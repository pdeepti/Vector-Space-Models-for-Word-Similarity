u.s. president bush renewed calls for turkey 's eu entry as he sought to boost ties with the country in ankara on the eve of a nato summit .
thousands of people protested on the sidelines . u.s. president george w. bush 's first-ever visit to turkey on saturday got off to a violent start . preceded by a series of protests and bomb blasts , including two last thursday that injured three people outside the ankara hotel where bush is expected to stay and killed another four on a bus in istanbul , the president 's arrival has put turkish security forces on high alert . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish police officers stand guard in front of a huge banner that reads " no to nato , go away bush " during a demonstration .
in a dramatic beefing up of security , f-16 warplanes patrolled the skies over istanbul on sunday while turkish commandos are monitoring the bosporus in rubber boats with mounted machine guns .
more than 23,000 turkish police will be on duty when the nato summit gets underway in istanbul on sunday . about 20,000 demonstrators , many members of leftist groups , gathered in a ankara square on sunday chanting anti-bush slogans and protesting american policies in the middle east . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters carry signs that say " criminals of occupation , torture and rape should be tried " against the nato summit and visit by bush in istanbul .
earlier on saturday , turkish police fired tear gas at hordes of stone-throwing leftist protestors , just hours before bush arrived in the country .
the fortress that ankara came to resemble over the weekend led a turkish commentator to write : " this visit is making our lives hell . " " barbaric act " the president 's visit also coincided with the hostage-taking of three turkish workers in iraq by militants loyal to abu musab al-zarqawi , a jordanian-born terrorist believed to have links to al qaeda . the militants have threatened to behead them within 72 hours unless turkish companies stop working with u.s. forces in iraq . the al-jazeera arabic television channel showed pictures of the three men crouching in front of masked gunmen and holding up their passports .
the same group beheaded a south korean hostage earlier this week and an american man last month . on saturday bush refused to answer reporters ' questions about the kidnappings , but white house spokesman sean mccormack said , " we 're in close contact with the turkish government on the issue .
it is an awful reminder of the barbaric nature of these terrorists , but their acts will not shake the will of free people everywhere . " " a model for the middle east " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. president george w. bush , right , and turkish president ahmet necdet sezer review the military honor guard in ankara .
meeting with turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan on sunday , bush vowed to fight hard for turkey to become a member of the european union , a line he stressed even during a eu-u.s. summit in ireland on saturday morning . " i will remind people of this good country that i believe ought to be given a date by the eu for your eventual acceptance into the eu , " bush said . the president also praised turkey for reconciling democracy with its muslim tradition and said it could set an example for the middle east . " i appreciate so very much the example your country has set on how to be a muslim country and at the same time a country which embraces democracy and rule of law and freedom , " he said . bush , who is on a europe trip to mobilize support for his mission in iraq , is hoping that his talks with turkish leaders will improve america 's ties with the only muslim nation in the western alliance . bush 's relations with turkey were strained in the run-up to the iraq war when turkey 's parliament rejected a u.s. request to let american troops use turkish bases to invade iraq from the south . nato to train iraqi military on monday , bush will fly to istanbul to attend a summit of the 26-nation nato alliance .
on saturday , nato nations cautiously agreed to respond to iraqi prime minister iyad allawi 's request to train iraqi security forces . the agreement is expected to be finalized at the nato summit that ends tuesday , a day before the transfer of political power in iraq . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de summit backs nato help to train iraqi military the u.s.-eu summit in ireland saturday put behind major transatlantic differences as it endorsed nato help in training iraqi security forces and pledged to support the economic and political reconstruction of iraq .

the romanian government has passed a law banning foreign adoptions of its orphans after pressure from the eu to curb abuses of the system by child traffickers .
dw-world readers are outraged . no , i do not support romania 's ban on foreign adoptions .
my son is from romania so i have come to love the country and its people .
and i would support all reasonable efforts to improve the system .
however , i can not support new legislation that will hurt the children of romania .
anyone who believes that children are better off in an institution or foster care than being in a home with a forever family is an idiot .
and the fact that one woman can blackmail a country into passing this type of legislation is incredible .
i not only cry for the children in romania but i am so afraid for the children in other countries who will be trying to join the eu - sandy axley no , i do not support this ban .
of course emma nicholson is delighted - the media " bought " her lies as she told of adoptive parents using their adopted children as organ donors , that we are sexually trafficking our children , and that we buy them off the internet for $ 50,000 .
sadly no one has published the truth - that a few impoverished adults sell their kidneys for money , that sexual trafficking of children does exist but is not done by adoptive parents , and that yes , adoption agencies do have websites on their agencies but you can not " buy " a child on the internet - you must go through social worker interviews , immigration approval , submission of your tax records and proof of employment , and in the united states - fingerprint checks by the fbi and state and local police .
this woman will have to answer to god for the damage she has done to the voiceless children of romania - linda robak the law in its present form creates discrimination against romanians living abroad , and hence is un-constitutional .
there is a double standard which the law promotes -lrb- art.39 -rrb- , giving rights to romanian citizens living in romania to adopt through an internal adoption process , but prohibiting romanians that live abroad to adopt .
we have written a letter to the romanian president ion iliescu not to sign such a law - florin rapan , president of alliance of romanian canadians , canada i absolutely do not agree with this ban .
as an adoptive mother of a romanian child with extreme delays in all areas because of her time spent in institutions , i have seen first hand what a difference a loving , permanent family can make in the lives of such children .
romania needs to stop the corruption but not legitimate adoptions .
my heart weeps for those children who sit and wait with their hopes of ever overcoming post-institutional problems tragically diminishing with each passing day - j .
cooper my wife and i have been trying to adopt two children from bucharest for nearly four years , and we had submitted all our paperwork before the moratorium began .
when we were finally assigned our two children at the beginning of 2003 , we eagerly prepared ourselves and the children by traveling to bucharest four times within a year to get to know them and be a part of their early lives .
unfortunately , the moratorium continued with few exceptions , and we were not able to adopt these children despite our best efforts .
now , it seems nearly all hope is lost .
we 're well aware of the plight of so many of these children , having become well-informed on the situation of the abandoned children of romania .
in their zeal for romania to join the european union , officials in romania and the eu have sacrificed the best interests of these poor children .
politics and misinformation have won over the weak and helpless .
a prime source of falsehoods and slander comes straight from the baroness nicholson , who has repeatedly described us hopeful adoptive parents as less than human and unfit for even domestic adoptions in our own countries ; and this in spite of the rigorous backgrounds checks and counseling we must undergo before we can even be considered eligible and able for adoption .
this ban on international adoptions is a sin and a travesty of human rights .

playing defensively for most of the match , the czech republic surgically used their chances to beat denmark 3-0 on sunday .
the czechs will face greece in the semi-final . giant striker jan koller headed the czechs in front in the 49th minute before liverpool marksman milan baros scored twice in two minutes to kill off the 1992 champions and ensure karel bruckner 's men maintained their 100 percent record in the competition . baros ' double - a clever chip and an unstoppable rising left-footed drive - took his goal tally to five in four matches , making him the tournament 's highest goalscorer . the czech republic , beaten finalists in 1996 when they lost to germany at wembley stadium in england , will play greece in the semi-finals here at the same stadium on thursday . the czechs were the first to threaten , pavel nedved 's whipped 20-yard free-kick wide on the left wing gathered safely by danish goalkeeper thomas sorensen .
koller , at 2.02 metres -lrb- 6ft 7ins -rrb- the tallest player at euro 2004 , headed karel poborsky 's right-wing cross over the bar and tomas galasek 's low drive sailed wide as the czechs maintained their early momentum before denmark mustered their first attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the luck of the vikings was n't enough .

poulsen headed wide as the danes slowly wrestled control of the match before thomas gravesen , pulling the strings for the scandinavians in central midfield , fired a drive into the stands from the edge of the box . former manchester united winger karel poborsky came the closest to breaking the deadlock a minute before half-time , the czech midfielder 's right-wing cross bouncing off the top of the crossbar .
the match sprang to life four minutes after the break when the czechs took the lead . nedved won a corner which poborsky drove into the penalty box and koller stole a yard on his marker to plant a firm header past a helpless sorensen .
the czechs tightened their grip in the 63rd minute when they increased their advantage with a swift counter-attack . poborsky 's clever ball found baros who outpaced danish captain rene henriksen before lifting the ball over the advancing sorensen .

the romanian government has passed a law banning foreign adoptions of its orphans after pressure from the eu to curb abuses of the system by child traffickers .
dw-world readers are outraged . no , i do not support romania 's ban on foreign adoptions .
my son is from romania so i have come to love the country and its people .
and i would support all reasonable efforts to improve the system .
however , i can not support new legislation that will hurt the children of romania .
anyone who believes that children are better off in an institution or foster care than being in a home with a forever family is an idiot .
and the fact that one woman can blackmail a country into passing this type of legislation is incredible .
i not only cry for the children in romania but i am so afraid for the children in other countries who will be trying to join the eu - sandy axley no , i do not support this ban .
of course emma nicholson is delighted - the media " bought " her lies as she told of adoptive parents using their adopted children as organ donors , that we are sexually trafficking our children , and that we buy them off the internet for $ 50,000 .
sadly no one has published the truth - that a few impoverished adults sell their kidneys for money , that sexual trafficking of children does exist but is not done by adoptive parents , and that yes , adoption agencies do have websites on their agencies but you can not " buy " a child on the internet - you must go through social worker interviews , immigration approval , submission of your tax records and proof of employment , and in the united states - fingerprint checks by the fbi and state and local police .
this woman will have to answer to god for the damage she has done to the voiceless children of romania - linda robak the law in its present form creates discrimination against romanians living abroad , and hence is un-constitutional .
there is a double standard which the law promotes -lrb- art.39 -rrb- , giving rights to romanian citizens living in romania to adopt through an internal adoption process , but prohibiting romanians that live abroad to adopt .
we have written a letter to the romanian president ion iliescu not to sign such a law - florin rapan , president of alliance of romanian canadians , canada i absolutely do not agree with this ban .
as an adoptive mother of a romanian child with extreme delays in all areas because of her time spent in institutions , i have seen first hand what a difference a loving , permanent family can make in the lives of such children .
romania needs to stop the corruption but not legitimate adoptions .
my heart weeps for those children who sit and wait with their hopes of ever overcoming post-institutional problems tragically diminishing with each passing day - j .
cooper my wife and i have been trying to adopt two children from bucharest for nearly four years , and we had submitted all our paperwork before the moratorium began .
when we were finally assigned our two children at the beginning of 2003 , we eagerly prepared ourselves and the children by traveling to bucharest four times within a year to get to know them and be a part of their early lives .
unfortunately , the moratorium continued with few exceptions , and we were not able to adopt these children despite our best efforts .
now , it seems nearly all hope is lost .
we 're well aware of the plight of so many of these children , having become well-informed on the situation of the abandoned children of romania .
in their zeal for romania to join the european union , officials in romania and the eu have sacrificed the best interests of these poor children .

a prime source of falsehoods and slander comes straight from the baroness nicholson , who has repeatedly described us hopeful adoptive parents as less than human and unfit for even domestic adoptions in our own countries ; and this in spite of the rigorous backgrounds checks and counseling we must undergo before we can even be considered eligible and able for adoption .
this ban on international adoptions is a sin and a travesty of human rights .

u.s. president bush renewed calls for turkey 's eu entry as he sought to boost ties with the country in ankara on the eve of a nato summit .
thousands of people protested on the sidelines . u.s. president george w. bush 's first-ever visit to turkey on saturday got off to a violent start . preceded by a series of protests and bomb blasts , including two last thursday that injured three people outside the ankara hotel where bush is expected to stay and killed another four on a bus in istanbul , the president 's arrival has put turkish security forces on high alert . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish police officers stand guard in front of a huge banner that reads " no to nato , go away bush " during a demonstration .
in a dramatic beefing up of security , f-16 warplanes patrolled the skies over istanbul on sunday while turkish commandos are monitoring the bosporus in rubber boats with mounted machine guns .
more than 23,000 turkish police will be on duty when the nato summit gets underway in istanbul on sunday . about 20,000 demonstrators , many members of leftist groups , gathered in a ankara square on sunday chanting anti-bush slogans and protesting american policies in the middle east . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters carry signs that say " criminals of occupation , torture and rape should be tried " against the nato summit and visit by bush in istanbul .
earlier on saturday , turkish police fired tear gas at hordes of stone-throwing leftist protestors , just hours before bush arrived in the country .
the fortress that ankara came to resemble over the weekend led a turkish commentator to write : " this visit is making our lives hell . " " barbaric act " the president 's visit also coincided with the hostage-taking of three turkish workers in iraq by militants loyal to abu musab al-zarqawi , a jordanian-born terrorist believed to have links to al qaeda . the militants have threatened to behead them within 72 hours unless turkish companies stop working with u.s. forces in iraq . the al-jazeera arabic television channel showed pictures of the three men crouching in front of masked gunmen and holding up their passports .
the same group beheaded a south korean hostage earlier this week and an american man last month . on saturday bush refused to answer reporters ' questions about the kidnappings , but white house spokesman sean mccormack said , " we 're in close contact with the turkish government on the issue .
it is an awful reminder of the barbaric nature of these terrorists , but their acts will not shake the will of free people everywhere . " " a model for the middle east " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. president george w. bush , right , and turkish president ahmet necdet sezer review the military honor guard in ankara .
meeting with turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan on sunday , bush vowed to fight hard for turkey to become a member of the european union , a line he stressed even during a eu-u.s. summit in ireland on saturday morning . " i will remind people of this good country that i believe ought to be given a date by the eu for your eventual acceptance into the eu , " bush said . the president also praised turkey for reconciling democracy with its muslim tradition and said it could set an example for the middle east . " i appreciate so very much the example your country has set on how to be a muslim country and at the same time a country which embraces democracy and rule of law and freedom , " he said . bush , who is on a europe trip to mobilize support for his mission in iraq , is hoping that his talks with turkish leaders will improve america 's ties with the only muslim nation in the western alliance . bush 's relations with turkey were strained in the run-up to the iraq war when turkey 's parliament rejected a u.s. request to let american troops use turkish bases to invade iraq from the south . nato to train iraqi military on monday , bush will fly to istanbul to attend a summit of the 26-nation nato alliance .
on saturday , nato nations cautiously agreed to respond to iraqi prime minister iyad allawi 's request to train iraqi security forces . the agreement is expected to be finalized at the nato summit that ends tuesday , a day before the transfer of political power in iraq . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de summit backs nato help to train iraqi military the u.s.-eu summit in ireland saturday put behind major transatlantic differences as it endorsed nato help in training iraqi security forces and pledged to support the economic and political reconstruction of iraq .

u.s. president bush renewed calls for turkey 's eu entry as he sought to boost ties with the country in ankara on the eve of a nato summit .
thousands of people protested on the sidelines . u.s. president george w. bush 's first-ever visit to turkey on saturday got off to a violent start . preceded by a series of protests and bomb blasts , including two last thursday that injured three people outside the ankara hotel where bush is expected to stay and killed another four on a bus in istanbul , the president 's arrival has put turkish security forces on high alert . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish police officers stand guard in front of a huge banner that reads " no to nato , go away bush " during a demonstration .
in a dramatic beefing up of security , f-16 warplanes patrolled the skies over istanbul on sunday while turkish commandos are monitoring the bosporus in rubber boats with mounted machine guns .
more than 23,000 turkish police will be on duty when the nato summit gets underway in istanbul on sunday . about 20,000 demonstrators , many members of leftist groups , gathered in a ankara square on sunday chanting anti-bush slogans and protesting american policies in the middle east . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters carry signs that say " criminals of occupation , torture and rape should be tried " against the nato summit and visit by bush in istanbul .
earlier on saturday , turkish police fired tear gas at hordes of stone-throwing leftist protestors , just hours before bush arrived in the country .
the fortress that ankara came to resemble over the weekend led a turkish commentator to write : " this visit is making our lives hell . " " barbaric act " the president 's visit also coincided with the hostage-taking of three turkish workers in iraq by militants loyal to abu musab al-zarqawi , a jordanian-born terrorist believed to have links to al qaeda . the militants have threatened to behead them within 72 hours unless turkish companies stop working with u.s. forces in iraq . the al-jazeera arabic television channel showed pictures of the three men crouching in front of masked gunmen and holding up their passports .
the same group beheaded a south korean hostage earlier this week and an american man last month . on saturday bush refused to answer reporters ' questions about the kidnappings , but white house spokesman sean mccormack said , " we 're in close contact with the turkish government on the issue .
it is an awful reminder of the barbaric nature of these terrorists , but their acts will not shake the will of free people everywhere . " " a model for the middle east " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. president george w. bush , right , and turkish president ahmet necdet sezer review the military honor guard in ankara .
meeting with turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan on sunday , bush vowed to fight hard for turkey to become a member of the european union , a line he stressed even during a eu-u.s. summit in ireland on saturday morning . " i will remind people of this good country that i believe ought to be given a date by the eu for your eventual acceptance into the eu , " bush said . the president also praised turkey for reconciling democracy with its muslim tradition and said it could set an example for the middle east . " i appreciate so very much the example your country has set on how to be a muslim country and at the same time a country which embraces democracy and rule of law and freedom , " he said . bush , who is on a europe trip to mobilize support for his mission in iraq , is hoping that his talks with turkish leaders will improve america 's ties with the only muslim nation in the western alliance . bush 's relations with turkey were strained in the run-up to the iraq war when turkey 's parliament rejected a u.s. request to let american troops use turkish bases to invade iraq from the south . nato to train iraqi military on monday , bush will fly to istanbul to attend a summit of the 26-nation nato alliance .
on saturday , nato nations cautiously agreed to respond to iraqi prime minister iyad allawi 's request to train iraqi security forces . the agreement is expected to be finalized at the nato summit that ends tuesday , a day before the transfer of political power in iraq . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de summit backs nato help to train iraqi military the u.s.-eu summit in ireland saturday put behind major transatlantic differences as it endorsed nato help in training iraqi security forces and pledged to support the economic and political reconstruction of iraq .

the romanian government has passed a law banning foreign adoptions of its orphans after pressure from the eu to curb abuses of the system by child traffickers .
dw-world readers are outraged . no , i do not support romania 's ban on foreign adoptions .
my son is from romania so i have come to love the country and its people .
and i would support all reasonable efforts to improve the system .
however , i can not support new legislation that will hurt the children of romania .
anyone who believes that children are better off in an institution or foster care than being in a home with a forever family is an idiot .
and the fact that one woman can blackmail a country into passing this type of legislation is incredible .
i not only cry for the children in romania but i am so afraid for the children in other countries who will be trying to join the eu - sandy axley no , i do not support this ban .
of course emma nicholson is delighted - the media " bought " her lies as she told of adoptive parents using their adopted children as organ donors , that we are sexually trafficking our children , and that we buy them off the internet for $ 50,000 .
sadly no one has published the truth - that a few impoverished adults sell their kidneys for money , that sexual trafficking of children does exist but is not done by adoptive parents , and that yes , adoption agencies do have websites on their agencies but you can not " buy " a child on the internet - you must go through social worker interviews , immigration approval , submission of your tax records and proof of employment , and in the united states - fingerprint checks by the fbi and state and local police .
this woman will have to answer to god for the damage she has done to the voiceless children of romania - linda robak the law in its present form creates discrimination against romanians living abroad , and hence is un-constitutional .
there is a double standard which the law promotes -lrb- art.39 -rrb- , giving rights to romanian citizens living in romania to adopt through an internal adoption process , but prohibiting romanians that live abroad to adopt .
we have written a letter to the romanian president ion iliescu not to sign such a law - florin rapan , president of alliance of romanian canadians , canada i absolutely do not agree with this ban .
as an adoptive mother of a romanian child with extreme delays in all areas because of her time spent in institutions , i have seen first hand what a difference a loving , permanent family can make in the lives of such children .
romania needs to stop the corruption but not legitimate adoptions .
my heart weeps for those children who sit and wait with their hopes of ever overcoming post-institutional problems tragically diminishing with each passing day - j .
cooper my wife and i have been trying to adopt two children from bucharest for nearly four years , and we had submitted all our paperwork before the moratorium began .
when we were finally assigned our two children at the beginning of 2003 , we eagerly prepared ourselves and the children by traveling to bucharest four times within a year to get to know them and be a part of their early lives .
unfortunately , the moratorium continued with few exceptions , and we were not able to adopt these children despite our best efforts .
now , it seems nearly all hope is lost .
we 're well aware of the plight of so many of these children , having become well-informed on the situation of the abandoned children of romania .
in their zeal for romania to join the european union , officials in romania and the eu have sacrificed the best interests of these poor children .
politics and misinformation have won over the weak and helpless .
a prime source of falsehoods and slander comes straight from the baroness nicholson , who has repeatedly described us hopeful adoptive parents as less than human and unfit for even domestic adoptions in our own countries ; and this in spite of the rigorous backgrounds checks and counseling we must undergo before we can even be considered eligible and able for adoption .
this ban on international adoptions is a sin and a travesty of human rights .
romania is in for a rude awakening in the coming years as the number of abandoned children mushrooms , and society crumbles as a result of another lost generation - thomas h. haar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de romania bans foreign adoptions the romanian government has passed a law banning foreign adoptions of its orphans after pressure from the eu to curb abuses of the system by child traffickers .

the romanian government has passed a law banning foreign adoptions of its orphans after pressure from the eu to curb abuses of the system by child traffickers .
dw-world readers are outraged . no , i do not support romania 's ban on foreign adoptions .
my son is from romania so i have come to love the country and its people .
and i would support all reasonable efforts to improve the system .
however , i can not support new legislation that will hurt the children of romania .
anyone who believes that children are better off in an institution or foster care than being in a home with a forever family is an idiot .
and the fact that one woman can blackmail a country into passing this type of legislation is incredible .
i not only cry for the children in romania but i am so afraid for the children in other countries who will be trying to join the eu - sandy axley no , i do not support this ban .
of course emma nicholson is delighted - the media " bought " her lies as she told of adoptive parents using their adopted children as organ donors , that we are sexually trafficking our children , and that we buy them off the internet for $ 50,000 .
sadly no one has published the truth - that a few impoverished adults sell their kidneys for money , that sexual trafficking of children does exist but is not done by adoptive parents , and that yes , adoption agencies do have websites on their agencies but you can not " buy " a child on the internet - you must go through social worker interviews , immigration approval , submission of your tax records and proof of employment , and in the united states - fingerprint checks by the fbi and state and local police .
this woman will have to answer to god for the damage she has done to the voiceless children of romania - linda robak the law in its present form creates discrimination against romanians living abroad , and hence is un-constitutional .
there is a double standard which the law promotes -lrb- art.39 -rrb- , giving rights to romanian citizens living in romania to adopt through an internal adoption process , but prohibiting romanians that live abroad to adopt .
we have written a letter to the romanian president ion iliescu not to sign such a law - florin rapan , president of alliance of romanian canadians , canada i absolutely do not agree with this ban .
as an adoptive mother of a romanian child with extreme delays in all areas because of her time spent in institutions , i have seen first hand what a difference a loving , permanent family can make in the lives of such children .
romania needs to stop the corruption but not legitimate adoptions .
my heart weeps for those children who sit and wait with their hopes of ever overcoming post-institutional problems tragically diminishing with each passing day - j .

when we were finally assigned our two children at the beginning of 2003 , we eagerly prepared ourselves and the children by traveling to bucharest four times within a year to get to know them and be a part of their early lives .
unfortunately , the moratorium continued with few exceptions , and we were not able to adopt these children despite our best efforts .
now , it seems nearly all hope is lost .

dutch advance after topping swedes in penalties greek davids ' slay the french goliaths portugal beats holland to book ticket to finals world cup 2006 -pipe- 27.06.2004 czechs crush danes to make semis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech forward pavel nedved put in the work for the win .
playing defensively for most of the match , the czech republic surgically used their chances to beat denmark 3-0 on sunday .
the czechs will face greece in the semi-final . giant striker jan koller headed the czechs in front in the 49th minute before liverpool marksman milan baros scored twice in two minutes to kill off the 1992 champions and ensure karel bruckner 's men maintained their 100 percent record in the competition . baros ' double - a clever chip and an unstoppable rising left-footed drive - took his goal tally to five in four matches , making him the tournament 's highest goalscorer . the czech republic , beaten finalists in 1996 when they lost to germany at wembley stadium in england , will play greece in the semi-finals here at the same stadium on thursday . the czechs were the first to threaten , pavel nedved 's whipped 20-yard free-kick wide on the left wing gathered safely by danish goalkeeper thomas sorensen .
koller , at 2.02 metres -lrb- 6ft 7ins -rrb- the tallest player at euro 2004 , headed karel poborsky 's right-wing cross over the bar and tomas galasek 's low drive sailed wide as the czechs maintained their early momentum before denmark mustered their first attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the luck of the vikings was n't enough .
claus jensen found space on the left after a weak defensive clearance and the livewire charlton midfielder fed christian poulsen whose goalbound drive was blocked by a forest of czech legs .
poulsen headed wide as the danes slowly wrestled control of the match before thomas gravesen , pulling the strings for the scandinavians in central midfield , fired a drive into the stands from the edge of the box . former manchester united winger karel poborsky came the closest to breaking the deadlock a minute before half-time , the czech midfielder 's right-wing cross bouncing off the top of the crossbar .
the match sprang to life four minutes after the break when the czechs took the lead . nedved won a corner which poborsky drove into the penalty box and koller stole a yard on his marker to plant a firm header past a helpless sorensen .
the czechs tightened their grip in the 63rd minute when they increased their advantage with a swift counter-attack . poborsky 's clever ball found baros who outpaced danish captain rene henriksen before lifting the ball over the advancing sorensen .
baros put the result beyond doubt two minutes later , collecting nedved 's clever diagonal pass before lashing the ball into the roof of the net .

playing defensively for most of the match , the czech republic surgically used their chances to beat denmark 3-0 on sunday .
the czechs will face greece in the semi-final . giant striker jan koller headed the czechs in front in the 49th minute before liverpool marksman milan baros scored twice in two minutes to kill off the 1992 champions and ensure karel bruckner 's men maintained their 100 percent record in the competition . baros ' double - a clever chip and an unstoppable rising left-footed drive - took his goal tally to five in four matches , making him the tournament 's highest goalscorer . the czech republic , beaten finalists in 1996 when they lost to germany at wembley stadium in england , will play greece in the semi-finals here at the same stadium on thursday . the czechs were the first to threaten , pavel nedved 's whipped 20-yard free-kick wide on the left wing gathered safely by danish goalkeeper thomas sorensen .
koller , at 2.02 metres -lrb- 6ft 7ins -rrb- the tallest player at euro 2004 , headed karel poborsky 's right-wing cross over the bar and tomas galasek 's low drive sailed wide as the czechs maintained their early momentum before denmark mustered their first attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the luck of the vikings was n't enough .
claus jensen found space on the left after a weak defensive clearance and the livewire charlton midfielder fed christian poulsen whose goalbound drive was blocked by a forest of czech legs .
poulsen headed wide as the danes slowly wrestled control of the match before thomas gravesen , pulling the strings for the scandinavians in central midfield , fired a drive into the stands from the edge of the box . former manchester united winger karel poborsky came the closest to breaking the deadlock a minute before half-time , the czech midfielder 's right-wing cross bouncing off the top of the crossbar .
the match sprang to life four minutes after the break when the czechs took the lead . nedved won a corner which poborsky drove into the penalty box and koller stole a yard on his marker to plant a firm header past a helpless sorensen .
the czechs tightened their grip in the 63rd minute when they increased their advantage with a swift counter-attack . poborsky 's clever ball found baros who outpaced danish captain rene henriksen before lifting the ball over the advancing sorensen .
baros put the result beyond doubt two minutes later , collecting nedved 's clever diagonal pass before lashing the ball into the roof of the net .

the romanian government has passed a law banning foreign adoptions of its orphans after pressure from the eu to curb abuses of the system by child traffickers .
dw-world readers are outraged . no , i do not support romania 's ban on foreign adoptions .
my son is from romania so i have come to love the country and its people .
and i would support all reasonable efforts to improve the system .
however , i can not support new legislation that will hurt the children of romania .
anyone who believes that children are better off in an institution or foster care than being in a home with a forever family is an idiot .
and the fact that one woman can blackmail a country into passing this type of legislation is incredible .
i not only cry for the children in romania but i am so afraid for the children in other countries who will be trying to join the eu - sandy axley no , i do not support this ban .
of course emma nicholson is delighted - the media " bought " her lies as she told of adoptive parents using their adopted children as organ donors , that we are sexually trafficking our children , and that we buy them off the internet for $ 50,000 .
sadly no one has published the truth - that a few impoverished adults sell their kidneys for money , that sexual trafficking of children does exist but is not done by adoptive parents , and that yes , adoption agencies do have websites on their agencies but you can not " buy " a child on the internet - you must go through social worker interviews , immigration approval , submission of your tax records and proof of employment , and in the united states - fingerprint checks by the fbi and state and local police .
this woman will have to answer to god for the damage she has done to the voiceless children of romania - linda robak the law in its present form creates discrimination against romanians living abroad , and hence is un-constitutional .
there is a double standard which the law promotes -lrb- art.39 -rrb- , giving rights to romanian citizens living in romania to adopt through an internal adoption process , but prohibiting romanians that live abroad to adopt .
we have written a letter to the romanian president ion iliescu not to sign such a law - florin rapan , president of alliance of romanian canadians , canada i absolutely do not agree with this ban .
as an adoptive mother of a romanian child with extreme delays in all areas because of her time spent in institutions , i have seen first hand what a difference a loving , permanent family can make in the lives of such children .
romania needs to stop the corruption but not legitimate adoptions .
my heart weeps for those children who sit and wait with their hopes of ever overcoming post-institutional problems tragically diminishing with each passing day - j .
cooper my wife and i have been trying to adopt two children from bucharest for nearly four years , and we had submitted all our paperwork before the moratorium began .
when we were finally assigned our two children at the beginning of 2003 , we eagerly prepared ourselves and the children by traveling to bucharest four times within a year to get to know them and be a part of their early lives .
unfortunately , the moratorium continued with few exceptions , and we were not able to adopt these children despite our best efforts .
now , it seems nearly all hope is lost .
we 're well aware of the plight of so many of these children , having become well-informed on the situation of the abandoned children of romania .
in their zeal for romania to join the european union , officials in romania and the eu have sacrificed the best interests of these poor children .

u.s. president bush renewed calls for turkey 's eu entry as he sought to boost ties with the country in ankara on the eve of a nato summit .
thousands of people protested on the sidelines . u.s. president george w. bush 's first-ever visit to turkey on saturday got off to a violent start . preceded by a series of protests and bomb blasts , including two last thursday that injured three people outside the ankara hotel where bush is expected to stay and killed another four on a bus in istanbul , the president 's arrival has put turkish security forces on high alert . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish police officers stand guard in front of a huge banner that reads " no to nato , go away bush " during a demonstration .
in a dramatic beefing up of security , f-16 warplanes patrolled the skies over istanbul on sunday while turkish commandos are monitoring the bosporus in rubber boats with mounted machine guns .
more than 23,000 turkish police will be on duty when the nato summit gets underway in istanbul on sunday . about 20,000 demonstrators , many members of leftist groups , gathered in a ankara square on sunday chanting anti-bush slogans and protesting american policies in the middle east . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters carry signs that say " criminals of occupation , torture and rape should be tried " against the nato summit and visit by bush in istanbul .

the fortress that ankara came to resemble over the weekend led a turkish commentator to write : " this visit is making our lives hell . " " barbaric act " the president 's visit also coincided with the hostage-taking of three turkish workers in iraq by militants loyal to abu musab al-zarqawi , a jordanian-born terrorist believed to have links to al qaeda . the militants have threatened to behead them within 72 hours unless turkish companies stop working with u.s. forces in iraq . the al-jazeera arabic television channel showed pictures of the three men crouching in front of masked gunmen and holding up their passports .

" i will remind people of this good country that i believe ought to be given a date by the eu for your eventual acceptance into the eu , " bush said . the president also praised turkey for reconciling democracy with its muslim tradition and said it could set an example for the middle east .

playing defensively for most of the match , the czech republic surgically used their chances to beat denmark 3-0 on sunday .
the czechs will face greece in the semi-final . giant striker jan koller headed the czechs in front in the 49th minute before liverpool marksman milan baros scored twice in two minutes to kill off the 1992 champions and ensure karel bruckner 's men maintained their 100 percent record in the competition . baros ' double - a clever chip and an unstoppable rising left-footed drive - took his goal tally to five in four matches , making him the tournament 's highest goalscorer . the czech republic , beaten finalists in 1996 when they lost to germany at wembley stadium in england , will play greece in the semi-finals here at the same stadium on thursday . the czechs were the first to threaten , pavel nedved 's whipped 20-yard free-kick wide on the left wing gathered safely by danish goalkeeper thomas sorensen .
koller , at 2.02 metres -lrb- 6ft 7ins -rrb- the tallest player at euro 2004 , headed karel poborsky 's right-wing cross over the bar and tomas galasek 's low drive sailed wide as the czechs maintained their early momentum before denmark mustered their first attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the luck of the vikings was n't enough .
claus jensen found space on the left after a weak defensive clearance and the livewire charlton midfielder fed christian poulsen whose goalbound drive was blocked by a forest of czech legs .
poulsen headed wide as the danes slowly wrestled control of the match before thomas gravesen , pulling the strings for the scandinavians in central midfield , fired a drive into the stands from the edge of the box . former manchester united winger karel poborsky came the closest to breaking the deadlock a minute before half-time , the czech midfielder 's right-wing cross bouncing off the top of the crossbar .
the match sprang to life four minutes after the break when the czechs took the lead . nedved won a corner which poborsky drove into the penalty box and koller stole a yard on his marker to plant a firm header past a helpless sorensen .
the czechs tightened their grip in the 63rd minute when they increased their advantage with a swift counter-attack . poborsky 's clever ball found baros who outpaced danish captain rene henriksen before lifting the ball over the advancing sorensen .
baros put the result beyond doubt two minutes later , collecting nedved 's clever diagonal pass before lashing the ball into the roof of the net .

the czechs will face greece in the semi-final . giant striker jan koller headed the czechs in front in the 49th minute before liverpool marksman milan baros scored twice in two minutes to kill off the 1992 champions and ensure karel bruckner 's men maintained their 100 percent record in the competition . baros ' double - a clever chip and an unstoppable rising left-footed drive - took his goal tally to five in four matches , making him the tournament 's highest goalscorer . the czech republic , beaten finalists in 1996 when they lost to germany at wembley stadium in england , will play greece in the semi-finals here at the same stadium on thursday . the czechs were the first to threaten , pavel nedved 's whipped 20-yard free-kick wide on the left wing gathered safely by danish goalkeeper thomas sorensen .
koller , at 2.02 metres -lrb- 6ft 7ins -rrb- the tallest player at euro 2004 , headed karel poborsky 's right-wing cross over the bar and tomas galasek 's low drive sailed wide as the czechs maintained their early momentum before denmark mustered their first attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the luck of the vikings was n't enough .
claus jensen found space on the left after a weak defensive clearance and the livewire charlton midfielder fed christian poulsen whose goalbound drive was blocked by a forest of czech legs .
poulsen headed wide as the danes slowly wrestled control of the match before thomas gravesen , pulling the strings for the scandinavians in central midfield , fired a drive into the stands from the edge of the box . former manchester united winger karel poborsky came the closest to breaking the deadlock a minute before half-time , the czech midfielder 's right-wing cross bouncing off the top of the crossbar .
the match sprang to life four minutes after the break when the czechs took the lead . nedved won a corner which poborsky drove into the penalty box and koller stole a yard on his marker to plant a firm header past a helpless sorensen .
the czechs tightened their grip in the 63rd minute when they increased their advantage with a swift counter-attack . poborsky 's clever ball found baros who outpaced danish captain rene henriksen before lifting the ball over the advancing sorensen .
baros put the result beyond doubt two minutes later , collecting nedved 's clever diagonal pass before lashing the ball into the roof of the net .

my son is from romania so i have come to love the country and its people .

sadly no one has published the truth - that a few impoverished adults sell their kidneys for money , that sexual trafficking of children does exist but is not done by adoptive parents , and that yes , adoption agencies do have websites on their agencies but you can not " buy " a child on the internet - you must go through social worker interviews , immigration approval , submission of your tax records and proof of employment , and in the united states - fingerprint checks by the fbi and state and local police .

there is a double standard which the law promotes -lrb- art.39 -rrb- , giving rights to romanian citizens living in romania to adopt through an internal adoption process , but prohibiting romanians that live abroad to adopt .
we have written a letter to the romanian president ion iliescu not to sign such a law - florin rapan , president of alliance of romanian canadians , canada i absolutely do not agree with this ban .

the romanian government has passed a law banning foreign adoptions of its orphans after pressure from the eu to curb abuses of the system by child traffickers .
dw-world readers are outraged . no , i do not support romania 's ban on foreign adoptions .
my son is from romania so i have come to love the country and its people .
and i would support all reasonable efforts to improve the system .
however , i can not support new legislation that will hurt the children of romania .
anyone who believes that children are better off in an institution or foster care than being in a home with a forever family is an idiot .
and the fact that one woman can blackmail a country into passing this type of legislation is incredible .
i not only cry for the children in romania but i am so afraid for the children in other countries who will be trying to join the eu - sandy axley no , i do not support this ban .
of course emma nicholson is delighted - the media " bought " her lies as she told of adoptive parents using their adopted children as organ donors , that we are sexually trafficking our children , and that we buy them off the internet for $ 50,000 .
sadly no one has published the truth - that a few impoverished adults sell their kidneys for money , that sexual trafficking of children does exist but is not done by adoptive parents , and that yes , adoption agencies do have websites on their agencies but you can not " buy " a child on the internet - you must go through social worker interviews , immigration approval , submission of your tax records and proof of employment , and in the united states - fingerprint checks by the fbi and state and local police .
this woman will have to answer to god for the damage she has done to the voiceless children of romania - linda robak the law in its present form creates discrimination against romanians living abroad , and hence is un-constitutional .
there is a double standard which the law promotes -lrb- art.39 -rrb- , giving rights to romanian citizens living in romania to adopt through an internal adoption process , but prohibiting romanians that live abroad to adopt .

playing defensively for most of the match , the czech republic surgically used their chances to beat denmark 3-0 on sunday .
the czechs will face greece in the semi-final . giant striker jan koller headed the czechs in front in the 49th minute before liverpool marksman milan baros scored twice in two minutes to kill off the 1992 champions and ensure karel bruckner 's men maintained their 100 percent record in the competition . baros ' double - a clever chip and an unstoppable rising left-footed drive - took his goal tally to five in four matches , making him the tournament 's highest goalscorer . the czech republic , beaten finalists in 1996 when they lost to germany at wembley stadium in england , will play greece in the semi-finals here at the same stadium on thursday . the czechs were the first to threaten , pavel nedved 's whipped 20-yard free-kick wide on the left wing gathered safely by danish goalkeeper thomas sorensen .
koller , at 2.02 metres -lrb- 6ft 7ins -rrb- the tallest player at euro 2004 , headed karel poborsky 's right-wing cross over the bar and tomas galasek 's low drive sailed wide as the czechs maintained their early momentum before denmark mustered their first attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the luck of the vikings was n't enough .

poulsen headed wide as the danes slowly wrestled control of the match before thomas gravesen , pulling the strings for the scandinavians in central midfield , fired a drive into the stands from the edge of the box . former manchester united winger karel poborsky came the closest to breaking the deadlock a minute before half-time , the czech midfielder 's right-wing cross bouncing off the top of the crossbar .
the match sprang to life four minutes after the break when the czechs took the lead . nedved won a corner which poborsky drove into the penalty box and koller stole a yard on his marker to plant a firm header past a helpless sorensen .
the czechs tightened their grip in the 63rd minute when they increased their advantage with a swift counter-attack . poborsky 's clever ball found baros who outpaced danish captain rene henriksen before lifting the ball over the advancing sorensen .

u.s. president bush renewed calls for turkey 's eu entry as he sought to boost ties with the country in ankara on the eve of a nato summit .
thousands of people protested on the sidelines . u.s. president george w. bush 's first-ever visit to turkey on saturday got off to a violent start . preceded by a series of protests and bomb blasts , including two last thursday that injured three people outside the ankara hotel where bush is expected to stay and killed another four on a bus in istanbul , the president 's arrival has put turkish security forces on high alert . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish police officers stand guard in front of a huge banner that reads " no to nato , go away bush " during a demonstration .
in a dramatic beefing up of security , f-16 warplanes patrolled the skies over istanbul on sunday while turkish commandos are monitoring the bosporus in rubber boats with mounted machine guns .
more than 23,000 turkish police will be on duty when the nato summit gets underway in istanbul on sunday . about 20,000 demonstrators , many members of leftist groups , gathered in a ankara square on sunday chanting anti-bush slogans and protesting american policies in the middle east . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters carry signs that say " criminals of occupation , torture and rape should be tried " against the nato summit and visit by bush in istanbul .
earlier on saturday , turkish police fired tear gas at hordes of stone-throwing leftist protestors , just hours before bush arrived in the country .
the fortress that ankara came to resemble over the weekend led a turkish commentator to write : " this visit is making our lives hell . " " barbaric act " the president 's visit also coincided with the hostage-taking of three turkish workers in iraq by militants loyal to abu musab al-zarqawi , a jordanian-born terrorist believed to have links to al qaeda . the militants have threatened to behead them within 72 hours unless turkish companies stop working with u.s. forces in iraq . the al-jazeera arabic television channel showed pictures of the three men crouching in front of masked gunmen and holding up their passports .
the same group beheaded a south korean hostage earlier this week and an american man last month . on saturday bush refused to answer reporters ' questions about the kidnappings , but white house spokesman sean mccormack said , " we 're in close contact with the turkish government on the issue .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de reader response -pipe- 27.06.2004 romania 's new adoption laws großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can only be taken in by a romanian family .
the romanian government has passed a law banning foreign adoptions of its orphans after pressure from the eu to curb abuses of the system by child traffickers .
dw-world readers are outraged . no , i do not support romania 's ban on foreign adoptions .
my son is from romania so i have come to love the country and its people .
and i would support all reasonable efforts to improve the system .
however , i can not support new legislation that will hurt the children of romania .
anyone who believes that children are better off in an institution or foster care than being in a home with a forever family is an idiot .
and the fact that one woman can blackmail a country into passing this type of legislation is incredible .
i not only cry for the children in romania but i am so afraid for the children in other countries who will be trying to join the eu - sandy axley no , i do not support this ban .
of course emma nicholson is delighted - the media " bought " her lies as she told of adoptive parents using their adopted children as organ donors , that we are sexually trafficking our children , and that we buy them off the internet for $ 50,000 .
sadly no one has published the truth - that a few impoverished adults sell their kidneys for money , that sexual trafficking of children does exist but is not done by adoptive parents , and that yes , adoption agencies do have websites on their agencies but you can not " buy " a child on the internet - you must go through social worker interviews , immigration approval , submission of your tax records and proof of employment , and in the united states - fingerprint checks by the fbi and state and local police .
this woman will have to answer to god for the damage she has done to the voiceless children of romania - linda robak the law in its present form creates discrimination against romanians living abroad , and hence is un-constitutional .

the romanian government has passed a law banning foreign adoptions of its orphans after pressure from the eu to curb abuses of the system by child traffickers .
dw-world readers are outraged . no , i do not support romania 's ban on foreign adoptions .
my son is from romania so i have come to love the country and its people .
and i would support all reasonable efforts to improve the system .
however , i can not support new legislation that will hurt the children of romania .
anyone who believes that children are better off in an institution or foster care than being in a home with a forever family is an idiot .
and the fact that one woman can blackmail a country into passing this type of legislation is incredible .
i not only cry for the children in romania but i am so afraid for the children in other countries who will be trying to join the eu - sandy axley no , i do not support this ban .
of course emma nicholson is delighted - the media " bought " her lies as she told of adoptive parents using their adopted children as organ donors , that we are sexually trafficking our children , and that we buy them off the internet for $ 50,000 .
sadly no one has published the truth - that a few impoverished adults sell their kidneys for money , that sexual trafficking of children does exist but is not done by adoptive parents , and that yes , adoption agencies do have websites on their agencies but you can not " buy " a child on the internet - you must go through social worker interviews , immigration approval , submission of your tax records and proof of employment , and in the united states - fingerprint checks by the fbi and state and local police .
this woman will have to answer to god for the damage she has done to the voiceless children of romania - linda robak the law in its present form creates discrimination against romanians living abroad , and hence is un-constitutional .
there is a double standard which the law promotes -lrb- art.39 -rrb- , giving rights to romanian citizens living in romania to adopt through an internal adoption process , but prohibiting romanians that live abroad to adopt .
we have written a letter to the romanian president ion iliescu not to sign such a law - florin rapan , president of alliance of romanian canadians , canada i absolutely do not agree with this ban .
as an adoptive mother of a romanian child with extreme delays in all areas because of her time spent in institutions , i have seen first hand what a difference a loving , permanent family can make in the lives of such children .
romania needs to stop the corruption but not legitimate adoptions .
my heart weeps for those children who sit and wait with their hopes of ever overcoming post-institutional problems tragically diminishing with each passing day - j .

playing defensively for most of the match , the czech republic surgically used their chances to beat denmark 3-0 on sunday .
the czechs will face greece in the semi-final . giant striker jan koller headed the czechs in front in the 49th minute before liverpool marksman milan baros scored twice in two minutes to kill off the 1992 champions and ensure karel bruckner 's men maintained their 100 percent record in the competition . baros ' double - a clever chip and an unstoppable rising left-footed drive - took his goal tally to five in four matches , making him the tournament 's highest goalscorer . the czech republic , beaten finalists in 1996 when they lost to germany at wembley stadium in england , will play greece in the semi-finals here at the same stadium on thursday . the czechs were the first to threaten , pavel nedved 's whipped 20-yard free-kick wide on the left wing gathered safely by danish goalkeeper thomas sorensen .
koller , at 2.02 metres -lrb- 6ft 7ins -rrb- the tallest player at euro 2004 , headed karel poborsky 's right-wing cross over the bar and tomas galasek 's low drive sailed wide as the czechs maintained their early momentum before denmark mustered their first attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the luck of the vikings was n't enough .
claus jensen found space on the left after a weak defensive clearance and the livewire charlton midfielder fed christian poulsen whose goalbound drive was blocked by a forest of czech legs .
poulsen headed wide as the danes slowly wrestled control of the match before thomas gravesen , pulling the strings for the scandinavians in central midfield , fired a drive into the stands from the edge of the box . former manchester united winger karel poborsky came the closest to breaking the deadlock a minute before half-time , the czech midfielder 's right-wing cross bouncing off the top of the crossbar .
the match sprang to life four minutes after the break when the czechs took the lead . nedved won a corner which poborsky drove into the penalty box and koller stole a yard on his marker to plant a firm header past a helpless sorensen .
the czechs tightened their grip in the 63rd minute when they increased their advantage with a swift counter-attack . poborsky 's clever ball found baros who outpaced danish captain rene henriksen before lifting the ball over the advancing sorensen .
baros put the result beyond doubt two minutes later , collecting nedved 's clever diagonal pass before lashing the ball into the roof of the net .

u.s. president bush renewed calls for turkey 's eu entry as he sought to boost ties with the country in ankara on the eve of a nato summit .
thousands of people protested on the sidelines . u.s. president george w. bush 's first-ever visit to turkey on saturday got off to a violent start . preceded by a series of protests and bomb blasts , including two last thursday that injured three people outside the ankara hotel where bush is expected to stay and killed another four on a bus in istanbul , the president 's arrival has put turkish security forces on high alert . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish police officers stand guard in front of a huge banner that reads " no to nato , go away bush " during a demonstration .
in a dramatic beefing up of security , f-16 warplanes patrolled the skies over istanbul on sunday while turkish commandos are monitoring the bosporus in rubber boats with mounted machine guns .
more than 23,000 turkish police will be on duty when the nato summit gets underway in istanbul on sunday . about 20,000 demonstrators , many members of leftist groups , gathered in a ankara square on sunday chanting anti-bush slogans and protesting american policies in the middle east . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters carry signs that say " criminals of occupation , torture and rape should be tried " against the nato summit and visit by bush in istanbul .
earlier on saturday , turkish police fired tear gas at hordes of stone-throwing leftist protestors , just hours before bush arrived in the country .
the fortress that ankara came to resemble over the weekend led a turkish commentator to write : " this visit is making our lives hell . " " barbaric act " the president 's visit also coincided with the hostage-taking of three turkish workers in iraq by militants loyal to abu musab al-zarqawi , a jordanian-born terrorist believed to have links to al qaeda . the militants have threatened to behead them within 72 hours unless turkish companies stop working with u.s. forces in iraq . the al-jazeera arabic television channel showed pictures of the three men crouching in front of masked gunmen and holding up their passports .
the same group beheaded a south korean hostage earlier this week and an american man last month . on saturday bush refused to answer reporters ' questions about the kidnappings , but white house spokesman sean mccormack said , " we 're in close contact with the turkish government on the issue .
it is an awful reminder of the barbaric nature of these terrorists , but their acts will not shake the will of free people everywhere . " " a model for the middle east " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. president george w. bush , right , and turkish president ahmet necdet sezer review the military honor guard in ankara .
meeting with turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan on sunday , bush vowed to fight hard for turkey to become a member of the european union , a line he stressed even during a eu-u.s. summit in ireland on saturday morning . " i will remind people of this good country that i believe ought to be given a date by the eu for your eventual acceptance into the eu , " bush said . the president also praised turkey for reconciling democracy with its muslim tradition and said it could set an example for the middle east . " i appreciate so very much the example your country has set on how to be a muslim country and at the same time a country which embraces democracy and rule of law and freedom , " he said . bush , who is on a europe trip to mobilize support for his mission in iraq , is hoping that his talks with turkish leaders will improve america 's ties with the only muslim nation in the western alliance . bush 's relations with turkey were strained in the run-up to the iraq war when turkey 's parliament rejected a u.s. request to let american troops use turkish bases to invade iraq from the south . nato to train iraqi military on monday , bush will fly to istanbul to attend a summit of the 26-nation nato alliance .
on saturday , nato nations cautiously agreed to respond to iraqi prime minister iyad allawi 's request to train iraqi security forces . the agreement is expected to be finalized at the nato summit that ends tuesday , a day before the transfer of political power in iraq . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de summit backs nato help to train iraqi military the u.s.-eu summit in ireland saturday put behind major transatlantic differences as it endorsed nato help in training iraqi security forces and pledged to support the economic and political reconstruction of iraq .

u.s. president bush renewed calls for turkey 's eu entry as he sought to boost ties with the country in ankara on the eve of a nato summit .
thousands of people protested on the sidelines . u.s. president george w. bush 's first-ever visit to turkey on saturday got off to a violent start . preceded by a series of protests and bomb blasts , including two last thursday that injured three people outside the ankara hotel where bush is expected to stay and killed another four on a bus in istanbul , the president 's arrival has put turkish security forces on high alert . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish police officers stand guard in front of a huge banner that reads " no to nato , go away bush " during a demonstration .
in a dramatic beefing up of security , f-16 warplanes patrolled the skies over istanbul on sunday while turkish commandos are monitoring the bosporus in rubber boats with mounted machine guns .
more than 23,000 turkish police will be on duty when the nato summit gets underway in istanbul on sunday . about 20,000 demonstrators , many members of leftist groups , gathered in a ankara square on sunday chanting anti-bush slogans and protesting american policies in the middle east . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters carry signs that say " criminals of occupation , torture and rape should be tried " against the nato summit and visit by bush in istanbul .
earlier on saturday , turkish police fired tear gas at hordes of stone-throwing leftist protestors , just hours before bush arrived in the country .
the fortress that ankara came to resemble over the weekend led a turkish commentator to write : " this visit is making our lives hell . " " barbaric act " the president 's visit also coincided with the hostage-taking of three turkish workers in iraq by militants loyal to abu musab al-zarqawi , a jordanian-born terrorist believed to have links to al qaeda . the militants have threatened to behead them within 72 hours unless turkish companies stop working with u.s. forces in iraq . the al-jazeera arabic television channel showed pictures of the three men crouching in front of masked gunmen and holding up their passports .
the same group beheaded a south korean hostage earlier this week and an american man last month . on saturday bush refused to answer reporters ' questions about the kidnappings , but white house spokesman sean mccormack said , " we 're in close contact with the turkish government on the issue .
it is an awful reminder of the barbaric nature of these terrorists , but their acts will not shake the will of free people everywhere . " " a model for the middle east " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. president george w. bush , right , and turkish president ahmet necdet sezer review the military honor guard in ankara .
meeting with turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan on sunday , bush vowed to fight hard for turkey to become a member of the european union , a line he stressed even during a eu-u.s. summit in ireland on saturday morning . " i will remind people of this good country that i believe ought to be given a date by the eu for your eventual acceptance into the eu , " bush said . the president also praised turkey for reconciling democracy with its muslim tradition and said it could set an example for the middle east . " i appreciate so very much the example your country has set on how to be a muslim country and at the same time a country which embraces democracy and rule of law and freedom , " he said . bush , who is on a europe trip to mobilize support for his mission in iraq , is hoping that his talks with turkish leaders will improve america 's ties with the only muslim nation in the western alliance . bush 's relations with turkey were strained in the run-up to the iraq war when turkey 's parliament rejected a u.s. request to let american troops use turkish bases to invade iraq from the south . nato to train iraqi military on monday , bush will fly to istanbul to attend a summit of the 26-nation nato alliance .
on saturday , nato nations cautiously agreed to respond to iraqi prime minister iyad allawi 's request to train iraqi security forces . the agreement is expected to be finalized at the nato summit that ends tuesday , a day before the transfer of political power in iraq . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de summit backs nato help to train iraqi military the u.s.-eu summit in ireland saturday put behind major transatlantic differences as it endorsed nato help in training iraqi security forces and pledged to support the economic and political reconstruction of iraq .

dutch advance after topping swedes in penalties greek davids ' slay the french goliaths portugal beats holland to book ticket to finals world cup 2006 -pipe- 27.06.2004 czechs crush danes to make semis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech forward pavel nedved put in the work for the win .
playing defensively for most of the match , the czech republic surgically used their chances to beat denmark 3-0 on sunday .
the czechs will face greece in the semi-final . giant striker jan koller headed the czechs in front in the 49th minute before liverpool marksman milan baros scored twice in two minutes to kill off the 1992 champions and ensure karel bruckner 's men maintained their 100 percent record in the competition . baros ' double - a clever chip and an unstoppable rising left-footed drive - took his goal tally to five in four matches , making him the tournament 's highest goalscorer . the czech republic , beaten finalists in 1996 when they lost to germany at wembley stadium in england , will play greece in the semi-finals here at the same stadium on thursday . the czechs were the first to threaten , pavel nedved 's whipped 20-yard free-kick wide on the left wing gathered safely by danish goalkeeper thomas sorensen .
koller , at 2.02 metres -lrb- 6ft 7ins -rrb- the tallest player at euro 2004 , headed karel poborsky 's right-wing cross over the bar and tomas galasek 's low drive sailed wide as the czechs maintained their early momentum before denmark mustered their first attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the luck of the vikings was n't enough .
claus jensen found space on the left after a weak defensive clearance and the livewire charlton midfielder fed christian poulsen whose goalbound drive was blocked by a forest of czech legs .
poulsen headed wide as the danes slowly wrestled control of the match before thomas gravesen , pulling the strings for the scandinavians in central midfield , fired a drive into the stands from the edge of the box . former manchester united winger karel poborsky came the closest to breaking the deadlock a minute before half-time , the czech midfielder 's right-wing cross bouncing off the top of the crossbar .
the match sprang to life four minutes after the break when the czechs took the lead . nedved won a corner which poborsky drove into the penalty box and koller stole a yard on his marker to plant a firm header past a helpless sorensen .
the czechs tightened their grip in the 63rd minute when they increased their advantage with a swift counter-attack . poborsky 's clever ball found baros who outpaced danish captain rene henriksen before lifting the ball over the advancing sorensen .
baros put the result beyond doubt two minutes later , collecting nedved 's clever diagonal pass before lashing the ball into the roof of the net .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de reader response -pipe- 27.06.2004 romania 's new adoption laws großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can only be taken in by a romanian family .
the romanian government has passed a law banning foreign adoptions of its orphans after pressure from the eu to curb abuses of the system by child traffickers .
dw-world readers are outraged . no , i do not support romania 's ban on foreign adoptions .
my son is from romania so i have come to love the country and its people .
and i would support all reasonable efforts to improve the system .
however , i can not support new legislation that will hurt the children of romania .
anyone who believes that children are better off in an institution or foster care than being in a home with a forever family is an idiot .
and the fact that one woman can blackmail a country into passing this type of legislation is incredible .
i not only cry for the children in romania but i am so afraid for the children in other countries who will be trying to join the eu - sandy axley no , i do not support this ban .
of course emma nicholson is delighted - the media " bought " her lies as she told of adoptive parents using their adopted children as organ donors , that we are sexually trafficking our children , and that we buy them off the internet for $ 50,000 .
sadly no one has published the truth - that a few impoverished adults sell their kidneys for money , that sexual trafficking of children does exist but is not done by adoptive parents , and that yes , adoption agencies do have websites on their agencies but you can not " buy " a child on the internet - you must go through social worker interviews , immigration approval , submission of your tax records and proof of employment , and in the united states - fingerprint checks by the fbi and state and local police .
this woman will have to answer to god for the damage she has done to the voiceless children of romania - linda robak the law in its present form creates discrimination against romanians living abroad , and hence is un-constitutional .
there is a double standard which the law promotes -lrb- art.39 -rrb- , giving rights to romanian citizens living in romania to adopt through an internal adoption process , but prohibiting romanians that live abroad to adopt .
we have written a letter to the romanian president ion iliescu not to sign such a law - florin rapan , president of alliance of romanian canadians , canada i absolutely do not agree with this ban .
as an adoptive mother of a romanian child with extreme delays in all areas because of her time spent in institutions , i have seen first hand what a difference a loving , permanent family can make in the lives of such children .
romania needs to stop the corruption but not legitimate adoptions .
my heart weeps for those children who sit and wait with their hopes of ever overcoming post-institutional problems tragically diminishing with each passing day - j .
cooper my wife and i have been trying to adopt two children from bucharest for nearly four years , and we had submitted all our paperwork before the moratorium began .
when we were finally assigned our two children at the beginning of 2003 , we eagerly prepared ourselves and the children by traveling to bucharest four times within a year to get to know them and be a part of their early lives .
unfortunately , the moratorium continued with few exceptions , and we were not able to adopt these children despite our best efforts .
now , it seems nearly all hope is lost .
we 're well aware of the plight of so many of these children , having become well-informed on the situation of the abandoned children of romania .
in their zeal for romania to join the european union , officials in romania and the eu have sacrificed the best interests of these poor children .
politics and misinformation have won over the weak and helpless .
a prime source of falsehoods and slander comes straight from the baroness nicholson , who has repeatedly described us hopeful adoptive parents as less than human and unfit for even domestic adoptions in our own countries ; and this in spite of the rigorous backgrounds checks and counseling we must undergo before we can even be considered eligible and able for adoption .
this ban on international adoptions is a sin and a travesty of human rights .
romania is in for a rude awakening in the coming years as the number of abandoned children mushrooms , and society crumbles as a result of another lost generation - thomas h. haar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de romania bans foreign adoptions the romanian government has passed a law banning foreign adoptions of its orphans after pressure from the eu to curb abuses of the system by child traffickers .
the u.s. says the ban goes too far .

u.s. president bush renewed calls for turkey 's eu entry as he sought to boost ties with the country in ankara on the eve of a nato summit .
thousands of people protested on the sidelines . u.s. president george w. bush 's first-ever visit to turkey on saturday got off to a violent start . preceded by a series of protests and bomb blasts , including two last thursday that injured three people outside the ankara hotel where bush is expected to stay and killed another four on a bus in istanbul , the president 's arrival has put turkish security forces on high alert . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish police officers stand guard in front of a huge banner that reads " no to nato , go away bush " during a demonstration .
in a dramatic beefing up of security , f-16 warplanes patrolled the skies over istanbul on sunday while turkish commandos are monitoring the bosporus in rubber boats with mounted machine guns .
more than 23,000 turkish police will be on duty when the nato summit gets underway in istanbul on sunday . about 20,000 demonstrators , many members of leftist groups , gathered in a ankara square on sunday chanting anti-bush slogans and protesting american policies in the middle east . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters carry signs that say " criminals of occupation , torture and rape should be tried " against the nato summit and visit by bush in istanbul .

the fortress that ankara came to resemble over the weekend led a turkish commentator to write : " this visit is making our lives hell . " " barbaric act " the president 's visit also coincided with the hostage-taking of three turkish workers in iraq by militants loyal to abu musab al-zarqawi , a jordanian-born terrorist believed to have links to al qaeda . the militants have threatened to behead them within 72 hours unless turkish companies stop working with u.s. forces in iraq . the al-jazeera arabic television channel showed pictures of the three men crouching in front of masked gunmen and holding up their passports .
the same group beheaded a south korean hostage earlier this week and an american man last month . on saturday bush refused to answer reporters ' questions about the kidnappings , but white house spokesman sean mccormack said , " we 're in close contact with the turkish government on the issue .

the romanian government has passed a law banning foreign adoptions of its orphans after pressure from the eu to curb abuses of the system by child traffickers .
dw-world readers are outraged . no , i do not support romania 's ban on foreign adoptions .
my son is from romania so i have come to love the country and its people .
and i would support all reasonable efforts to improve the system .
however , i can not support new legislation that will hurt the children of romania .
anyone who believes that children are better off in an institution or foster care than being in a home with a forever family is an idiot .
and the fact that one woman can blackmail a country into passing this type of legislation is incredible .
i not only cry for the children in romania but i am so afraid for the children in other countries who will be trying to join the eu - sandy axley no , i do not support this ban .
of course emma nicholson is delighted - the media " bought " her lies as she told of adoptive parents using their adopted children as organ donors , that we are sexually trafficking our children , and that we buy them off the internet for $ 50,000 .
sadly no one has published the truth - that a few impoverished adults sell their kidneys for money , that sexual trafficking of children does exist but is not done by adoptive parents , and that yes , adoption agencies do have websites on their agencies but you can not " buy " a child on the internet - you must go through social worker interviews , immigration approval , submission of your tax records and proof of employment , and in the united states - fingerprint checks by the fbi and state and local police .
this woman will have to answer to god for the damage she has done to the voiceless children of romania - linda robak the law in its present form creates discrimination against romanians living abroad , and hence is un-constitutional .
there is a double standard which the law promotes -lrb- art.39 -rrb- , giving rights to romanian citizens living in romania to adopt through an internal adoption process , but prohibiting romanians that live abroad to adopt .
we have written a letter to the romanian president ion iliescu not to sign such a law - florin rapan , president of alliance of romanian canadians , canada i absolutely do not agree with this ban .
as an adoptive mother of a romanian child with extreme delays in all areas because of her time spent in institutions , i have seen first hand what a difference a loving , permanent family can make in the lives of such children .
romania needs to stop the corruption but not legitimate adoptions .
my heart weeps for those children who sit and wait with their hopes of ever overcoming post-institutional problems tragically diminishing with each passing day - j .
cooper my wife and i have been trying to adopt two children from bucharest for nearly four years , and we had submitted all our paperwork before the moratorium began .
when we were finally assigned our two children at the beginning of 2003 , we eagerly prepared ourselves and the children by traveling to bucharest four times within a year to get to know them and be a part of their early lives .
unfortunately , the moratorium continued with few exceptions , and we were not able to adopt these children despite our best efforts .
now , it seems nearly all hope is lost .
we 're well aware of the plight of so many of these children , having become well-informed on the situation of the abandoned children of romania .
in their zeal for romania to join the european union , officials in romania and the eu have sacrificed the best interests of these poor children .
politics and misinformation have won over the weak and helpless .
a prime source of falsehoods and slander comes straight from the baroness nicholson , who has repeatedly described us hopeful adoptive parents as less than human and unfit for even domestic adoptions in our own countries ; and this in spite of the rigorous backgrounds checks and counseling we must undergo before we can even be considered eligible and able for adoption .
this ban on international adoptions is a sin and a travesty of human rights .

playing defensively for most of the match , the czech republic surgically used their chances to beat denmark 3-0 on sunday .
the czechs will face greece in the semi-final . giant striker jan koller headed the czechs in front in the 49th minute before liverpool marksman milan baros scored twice in two minutes to kill off the 1992 champions and ensure karel bruckner 's men maintained their 100 percent record in the competition . baros ' double - a clever chip and an unstoppable rising left-footed drive - took his goal tally to five in four matches , making him the tournament 's highest goalscorer . the czech republic , beaten finalists in 1996 when they lost to germany at wembley stadium in england , will play greece in the semi-finals here at the same stadium on thursday . the czechs were the first to threaten , pavel nedved 's whipped 20-yard free-kick wide on the left wing gathered safely by danish goalkeeper thomas sorensen .
koller , at 2.02 metres -lrb- 6ft 7ins -rrb- the tallest player at euro 2004 , headed karel poborsky 's right-wing cross over the bar and tomas galasek 's low drive sailed wide as the czechs maintained their early momentum before denmark mustered their first attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the luck of the vikings was n't enough .
claus jensen found space on the left after a weak defensive clearance and the livewire charlton midfielder fed christian poulsen whose goalbound drive was blocked by a forest of czech legs .
poulsen headed wide as the danes slowly wrestled control of the match before thomas gravesen , pulling the strings for the scandinavians in central midfield , fired a drive into the stands from the edge of the box . former manchester united winger karel poborsky came the closest to breaking the deadlock a minute before half-time , the czech midfielder 's right-wing cross bouncing off the top of the crossbar .
the match sprang to life four minutes after the break when the czechs took the lead . nedved won a corner which poborsky drove into the penalty box and koller stole a yard on his marker to plant a firm header past a helpless sorensen .
the czechs tightened their grip in the 63rd minute when they increased their advantage with a swift counter-attack . poborsky 's clever ball found baros who outpaced danish captain rene henriksen before lifting the ball over the advancing sorensen .
baros put the result beyond doubt two minutes later , collecting nedved 's clever diagonal pass before lashing the ball into the roof of the net .

u.s. president bush renewed calls for turkey 's eu entry as he sought to boost ties with the country in ankara on the eve of a nato summit .
thousands of people protested on the sidelines . u.s. president george w. bush 's first-ever visit to turkey on saturday got off to a violent start . preceded by a series of protests and bomb blasts , including two last thursday that injured three people outside the ankara hotel where bush is expected to stay and killed another four on a bus in istanbul , the president 's arrival has put turkish security forces on high alert . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish police officers stand guard in front of a huge banner that reads " no to nato , go away bush " during a demonstration .
in a dramatic beefing up of security , f-16 warplanes patrolled the skies over istanbul on sunday while turkish commandos are monitoring the bosporus in rubber boats with mounted machine guns .
more than 23,000 turkish police will be on duty when the nato summit gets underway in istanbul on sunday . about 20,000 demonstrators , many members of leftist groups , gathered in a ankara square on sunday chanting anti-bush slogans and protesting american policies in the middle east . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters carry signs that say " criminals of occupation , torture and rape should be tried " against the nato summit and visit by bush in istanbul .
earlier on saturday , turkish police fired tear gas at hordes of stone-throwing leftist protestors , just hours before bush arrived in the country .
the fortress that ankara came to resemble over the weekend led a turkish commentator to write : " this visit is making our lives hell . " " barbaric act " the president 's visit also coincided with the hostage-taking of three turkish workers in iraq by militants loyal to abu musab al-zarqawi , a jordanian-born terrorist believed to have links to al qaeda . the militants have threatened to behead them within 72 hours unless turkish companies stop working with u.s. forces in iraq . the al-jazeera arabic television channel showed pictures of the three men crouching in front of masked gunmen and holding up their passports .
the same group beheaded a south korean hostage earlier this week and an american man last month . on saturday bush refused to answer reporters ' questions about the kidnappings , but white house spokesman sean mccormack said , " we 're in close contact with the turkish government on the issue .
it is an awful reminder of the barbaric nature of these terrorists , but their acts will not shake the will of free people everywhere .

meeting with turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan on sunday , bush vowed to fight hard for turkey to become a member of the european union , a line he stressed even during a eu-u.s. summit in ireland on saturday morning . " i will remind people of this good country that i believe ought to be given a date by the eu for your eventual acceptance into the eu , " bush said . the president also praised turkey for reconciling democracy with its muslim tradition and said it could set an example for the middle east . " i appreciate so very much the example your country has set on how to be a muslim country and at the same time a country which embraces democracy and rule of law and freedom , " he said . bush , who is on a europe trip to mobilize support for his mission in iraq , is hoping that his talks with turkish leaders will improve america 's ties with the only muslim nation in the western alliance . bush 's relations with turkey were strained in the run-up to the iraq war when turkey 's parliament rejected a u.s. request to let american troops use turkish bases to invade iraq from the south . nato to train iraqi military on monday , bush will fly to istanbul to attend a summit of the 26-nation nato alliance .

but doctors.net.uk found only 15 % of incidents which could have led to death or disability were reported .
the national patient safety agency is rolling out an anonymous reporting system across the nhs this year .
but the majority of the 2,500 doctors surveyed backed an independent internet site to log such errors .
blame culture of those questioned , 81 % said they did not trust their nhs trust or the department of health to a run a blame-free system for reporting their mistakes .
dr neil bacon , founder of doctors.net.uk , said : " existing systems are not trusted by doctors .
" it 's meant to be confidential but the culture of no blame is n't a reality in the nhs .
it 's used as a witch-hunt .
any system that helps prevent medical mistakes , by helping doctors come forward without the fear of being blamed , would hold real benefits for the nhs michael wilks , chairman of the british medical association 's medico-legal committee " at the moment we have no way of learning as doctors from each other .
effectively , we are all working in the dark . "
dr bacon said the only way forward was an anonymous system like those used by airline pilots .
this could be a confidential system on the internet , he said .
" doctors want this to change .
it is n't doctors being secretive , " said dr bacon .
he said errors reported ranged from small , day in day out mistakes in prescribing and diagnosing to rare but much more serious mistakes .
" doctors across the uk have shown a remarkable honesty and frankness about the scale of the problem and a demand that things change for the benefit of their patients , " he said .
time for change sue osborn , joint chief executive of the national patient safety agency which is introducing the nhs 's reporting system said : " if we want to maximise the numbers of reports we receive and the amount we learn , we need the trust of clinicians .
" this is why we have developed an anonymous system that will respect the confidentiality of those who take the time to report to us , " he said .
michael wilks , chairman of the british medical association 's medico-legal committee , said : " the bma would welcome a system of reporting that allows clinical mistakes to be openly discussed and analysed .
he said : " many medical mistakes are a result of system errors rather than the negligence of an individual doctor and so any system that helps prevent medical mistakes , by helping doctors come forward without the fear of being blamed , would hold real benefits for the nhs .
" e-learning systems that allows for reporting medical mistakes should be introduced as part of the planned reform of the clinical negligence system if it is to effectively tackle the blame culture within the nhs , " he said .
systems exist mr james johnson , chairman of the british medical association , said : " doctors are human and therefore inevitably they will sometimes make mistakes .
it is vitally important we learn from these mistakes .
" if you can find out why something has gone wrong and share that information you can stop it happening again .
but others can best learn from your mistakes if you have a no blame culture .
" there is already a system in place for sharing information about medical errors and near-misses - it 's called the national patient safety agency .
" people can report incidents to the agency on an anonymous basis if they want to , or can give fuller details .
the important thing is to alert everyone to a problem area so that patients are safeguarded in future , " he said .
the royal college of nursing released new guidelines last week aimed at cutting blood transfusion errors .
it sets out practical step-by-step advice for nurses involved in the transfusion process .
figures from the serious hazards of transfusion reporting scheme show a 47 % increase in reporting of adverse events and near misses since 1996 .

some 16 people received death sentences in a trial in the city of chongqing on saturday and a man was executed in shanghai , said xinhua news agency .
xinhua 's website , xinhuanet , said on friday executions had also been carried out in several other provinces .
human rights group amnesty international urged china to abolish the death penalty in drugs cases .
xinhuanet said " dozens " of dealers were sentenced to death across china in the run-up to the international anti-drugs day .
the news agency said that a man was executed in shanghai on saturday for smuggling in 1.8kg of heroin from burma -lrb- myanmar -rrb- .
executions were also carried out in the provinces of yunnan , guangdong , zhejiang , shaanxi and xinjiang , it added .
most cases involved heroin , opium and ephedrine .
amnesty international urged beijing to abandon the policy of imposing the death penalty .
" we have seen an annual spree of executions in china in the run-up to un international day against drug abuse and illicit trafficking in previous years , " it said .

she was diagnosed with crohn 's at the age of 25 , but her doctor told her she had been suffering from it for 12 years .
the 48-year-old mother-of-two from stanmore , north-west london , was not tested for the illness until her parents sought private advice - even though her sister had already been diagnosed .
" i used to get stomach upsets and go to the doctor who would say it was " monday morning feeling " because i did n't want to go to school , " said mrs adley .
" in the end i got so ill that my parents sent me to a private doctor and i was diagnosed . "
with the diarrhoea sometimes you just ca n't get to the toilet in time , it 's very degrading " ruth adley " by this time it was too late and i had to have surgery to remove part of my bowel . "
the little-known disease causes inflammation and ulceration throughout the gastrointestinal system .
the cause of the illness itself is unknown .
symptoms include severe stomach pains and chronic diarrhoea .
all in the space of just a few weeks mrs adley suffered with internal abscesses and also developed peritonitis so doctors removed her appendix which had become gangrenous .
she became so unwell that her weight dropped to just five-and-a-half stone .
mother 's illness mrs adley said : " i felt terrible while i was in hospital , especially with the diarrhoea because you just ca n't get to the toilet in time , it 's very degrading . "
part of the bowel removed in mrs adley 's operation was the section that regulates going to the toilet so she was left with less control .
as well being embarrassing , mrs adley said it has had a further reaching affect on her life and her family .
" when my daughter natasha was a baby if i was out with her and needed to go to the toilet i would have to knock on people 's doors and ask if i could use theirs , " she said .
" if i was feeding her at home and needed to use the toilet i just had to leave her on the floor and go .
it would be awful because i could hear her crying . "
natasha , 18 , said she too has had to learn to live with her mother 's illness .
she said : " when we need to go on a long journey , like up to university in birmingham , it 's easier for her not to come . "
the teenager is so keen for people to learn more about crohn 's and make it less of a taboo subject that she and her friend 19-year-old lisa meleck , whose mother helene is also a sufferer , organise an annual sponsored walk in hyde park .
in 2003 , 350 walkers raised £ 32,000 .
josh , natasha 's 15-year-old brother , has also helped his mother out in the past .
snide comments mrs adley said : " when he was younger if we were in town and i needed to go to the toilet he would make out it was him to save my embarrassment . "
she carries the national association of colitis and crohn 's " ca n't wait " card , which explains that she has an illness which makes her need to use the toilet urgently but some shop-owners can be less than understanding .
as can other diners when mrs adley decides to eat out .
she said : " often in restaurants there is only one toilet and because you need to be in there a long time people will bang on the door .
they will also make snide comments when you come out .
" perhaps if they knew what was wrong they would n't . "
this year 's walk for crohn 's took place on sunday , 27 june in hyde park , central london .

she was diagnosed with crohn 's at the age of 25 , but her doctor told her she had been suffering from it for 12 years .
the 48-year-old mother-of-two from stanmore , north-west london , was not tested for the illness until her parents sought private advice - even though her sister had already been diagnosed .
" i used to get stomach upsets and go to the doctor who would say it was " monday morning feeling " because i did n't want to go to school , " said mrs adley .
" in the end i got so ill that my parents sent me to a private doctor and i was diagnosed .
with the diarrhoea sometimes you just ca n't get to the toilet in time , it 's very degrading ruth adley " by this time it was too late and i had to have surgery to remove part of my bowel . "
the little-known disease causes inflammation and ulceration throughout the gastrointestinal system .
the cause of the illness itself is unknown .
symptoms include severe stomach pains and chronic diarrhoea .
all in the space of just a few weeks mrs adley suffered with internal abscesses and also developed peritonitis so doctors removed her appendix which had become gangrenous .
she became so unwell that her weight dropped to just five-and-a-half stone .
mother 's illness mrs adley said : " i felt terrible while i was in hospital , especially with the diarrhoea because you just ca n't get to the toilet in time , it 's very degrading . "
part of the bowel removed in mrs adley 's operation was the section that regulates going to the toilet so she was left with less control .
as well being embarrassing , mrs adley said it has had a further reaching affect on her life and her family .
" when my daughter natasha was a baby if i was out with her and needed to go to the toilet i would have to knock on people 's doors and ask if i could use theirs , " she said .
" if i was feeding her at home and needed to use the toilet i just had to leave her on the floor and go .
it would be awful because i could hear her crying . "
the 2003 walk for crohn 's raised £ 32,000 natasha , 18 , said she too has had to learn to live with her mother 's illness .
she said : " when we need to go on a long journey , like up to university in birmingham , it 's easier for her not to come . "
the teenager is so keen for people to learn more about crohn 's and make it less of a taboo subject that she and her friend 19-year-old lisa meleck , whose mother helene is also a sufferer , organise an annual sponsored walk in hyde park .
in 2003 , 350 walkers raised £ 32,000 .
josh , natasha 's 15-year-old brother , has also helped his mother out in the past .
snide comments mrs adley said : " when he was younger if we were in town and i needed to go to the toilet he would make out it was him to save my embarrassment . "
she carries the national association of colitis and crohn 's " ca n't wait " card , which explains that she has an illness which makes her need to use the toilet urgently but some shop-owners can be less than understanding .
as can other diners when mrs adley decides to eat out .
she said : " often in restaurants there is only one toilet and because you need to be in there a long time people will bang on the door .
they will also make snide comments when you come out .
" perhaps if they knew what was wrong they would n't . "
this year 's walk for crohn 's took place on sunday , 27 june in hyde park , central london .
