given the threat of terrorism , the investment in precaution is understandable . nato has begun operation " distinguished games " - the first time the organization has played such a support role for a civilian event .
its operations include an intensive surveillance of the airspace over greece , with around 10 airborne early warning aircraft -lrb- awacs -rrb- taking it in shifts to circle over the eastern mediterranean , searching for passenger planes or other aircraft that could be seized by terrorists .
should the flying radar stations find a suspicious aircraft , the nato command center in larissa can send fighter jets from greece or other nato member states into the sky .
patriot anti-aircraft missiles are also deployed around athens .
if a warning is ignored , shots may be fired - but only if the greek government gives the command .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the greek navy patrols the coast , here near the greek island of hydra , southwest of athens .
" nato wo n't be taking action in response to any kind of a contingency , " said nato spokesman james appathurai .
" if our planes detect something , they 'll inform the greek authorities and it 'll be for them to decide what to do and to do it , but not for nato . "
test runs have shown that a crisis committee could give the green light for a launch within 20 minutes at the most .
around 12 nato patrol boats and 35 boats belonging to the greek navy are cruising along the coast to protect the olympic sports arenas from attack by ship .
anti-terror troops on hand a nato " anti-terror batallion " is stationed in the bathing resort of halkida , 90 kilometers northeast of athens .
this will be the starting place for troops from belgium , the czech republic , hungary , italy , poland and spain should there be a poison gas attack or some similar catastrophe .
" we will be forward-deploying elements of a chemical , biological , radiological and nuclear defense battalion , which will be there to help defend against any attack using weapons of mass destruction , " appathurai said .
the 200 nato troops do not constitute a fighting force , and while security is the top priority , appathurai is optimistic that the games will pass without incident .
" we 're quite confident that the greek authorities have done everything humanly possible to provide for security , and we do n't have any specific reason to believe there 'll be a major attack at the olympics , " appathurai said .
" but you always have to be prepared . "
new spending record greece has invested € 1.2 billion in security measures for the olympic games - four times the amount spent in sydney in 2000 .
a blimp is circling above athens that can listen in on telephone conversations and detect chemicals .
every movement in the city is being observed by more than 1500 surveillance cameras .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a police officer stands in front of a us-swiss airship fitted with cameras and sensors to provide security at olympics .
greek prime minister kostas karamanlis is reportedly proud of this total surveillance but there 's also been heavy criticism of the measures .
many athenians are concerned that their civil liberties are being threatened .
the international olympic committee though , says it expected nothing less .
" the security measures wo n't affect the mood of the games , they are necessary , " said ioc president jacques rogge .
" i commend the greek government for having done everything possible .
that 's what the world expects for something like the olympic games .

taxation is the choice method . starting in august , young germans looking for an alcoholic kick on a summer night , have to reach a little deeper in their pocket .
a sin tax slapped on mixed drinks sold in cans or bottles is to blame .
instead of the € 2.00 a pop they used to cost , teenage drinkers have to fork out another 80 cents -lrb- about one dollar more -rrb- for their fruit-flavored alcohol .
the german health ministry , which proposed the tax as a means to discourage under-age drinkers from buying the so-called alcopops , hopes the increased price will have an effect not only on the consumers , but also on the manufacturers , who notoriously market the sweet drinks to younger crowds by presenting them as cool and trendy in advertisements .
" we want to give a clear signal that we do not want people under 18 buying them , " said marion caspers-merck , germany 's commissioner for drug policy .
europe-wide health concern germany is not alone in declaring a war on alcopops .
throughout europe , politicians are taking aim at the innocent looking bottles in bright snappy colors with exotic ingredients such as tequila , lime and " organic agave cactus juice . "
with an average alcohol content of 5.5 percent , the drinks have been pinpointed as a major contributor to increased alcohol abuse among teenagers .
alcopops are especially conducive to encouraging underage drinking because their characteristic sweetness masks the bitter taste of alcohol .
young people , who ordinarily would not opt for hard liquor , are now consuming it in greater quantities disguised in fruit-flavored drinks .
doctors in britain have put the blame for the surge in teenage drinking squarely on alcopops .
the british organization alcohol concern has said that alcohol abuse in children and young adults is on the increase .
studies conducted at the royal liverpool children 's hospital has shown that , from 1985 to 1996 , there was a tenfold increase in admissions of children aged nine to 16 under the influence of alcohol .
half of all alcopops consumed by teenagers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rigo , breezer and smirnoff ice are the preferred trendy drinks of youths .
according to an international study by the world health organization , 3.6 percent of 11 year-olds admitted to drinking alcopops regularly .
at age 15 , the figure jumps to almost 15 percent .
in germany , a government report last year said every second alcopop sold was purchased by 14 to 19 year-olds .
but while health officials continue to worry about how the drinks are leading to increased alcoholism among young people , the drink producers are watching their sales climb .
between 2001 and 2002 , the amount of alcopops sold rose from 3 to 13 million liters -lrb- 0.8 to 3.4 million gallons -rrb- .
the biggest markets are germany , france , britain , belgium and denmark .
in germany , sales of rigo and breezer - two popular mixed drinks - account for 56 percent of bicardi deutschland 's turnover .
taxation as prevention austria is the latest country to take preventive action to curb sales of the sugary drinks .
following germany 's example , it too has decided to increase the price of alcopops .
earlier this week , austrian health minister maria rauch-kallat called for firm measures in the form of a tax to act as a disincentive for young people to buy the flavored alcohol .
the country 's treasury will correspondingly decrease taxes on non-alcoholic beverages , she added .
in france , a tax on alcopops was introduced in 1996 and left a serious dent in the market .
last month a new public health low was voted through parliament setting the tax rate at 11 euros per deciliter of pure alcohol in a new public health law voted through parliament last month .
although fewer teens may opt to spend more money for the drinks , not everyone is convinced that the tax is as effective as intended .
the french automobile association - quoting figures of a quarter of drunk-driving accidents committed by people between age 18 and 24 - says a simple health tax is not enough to address the problem .
it says there should be more prevention campaigns focusing on the effects of alcohol .
in germany , though , politicians and health officials are sticking to taxation as a form of discouragement .
" this is an important and sensible step , " said fritz behrens , state interior minister for north rhine-westphalia .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 07.08.2004 court issues sentence in berlin wall shootings großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once a death zone , now a popular tourist site some 15 years after unification , a berlin court has given one-year prison sentences to two former east german politburo members , bringing an end to cases against east german leaders involved in the shoot-to-kill policy . sitting in the dock in the last trial involving former east german politburo members were ex-regional communist party heads siegfried lorenz and hans-joachim böhme .
both men , now in their 70 's stood accused of accessory to manslaughter for their involvement in issuing " shoot-to-kill " orders along the berlin wall and the former inner-german border .
the judges in the berlin regional court considered the two officials for the former east german state as " primary " decision-makers in the communist chain of command that ultimately led to three deaths at the berlin wall between 1986 and 1989 .
the court thus handed down one-year suspended prison sentences to both men .
although lorenz and böhme alleged they had never directly ordered or oversaw any shootings at the wall , they were nonetheless found guilty for failing to prevent or revoke the order to kill illegal border crossers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : remembering those who died in search of freedom crossing the berlin wall - here on aug .
13 , 2003 - the 42nd anniversary of the wall .
the defendants ' argument that border shootings were lawful in east germany at the time and that they were simply following command , failed to persuade the judges .
the nuremberg trials against nazi leaders after world war ii already established the legal precedent to which germany abides , namely that under international law , those who order or assist in killings can not be protected by national legislation .
last in a line of proceedings the case against lorenz and böhme marks the end in a long line of proceedings against former east german officials and their involvement in crimes committed prior to unification in 1990 .
looking back on past trials , marianne birthler -lrb- photo -rrb- , the head of the state-run agency responsible for analyzing archived stasi material , said there is a lot to be learned .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler " the trials we 've witnessed over the past years have been an important contribution towards coming to terms with our own history , " said the woman who governs over reams of archives compiled by east german state police .
" it 's the travel season now , and thousands of germans cross the former inner-german border just like that .
to think that some 15 years ago this would have been totally impossible for us easterners , " she added .
" you must not forget that the wall was nothing less than a big prison for millions of people over so many years .
this alone was a huge crime ! "
partial victory for justice during the 40-year history of east germany , close to 1,000 people were shot at the berlin wall or along the inner-german border while trying to flee to the west .
legal proceedings against senior east german government members started in 1992 , when former head of state erich honecker had to stand trial .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former east german head of state and party leader , egon krenz was released from prison on dec .
18 , 2003 , after serving just 4 years for involvement in state shootings .
but death or infirmity has caught up with most officials before the courts could bring them to justice .
honecker , for example , died in 1994 while in exile in chile .
and east germany 's last leader , egon krenz -lrb- photo -rrb- , was handed down a six and a half year prison sentence for manslaughter , of which he only had to serve four years before being released early in dec .
2003 .
birthler stressed that a lot has been done to make sure justice was carried out with regard to the wall shootings .
" in other areas , the judicial system in unified germany has failed completely , " she lamented , referring to the case of erich mielke , the head of the dreaded stasi secret police .

both men , now in their 70 's stood accused of accessory to manslaughter for their involvement in issuing " shoot-to-kill " orders along the berlin wall and the former inner-german border .
the judges in the berlin regional court considered the two officials for the former east german state as " primary " decision-makers in the communist chain of command that ultimately led to three deaths at the berlin wall between 1986 and 1989 .
the court thus handed down one-year suspended prison sentences to both men .
although lorenz and böhme alleged they had never directly ordered or oversaw any shootings at the wall , they were nonetheless found guilty for failing to prevent or revoke the order to kill illegal border crossers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : remembering those who died in search of freedom crossing the berlin wall - here on aug .
13 , 2003 - the 42nd anniversary of the wall .
the defendants ' argument that border shootings were lawful in east germany at the time and that they were simply following command , failed to persuade the judges .
the nuremberg trials against nazi leaders after world war ii already established the legal precedent to which germany abides , namely that under international law , those who order or assist in killings can not be protected by national legislation .
last in a line of proceedings the case against lorenz and böhme marks the end in a long line of proceedings against former east german officials and their involvement in crimes committed prior to unification in 1990 .
looking back on past trials , marianne birthler -lrb- photo -rrb- , the head of the state-run agency responsible for analyzing archived stasi material , said there is a lot to be learned .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler " the trials we 've witnessed over the past years have been an important contribution towards coming to terms with our own history , " said the woman who governs over reams of archives compiled by east german state police .
" it 's the travel season now , and thousands of germans cross the former inner-german border just like that .
to think that some 15 years ago this would have been totally impossible for us easterners , " she added .
" you must not forget that the wall was nothing less than a big prison for millions of people over so many years .
this alone was a huge crime ! "
partial victory for justice during the 40-year history of east germany , close to 1,000 people were shot at the berlin wall or along the inner-german border while trying to flee to the west .
legal proceedings against senior east german government members started in 1992 , when former head of state erich honecker had to stand trial .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former east german head of state and party leader , egon krenz was released from prison on dec .
18 , 2003 , after serving just 4 years for involvement in state shootings .
but death or infirmity has caught up with most officials before the courts could bring them to justice .
honecker , for example , died in 1994 while in exile in chile .
and east germany 's last leader , egon krenz -lrb- photo -rrb- , was handed down a six and a half year prison sentence for manslaughter , of which he only had to serve four years before being released early in dec .
2003 .
birthler stressed that a lot has been done to make sure justice was carried out with regard to the wall shootings .
" in other areas , the judicial system in unified germany has failed completely , " she lamented , referring to the case of erich mielke , the head of the dreaded stasi secret police .

given the threat of terrorism , the investment in precaution is understandable . nato has begun operation " distinguished games " - the first time the organization has played such a support role for a civilian event .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 07.08.2004 court issues sentence in berlin wall shootings großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once a death zone , now a popular tourist site some 15 years after unification , a berlin court has given one-year prison sentences to two former east german politburo members , bringing an end to cases against east german leaders involved in the shoot-to-kill policy . sitting in the dock in the last trial involving former east german politburo members were ex-regional communist party heads siegfried lorenz and hans-joachim böhme .
both men , now in their 70 's stood accused of accessory to manslaughter for their involvement in issuing " shoot-to-kill " orders along the berlin wall and the former inner-german border .
the judges in the berlin regional court considered the two officials for the former east german state as " primary " decision-makers in the communist chain of command that ultimately led to three deaths at the berlin wall between 1986 and 1989 .
the court thus handed down one-year suspended prison sentences to both men .
although lorenz and böhme alleged they had never directly ordered or oversaw any shootings at the wall , they were nonetheless found guilty for failing to prevent or revoke the order to kill illegal border crossers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : remembering those who died in search of freedom crossing the berlin wall - here on aug .
13 , 2003 - the 42nd anniversary of the wall .
the defendants ' argument that border shootings were lawful in east germany at the time and that they were simply following command , failed to persuade the judges .
the nuremberg trials against nazi leaders after world war ii already established the legal precedent to which germany abides , namely that under international law , those who order or assist in killings can not be protected by national legislation .
last in a line of proceedings the case against lorenz and böhme marks the end in a long line of proceedings against former east german officials and their involvement in crimes committed prior to unification in 1990 .
looking back on past trials , marianne birthler -lrb- photo -rrb- , the head of the state-run agency responsible for analyzing archived stasi material , said there is a lot to be learned .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler " the trials we 've witnessed over the past years have been an important contribution towards coming to terms with our own history , " said the woman who governs over reams of archives compiled by east german state police .
" it 's the travel season now , and thousands of germans cross the former inner-german border just like that .
to think that some 15 years ago this would have been totally impossible for us easterners , " she added .
" you must not forget that the wall was nothing less than a big prison for millions of people over so many years .
this alone was a huge crime ! "
partial victory for justice during the 40-year history of east germany , close to 1,000 people were shot at the berlin wall or along the inner-german border while trying to flee to the west .
legal proceedings against senior east german government members started in 1992 , when former head of state erich honecker had to stand trial .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former east german head of state and party leader , egon krenz was released from prison on dec .
18 , 2003 , after serving just 4 years for involvement in state shootings .
but death or infirmity has caught up with most officials before the courts could bring them to justice .
honecker , for example , died in 1994 while in exile in chile .
and east germany 's last leader , egon krenz -lrb- photo -rrb- , was handed down a six and a half year prison sentence for manslaughter , of which he only had to serve four years before being released early in dec .
2003 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 07.08.2004 court issues sentence in berlin wall shootings großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once a death zone , now a popular tourist site some 15 years after unification , a berlin court has given one-year prison sentences to two former east german politburo members , bringing an end to cases against east german leaders involved in the shoot-to-kill policy . sitting in the dock in the last trial involving former east german politburo members were ex-regional communist party heads siegfried lorenz and hans-joachim böhme .
both men , now in their 70 's stood accused of accessory to manslaughter for their involvement in issuing " shoot-to-kill " orders along the berlin wall and the former inner-german border .
the judges in the berlin regional court considered the two officials for the former east german state as " primary " decision-makers in the communist chain of command that ultimately led to three deaths at the berlin wall between 1986 and 1989 .
the court thus handed down one-year suspended prison sentences to both men .
although lorenz and böhme alleged they had never directly ordered or oversaw any shootings at the wall , they were nonetheless found guilty for failing to prevent or revoke the order to kill illegal border crossers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : remembering those who died in search of freedom crossing the berlin wall - here on aug .
13 , 2003 - the 42nd anniversary of the wall .
the defendants ' argument that border shootings were lawful in east germany at the time and that they were simply following command , failed to persuade the judges .
the nuremberg trials against nazi leaders after world war ii already established the legal precedent to which germany abides , namely that under international law , those who order or assist in killings can not be protected by national legislation .
last in a line of proceedings the case against lorenz and böhme marks the end in a long line of proceedings against former east german officials and their involvement in crimes committed prior to unification in 1990 .
looking back on past trials , marianne birthler -lrb- photo -rrb- , the head of the state-run agency responsible for analyzing archived stasi material , said there is a lot to be learned .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler " the trials we 've witnessed over the past years have been an important contribution towards coming to terms with our own history , " said the woman who governs over reams of archives compiled by east german state police .
" it 's the travel season now , and thousands of germans cross the former inner-german border just like that .
to think that some 15 years ago this would have been totally impossible for us easterners , " she added .
" you must not forget that the wall was nothing less than a big prison for millions of people over so many years .
this alone was a huge crime ! "
partial victory for justice during the 40-year history of east germany , close to 1,000 people were shot at the berlin wall or along the inner-german border while trying to flee to the west .
legal proceedings against senior east german government members started in 1992 , when former head of state erich honecker had to stand trial .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former east german head of state and party leader , egon krenz was released from prison on dec .
18 , 2003 , after serving just 4 years for involvement in state shootings .
but death or infirmity has caught up with most officials before the courts could bring them to justice .
honecker , for example , died in 1994 while in exile in chile .
and east germany 's last leader , egon krenz -lrb- photo -rrb- , was handed down a six and a half year prison sentence for manslaughter , of which he only had to serve four years before being released early in dec .
2003 .
birthler stressed that a lot has been done to make sure justice was carried out with regard to the wall shootings .
" in other areas , the judicial system in unified germany has failed completely , " she lamented , referring to the case of erich mielke , the head of the dreaded stasi secret police .

taxation is the choice method . starting in august , young germans looking for an alcoholic kick on a summer night , have to reach a little deeper in their pocket .
a sin tax slapped on mixed drinks sold in cans or bottles is to blame .
instead of the € 2.00 a pop they used to cost , teenage drinkers have to fork out another 80 cents -lrb- about one dollar more -rrb- for their fruit-flavored alcohol .
the german health ministry , which proposed the tax as a means to discourage under-age drinkers from buying the so-called alcopops , hopes the increased price will have an effect not only on the consumers , but also on the manufacturers , who notoriously market the sweet drinks to younger crowds by presenting them as cool and trendy in advertisements .
" we want to give a clear signal that we do not want people under 18 buying them , " said marion caspers-merck , germany 's commissioner for drug policy .
europe-wide health concern germany is not alone in declaring a war on alcopops .
throughout europe , politicians are taking aim at the innocent looking bottles in bright snappy colors with exotic ingredients such as tequila , lime and " organic agave cactus juice . "
with an average alcohol content of 5.5 percent , the drinks have been pinpointed as a major contributor to increased alcohol abuse among teenagers .
alcopops are especially conducive to encouraging underage drinking because their characteristic sweetness masks the bitter taste of alcohol .
young people , who ordinarily would not opt for hard liquor , are now consuming it in greater quantities disguised in fruit-flavored drinks .
doctors in britain have put the blame for the surge in teenage drinking squarely on alcopops .
the british organization alcohol concern has said that alcohol abuse in children and young adults is on the increase .
studies conducted at the royal liverpool children 's hospital has shown that , from 1985 to 1996 , there was a tenfold increase in admissions of children aged nine to 16 under the influence of alcohol .
half of all alcopops consumed by teenagers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rigo , breezer and smirnoff ice are the preferred trendy drinks of youths .
according to an international study by the world health organization , 3.6 percent of 11 year-olds admitted to drinking alcopops regularly .
at age 15 , the figure jumps to almost 15 percent .
in germany , a government report last year said every second alcopop sold was purchased by 14 to 19 year-olds .
but while health officials continue to worry about how the drinks are leading to increased alcoholism among young people , the drink producers are watching their sales climb .
between 2001 and 2002 , the amount of alcopops sold rose from 3 to 13 million liters -lrb- 0.8 to 3.4 million gallons -rrb- .
the biggest markets are germany , france , britain , belgium and denmark .
in germany , sales of rigo and breezer - two popular mixed drinks - account for 56 percent of bicardi deutschland 's turnover .
taxation as prevention austria is the latest country to take preventive action to curb sales of the sugary drinks .
following germany 's example , it too has decided to increase the price of alcopops .
earlier this week , austrian health minister maria rauch-kallat called for firm measures in the form of a tax to act as a disincentive for young people to buy the flavored alcohol .
the country 's treasury will correspondingly decrease taxes on non-alcoholic beverages , she added .
in france , a tax on alcopops was introduced in 1996 and left a serious dent in the market .
last month a new public health low was voted through parliament setting the tax rate at 11 euros per deciliter of pure alcohol in a new public health law voted through parliament last month .
although fewer teens may opt to spend more money for the drinks , not everyone is convinced that the tax is as effective as intended .
the french automobile association - quoting figures of a quarter of drunk-driving accidents committed by people between age 18 and 24 - says a simple health tax is not enough to address the problem .
it says there should be more prevention campaigns focusing on the effects of alcohol .
in germany , though , politicians and health officials are sticking to taxation as a form of discouragement .
" this is an important and sensible step , " said fritz behrens , state interior minister for north rhine-westphalia .
" young people underestimate the dangers of apparently harmless , sweet and trendy-looking drinks . "

rejecting a six-year-old spelling reform , several publishing companies have announced they would switch back to the old system .
the move comes shortly after leading conservative politicians had proposed a reversal . officials for axel springer and spiegel publishing companies said friday they planned to revert to the old spelling " as quickly as possible " in their print and online publications and called on other german media organizations to do so as well . the two leading publishers justified the decision by saying that the new rules were lacking acceptance and germans were increasingly uncertain about writing in their own language .
the new rules , aimed at ironing out quirks in spelling and punctuation , were first introduced in schools in 1998 and are scheduled to completely replace the old spelling by aug .
2005 . " the spelling reform is not a reform , but a step backwards , " springer ceo mathias döpfner and stefan aust , spiegel 's editor-in-chief , wrote in a joint statement .
" we want to help to correct this mistake .
linguistic development is an evolutionary process , as history has shown .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian wulff christian wulff -lrb- photo -rrb- , the christian democratic -lrb- cdu -rrb- premier of the german state of lower saxony , welcomed the decision . " this nonsensical reform can not be kept alive any longer , " said wulff , who re-ignited the debate a few weeks ago by calling for a reversal of the reform .
he added that he would try to get a majority of state premiers to support him at their next meeting in october .
several cdu premiers have already said they back the idea . a death blow ? others said they did n't believe the reform could survive with several of the country 's major publishers opposing it . " i ca n't imagine that the new spelling will survive now , " said hendrik zörner , the spokesman for the german journalists ' association , adding that his organization remained neutral on the issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spiegel and springer publications at a newsstand the two companies say they reach about 60 percent of the german population through their publications , which include mass-circulation tabloid bild and die welt newspaper -lrb- springer -rrb- and der spiegel newsmagazine -lrb- spiegel -rrb- . following their announcement , other media companies jumped on the band wagon .
officials for süddeutsche zeitung also said they would drop the new spelling .
bauer publishing company , which puts out tv guides and other popular magazines , also indicated they would follow suit .
germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper already switched back to the old spelling in 2000 . peter voss , the director-general of german public broadcaster swr , supported the reversal as well .
he added that his organization was debating doing the same and that he planned to bring up the issue with his colleagues within the national network of public broadcasters , ard .

they added that a new spelling council established to monitor linguistic development and fine-tune the reforms had been established in june . officials at burda publishing company , which includes focus newsmagazine , said they did not want to confuse people and would stick to the reform .
but they added that this should not be seen as a " commitment to the spelling reform .

rejecting a six-year-old spelling reform , several publishing companies have announced they would switch back to the old system .
the move comes shortly after leading conservative politicians had proposed a reversal . officials for axel springer and spiegel publishing companies said friday they planned to revert to the old spelling " as quickly as possible " in their print and online publications and called on other german media organizations to do so as well . the two leading publishers justified the decision by saying that the new rules were lacking acceptance and germans were increasingly uncertain about writing in their own language .
the new rules , aimed at ironing out quirks in spelling and punctuation , were first introduced in schools in 1998 and are scheduled to completely replace the old spelling by aug .
2005 . " the spelling reform is not a reform , but a step backwards , " springer ceo mathias döpfner and stefan aust , spiegel 's editor-in-chief , wrote in a joint statement .
" we want to help to correct this mistake .
linguistic development is an evolutionary process , as history has shown .
orthography should follow these changes and not prescribe them . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian wulff christian wulff -lrb- photo -rrb- , the christian democratic -lrb- cdu -rrb- premier of the german state of lower saxony , welcomed the decision . " this nonsensical reform can not be kept alive any longer , " said wulff , who re-ignited the debate a few weeks ago by calling for a reversal of the reform .
he added that he would try to get a majority of state premiers to support him at their next meeting in october .
several cdu premiers have already said they back the idea . a death blow ? others said they did n't believe the reform could survive with several of the country 's major publishers opposing it . " i ca n't imagine that the new spelling will survive now , " said hendrik zörner , the spokesman for the german journalists ' association , adding that his organization remained neutral on the issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spiegel and springer publications at a newsstand the two companies say they reach about 60 percent of the german population through their publications , which include mass-circulation tabloid bild and die welt newspaper -lrb- springer -rrb- and der spiegel newsmagazine -lrb- spiegel -rrb- . following their announcement , other media companies jumped on the band wagon .
officials for süddeutsche zeitung also said they would drop the new spelling .
bauer publishing company , which puts out tv guides and other popular magazines , also indicated they would follow suit .
germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper already switched back to the old spelling in 2000 . peter voss , the director-general of german public broadcaster swr , supported the reversal as well .
he added that his organization was debating doing the same and that he planned to bring up the issue with his colleagues within the national network of public broadcasters , ard .
deutsche welle is part of that organization . reform backers fight back supporters of the reform criticized the move , saying that it was the publishers who were causing uncertainty among germans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : backers of the reform say a reversal would cost hundreds of millions of euros to rewrite dictionaries and text books in a written statement , officials for the conference of german culture ministers , the government body that initiated the reforms , said media companies had so far supported the change .
they added that a new spelling council established to monitor linguistic development and fine-tune the reforms had been established in june . officials at burda publishing company , which includes focus newsmagazine , said they did not want to confuse people and would stick to the reform .
but they added that this should not be seen as a " commitment to the spelling reform . " media organizations in austria and switzerland , where the new spelling was also introduced , said they had no plans to follow their german colleagues , according to news reports . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german spelling debate reignites german spelling is once again at the center of political debate , despite the fact that an across-the-board reform went into effect six years ago .

given the threat of terrorism , the investment in precaution is understandable . nato has begun operation " distinguished games " - the first time the organization has played such a support role for a civilian event .
its operations include an intensive surveillance of the airspace over greece , with around 10 airborne early warning aircraft -lrb- awacs -rrb- taking it in shifts to circle over the eastern mediterranean , searching for passenger planes or other aircraft that could be seized by terrorists .
should the flying radar stations find a suspicious aircraft , the nato command center in larissa can send fighter jets from greece or other nato member states into the sky .

test runs have shown that a crisis committee could give the green light for a launch within 20 minutes at the most .

" we will be forward-deploying elements of a chemical , biological , radiological and nuclear defense battalion , which will be there to help defend against any attack using weapons of mass destruction , " appathurai said .
the 200 nato troops do not constitute a fighting force , and while security is the top priority , appathurai is optimistic that the games will pass without incident .
" we 're quite confident that the greek authorities have done everything humanly possible to provide for security , and we do n't have any specific reason to believe there 'll be a major attack at the olympics , " appathurai said .

rejecting a six-year-old spelling reform , several publishing companies have announced they would switch back to the old system .
the move comes shortly after leading conservative politicians had proposed a reversal . officials for axel springer and spiegel publishing companies said friday they planned to revert to the old spelling " as quickly as possible " in their print and online publications and called on other german media organizations to do so as well . the two leading publishers justified the decision by saying that the new rules were lacking acceptance and germans were increasingly uncertain about writing in their own language .
the new rules , aimed at ironing out quirks in spelling and punctuation , were first introduced in schools in 1998 and are scheduled to completely replace the old spelling by aug .
2005 . " the spelling reform is not a reform , but a step backwards , " springer ceo mathias döpfner and stefan aust , spiegel 's editor-in-chief , wrote in a joint statement .
" we want to help to correct this mistake .

" this nonsensical reform can not be kept alive any longer , " said wulff , who re-ignited the debate a few weeks ago by calling for a reversal of the reform .
he added that he would try to get a majority of state premiers to support him at their next meeting in october .
several cdu premiers have already said they back the idea . a death blow ? others said they did n't believe the reform could survive with several of the country 's major publishers opposing it . " i ca n't imagine that the new spelling will survive now , " said hendrik zörner , the spokesman for the german journalists ' association , adding that his organization remained neutral on the issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spiegel and springer publications at a newsstand the two companies say they reach about 60 percent of the german population through their publications , which include mass-circulation tabloid bild and die welt newspaper -lrb- springer -rrb- and der spiegel newsmagazine -lrb- spiegel -rrb- . following their announcement , other media companies jumped on the band wagon .

they added that a new spelling council established to monitor linguistic development and fine-tune the reforms had been established in june . officials at burda publishing company , which includes focus newsmagazine , said they did not want to confuse people and would stick to the reform .

rejecting a six-year-old spelling reform , several publishing companies have announced they would switch back to the old system .
the move comes shortly after leading conservative politicians had proposed a reversal . officials for axel springer and spiegel publishing companies said friday they planned to revert to the old spelling " as quickly as possible " in their print and online publications and called on other german media organizations to do so as well . the two leading publishers justified the decision by saying that the new rules were lacking acceptance and germans were increasingly uncertain about writing in their own language .
the new rules , aimed at ironing out quirks in spelling and punctuation , were first introduced in schools in 1998 and are scheduled to completely replace the old spelling by aug .
2005 . " the spelling reform is not a reform , but a step backwards , " springer ceo mathias döpfner and stefan aust , spiegel 's editor-in-chief , wrote in a joint statement .
" we want to help to correct this mistake .
linguistic development is an evolutionary process , as history has shown .
orthography should follow these changes and not prescribe them . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian wulff christian wulff -lrb- photo -rrb- , the christian democratic -lrb- cdu -rrb- premier of the german state of lower saxony , welcomed the decision . " this nonsensical reform can not be kept alive any longer , " said wulff , who re-ignited the debate a few weeks ago by calling for a reversal of the reform .
he added that he would try to get a majority of state premiers to support him at their next meeting in october .
several cdu premiers have already said they back the idea . a death blow ? others said they did n't believe the reform could survive with several of the country 's major publishers opposing it . " i ca n't imagine that the new spelling will survive now , " said hendrik zörner , the spokesman for the german journalists ' association , adding that his organization remained neutral on the issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spiegel and springer publications at a newsstand the two companies say they reach about 60 percent of the german population through their publications , which include mass-circulation tabloid bild and die welt newspaper -lrb- springer -rrb- and der spiegel newsmagazine -lrb- spiegel -rrb- . following their announcement , other media companies jumped on the band wagon .
officials for süddeutsche zeitung also said they would drop the new spelling .
bauer publishing company , which puts out tv guides and other popular magazines , also indicated they would follow suit .
germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper already switched back to the old spelling in 2000 . peter voss , the director-general of german public broadcaster swr , supported the reversal as well .
he added that his organization was debating doing the same and that he planned to bring up the issue with his colleagues within the national network of public broadcasters , ard .

rejecting a six-year-old spelling reform , several publishing companies have announced they would switch back to the old system .
the move comes shortly after leading conservative politicians had proposed a reversal . officials for axel springer and spiegel publishing companies said friday they planned to revert to the old spelling " as quickly as possible " in their print and online publications and called on other german media organizations to do so as well . the two leading publishers justified the decision by saying that the new rules were lacking acceptance and germans were increasingly uncertain about writing in their own language .
the new rules , aimed at ironing out quirks in spelling and punctuation , were first introduced in schools in 1998 and are scheduled to completely replace the old spelling by aug .
2005 . " the spelling reform is not a reform , but a step backwards , " springer ceo mathias döpfner and stefan aust , spiegel 's editor-in-chief , wrote in a joint statement .

given the threat of terrorism , the investment in precaution is understandable . nato has begun operation " distinguished games " - the first time the organization has played such a support role for a civilian event .
its operations include an intensive surveillance of the airspace over greece , with around 10 airborne early warning aircraft -lrb- awacs -rrb- taking it in shifts to circle over the eastern mediterranean , searching for passenger planes or other aircraft that could be seized by terrorists .
should the flying radar stations find a suspicious aircraft , the nato command center in larissa can send fighter jets from greece or other nato member states into the sky .
patriot anti-aircraft missiles are also deployed around athens .
if a warning is ignored , shots may be fired - but only if the greek government gives the command .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the greek navy patrols the coast , here near the greek island of hydra , southwest of athens .
" nato wo n't be taking action in response to any kind of a contingency , " said nato spokesman james appathurai .
" if our planes detect something , they 'll inform the greek authorities and it 'll be for them to decide what to do and to do it , but not for nato . "
test runs have shown that a crisis committee could give the green light for a launch within 20 minutes at the most .
around 12 nato patrol boats and 35 boats belonging to the greek navy are cruising along the coast to protect the olympic sports arenas from attack by ship .
anti-terror troops on hand a nato " anti-terror batallion " is stationed in the bathing resort of halkida , 90 kilometers northeast of athens .
this will be the starting place for troops from belgium , the czech republic , hungary , italy , poland and spain should there be a poison gas attack or some similar catastrophe .
" we will be forward-deploying elements of a chemical , biological , radiological and nuclear defense battalion , which will be there to help defend against any attack using weapons of mass destruction , " appathurai said .
the 200 nato troops do not constitute a fighting force , and while security is the top priority , appathurai is optimistic that the games will pass without incident .
" we 're quite confident that the greek authorities have done everything humanly possible to provide for security , and we do n't have any specific reason to believe there 'll be a major attack at the olympics , " appathurai said .
" but you always have to be prepared . "
new spending record greece has invested € 1.2 billion in security measures for the olympic games - four times the amount spent in sydney in 2000 .
a blimp is circling above athens that can listen in on telephone conversations and detect chemicals .
every movement in the city is being observed by more than 1500 surveillance cameras .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a police officer stands in front of a us-swiss airship fitted with cameras and sensors to provide security at olympics .
greek prime minister kostas karamanlis is reportedly proud of this total surveillance but there 's also been heavy criticism of the measures .
many athenians are concerned that their civil liberties are being threatened .
the international olympic committee though , says it expected nothing less .
" the security measures wo n't affect the mood of the games , they are necessary , " said ioc president jacques rogge .
" i commend the greek government for having done everything possible .

both men , now in their 70 's stood accused of accessory to manslaughter for their involvement in issuing " shoot-to-kill " orders along the berlin wall and the former inner-german border .
the judges in the berlin regional court considered the two officials for the former east german state as " primary " decision-makers in the communist chain of command that ultimately led to three deaths at the berlin wall between 1986 and 1989 .
the court thus handed down one-year suspended prison sentences to both men .
although lorenz and böhme alleged they had never directly ordered or oversaw any shootings at the wall , they were nonetheless found guilty for failing to prevent or revoke the order to kill illegal border crossers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : remembering those who died in search of freedom crossing the berlin wall - here on aug .
13 , 2003 - the 42nd anniversary of the wall .
the defendants ' argument that border shootings were lawful in east germany at the time and that they were simply following command , failed to persuade the judges .
the nuremberg trials against nazi leaders after world war ii already established the legal precedent to which germany abides , namely that under international law , those who order or assist in killings can not be protected by national legislation .
last in a line of proceedings the case against lorenz and böhme marks the end in a long line of proceedings against former east german officials and their involvement in crimes committed prior to unification in 1990 .
looking back on past trials , marianne birthler -lrb- photo -rrb- , the head of the state-run agency responsible for analyzing archived stasi material , said there is a lot to be learned .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler " the trials we 've witnessed over the past years have been an important contribution towards coming to terms with our own history , " said the woman who governs over reams of archives compiled by east german state police .
" it 's the travel season now , and thousands of germans cross the former inner-german border just like that .
to think that some 15 years ago this would have been totally impossible for us easterners , " she added .
" you must not forget that the wall was nothing less than a big prison for millions of people over so many years .
this alone was a huge crime ! "
partial victory for justice during the 40-year history of east germany , close to 1,000 people were shot at the berlin wall or along the inner-german border while trying to flee to the west .
legal proceedings against senior east german government members started in 1992 , when former head of state erich honecker had to stand trial .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former east german head of state and party leader , egon krenz was released from prison on dec .
18 , 2003 , after serving just 4 years for involvement in state shootings .
but death or infirmity has caught up with most officials before the courts could bring them to justice .
honecker , for example , died in 1994 while in exile in chile .
and east germany 's last leader , egon krenz -lrb- photo -rrb- , was handed down a six and a half year prison sentence for manslaughter , of which he only had to serve four years before being released early in dec .
2003 .
birthler stressed that a lot has been done to make sure justice was carried out with regard to the wall shootings .
" in other areas , the judicial system in unified germany has failed completely , " she lamented , referring to the case of erich mielke , the head of the dreaded stasi secret police .
" he was convicted of killing two policemen during the weimar republic .
but he did n't have to stand trial because of what he did as the stasi chief , nor did anyone else because of their involvement with the secret police in a dictatorship , " birthler said .
she noted that no fewer than 250,000 political prisoners suffered under the " very rough " treatment of the stasi during interrogation and internment .
" it is simply ridiculous , and a slap in the face of those who suffered from stasi repression , " argued birthler , who herself is from former east germany .
many of the dreaded former stasi prison officers have found a new nice in unified germany as heads of private security firms , she said , regretting that justice had not completely won out . hardy graupner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dissidents angered by the release of east germany 's last leader former east german dissidents criticized the early release of east germany ’ s last head of state .
egon krenz was sentenced to six and a half years for his role in the fatal shootings of people trying to flee the country .

taxation is the choice method . starting in august , young germans looking for an alcoholic kick on a summer night , have to reach a little deeper in their pocket .
a sin tax slapped on mixed drinks sold in cans or bottles is to blame .
instead of the € 2.00 a pop they used to cost , teenage drinkers have to fork out another 80 cents -lrb- about one dollar more -rrb- for their fruit-flavored alcohol .
the german health ministry , which proposed the tax as a means to discourage under-age drinkers from buying the so-called alcopops , hopes the increased price will have an effect not only on the consumers , but also on the manufacturers , who notoriously market the sweet drinks to younger crowds by presenting them as cool and trendy in advertisements .
" we want to give a clear signal that we do not want people under 18 buying them , " said marion caspers-merck , germany 's commissioner for drug policy .
europe-wide health concern germany is not alone in declaring a war on alcopops .
throughout europe , politicians are taking aim at the innocent looking bottles in bright snappy colors with exotic ingredients such as tequila , lime and " organic agave cactus juice . "
with an average alcohol content of 5.5 percent , the drinks have been pinpointed as a major contributor to increased alcohol abuse among teenagers .
alcopops are especially conducive to encouraging underage drinking because their characteristic sweetness masks the bitter taste of alcohol .
young people , who ordinarily would not opt for hard liquor , are now consuming it in greater quantities disguised in fruit-flavored drinks .
doctors in britain have put the blame for the surge in teenage drinking squarely on alcopops .
the british organization alcohol concern has said that alcohol abuse in children and young adults is on the increase .
studies conducted at the royal liverpool children 's hospital has shown that , from 1985 to 1996 , there was a tenfold increase in admissions of children aged nine to 16 under the influence of alcohol .
half of all alcopops consumed by teenagers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rigo , breezer and smirnoff ice are the preferred trendy drinks of youths .
according to an international study by the world health organization , 3.6 percent of 11 year-olds admitted to drinking alcopops regularly .
at age 15 , the figure jumps to almost 15 percent .
in germany , a government report last year said every second alcopop sold was purchased by 14 to 19 year-olds .
but while health officials continue to worry about how the drinks are leading to increased alcoholism among young people , the drink producers are watching their sales climb .
between 2001 and 2002 , the amount of alcopops sold rose from 3 to 13 million liters -lrb- 0.8 to 3.4 million gallons -rrb- .
the biggest markets are germany , france , britain , belgium and denmark .
in germany , sales of rigo and breezer - two popular mixed drinks - account for 56 percent of bicardi deutschland 's turnover .
taxation as prevention austria is the latest country to take preventive action to curb sales of the sugary drinks .
following germany 's example , it too has decided to increase the price of alcopops .
earlier this week , austrian health minister maria rauch-kallat called for firm measures in the form of a tax to act as a disincentive for young people to buy the flavored alcohol .
the country 's treasury will correspondingly decrease taxes on non-alcoholic beverages , she added .
in france , a tax on alcopops was introduced in 1996 and left a serious dent in the market .
last month a new public health low was voted through parliament setting the tax rate at 11 euros per deciliter of pure alcohol in a new public health law voted through parliament last month .
although fewer teens may opt to spend more money for the drinks , not everyone is convinced that the tax is as effective as intended .
the french automobile association - quoting figures of a quarter of drunk-driving accidents committed by people between age 18 and 24 - says a simple health tax is not enough to address the problem .
it says there should be more prevention campaigns focusing on the effects of alcohol .
in germany , though , politicians and health officials are sticking to taxation as a form of discouragement .
" this is an important and sensible step , " said fritz behrens , state interior minister for north rhine-westphalia .
" young people underestimate the dangers of apparently harmless , sweet and trendy-looking drinks . "

throughout europe , politicians are taking aim at the innocent looking bottles in bright snappy colors with exotic ingredients such as tequila , lime and " organic agave cactus juice . "
with an average alcohol content of 5.5 percent , the drinks have been pinpointed as a major contributor to increased alcohol abuse among teenagers .
alcopops are especially conducive to encouraging underage drinking because their characteristic sweetness masks the bitter taste of alcohol .
young people , who ordinarily would not opt for hard liquor , are now consuming it in greater quantities disguised in fruit-flavored drinks .
doctors in britain have put the blame for the surge in teenage drinking squarely on alcopops .
the british organization alcohol concern has said that alcohol abuse in children and young adults is on the increase .
studies conducted at the royal liverpool children 's hospital has shown that , from 1985 to 1996 , there was a tenfold increase in admissions of children aged nine to 16 under the influence of alcohol .
half of all alcopops consumed by teenagers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rigo , breezer and smirnoff ice are the preferred trendy drinks of youths .
according to an international study by the world health organization , 3.6 percent of 11 year-olds admitted to drinking alcopops regularly .
at age 15 , the figure jumps to almost 15 percent .
in germany , a government report last year said every second alcopop sold was purchased by 14 to 19 year-olds .
but while health officials continue to worry about how the drinks are leading to increased alcoholism among young people , the drink producers are watching their sales climb .
between 2001 and 2002 , the amount of alcopops sold rose from 3 to 13 million liters -lrb- 0.8 to 3.4 million gallons -rrb- .
the biggest markets are germany , france , britain , belgium and denmark .
in germany , sales of rigo and breezer - two popular mixed drinks - account for 56 percent of bicardi deutschland 's turnover .
taxation as prevention austria is the latest country to take preventive action to curb sales of the sugary drinks .
following germany 's example , it too has decided to increase the price of alcopops .
earlier this week , austrian health minister maria rauch-kallat called for firm measures in the form of a tax to act as a disincentive for young people to buy the flavored alcohol .
the country 's treasury will correspondingly decrease taxes on non-alcoholic beverages , she added .
in france , a tax on alcopops was introduced in 1996 and left a serious dent in the market .
last month a new public health low was voted through parliament setting the tax rate at 11 euros per deciliter of pure alcohol in a new public health law voted through parliament last month .
although fewer teens may opt to spend more money for the drinks , not everyone is convinced that the tax is as effective as intended .
the french automobile association - quoting figures of a quarter of drunk-driving accidents committed by people between age 18 and 24 - says a simple health tax is not enough to address the problem .
it says there should be more prevention campaigns focusing on the effects of alcohol .
in germany , though , politicians and health officials are sticking to taxation as a form of discouragement .
" this is an important and sensible step , " said fritz behrens , state interior minister for north rhine-westphalia .

taxation is the choice method . starting in august , young germans looking for an alcoholic kick on a summer night , have to reach a little deeper in their pocket .
a sin tax slapped on mixed drinks sold in cans or bottles is to blame .
instead of the € 2.00 a pop they used to cost , teenage drinkers have to fork out another 80 cents -lrb- about one dollar more -rrb- for their fruit-flavored alcohol .
the german health ministry , which proposed the tax as a means to discourage under-age drinkers from buying the so-called alcopops , hopes the increased price will have an effect not only on the consumers , but also on the manufacturers , who notoriously market the sweet drinks to younger crowds by presenting them as cool and trendy in advertisements .
" we want to give a clear signal that we do not want people under 18 buying them , " said marion caspers-merck , germany 's commissioner for drug policy .
europe-wide health concern germany is not alone in declaring a war on alcopops .
throughout europe , politicians are taking aim at the innocent looking bottles in bright snappy colors with exotic ingredients such as tequila , lime and " organic agave cactus juice . "
with an average alcohol content of 5.5 percent , the drinks have been pinpointed as a major contributor to increased alcohol abuse among teenagers .
alcopops are especially conducive to encouraging underage drinking because their characteristic sweetness masks the bitter taste of alcohol .
young people , who ordinarily would not opt for hard liquor , are now consuming it in greater quantities disguised in fruit-flavored drinks .
doctors in britain have put the blame for the surge in teenage drinking squarely on alcopops .
the british organization alcohol concern has said that alcohol abuse in children and young adults is on the increase .
studies conducted at the royal liverpool children 's hospital has shown that , from 1985 to 1996 , there was a tenfold increase in admissions of children aged nine to 16 under the influence of alcohol .
half of all alcopops consumed by teenagers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rigo , breezer and smirnoff ice are the preferred trendy drinks of youths .
according to an international study by the world health organization , 3.6 percent of 11 year-olds admitted to drinking alcopops regularly .
at age 15 , the figure jumps to almost 15 percent .
in germany , a government report last year said every second alcopop sold was purchased by 14 to 19 year-olds .
but while health officials continue to worry about how the drinks are leading to increased alcoholism among young people , the drink producers are watching their sales climb .
between 2001 and 2002 , the amount of alcopops sold rose from 3 to 13 million liters -lrb- 0.8 to 3.4 million gallons -rrb- .
the biggest markets are germany , france , britain , belgium and denmark .
in germany , sales of rigo and breezer - two popular mixed drinks - account for 56 percent of bicardi deutschland 's turnover .
taxation as prevention austria is the latest country to take preventive action to curb sales of the sugary drinks .
following germany 's example , it too has decided to increase the price of alcopops .
earlier this week , austrian health minister maria rauch-kallat called for firm measures in the form of a tax to act as a disincentive for young people to buy the flavored alcohol .
the country 's treasury will correspondingly decrease taxes on non-alcoholic beverages , she added .
in france , a tax on alcopops was introduced in 1996 and left a serious dent in the market .
last month a new public health low was voted through parliament setting the tax rate at 11 euros per deciliter of pure alcohol in a new public health law voted through parliament last month .
although fewer teens may opt to spend more money for the drinks , not everyone is convinced that the tax is as effective as intended .
the french automobile association - quoting figures of a quarter of drunk-driving accidents committed by people between age 18 and 24 - says a simple health tax is not enough to address the problem .
it says there should be more prevention campaigns focusing on the effects of alcohol .
in germany , though , politicians and health officials are sticking to taxation as a form of discouragement .
" this is an important and sensible step , " said fritz behrens , state interior minister for north rhine-westphalia .

both men , now in their 70 's stood accused of accessory to manslaughter for their involvement in issuing " shoot-to-kill " orders along the berlin wall and the former inner-german border .
the judges in the berlin regional court considered the two officials for the former east german state as " primary " decision-makers in the communist chain of command that ultimately led to three deaths at the berlin wall between 1986 and 1989 .
the court thus handed down one-year suspended prison sentences to both men .
although lorenz and böhme alleged they had never directly ordered or oversaw any shootings at the wall , they were nonetheless found guilty for failing to prevent or revoke the order to kill illegal border crossers .

13 , 2003 - the 42nd anniversary of the wall .
the defendants ' argument that border shootings were lawful in east germany at the time and that they were simply following command , failed to persuade the judges .
the nuremberg trials against nazi leaders after world war ii already established the legal precedent to which germany abides , namely that under international law , those who order or assist in killings can not be protected by national legislation .
last in a line of proceedings the case against lorenz and böhme marks the end in a long line of proceedings against former east german officials and their involvement in crimes committed prior to unification in 1990 .
looking back on past trials , marianne birthler -lrb- photo -rrb- , the head of the state-run agency responsible for analyzing archived stasi material , said there is a lot to be learned .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler " the trials we 've witnessed over the past years have been an important contribution towards coming to terms with our own history , " said the woman who governs over reams of archives compiled by east german state police .
" it 's the travel season now , and thousands of germans cross the former inner-german border just like that .
to think that some 15 years ago this would have been totally impossible for us easterners , " she added .
" you must not forget that the wall was nothing less than a big prison for millions of people over so many years .
this alone was a huge crime ! "
partial victory for justice during the 40-year history of east germany , close to 1,000 people were shot at the berlin wall or along the inner-german border while trying to flee to the west .
legal proceedings against senior east german government members started in 1992 , when former head of state erich honecker had to stand trial .

18 , 2003 , after serving just 4 years for involvement in state shootings .
but death or infirmity has caught up with most officials before the courts could bring them to justice .
honecker , for example , died in 1994 while in exile in chile .
and east germany 's last leader , egon krenz -lrb- photo -rrb- , was handed down a six and a half year prison sentence for manslaughter , of which he only had to serve four years before being released early in dec .
2003 .
birthler stressed that a lot has been done to make sure justice was carried out with regard to the wall shootings .
" in other areas , the judicial system in unified germany has failed completely , " she lamented , referring to the case of erich mielke , the head of the dreaded stasi secret police .
" he was convicted of killing two policemen during the weimar republic .
but he did n't have to stand trial because of what he did as the stasi chief , nor did anyone else because of their involvement with the secret police in a dictatorship , " birthler said .
she noted that no fewer than 250,000 political prisoners suffered under the " very rough " treatment of the stasi during interrogation and internment .
" it is simply ridiculous , and a slap in the face of those who suffered from stasi repression , " argued birthler , who herself is from former east germany .

" you must not forget that the wall was nothing less than a big prison for millions of people over so many years .

partial victory for justice during the 40-year history of east germany , close to 1,000 people were shot at the berlin wall or along the inner-german border while trying to flee to the west .

both men , now in their 70 's stood accused of accessory to manslaughter for their involvement in issuing " shoot-to-kill " orders along the berlin wall and the former inner-german border .
the judges in the berlin regional court considered the two officials for the former east german state as " primary " decision-makers in the communist chain of command that ultimately led to three deaths at the berlin wall between 1986 and 1989 .
the court thus handed down one-year suspended prison sentences to both men .
although lorenz and böhme alleged they had never directly ordered or oversaw any shootings at the wall , they were nonetheless found guilty for failing to prevent or revoke the order to kill illegal border crossers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : remembering those who died in search of freedom crossing the berlin wall - here on aug .
13 , 2003 - the 42nd anniversary of the wall .
the defendants ' argument that border shootings were lawful in east germany at the time and that they were simply following command , failed to persuade the judges .
the nuremberg trials against nazi leaders after world war ii already established the legal precedent to which germany abides , namely that under international law , those who order or assist in killings can not be protected by national legislation .
last in a line of proceedings the case against lorenz and böhme marks the end in a long line of proceedings against former east german officials and their involvement in crimes committed prior to unification in 1990 .
looking back on past trials , marianne birthler -lrb- photo -rrb- , the head of the state-run agency responsible for analyzing archived stasi material , said there is a lot to be learned .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler " the trials we 've witnessed over the past years have been an important contribution towards coming to terms with our own history , " said the woman who governs over reams of archives compiled by east german state police .
" it 's the travel season now , and thousands of germans cross the former inner-german border just like that .
to think that some 15 years ago this would have been totally impossible for us easterners , " she added .
" you must not forget that the wall was nothing less than a big prison for millions of people over so many years .
this alone was a huge crime ! "
partial victory for justice during the 40-year history of east germany , close to 1,000 people were shot at the berlin wall or along the inner-german border while trying to flee to the west .
legal proceedings against senior east german government members started in 1992 , when former head of state erich honecker had to stand trial .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former east german head of state and party leader , egon krenz was released from prison on dec .
18 , 2003 , after serving just 4 years for involvement in state shootings .
but death or infirmity has caught up with most officials before the courts could bring them to justice .
honecker , for example , died in 1994 while in exile in chile .
and east germany 's last leader , egon krenz -lrb- photo -rrb- , was handed down a six and a half year prison sentence for manslaughter , of which he only had to serve four years before being released early in dec .
2003 .
birthler stressed that a lot has been done to make sure justice was carried out with regard to the wall shootings .
" in other areas , the judicial system in unified germany has failed completely , " she lamented , referring to the case of erich mielke , the head of the dreaded stasi secret police .
" he was convicted of killing two policemen during the weimar republic .
but he did n't have to stand trial because of what he did as the stasi chief , nor did anyone else because of their involvement with the secret police in a dictatorship , " birthler said .
she noted that no fewer than 250,000 political prisoners suffered under the " very rough " treatment of the stasi during interrogation and internment .
" it is simply ridiculous , and a slap in the face of those who suffered from stasi repression , " argued birthler , who herself is from former east germany .
many of the dreaded former stasi prison officers have found a new nice in unified germany as heads of private security firms , she said , regretting that justice had not completely won out . hardy graupner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dissidents angered by the release of east germany 's last leader former east german dissidents criticized the early release of east germany ’ s last head of state .
egon krenz was sentenced to six and a half years for his role in the fatal shootings of people trying to flee the country .

given the threat of terrorism , the investment in precaution is understandable . nato has begun operation " distinguished games " - the first time the organization has played such a support role for a civilian event .
its operations include an intensive surveillance of the airspace over greece , with around 10 airborne early warning aircraft -lrb- awacs -rrb- taking it in shifts to circle over the eastern mediterranean , searching for passenger planes or other aircraft that could be seized by terrorists .
should the flying radar stations find a suspicious aircraft , the nato command center in larissa can send fighter jets from greece or other nato member states into the sky .

the 200 nato troops do not constitute a fighting force , and while security is the top priority , appathurai is optimistic that the games will pass without incident .
" we 're quite confident that the greek authorities have done everything humanly possible to provide for security , and we do n't have any specific reason to believe there 'll be a major attack at the olympics , " appathurai said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 07.08.2004 europe takes on alcopops großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nearly half of all alcopops sold are consumed by teenagers in an attempt to tackle teenage alcohol consumption , european politicians are targeting alcopops , the trendy fruit-flavored alcoholic beverages preferred by young drinkers .
taxation is the choice method . starting in august , young germans looking for an alcoholic kick on a summer night , have to reach a little deeper in their pocket .
a sin tax slapped on mixed drinks sold in cans or bottles is to blame .
instead of the € 2.00 a pop they used to cost , teenage drinkers have to fork out another 80 cents -lrb- about one dollar more -rrb- for their fruit-flavored alcohol .
the german health ministry , which proposed the tax as a means to discourage under-age drinkers from buying the so-called alcopops , hopes the increased price will have an effect not only on the consumers , but also on the manufacturers , who notoriously market the sweet drinks to younger crowds by presenting them as cool and trendy in advertisements .
" we want to give a clear signal that we do not want people under 18 buying them , " said marion caspers-merck , germany 's commissioner for drug policy .
europe-wide health concern germany is not alone in declaring a war on alcopops .
throughout europe , politicians are taking aim at the innocent looking bottles in bright snappy colors with exotic ingredients such as tequila , lime and " organic agave cactus juice . "
with an average alcohol content of 5.5 percent , the drinks have been pinpointed as a major contributor to increased alcohol abuse among teenagers .
alcopops are especially conducive to encouraging underage drinking because their characteristic sweetness masks the bitter taste of alcohol .
young people , who ordinarily would not opt for hard liquor , are now consuming it in greater quantities disguised in fruit-flavored drinks .
doctors in britain have put the blame for the surge in teenage drinking squarely on alcopops .
the british organization alcohol concern has said that alcohol abuse in children and young adults is on the increase .
studies conducted at the royal liverpool children 's hospital has shown that , from 1985 to 1996 , there was a tenfold increase in admissions of children aged nine to 16 under the influence of alcohol .
half of all alcopops consumed by teenagers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rigo , breezer and smirnoff ice are the preferred trendy drinks of youths .
according to an international study by the world health organization , 3.6 percent of 11 year-olds admitted to drinking alcopops regularly .
at age 15 , the figure jumps to almost 15 percent .
in germany , a government report last year said every second alcopop sold was purchased by 14 to 19 year-olds .
but while health officials continue to worry about how the drinks are leading to increased alcoholism among young people , the drink producers are watching their sales climb .
between 2001 and 2002 , the amount of alcopops sold rose from 3 to 13 million liters -lrb- 0.8 to 3.4 million gallons -rrb- .
the biggest markets are germany , france , britain , belgium and denmark .
in germany , sales of rigo and breezer - two popular mixed drinks - account for 56 percent of bicardi deutschland 's turnover .
taxation as prevention austria is the latest country to take preventive action to curb sales of the sugary drinks .
following germany 's example , it too has decided to increase the price of alcopops .
earlier this week , austrian health minister maria rauch-kallat called for firm measures in the form of a tax to act as a disincentive for young people to buy the flavored alcohol .
the country 's treasury will correspondingly decrease taxes on non-alcoholic beverages , she added .
in france , a tax on alcopops was introduced in 1996 and left a serious dent in the market .
last month a new public health low was voted through parliament setting the tax rate at 11 euros per deciliter of pure alcohol in a new public health law voted through parliament last month .
although fewer teens may opt to spend more money for the drinks , not everyone is convinced that the tax is as effective as intended .
the french automobile association - quoting figures of a quarter of drunk-driving accidents committed by people between age 18 and 24 - says a simple health tax is not enough to address the problem .
it says there should be more prevention campaigns focusing on the effects of alcohol .
in germany , though , politicians and health officials are sticking to taxation as a form of discouragement .
" this is an important and sensible step , " said fritz behrens , state interior minister for north rhine-westphalia .
" young people underestimate the dangers of apparently harmless , sweet and trendy-looking drinks . "
the five million euros garnered from the tax by the end of this year will be put towards developing preventive measures against alcoholism . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de taking aim at alcopops the days when thrill-seeking teenagers had to raid their parents ' drinks cabinet are long over .

both men , now in their 70 's stood accused of accessory to manslaughter for their involvement in issuing " shoot-to-kill " orders along the berlin wall and the former inner-german border .
the judges in the berlin regional court considered the two officials for the former east german state as " primary " decision-makers in the communist chain of command that ultimately led to three deaths at the berlin wall between 1986 and 1989 .
the court thus handed down one-year suspended prison sentences to both men .
although lorenz and böhme alleged they had never directly ordered or oversaw any shootings at the wall , they were nonetheless found guilty for failing to prevent or revoke the order to kill illegal border crossers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : remembering those who died in search of freedom crossing the berlin wall - here on aug .
13 , 2003 - the 42nd anniversary of the wall .
the defendants ' argument that border shootings were lawful in east germany at the time and that they were simply following command , failed to persuade the judges .
the nuremberg trials against nazi leaders after world war ii already established the legal precedent to which germany abides , namely that under international law , those who order or assist in killings can not be protected by national legislation .
last in a line of proceedings the case against lorenz and böhme marks the end in a long line of proceedings against former east german officials and their involvement in crimes committed prior to unification in 1990 .
looking back on past trials , marianne birthler -lrb- photo -rrb- , the head of the state-run agency responsible for analyzing archived stasi material , said there is a lot to be learned .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler " the trials we 've witnessed over the past years have been an important contribution towards coming to terms with our own history , " said the woman who governs over reams of archives compiled by east german state police .
" it 's the travel season now , and thousands of germans cross the former inner-german border just like that .
to think that some 15 years ago this would have been totally impossible for us easterners , " she added .
" you must not forget that the wall was nothing less than a big prison for millions of people over so many years .
this alone was a huge crime ! "
partial victory for justice during the 40-year history of east germany , close to 1,000 people were shot at the berlin wall or along the inner-german border while trying to flee to the west .
legal proceedings against senior east german government members started in 1992 , when former head of state erich honecker had to stand trial .

18 , 2003 , after serving just 4 years for involvement in state shootings .
but death or infirmity has caught up with most officials before the courts could bring them to justice .
honecker , for example , died in 1994 while in exile in chile .
and east germany 's last leader , egon krenz -lrb- photo -rrb- , was handed down a six and a half year prison sentence for manslaughter , of which he only had to serve four years before being released early in dec .
2003 .
birthler stressed that a lot has been done to make sure justice was carried out with regard to the wall shootings .
" in other areas , the judicial system in unified germany has failed completely , " she lamented , referring to the case of erich mielke , the head of the dreaded stasi secret police .
" he was convicted of killing two policemen during the weimar republic .
but he did n't have to stand trial because of what he did as the stasi chief , nor did anyone else because of their involvement with the secret police in a dictatorship , " birthler said .
she noted that no fewer than 250,000 political prisoners suffered under the " very rough " treatment of the stasi during interrogation and internment .
" it is simply ridiculous , and a slap in the face of those who suffered from stasi repression , " argued birthler , who herself is from former east germany .

rejecting a six-year-old spelling reform , several publishing companies have announced they would switch back to the old system .
the move comes shortly after leading conservative politicians had proposed a reversal . officials for axel springer and spiegel publishing companies said friday they planned to revert to the old spelling " as quickly as possible " in their print and online publications and called on other german media organizations to do so as well . the two leading publishers justified the decision by saying that the new rules were lacking acceptance and germans were increasingly uncertain about writing in their own language .
the new rules , aimed at ironing out quirks in spelling and punctuation , were first introduced in schools in 1998 and are scheduled to completely replace the old spelling by aug .
2005 . " the spelling reform is not a reform , but a step backwards , " springer ceo mathias döpfner and stefan aust , spiegel 's editor-in-chief , wrote in a joint statement .
" we want to help to correct this mistake .
linguistic development is an evolutionary process , as history has shown .
orthography should follow these changes and not prescribe them . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian wulff christian wulff -lrb- photo -rrb- , the christian democratic -lrb- cdu -rrb- premier of the german state of lower saxony , welcomed the decision . " this nonsensical reform can not be kept alive any longer , " said wulff , who re-ignited the debate a few weeks ago by calling for a reversal of the reform .
he added that he would try to get a majority of state premiers to support him at their next meeting in october .
several cdu premiers have already said they back the idea . a death blow ? others said they did n't believe the reform could survive with several of the country 's major publishers opposing it . " i ca n't imagine that the new spelling will survive now , " said hendrik zörner , the spokesman for the german journalists ' association , adding that his organization remained neutral on the issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spiegel and springer publications at a newsstand the two companies say they reach about 60 percent of the german population through their publications , which include mass-circulation tabloid bild and die welt newspaper -lrb- springer -rrb- and der spiegel newsmagazine -lrb- spiegel -rrb- . following their announcement , other media companies jumped on the band wagon .
officials for süddeutsche zeitung also said they would drop the new spelling .
bauer publishing company , which puts out tv guides and other popular magazines , also indicated they would follow suit .
germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper already switched back to the old spelling in 2000 . peter voss , the director-general of german public broadcaster swr , supported the reversal as well .
he added that his organization was debating doing the same and that he planned to bring up the issue with his colleagues within the national network of public broadcasters , ard .
deutsche welle is part of that organization . reform backers fight back supporters of the reform criticized the move , saying that it was the publishers who were causing uncertainty among germans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : backers of the reform say a reversal would cost hundreds of millions of euros to rewrite dictionaries and text books in a written statement , officials for the conference of german culture ministers , the government body that initiated the reforms , said media companies had so far supported the change .
they added that a new spelling council established to monitor linguistic development and fine-tune the reforms had been established in june . officials at burda publishing company , which includes focus newsmagazine , said they did not want to confuse people and would stick to the reform .

rejecting a six-year-old spelling reform , several publishing companies have announced they would switch back to the old system .
the move comes shortly after leading conservative politicians had proposed a reversal . officials for axel springer and spiegel publishing companies said friday they planned to revert to the old spelling " as quickly as possible " in their print and online publications and called on other german media organizations to do so as well . the two leading publishers justified the decision by saying that the new rules were lacking acceptance and germans were increasingly uncertain about writing in their own language .
the new rules , aimed at ironing out quirks in spelling and punctuation , were first introduced in schools in 1998 and are scheduled to completely replace the old spelling by aug .
2005 . " the spelling reform is not a reform , but a step backwards , " springer ceo mathias döpfner and stefan aust , spiegel 's editor-in-chief , wrote in a joint statement .

he added that he would try to get a majority of state premiers to support him at their next meeting in october .
several cdu premiers have already said they back the idea . a death blow ? others said they did n't believe the reform could survive with several of the country 's major publishers opposing it .

germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper already switched back to the old spelling in 2000 . peter voss , the director-general of german public broadcaster swr , supported the reversal as well .
he added that his organization was debating doing the same and that he planned to bring up the issue with his colleagues within the national network of public broadcasters , ard .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 07.08.2004 europe takes on alcopops großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nearly half of all alcopops sold are consumed by teenagers in an attempt to tackle teenage alcohol consumption , european politicians are targeting alcopops , the trendy fruit-flavored alcoholic beverages preferred by young drinkers .
taxation is the choice method . starting in august , young germans looking for an alcoholic kick on a summer night , have to reach a little deeper in their pocket .
a sin tax slapped on mixed drinks sold in cans or bottles is to blame .
instead of the € 2.00 a pop they used to cost , teenage drinkers have to fork out another 80 cents -lrb- about one dollar more -rrb- for their fruit-flavored alcohol .
the german health ministry , which proposed the tax as a means to discourage under-age drinkers from buying the so-called alcopops , hopes the increased price will have an effect not only on the consumers , but also on the manufacturers , who notoriously market the sweet drinks to younger crowds by presenting them as cool and trendy in advertisements .
" we want to give a clear signal that we do not want people under 18 buying them , " said marion caspers-merck , germany 's commissioner for drug policy .
europe-wide health concern germany is not alone in declaring a war on alcopops .
throughout europe , politicians are taking aim at the innocent looking bottles in bright snappy colors with exotic ingredients such as tequila , lime and " organic agave cactus juice . "
with an average alcohol content of 5.5 percent , the drinks have been pinpointed as a major contributor to increased alcohol abuse among teenagers .
alcopops are especially conducive to encouraging underage drinking because their characteristic sweetness masks the bitter taste of alcohol .
young people , who ordinarily would not opt for hard liquor , are now consuming it in greater quantities disguised in fruit-flavored drinks .
doctors in britain have put the blame for the surge in teenage drinking squarely on alcopops .
the british organization alcohol concern has said that alcohol abuse in children and young adults is on the increase .
studies conducted at the royal liverpool children 's hospital has shown that , from 1985 to 1996 , there was a tenfold increase in admissions of children aged nine to 16 under the influence of alcohol .
half of all alcopops consumed by teenagers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rigo , breezer and smirnoff ice are the preferred trendy drinks of youths .
according to an international study by the world health organization , 3.6 percent of 11 year-olds admitted to drinking alcopops regularly .
at age 15 , the figure jumps to almost 15 percent .
in germany , a government report last year said every second alcopop sold was purchased by 14 to 19 year-olds .
but while health officials continue to worry about how the drinks are leading to increased alcoholism among young people , the drink producers are watching their sales climb .
between 2001 and 2002 , the amount of alcopops sold rose from 3 to 13 million liters -lrb- 0.8 to 3.4 million gallons -rrb- .
the biggest markets are germany , france , britain , belgium and denmark .
in germany , sales of rigo and breezer - two popular mixed drinks - account for 56 percent of bicardi deutschland 's turnover .
taxation as prevention austria is the latest country to take preventive action to curb sales of the sugary drinks .
following germany 's example , it too has decided to increase the price of alcopops .
earlier this week , austrian health minister maria rauch-kallat called for firm measures in the form of a tax to act as a disincentive for young people to buy the flavored alcohol .
the country 's treasury will correspondingly decrease taxes on non-alcoholic beverages , she added .
in france , a tax on alcopops was introduced in 1996 and left a serious dent in the market .
last month a new public health low was voted through parliament setting the tax rate at 11 euros per deciliter of pure alcohol in a new public health law voted through parliament last month .
although fewer teens may opt to spend more money for the drinks , not everyone is convinced that the tax is as effective as intended .
the french automobile association - quoting figures of a quarter of drunk-driving accidents committed by people between age 18 and 24 - says a simple health tax is not enough to address the problem .
it says there should be more prevention campaigns focusing on the effects of alcohol .
in germany , though , politicians and health officials are sticking to taxation as a form of discouragement .
" this is an important and sensible step , " said fritz behrens , state interior minister for north rhine-westphalia .
" young people underestimate the dangers of apparently harmless , sweet and trendy-looking drinks . "
the five million euros garnered from the tax by the end of this year will be put towards developing preventive measures against alcoholism . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de taking aim at alcopops the days when thrill-seeking teenagers had to raid their parents ' drinks cabinet are long over .

young people , who ordinarily would not opt for hard liquor , are now consuming it in greater quantities disguised in fruit-flavored drinks .
doctors in britain have put the blame for the surge in teenage drinking squarely on alcopops .
the british organization alcohol concern has said that alcohol abuse in children and young adults is on the increase .

according to an international study by the world health organization , 3.6 percent of 11 year-olds admitted to drinking alcopops regularly .
at age 15 , the figure jumps to almost 15 percent .
in germany , a government report last year said every second alcopop sold was purchased by 14 to 19 year-olds .
but while health officials continue to worry about how the drinks are leading to increased alcoholism among young people , the drink producers are watching their sales climb .
between 2001 and 2002 , the amount of alcopops sold rose from 3 to 13 million liters -lrb- 0.8 to 3.4 million gallons -rrb- .
the biggest markets are germany , france , britain , belgium and denmark .

the country 's treasury will correspondingly decrease taxes on non-alcoholic beverages , she added .
in france , a tax on alcopops was introduced in 1996 and left a serious dent in the market .
last month a new public health low was voted through parliament setting the tax rate at 11 euros per deciliter of pure alcohol in a new public health law voted through parliament last month .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 07.08.2004 court issues sentence in berlin wall shootings großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once a death zone , now a popular tourist site some 15 years after unification , a berlin court has given one-year prison sentences to two former east german politburo members , bringing an end to cases against east german leaders involved in the shoot-to-kill policy . sitting in the dock in the last trial involving former east german politburo members were ex-regional communist party heads siegfried lorenz and hans-joachim böhme .
both men , now in their 70 's stood accused of accessory to manslaughter for their involvement in issuing " shoot-to-kill " orders along the berlin wall and the former inner-german border .
the judges in the berlin regional court considered the two officials for the former east german state as " primary " decision-makers in the communist chain of command that ultimately led to three deaths at the berlin wall between 1986 and 1989 .
the court thus handed down one-year suspended prison sentences to both men .
although lorenz and böhme alleged they had never directly ordered or oversaw any shootings at the wall , they were nonetheless found guilty for failing to prevent or revoke the order to kill illegal border crossers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : remembering those who died in search of freedom crossing the berlin wall - here on aug .
13 , 2003 - the 42nd anniversary of the wall .
the defendants ' argument that border shootings were lawful in east germany at the time and that they were simply following command , failed to persuade the judges .
the nuremberg trials against nazi leaders after world war ii already established the legal precedent to which germany abides , namely that under international law , those who order or assist in killings can not be protected by national legislation .
last in a line of proceedings the case against lorenz and böhme marks the end in a long line of proceedings against former east german officials and their involvement in crimes committed prior to unification in 1990 .
looking back on past trials , marianne birthler -lrb- photo -rrb- , the head of the state-run agency responsible for analyzing archived stasi material , said there is a lot to be learned .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler " the trials we 've witnessed over the past years have been an important contribution towards coming to terms with our own history , " said the woman who governs over reams of archives compiled by east german state police .
" it 's the travel season now , and thousands of germans cross the former inner-german border just like that .
to think that some 15 years ago this would have been totally impossible for us easterners , " she added .
" you must not forget that the wall was nothing less than a big prison for millions of people over so many years .
this alone was a huge crime ! "
partial victory for justice during the 40-year history of east germany , close to 1,000 people were shot at the berlin wall or along the inner-german border while trying to flee to the west .
legal proceedings against senior east german government members started in 1992 , when former head of state erich honecker had to stand trial .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former east german head of state and party leader , egon krenz was released from prison on dec .
18 , 2003 , after serving just 4 years for involvement in state shootings .
but death or infirmity has caught up with most officials before the courts could bring them to justice .
honecker , for example , died in 1994 while in exile in chile .
and east germany 's last leader , egon krenz -lrb- photo -rrb- , was handed down a six and a half year prison sentence for manslaughter , of which he only had to serve four years before being released early in dec .
2003 .
birthler stressed that a lot has been done to make sure justice was carried out with regard to the wall shootings .
" in other areas , the judicial system in unified germany has failed completely , " she lamented , referring to the case of erich mielke , the head of the dreaded stasi secret police .
" he was convicted of killing two policemen during the weimar republic .
but he did n't have to stand trial because of what he did as the stasi chief , nor did anyone else because of their involvement with the secret police in a dictatorship , " birthler said .
she noted that no fewer than 250,000 political prisoners suffered under the " very rough " treatment of the stasi during interrogation and internment .
" it is simply ridiculous , and a slap in the face of those who suffered from stasi repression , " argued birthler , who herself is from former east germany .
many of the dreaded former stasi prison officers have found a new nice in unified germany as heads of private security firms , she said , regretting that justice had not completely won out . hardy graupner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dissidents angered by the release of east germany 's last leader former east german dissidents criticized the early release of east germany ’ s last head of state .

both men , now in their 70 's stood accused of accessory to manslaughter for their involvement in issuing " shoot-to-kill " orders along the berlin wall and the former inner-german border .
the judges in the berlin regional court considered the two officials for the former east german state as " primary " decision-makers in the communist chain of command that ultimately led to three deaths at the berlin wall between 1986 and 1989 .
the court thus handed down one-year suspended prison sentences to both men .
although lorenz and böhme alleged they had never directly ordered or oversaw any shootings at the wall , they were nonetheless found guilty for failing to prevent or revoke the order to kill illegal border crossers .

13 , 2003 - the 42nd anniversary of the wall .
the defendants ' argument that border shootings were lawful in east germany at the time and that they were simply following command , failed to persuade the judges .
the nuremberg trials against nazi leaders after world war ii already established the legal precedent to which germany abides , namely that under international law , those who order or assist in killings can not be protected by national legislation .
last in a line of proceedings the case against lorenz and böhme marks the end in a long line of proceedings against former east german officials and their involvement in crimes committed prior to unification in 1990 .
looking back on past trials , marianne birthler -lrb- photo -rrb- , the head of the state-run agency responsible for analyzing archived stasi material , said there is a lot to be learned .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler " the trials we 've witnessed over the past years have been an important contribution towards coming to terms with our own history , " said the woman who governs over reams of archives compiled by east german state police .
" it 's the travel season now , and thousands of germans cross the former inner-german border just like that .
to think that some 15 years ago this would have been totally impossible for us easterners , " she added .
" you must not forget that the wall was nothing less than a big prison for millions of people over so many years .
this alone was a huge crime ! "
partial victory for justice during the 40-year history of east germany , close to 1,000 people were shot at the berlin wall or along the inner-german border while trying to flee to the west .
legal proceedings against senior east german government members started in 1992 , when former head of state erich honecker had to stand trial .

honecker , for example , died in 1994 while in exile in chile .

birthler stressed that a lot has been done to make sure justice was carried out with regard to the wall shootings .
" in other areas , the judicial system in unified germany has failed completely , " she lamented , referring to the case of erich mielke , the head of the dreaded stasi secret police .
" he was convicted of killing two policemen during the weimar republic .
but he did n't have to stand trial because of what he did as the stasi chief , nor did anyone else because of their involvement with the secret police in a dictatorship , " birthler said .
she noted that no fewer than 250,000 political prisoners suffered under the " very rough " treatment of the stasi during interrogation and internment .
" it is simply ridiculous , and a slap in the face of those who suffered from stasi repression , " argued birthler , who herself is from former east germany .

given the threat of terrorism , the investment in precaution is understandable . nato has begun operation " distinguished games " - the first time the organization has played such a support role for a civilian event .
its operations include an intensive surveillance of the airspace over greece , with around 10 airborne early warning aircraft -lrb- awacs -rrb- taking it in shifts to circle over the eastern mediterranean , searching for passenger planes or other aircraft that could be seized by terrorists .
should the flying radar stations find a suspicious aircraft , the nato command center in larissa can send fighter jets from greece or other nato member states into the sky .
patriot anti-aircraft missiles are also deployed around athens .
if a warning is ignored , shots may be fired - but only if the greek government gives the command .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the greek navy patrols the coast , here near the greek island of hydra , southwest of athens .
" nato wo n't be taking action in response to any kind of a contingency , " said nato spokesman james appathurai .

rejecting a six-year-old spelling reform , several publishing companies have announced they would switch back to the old system .
the move comes shortly after leading conservative politicians had proposed a reversal . officials for axel springer and spiegel publishing companies said friday they planned to revert to the old spelling " as quickly as possible " in their print and online publications and called on other german media organizations to do so as well . the two leading publishers justified the decision by saying that the new rules were lacking acceptance and germans were increasingly uncertain about writing in their own language .
the new rules , aimed at ironing out quirks in spelling and punctuation , were first introduced in schools in 1998 and are scheduled to completely replace the old spelling by aug .
2005 . " the spelling reform is not a reform , but a step backwards , " springer ceo mathias döpfner and stefan aust , spiegel 's editor-in-chief , wrote in a joint statement .
" we want to help to correct this mistake .
linguistic development is an evolutionary process , as history has shown .
orthography should follow these changes and not prescribe them . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian wulff christian wulff -lrb- photo -rrb- , the christian democratic -lrb- cdu -rrb- premier of the german state of lower saxony , welcomed the decision . " this nonsensical reform can not be kept alive any longer , " said wulff , who re-ignited the debate a few weeks ago by calling for a reversal of the reform .
he added that he would try to get a majority of state premiers to support him at their next meeting in october .
several cdu premiers have already said they back the idea . a death blow ? others said they did n't believe the reform could survive with several of the country 's major publishers opposing it . " i ca n't imagine that the new spelling will survive now , " said hendrik zörner , the spokesman for the german journalists ' association , adding that his organization remained neutral on the issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spiegel and springer publications at a newsstand the two companies say they reach about 60 percent of the german population through their publications , which include mass-circulation tabloid bild and die welt newspaper -lrb- springer -rrb- and der spiegel newsmagazine -lrb- spiegel -rrb- . following their announcement , other media companies jumped on the band wagon .
officials for süddeutsche zeitung also said they would drop the new spelling .
bauer publishing company , which puts out tv guides and other popular magazines , also indicated they would follow suit .
germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper already switched back to the old spelling in 2000 . peter voss , the director-general of german public broadcaster swr , supported the reversal as well .
he added that his organization was debating doing the same and that he planned to bring up the issue with his colleagues within the national network of public broadcasters , ard .
deutsche welle is part of that organization . reform backers fight back supporters of the reform criticized the move , saying that it was the publishers who were causing uncertainty among germans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : backers of the reform say a reversal would cost hundreds of millions of euros to rewrite dictionaries and text books in a written statement , officials for the conference of german culture ministers , the government body that initiated the reforms , said media companies had so far supported the change .
they added that a new spelling council established to monitor linguistic development and fine-tune the reforms had been established in june . officials at burda publishing company , which includes focus newsmagazine , said they did not want to confuse people and would stick to the reform .
but they added that this should not be seen as a " commitment to the spelling reform . " media organizations in austria and switzerland , where the new spelling was also introduced , said they had no plans to follow their german colleagues , according to news reports . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german spelling debate reignites german spelling is once again at the center of political debate , despite the fact that an across-the-board reform went into effect six years ago .

both men , now in their 70 's stood accused of accessory to manslaughter for their involvement in issuing " shoot-to-kill " orders along the berlin wall and the former inner-german border .
the judges in the berlin regional court considered the two officials for the former east german state as " primary " decision-makers in the communist chain of command that ultimately led to three deaths at the berlin wall between 1986 and 1989 .
the court thus handed down one-year suspended prison sentences to both men .
although lorenz and böhme alleged they had never directly ordered or oversaw any shootings at the wall , they were nonetheless found guilty for failing to prevent or revoke the order to kill illegal border crossers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : remembering those who died in search of freedom crossing the berlin wall - here on aug .
13 , 2003 - the 42nd anniversary of the wall .
the defendants ' argument that border shootings were lawful in east germany at the time and that they were simply following command , failed to persuade the judges .
the nuremberg trials against nazi leaders after world war ii already established the legal precedent to which germany abides , namely that under international law , those who order or assist in killings can not be protected by national legislation .
last in a line of proceedings the case against lorenz and böhme marks the end in a long line of proceedings against former east german officials and their involvement in crimes committed prior to unification in 1990 .
looking back on past trials , marianne birthler -lrb- photo -rrb- , the head of the state-run agency responsible for analyzing archived stasi material , said there is a lot to be learned .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler " the trials we 've witnessed over the past years have been an important contribution towards coming to terms with our own history , " said the woman who governs over reams of archives compiled by east german state police .
" it 's the travel season now , and thousands of germans cross the former inner-german border just like that .
to think that some 15 years ago this would have been totally impossible for us easterners , " she added .
" you must not forget that the wall was nothing less than a big prison for millions of people over so many years .
this alone was a huge crime ! "
partial victory for justice during the 40-year history of east germany , close to 1,000 people were shot at the berlin wall or along the inner-german border while trying to flee to the west .
legal proceedings against senior east german government members started in 1992 , when former head of state erich honecker had to stand trial .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former east german head of state and party leader , egon krenz was released from prison on dec .
18 , 2003 , after serving just 4 years for involvement in state shootings .
but death or infirmity has caught up with most officials before the courts could bring them to justice .
honecker , for example , died in 1994 while in exile in chile .
and east germany 's last leader , egon krenz -lrb- photo -rrb- , was handed down a six and a half year prison sentence for manslaughter , of which he only had to serve four years before being released early in dec .
2003 .
birthler stressed that a lot has been done to make sure justice was carried out with regard to the wall shootings .
" in other areas , the judicial system in unified germany has failed completely , " she lamented , referring to the case of erich mielke , the head of the dreaded stasi secret police .
" he was convicted of killing two policemen during the weimar republic .
but he did n't have to stand trial because of what he did as the stasi chief , nor did anyone else because of their involvement with the secret police in a dictatorship , " birthler said .
she noted that no fewer than 250,000 political prisoners suffered under the " very rough " treatment of the stasi during interrogation and internment .
" it is simply ridiculous , and a slap in the face of those who suffered from stasi repression , " argued birthler , who herself is from former east germany .
many of the dreaded former stasi prison officers have found a new nice in unified germany as heads of private security firms , she said , regretting that justice had not completely won out . hardy graupner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dissidents angered by the release of east germany 's last leader former east german dissidents criticized the early release of east germany ’ s last head of state .

partial victory for justice during the 40-year history of east germany , close to 1,000 people were shot at the berlin wall or along the inner-german border while trying to flee to the west .
legal proceedings against senior east german government members started in 1992 , when former head of state erich honecker had to stand trial .

18 , 2003 , after serving just 4 years for involvement in state shootings .
but death or infirmity has caught up with most officials before the courts could bring them to justice .
honecker , for example , died in 1994 while in exile in chile .
and east germany 's last leader , egon krenz -lrb- photo -rrb- , was handed down a six and a half year prison sentence for manslaughter , of which he only had to serve four years before being released early in dec .
2003 .
birthler stressed that a lot has been done to make sure justice was carried out with regard to the wall shootings .
" in other areas , the judicial system in unified germany has failed completely , " she lamented , referring to the case of erich mielke , the head of the dreaded stasi secret police .
" he was convicted of killing two policemen during the weimar republic .
but he did n't have to stand trial because of what he did as the stasi chief , nor did anyone else because of their involvement with the secret police in a dictatorship , " birthler said .
she noted that no fewer than 250,000 political prisoners suffered under the " very rough " treatment of the stasi during interrogation and internment .
" it is simply ridiculous , and a slap in the face of those who suffered from stasi repression , " argued birthler , who herself is from former east germany .
many of the dreaded former stasi prison officers have found a new nice in unified germany as heads of private security firms , she said , regretting that justice had not completely won out . hardy graupner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dissidents angered by the release of east germany 's last leader former east german dissidents criticized the early release of east germany ’ s last head of state .

rejecting a six-year-old spelling reform , several publishing companies have announced they would switch back to the old system .
the move comes shortly after leading conservative politicians had proposed a reversal . officials for axel springer and spiegel publishing companies said friday they planned to revert to the old spelling " as quickly as possible " in their print and online publications and called on other german media organizations to do so as well . the two leading publishers justified the decision by saying that the new rules were lacking acceptance and germans were increasingly uncertain about writing in their own language .
the new rules , aimed at ironing out quirks in spelling and punctuation , were first introduced in schools in 1998 and are scheduled to completely replace the old spelling by aug .
2005 . " the spelling reform is not a reform , but a step backwards , " springer ceo mathias döpfner and stefan aust , spiegel 's editor-in-chief , wrote in a joint statement .
" we want to help to correct this mistake .

he added that he would try to get a majority of state premiers to support him at their next meeting in october .
several cdu premiers have already said they back the idea . a death blow ? others said they did n't believe the reform could survive with several of the country 's major publishers opposing it . " i ca n't imagine that the new spelling will survive now , " said hendrik zörner , the spokesman for the german journalists ' association , adding that his organization remained neutral on the issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spiegel and springer publications at a newsstand the two companies say they reach about 60 percent of the german population through their publications , which include mass-circulation tabloid bild and die welt newspaper -lrb- springer -rrb- and der spiegel newsmagazine -lrb- spiegel -rrb- . following their announcement , other media companies jumped on the band wagon .
officials for süddeutsche zeitung also said they would drop the new spelling .
bauer publishing company , which puts out tv guides and other popular magazines , also indicated they would follow suit .
germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper already switched back to the old spelling in 2000 . peter voss , the director-general of german public broadcaster swr , supported the reversal as well .
he added that his organization was debating doing the same and that he planned to bring up the issue with his colleagues within the national network of public broadcasters , ard .

they added that a new spelling council established to monitor linguistic development and fine-tune the reforms had been established in june . officials at burda publishing company , which includes focus newsmagazine , said they did not want to confuse people and would stick to the reform .

both men , now in their 70 's stood accused of accessory to manslaughter for their involvement in issuing " shoot-to-kill " orders along the berlin wall and the former inner-german border .
the judges in the berlin regional court considered the two officials for the former east german state as " primary " decision-makers in the communist chain of command that ultimately led to three deaths at the berlin wall between 1986 and 1989 .
the court thus handed down one-year suspended prison sentences to both men .
although lorenz and böhme alleged they had never directly ordered or oversaw any shootings at the wall , they were nonetheless found guilty for failing to prevent or revoke the order to kill illegal border crossers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : remembering those who died in search of freedom crossing the berlin wall - here on aug .
13 , 2003 - the 42nd anniversary of the wall .
the defendants ' argument that border shootings were lawful in east germany at the time and that they were simply following command , failed to persuade the judges .
the nuremberg trials against nazi leaders after world war ii already established the legal precedent to which germany abides , namely that under international law , those who order or assist in killings can not be protected by national legislation .
last in a line of proceedings the case against lorenz and böhme marks the end in a long line of proceedings against former east german officials and their involvement in crimes committed prior to unification in 1990 .
looking back on past trials , marianne birthler -lrb- photo -rrb- , the head of the state-run agency responsible for analyzing archived stasi material , said there is a lot to be learned .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler " the trials we 've witnessed over the past years have been an important contribution towards coming to terms with our own history , " said the woman who governs over reams of archives compiled by east german state police .
" it 's the travel season now , and thousands of germans cross the former inner-german border just like that .
to think that some 15 years ago this would have been totally impossible for us easterners , " she added .
" you must not forget that the wall was nothing less than a big prison for millions of people over so many years .
this alone was a huge crime ! "
partial victory for justice during the 40-year history of east germany , close to 1,000 people were shot at the berlin wall or along the inner-german border while trying to flee to the west .
legal proceedings against senior east german government members started in 1992 , when former head of state erich honecker had to stand trial .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former east german head of state and party leader , egon krenz was released from prison on dec .
18 , 2003 , after serving just 4 years for involvement in state shootings .
but death or infirmity has caught up with most officials before the courts could bring them to justice .
honecker , for example , died in 1994 while in exile in chile .
and east germany 's last leader , egon krenz -lrb- photo -rrb- , was handed down a six and a half year prison sentence for manslaughter , of which he only had to serve four years before being released early in dec .
2003 .
birthler stressed that a lot has been done to make sure justice was carried out with regard to the wall shootings .
" in other areas , the judicial system in unified germany has failed completely , " she lamented , referring to the case of erich mielke , the head of the dreaded stasi secret police .
" he was convicted of killing two policemen during the weimar republic .
but he did n't have to stand trial because of what he did as the stasi chief , nor did anyone else because of their involvement with the secret police in a dictatorship , " birthler said .
she noted that no fewer than 250,000 political prisoners suffered under the " very rough " treatment of the stasi during interrogation and internment .
" it is simply ridiculous , and a slap in the face of those who suffered from stasi repression , " argued birthler , who herself is from former east germany .
many of the dreaded former stasi prison officers have found a new nice in unified germany as heads of private security firms , she said , regretting that justice had not completely won out . hardy graupner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dissidents angered by the release of east germany 's last leader former east german dissidents criticized the early release of east germany ’ s last head of state .

given the threat of terrorism , the investment in precaution is understandable . nato has begun operation " distinguished games " - the first time the organization has played such a support role for a civilian event .
its operations include an intensive surveillance of the airspace over greece , with around 10 airborne early warning aircraft -lrb- awacs -rrb- taking it in shifts to circle over the eastern mediterranean , searching for passenger planes or other aircraft that could be seized by terrorists .
should the flying radar stations find a suspicious aircraft , the nato command center in larissa can send fighter jets from greece or other nato member states into the sky .
patriot anti-aircraft missiles are also deployed around athens .
if a warning is ignored , shots may be fired - but only if the greek government gives the command .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the greek navy patrols the coast , here near the greek island of hydra , southwest of athens .
" nato wo n't be taking action in response to any kind of a contingency , " said nato spokesman james appathurai .
" if our planes detect something , they 'll inform the greek authorities and it 'll be for them to decide what to do and to do it , but not for nato . "
test runs have shown that a crisis committee could give the green light for a launch within 20 minutes at the most .
around 12 nato patrol boats and 35 boats belonging to the greek navy are cruising along the coast to protect the olympic sports arenas from attack by ship .
anti-terror troops on hand a nato " anti-terror batallion " is stationed in the bathing resort of halkida , 90 kilometers northeast of athens .
this will be the starting place for troops from belgium , the czech republic , hungary , italy , poland and spain should there be a poison gas attack or some similar catastrophe .
" we will be forward-deploying elements of a chemical , biological , radiological and nuclear defense battalion , which will be there to help defend against any attack using weapons of mass destruction , " appathurai said .
the 200 nato troops do not constitute a fighting force , and while security is the top priority , appathurai is optimistic that the games will pass without incident .
" we 're quite confident that the greek authorities have done everything humanly possible to provide for security , and we do n't have any specific reason to believe there 'll be a major attack at the olympics , " appathurai said .
" but you always have to be prepared . "
new spending record greece has invested € 1.2 billion in security measures for the olympic games - four times the amount spent in sydney in 2000 .
a blimp is circling above athens that can listen in on telephone conversations and detect chemicals .
every movement in the city is being observed by more than 1500 surveillance cameras .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a police officer stands in front of a us-swiss airship fitted with cameras and sensors to provide security at olympics .
greek prime minister kostas karamanlis is reportedly proud of this total surveillance but there 's also been heavy criticism of the measures .
many athenians are concerned that their civil liberties are being threatened .
the international olympic committee though , says it expected nothing less .
" the security measures wo n't affect the mood of the games , they are necessary , " said ioc president jacques rogge .
" i commend the greek government for having done everything possible .

given the threat of terrorism , the investment in precaution is understandable . nato has begun operation " distinguished games " - the first time the organization has played such a support role for a civilian event .
its operations include an intensive surveillance of the airspace over greece , with around 10 airborne early warning aircraft -lrb- awacs -rrb- taking it in shifts to circle over the eastern mediterranean , searching for passenger planes or other aircraft that could be seized by terrorists .
should the flying radar stations find a suspicious aircraft , the nato command center in larissa can send fighter jets from greece or other nato member states into the sky .

" nato wo n't be taking action in response to any kind of a contingency , " said nato spokesman james appathurai .
" if our planes detect something , they 'll inform the greek authorities and it 'll be for them to decide what to do and to do it , but not for nato . "
test runs have shown that a crisis committee could give the green light for a launch within 20 minutes at the most .
around 12 nato patrol boats and 35 boats belonging to the greek navy are cruising along the coast to protect the olympic sports arenas from attack by ship .
anti-terror troops on hand a nato " anti-terror batallion " is stationed in the bathing resort of halkida , 90 kilometers northeast of athens .
this will be the starting place for troops from belgium , the czech republic , hungary , italy , poland and spain should there be a poison gas attack or some similar catastrophe .
" we will be forward-deploying elements of a chemical , biological , radiological and nuclear defense battalion , which will be there to help defend against any attack using weapons of mass destruction , " appathurai said .
the 200 nato troops do not constitute a fighting force , and while security is the top priority , appathurai is optimistic that the games will pass without incident .
" we 're quite confident that the greek authorities have done everything humanly possible to provide for security , and we do n't have any specific reason to believe there 'll be a major attack at the olympics , " appathurai said .
" but you always have to be prepared . "

" we will be forward-deploying elements of a chemical , biological , radiological and nuclear defense battalion , which will be there to help defend against any attack using weapons of mass destruction , " appathurai said .
the 200 nato troops do not constitute a fighting force , and while security is the top priority , appathurai is optimistic that the games will pass without incident .
" we 're quite confident that the greek authorities have done everything humanly possible to provide for security , and we do n't have any specific reason to believe there 'll be a major attack at the olympics , " appathurai said .
" but you always have to be prepared . "
new spending record greece has invested € 1.2 billion in security measures for the olympic games - four times the amount spent in sydney in 2000 .
a blimp is circling above athens that can listen in on telephone conversations and detect chemicals .
every movement in the city is being observed by more than 1500 surveillance cameras .

greek prime minister kostas karamanlis is reportedly proud of this total surveillance but there 's also been heavy criticism of the measures .
many athenians are concerned that their civil liberties are being threatened .
the international olympic committee though , says it expected nothing less .
" the security measures wo n't affect the mood of the games , they are necessary , " said ioc president jacques rogge .

nadia , 27 , gained huge public support and had been the hottest favourite in the programme 's five-series history .
" there 's no words that could show the happiness inside me , " she said on leaving the house .
" thank you so much . "
jason cowan , a 30-year-old air steward from glasgow , came second with daniel bryan , 30 , from hull , third and shell jubin , 21 , also from glasgow , fourth .
they had been locked in a tv house for 10 weeks , with nine other contestants kicked out along the way .
big brother final week votes nadia - 3,863,696 jason -lrb- above -rrb- - 1,335,246 dan - 685,995 shell - 347,051 nadia , a bank clerk living in surrey , broke down in tears and started shaking when presenter davina mccall announced the news .
she kept the fact she was born a man from her fellow housemates and began the series as a 50-1 outsider .
but she endeared herself to the nation to win the £ 63,500 prize .
she said her transsexuality was not a secret , but she wanted to win the show without telling housemates for " a reassurance of myself " .
" it was very hard because there were times that i felt i had to lie a little bit and i did n't want to lie at all , " she said .
" there were moments when i felt i would just come clean and be honest about it . "
big brother final week votes 2000 - 7.5 million 2001 - 7.3 million 2002 - 8.6 million 2003 - 4.3 million 2004 - 6.4 million this series has been among the most controversial yet , with security men called in to break up a fight , sex between two contestants and producers setting " evil " tasks .
jason - who entered the house in a thong in may - received boos from some fans on leaving but said he was " chuffed to bits " to come second .
he said it was " brilliant " , adding : " it 's made me a better person so i 've enjoyed it . "
daniel , a hairdresser , insisted he did not want to win the show .
he told viewers : " it 's not something i would 've been comfortable with .
it 's not hard work in the house . "
on leaving in fourth place , shell , a student , said : " people just kicked me up the backside a bit and i had good fun from it . "
nadia received almost 3.9 million votes in the final week , compared with 1.3 million for jason .
daniel got 685,995 , with 347,051 for shell .
the total of 6.4 million was up from last year 's record low of 4.3 million votes - but still lower than the totals for the first three series .
popularity however the 10-week series has succeeded in boosting ratings for channel 4 - an average of 4.9 million have watched this year 's shows so far .
that makes it the second most popular of the uk 's five series , behind big brother 3 , which saw kate lawler triumph .
a total of 9.4 million watched kate crowned the first female winner on the final night in 2002 - but the final 's ratings dropped to 6.6 million in 2003 .
send us your views on the big brother final - did you want nadia to win ?
why do you think she got such huge support ?
from the day she walked into that house i loved her .
ask anyone i know .
she 's fantastic , lovely , funny , gorgeous , everything a human wants .
she also won our hearts over with her emotional outbursts about how she felt accepted .
there was no other winner ever that deserved this as much as she does , she 's fantastic .
i 'm a super fan of nadia and i hope she gets everything she ever wanted in life .
good on ya girl .
john conroy , ireland garish , obscene , rabid , disgraceful , ordinary , nonsense .
bring back the word .
proper friday night viewing , thank goodness the ordinary license fee payer did n't contribute towards this gutter trash .
paulo , uk she got all the support because most of the voters tend to be 16 to 35-year-old , heat-reading party girls who 'd idolise a loud chain-smoking heavy drinker like themselves .
i respect her for who she is , but i just could n't stand her personality ... and that laugh !
ingmar , east yorkshire , uk nadia was beautiful all the way through this series , she has style , she is one classy lady .
she deserved to win iris jones , uk nadia so deserved to win .
she was herself from day one either happy or grumpy .
she got such support because people loved her for being herself , and admired her for not being ashamed of who she is .
go nads ! ! ! !
cara , uk she definitely got the sympathy vote !
her laugh and constant screaming were so annoying !
jason was cruelly denied victory !
annie , manchester i have wanted nadia to win for a long time .
it was really apparent how much tonight meant to her .
she has been through so much in her life and then to receive the admiration of the country is something else !
i was in tears tonight watching her reaction and the clips from the 10 weeks .
in my opinion it has been the best bb ever !
roll on celebrity bb later this year and bb6 next year !
i could not think of anyone more deserving than nadia , and if next year is anything like this year , ratings will go through the roof !
jack hamilton , belfast i sincerely hope young children did n't watch it , it was a show full of depravity and profanities .
no example for our children .
paul , scotland this is tv for the uneducated masses .
thank goodness the vast majority of the uk population chose to do something else , rather than watch it .
paul , dawlish , england why so many people are so keen to devote valuable hours of their finite lives to watching this sort of pappy , moronic " entertainment " is beyond me .
if i want to watch a building full of gormless cretins trying to string a sentence together i 'll go to the pub ; at least they have a pool table there .
life is too short to waste watching this sort of tosh , so it 's great news that it 's over .
another year of peace beckons ...
matt vaughan , england much better than the oz bb , davina is just so cool .
nadia was my favourite , she is so genuine and such a galmour queen , ab fab and the lip gloss bitches rule !
francesca monroe , australia -lrb- but living in the uk -rrb- way to go nadia !
yes i totally wanted nadia to win .
i think people gave her so much support which shows people are starting to understand the plight of transsexuals and at least in england she is accepted for who she really is , a fabulous woman .
shana , england the only reason jason cowan got so much support was because scottish newspapers campaigned to get the people of scotland to vote for him purely because he was scottish .
the boos he received showed how unpopular he was .
i 'm glad nadia won !
gaye o 'reilly , birmingham , united kingdom maybe it 's time for the gay and the transgender community to accept that they have actually been accepted by such a vast majority !
it 's interesting to see that all the people with negative comments still must have watched the programme to comment so negatively .
well done nadia - you are a superb role model for all !

" thank you so much . "
jason cowan , a 30-year-old air steward from glasgow , came second with daniel bryan , 30 , from hull , third and shell jubin , 21 , also from glasgow , fourth .
they had been locked in a tv house for 10 weeks , with nine other contestants kicked out along the way .
big brother final week votes nadia - 3,863,696 jason -lrb- above -rrb- - 1,335,246 dan - 685,995 shell - 347,051 nadia , a bank clerk living in surrey , broke down in tears and started shaking when presenter davina mccall announced the news .
she kept the fact she was born a man from her fellow housemates and began the series as a 50-1 outsider .
but she endeared herself to the nation to win the £ 63,500 prize .
she said her transsexuality was not a secret , but she wanted to win the show without telling housemates for " a reassurance of myself " .
" it was very hard because there were times that i felt i had to lie a little bit and i did n't want to lie at all , " she said .
" there were moments when i felt i would just come clean and be honest about it . "
big brother final week votes 2000 - 7.5 million 2001 - 7.3 million 2002 - 8.6 million 2003 - 4.3 million 2004 - 6.4 million this series has been among the most controversial yet , with security men called in to break up a fight , sex between two contestants and producers setting " evil " tasks .
jason - who entered the house in a thong in may - received boos from some fans on leaving but said he was " chuffed to bits " to come second .
he said it was " brilliant " , adding : " it 's made me a better person so i 've enjoyed it . "
daniel , a hairdresser , insisted he did not want to win the show .
he told viewers : " it 's not something i would 've been comfortable with .
it 's not hard work in the house . "
on leaving in fourth place , shell , a student , said : " people just kicked me up the backside a bit and i had good fun from it . "
nadia received almost 3.9 million votes in the final week , compared with 1.3 million for jason .
daniel got 685,995 , with 347,051 for shell .
the total of 6.4 million was up from last year 's record low of 4.3 million votes - but still lower than the totals for the first three series .
popularity however the 10-week series has succeeded in boosting ratings for channel 4 - an average of 4.9 million have watched this year 's shows so far .
that makes it the second most popular of the uk 's five series , behind big brother 3 , which saw kate lawler triumph .
a total of 9.4 million watched kate crowned the first female winner on the final night in 2002 - but the final 's ratings dropped to 6.6 million in 2003 .
send us your views on the big brother final - did you want nadia to win ?
why do you think she got such huge support ?
from the day she walked into that house i loved her .
ask anyone i know .
she 's fantastic , lovely , funny , gorgeous , everything a human wants .
she also won our hearts over with her emotional outbursts about how she felt accepted .
there was no other winner ever that deserved this as much as she does , she 's fantastic .
i 'm a super fan of nadia and i hope she gets everything she ever wanted in life .
good on ya girl .
john conroy , ireland garish , obscene , rabid , disgraceful , ordinary , nonsense .
bring back the word .
proper friday night viewing , thank goodness the ordinary license fee payer did n't contribute towards this gutter trash .
paulo , uk she got all the support because most of the voters tend to be 16 to 35-year-old , heat-reading party girls who 'd idolise a loud chain-smoking heavy drinker like themselves .
i respect her for who she is , but i just could n't stand her personality ... and that laugh !
ingmar , east yorkshire , uk nadia was beautiful all the way through this series , she has style , she is one classy lady .
she deserved to win iris jones , uk nadia so deserved to win .
she was herself from day one either happy or grumpy .
she got such support because people loved her for being herself , and admired her for not being ashamed of who she is .
go nads ! ! ! !
cara , uk she definitely got the sympathy vote !
her laugh and constant screaming were so annoying !
jason was cruelly denied victory !
annie , manchester i have wanted nadia to win for a long time .
it was really apparent how much tonight meant to her .
she has been through so much in her life and then to receive the admiration of the country is something else !
i was in tears tonight watching her reaction and the clips from the 10 weeks .
in my opinion it has been the best bb ever !
roll on celebrity bb later this year and bb6 next year !
i could not think of anyone more deserving than nadia , and if next year is anything like this year , ratings will go through the roof !
jack hamilton , belfast i sincerely hope young children did n't watch it , it was a show full of depravity and profanities .
no example for our children .
paul , scotland this is tv for the uneducated masses .
thank goodness the vast majority of the uk population chose to do something else , rather than watch it .
paul , dawlish , england why so many people are so keen to devote valuable hours of their finite lives to watching this sort of pappy , moronic " entertainment " is beyond me .
if i want to watch a building full of gormless cretins trying to string a sentence together i 'll go to the pub ; at least they have a pool table there .
life is too short to waste watching this sort of tosh , so it 's great news that it 's over .
another year of peace beckons ...
matt vaughan , england much better than the oz bb , davina is just so cool .
nadia was my favourite , she is so genuine and such a galmour queen , ab fab and the lip gloss bitches rule !
francesca monroe , australia -lrb- but living in the uk -rrb- way to go nadia !
yes i totally wanted nadia to win .
i think people gave her so much support which shows people are starting to understand the plight of transsexuals and at least in england she is accepted for who she really is , a fabulous woman .
shana , england the only reason jason cowan got so much support was because scottish newspapers campaigned to get the people of scotland to vote for him purely because he was scottish .
the boos he received showed how unpopular he was .
i 'm glad nadia won !
gaye o 'reilly , birmingham , united kingdom maybe it 's time for the gay and the transgender community to accept that they have actually been accepted by such a vast majority !
it 's interesting to see that all the people with negative comments still must have watched the programme to comment so negatively .
well done nadia - you are a superb role model for all !

paulo , uk she got all the support because most of the voters tend to be 16 to 35-year-old , heat-reading party girls who 'd idolise a loud chain-smoking heavy drinker like themselves .
i respect her for who she is , but i just could n't stand her personality ... and that laugh !

i was in tears tonight watching her reaction and the clips from the 10 weeks .
in my opinion it has been the best bb ever !
roll on celebrity bb later this year and bb6 next year !
i could not think of anyone more deserving than nadia , and if next year is anything like this year , ratings will go through the roof !

nadia , 27 , gained huge public support and had been the hottest favourite in the programme 's five-series history .
" there 's no words that could show the happiness inside me , " she said on leaving the house .
" thank you so much . "
jason cowan , a 30-year-old air steward from glasgow , came second with daniel bryan , 30 , from hull , third and shell jubin , 21 , also from glasgow , fourth .
they had been locked in a tv house for 10 weeks , with nine other contestants kicked out along the way .
big brother final week votes nadia - 3,863,696 jason -lrb- above -rrb- - 1,335,246 dan - 685,995 shell - 347,051 nadia , a bank clerk living in surrey , broke down in tears and started shaking when presenter davina mccall announced the news .
she kept the fact she was born a man from her fellow housemates and began the series as a 50-1 outsider .
but she endeared herself to the nation to win the £ 63,500 prize .
she said her transsexuality was not a secret , but she wanted to win the show without telling housemates for " a reassurance of myself " .
" it was very hard because there were times that i felt i had to lie a little bit and i did n't want to lie at all , " she said .
" there were moments when i felt i would just come clean and be honest about it . "
big brother final week votes 2000 - 7.5 million 2001 - 7.3 million 2002 - 8.6 million 2003 - 4.3 million 2004 - 6.4 million this series has been among the most controversial yet , with security men called in to break up a fight , sex between two contestants and producers setting " evil " tasks .
jason - who entered the house in a thong in may - received boos from some fans on leaving but said he was " chuffed to bits " to come second .
he said it was " brilliant " , adding : " it 's made me a better person so i 've enjoyed it . "
daniel , a hairdresser , insisted he did not want to win the show .
he told viewers : " it 's not something i would 've been comfortable with .
it 's not hard work in the house . "
on leaving in fourth place , shell , a student , said : " people just kicked me up the backside a bit and i had good fun from it . "
nadia received almost 3.9 million votes in the final week , compared with 1.3 million for jason .
daniel got 685,995 , with 347,051 for shell .
the total of 6.4 million was up from last year 's record low of 4.3 million votes - but still lower than the totals for the first three series .
popularity however the 10-week series has succeeded in boosting ratings for channel 4 - an average of 4.9 million have watched this year 's shows so far .
that makes it the second most popular of the uk 's five series , behind big brother 3 , which saw kate lawler triumph .
a total of 9.4 million watched kate crowned the first female winner on the final night in 2002 - but the final 's ratings dropped to 6.6 million in 2003 .
send us your views on the big brother final - did you want nadia to win ?
why do you think she got such huge support ?
from the day she walked into that house i loved her .
ask anyone i know .
she 's fantastic , lovely , funny , gorgeous , everything a human wants .
she also won our hearts over with her emotional outbursts about how she felt accepted .
there was no other winner ever that deserved this as much as she does , she 's fantastic .

the new essential guide to hadrian 's wall path national trail , was only published in may .
but the countryside agency says it is delighted more than 1,000 copies of the pocket sized books have been sold .
the 64-page guide was compiled by trail officer david mcglade and is aimed at walkers following the national trail between wallsend and bowness-on-solway .
mr mcglade said : " since opening in 2003 , hadrian 's wall path has proved extremely popular with walkers .
" more than 3,500 people completed the trail in the first few months .
public transport " we found however that these walkers did n't have enough information about the everyday essentials often taken for granted .
" for example , they needed to know where to find a cash point or toilets , museum opening times and where to get medical treatment .
" the guide aims to meet this need and be a handy reference point for anyone contemplating doing the walk . "
also covered in the guide are conservation tips and information about using public transport and even tide times .
the 84-mile stretch of wall linking tyneside to cumbria opened in may 2003 .
the countryside agency , which is responsible for the trail , reckons more than 50 % of the £ 6m cost of setting up the route had already been recouped .

the 64-page guide was compiled by trail officer david mcglade and is aimed at walkers following the national trail between wallsend and bowness-on-solway .
mr mcglade said : " since opening in 2003 , hadrian 's wall path has proved extremely popular with walkers .
" more than 3,500 people completed the trail in the first few months .
public transport " we found however that these walkers did n't have enough information about the everyday essentials often taken for granted .
" for example , they needed to know where to find a cash point or toilets , museum opening times and where to get medical treatment .
" the guide aims to meet this need and be a handy reference point for anyone contemplating doing the walk . "
also covered in the guide are conservation tips and information about using public transport and even tide times .
the 84-mile stretch of wall linking tyneside to cumbria opened in may 2003 .
the countryside agency , which is responsible for the trail , reckons more than 50 % of the £ 6m cost of setting up the route had already been recouped .
