the 22-year-old dreams of opening his own turkish restaurant and attends a school to learn how to be a manager .
he gets his practical training at burger king . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fatih haslak in his spare time , haslak -lrb- photo -rrb- comes to mevlana mosque , which sits at the bottom of a dilapidated apartment complex that towers over kottbusser tor .
he 's the mosque 's secretary and assures visitors that this is a place that 's open to anyone . " we do n't have any problems with other cultures , " he said , adding that he unfortunately does n't have time to find german friends .
haslak sees the increase in women wearing headscarves as a normal development : " wherever turks live , they try to showcase their culture . " but other turkish people living in the area view things quite differently .
take mustafa sükrü cakiroglu , who has decorated his office with prayer plates , turkish flags and a painting of kemal atatürk , the founder of modern-day turkey . " that 's just there for my customers , " said the interpreter , who has lived in germany for 30 years .
like haslak , cakiroglu also has no german friends in berlin , a fact he 's unhappy about .
" there 's no opportunity to mix , " he says . things were different in western germany , where he lived for many years before coming to the capital .
there , turks and germans lived next to each other and expressed more interest in their cultures , he said . he believes that 's less likely in berlin , where immigrants tend to cluster in certain neighborhoods .
" i tell everyone to leave , " he says and adds that he 'd like to move to another part of germany himself . a good relationship horst wiessner would never think of leaving kreuzberg .
the 82-year-old has lived in the neighborhood all his life .
he 's seen it transform from a predominantly german to a mostly turkish quarter , a fact that does n't worry him in the least .
" we have a really good relationship with our turkish neighbors , " says wiessner , who is the president of the kottbusser tor apartment complex 's tenant association . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst wiessner stands on his roof terrace .
thirty years ago , wiessner -lrb- photo -rrb- and his late wife were the first ones to move into the complex .
they came with high hopes of living in a modern urban building and managed to get a top floor apartment with a roof garden that offers sweeping views across the city .
up there , things have n't changed much , but it 's a different story down on the ground . the building is covered in graffiti and berlin 's drug addicts who hang out in the area use the dark hallways for injections .
despite constant setbacks and disputes with the owners of the building , wiessner keeps working to improve the neighborhood . " i have a job here that still is n't finished , " he said . little cross-cultural contact sponholz does n't even have children of her own yet .
" but when i do , they should grow up here , " she said after sending off the group of teenagers she led around the neighborhood .
" i 've acquired so much social competence here , i can see that when i compare myself to others at university . " sponholz has german parents , she became familiar with turkish culture through her best friend .
she said kottbusser tor has changed since she was a child .
" there 's really very little contact with german society , " she said .
" it 's not necessary , because there 's a turkish infrastructure now . " she says she knows that her neighborhood has its problems .
she knows that it 's bad that a lot of germans have left - but so have a lot of turkish families , who could afford homes elsewhere .
maybe a new group of immigrants will take over in the future : " maybe it 's going to be a polish kreuzberg some day .

many see berlin 's kottbusser tor neighborhood as a prime example for failed integration .
but while germans and immigrants might not interact much , they 're getting along just fine , say those living and working there . the tourists nadja sponholz is showing around kreuzberg have n't had to travel far .
a dozen teenagers from berlin 's eastern suburbs , they 've been on a bus for about half an hour to visit the city 's famous multicultural district . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nadja sponholz -lrb- left -rrb- then again , sponholz is n't offering a typical tour .
the 26-year-old history student and kreuzberg native , is trying to breaking down prejudices about a neighborhood many germans - even those living less than a few miles away - do n't dare visit . " i 've never really been here because of that - like you ca n't walk alone in the streets , " said linda lahmert , 16 , who is training to become a secretary . sitting in a turkish café near a square called kottbusser tor , everyone 's now sipping sweetened black tea and listening to sponholz 's stories about her part of town .
stories like the one about fanatical turks who decorate their entire apartments in the colors of their favorite soccer team , or why you should n't smoke in the presence of elderly turkish ladies .
they are anecdotes designed to make kreuzberg seem much less threatening . " i think it 's great that we have this day here , " said lahmert and quickly answers when asked whether she could imagine living here : " why not ?
i could learn turkish . " an immigrant quarter for 300 years it probably wouldn ’ t be a bad idea : turkish has long been the predominant language in the neighborhood . more than half of the people who live here are of foreign extraction . turkish fast food stores , groceries , banks and pharmacies cluster around kottbusser tor , a run-down traffic circle also known as little istanbul .
since the fall of the wall , those who could afford to move elsewhere did so , leaving behind a population that does n't step outside its own culture and speaks little or no german . people from more than 100 countries live here : turks make up the biggest group , followed by immigrants from the former yugoslavia , lebanon and other middle eastern states .
there 's little interaction between the groups and many people depend on social welfare , prompting conservative politicians to see the neighborhood as an example of failed integration and the problems big cities face when trying to integrate foreigners . others , such as kreuzberg museum director martin düspohl , like to put things in perspective : the turks have only been here since the 1960s and it took others much longer to feel at home .
" the huguenots settled here in 1704 , but it took a century for them to stop feeling french , " he says . integration clearly has suffered some drawbacks over the last 15 years , düspohl adds .
rising unemployment and xenophobic attacks have made turkish families wary of their german neighbors and led them to turn inward .
" now people who come here on work placement have to pray during the day , " düspohl says , referring to workers who now demand regular prayer breaks .
" that was n't the case during the 80s . " more headscarves around bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two young women wearing headscarves in kreuzberg .
manuela seidel , the principal of the area 's elementary school , has also seen religion take on a more important role .

a dozen teenagers from berlin 's eastern suburbs , they 've been on a bus for about half an hour to visit the city 's famous multicultural district . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nadja sponholz -lrb- left -rrb- then again , sponholz is n't offering a typical tour .
the 26-year-old history student and kreuzberg native , is trying to breaking down prejudices about a neighborhood many germans - even those living less than a few miles away - do n't dare visit . " i 've never really been here because of that - like you ca n't walk alone in the streets , " said linda lahmert , 16 , who is training to become a secretary . sitting in a turkish café near a square called kottbusser tor , everyone 's now sipping sweetened black tea and listening to sponholz 's stories about her part of town .
stories like the one about fanatical turks who decorate their entire apartments in the colors of their favorite soccer team , or why you should n't smoke in the presence of elderly turkish ladies .
they are anecdotes designed to make kreuzberg seem much less threatening . " i think it 's great that we have this day here , " said lahmert and quickly answers when asked whether she could imagine living here : " why not ?
i could learn turkish . " an immigrant quarter for 300 years it probably wouldn ’ t be a bad idea : turkish has long been the predominant language in the neighborhood . more than half of the people who live here are of foreign extraction . turkish fast food stores , groceries , banks and pharmacies cluster around kottbusser tor , a run-down traffic circle also known as little istanbul .
since the fall of the wall , those who could afford to move elsewhere did so , leaving behind a population that does n't step outside its own culture and speaks little or no german . people from more than 100 countries live here : turks make up the biggest group , followed by immigrants from the former yugoslavia , lebanon and other middle eastern states .
there 's little interaction between the groups and many people depend on social welfare , prompting conservative politicians to see the neighborhood as an example of failed integration and the problems big cities face when trying to integrate foreigners . others , such as kreuzberg museum director martin düspohl , like to put things in perspective : the turks have only been here since the 1960s and it took others much longer to feel at home .
" the huguenots settled here in 1704 , but it took a century for them to stop feeling french , " he says . integration clearly has suffered some drawbacks over the last 15 years , düspohl adds .
rising unemployment and xenophobic attacks have made turkish families wary of their german neighbors and led them to turn inward .
" now people who come here on work placement have to pray during the day , " düspohl says , referring to workers who now demand regular prayer breaks .
" that was n't the case during the 80s . " more headscarves around bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two young women wearing headscarves in kreuzberg .
manuela seidel , the principal of the area 's elementary school , has also seen religion take on a more important role .
" it sounds trite , but there 's more headscarves around , " she says , adding that 93 percent of her 600 students do n't have german parents . integration is a concept seidel would n't associate with the neighborhood .
" you 'd have to integrate the germans here , " she says .
" every -lrb- ethnic -rrb- group lives by itself and tolerates the other as far as i can tell . " seidel has been trying to get parents more involved in school activities .
few , however , have shown interest so far , she says .
living in an area where everyone from the grocer to the doctor speaks turkish doesn ’ t help integration along , either . " i do n't have to speak german to get by around here , " seidel said , adding that she wants to give her students the necessary tools to succeed .

the 22-year-old dreams of opening his own turkish restaurant and attends a school to learn how to be a manager .
he gets his practical training at burger king . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fatih haslak in his spare time , haslak -lrb- photo -rrb- comes to mevlana mosque , which sits at the bottom of a dilapidated apartment complex that towers over kottbusser tor .
he 's the mosque 's secretary and assures visitors that this is a place that 's open to anyone . " we do n't have any problems with other cultures , " he said , adding that he unfortunately does n't have time to find german friends .
haslak sees the increase in women wearing headscarves as a normal development : " wherever turks live , they try to showcase their culture . " but other turkish people living in the area view things quite differently .
take mustafa sükrü cakiroglu , who has decorated his office with prayer plates , turkish flags and a painting of kemal atatürk , the founder of modern-day turkey . " that 's just there for my customers , " said the interpreter , who has lived in germany for 30 years .
like haslak , cakiroglu also has no german friends in berlin , a fact he 's unhappy about .
" there 's no opportunity to mix , " he says . things were different in western germany , where he lived for many years before coming to the capital .
there , turks and germans lived next to each other and expressed more interest in their cultures , he said . he believes that 's less likely in berlin , where immigrants tend to cluster in certain neighborhoods .
" i tell everyone to leave , " he says and adds that he 'd like to move to another part of germany himself . a good relationship horst wiessner would never think of leaving kreuzberg .
the 82-year-old has lived in the neighborhood all his life .
he 's seen it transform from a predominantly german to a mostly turkish quarter , a fact that does n't worry him in the least .
" we have a really good relationship with our turkish neighbors , " says wiessner , who is the president of the kottbusser tor apartment complex 's tenant association . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst wiessner stands on his roof terrace .
thirty years ago , wiessner -lrb- photo -rrb- and his late wife were the first ones to move into the complex .
they came with high hopes of living in a modern urban building and managed to get a top floor apartment with a roof garden that offers sweeping views across the city .

daimlerchrysler 's woes in the asian market deepened with south korean partner hyundai motors planning to scrap a joint truck venture .
earlier daimler abandoned beleaguered japanese partner mitsubishi motors corp. the south korean carmaker hyundai motors is planning to drop all cooperation projects with german carmaker daimlerchrysler in the coming week , according to media reports .
the move would affect a major planned alliance between daimlerchrysler and hyundai motors to jointly build heavy trucks and the yearly delivery of 50,000 truck engines to hyundai . quoting company sources , germany 's wirtschaftswoche financial news magazine said profitable hyundai had cold feet amid worries that daimlerchrysler , the world 's fifth-biggest automaker , would use the deal to seek greater influence over hyundi , as is currently happening to the troubled japanese automotive group mitsubishi motors . daimlerchrysler ' finance director manfred gentz earlier said that all cooperations with hyundai would continue as planned , but added that the strategic urgency of the joint trucking venture with hyundai was no longer as significant as when the two joined forces in 2001 . mercedes-benz chinese plans angers hyundai bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a mercedes-benz e-class car according to media reports , hyundai chief park hwang-ho is irked at the chinese expansion plans of mercedes-benz , a subsidiary of daimlerchrsyler .
starting 2005 , mercedes together with chinese manufacturer beijing automotive industry company -lrb- baic -rrb- wants to produce mercedes c-class and e-class -lrb- photo -rrb- models for the chinese market . but since hyundai itself has a cooperation with baic , it insists that baic deal exclusively with it for 30 years .
experts believe that if the south koreans get their way , mercedes-benz will be no longer be able to begin car production in china .
daimlerchrysler has an investment stake of just more than 10 percent in hyundai motors , which is part of the hyundai industrial group . daimlerchrsyler to review asian strategy kim yong-duk , vice president of keb commerz investment trust management in seoul , told the wirtschaftswoche that hyundai did not want to become " just another element in the shaky world inc. of herr schrempp -lsb- daimlerchrysler chief executive juergen schrempp -rsb- but rise to the top by its own efforts " . the magazine said a separate project to jointly manufacture truck engines was also unlikely to be carried out , but the two groups would persist in plans to make car engines together . though daimlerchrysler has not categorically confirmed the end of the joint trucking venture with hyundai , the negotiations which have dragged on for the past one and a half years , have reportedly been difficult .
gentz said daimlerchrysler would fundamentally review its asian strategy . daimlerchrsyler abandons mitsubishi motors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the headquarters of mitsubishi motors corp. in tokyo on friday , daimlerchrysler company executives announced they had abandoned plans to rescue ailing carmaker mitsubishi with a multi-billion-dollar investment . daimler shares rose as investors expressed relief as what appeared to be the end of the of its costly entanglement with japan 's only unprofitable carmaker .
but the decision came as a blow to daimlerchrysler ceo jürgen schrempp 's vision to turn the company into a worldwide player . after the 1998 merger with chrysler , schrempp had bought 37 percent of the japanese company three years ago , making daimlerchrysler mitsubishi 's largest shareholder .
mitsubishi is expecting a 72 billion yen -lrb- € 557.8 million , $ 659.4 million -rrb- loss for the fiscal year ending march 31 . daimlerchrysler officials on friday said injecting more money into mitsubishi made no sense for them , saying it would require a " very , very high capital infusion . " they added that they did n't know yet what they would do with their shares . " there is no decision for selling out stake and we are not looking for someone to buy it , " daimlerchrysler chief financial officer manfred gentz said , according to ap news agency .
in response , the mitsubishi group of companies , which holds the majority of mitsubishi motor shares , announced that it would " do their best " to revive the car maker . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de daimler forges engines joint venture with mitsubishi , hyundai in further pursuit of its globalization , daimlerchrysler is to set up a joint venture with japan 's mitsubishi motors and korea 's hyundai motor .

greek cypriots on saturday voted overwhelmingly against reunification with turkish cypriots , sounding the death knell for a un-backed peace plan to end a 30-year division of the island . television exit polls forecast that the greek cypriots voted against the u.n. blueprint in large numbers , while the turkish cypriots voted heavily in favor . the polls on the south of the island said 78.5 percent of greek cypriots had rejected the plan .
a separate exit poll by turkey 's private cnn-turk television found 61 percent of turkish cypriots accepted the plan .
the rejection means that only greek cypriots will enter the european union on may 1 . greek and turkish cypriots were voting in separate referendums on whether to accept a peace plan drawn up by un secretary-general kofi anan in reuniting the island that has been divided for 30 years ever since turkey invaded the north in the wake of a greek cypriot coup in an attempt to unite the island with greece .
a mined no-man 's land , the " green line , " which is policed by u.n. peacekeepers , separates the northern one-third of the island from the south . papadopoulos gets his way but the peace plan 's outcome was more or less sealed after prominent greek cypriot leaders said they were unhappy with the details that favored the turkish cypriots .
the plan envisaged a federation of two politically equal states , one for the 643,000 greek cypriots and one for the 180,000 turks and turkish cypriots in the north , under a weak central government . greek cypriot leaders in particular objected to the fact that the blueprint restricts the rights of an estimated 200,000 refugees to return to their former homes in the north , while allowing more than 60,000 settlers from turkey to remain on the island . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tassos papadopoulos greek cypriot president tassos papadopoulos along with his nationalist allies has been accused of running a campaign playing on greek cypriot fears that turkey and the turkish cypriots would fail to hand back nine percent of the island 's territory and gradually withdraw 38,000 turkish troops . earlier on saturday papdopoulos cast his vote and said , " today 's voting will determine the future of our country .

" denktash : voters did n't know the plan for his part , veteran turkish cypriot leader rauf denktash , who also vociferously opposed the peace plan in the face of widespread support for it among his own people , said that cypriots did n't really know the 220-page document they were voting on . " unfortunately we are not voting for a document that has been agreed on , but a document that has not been agreed on , " he said .
" we are not voting for harmony , peace and agreement , but disagreement . " denktash criticized the international community for forcing the referendums on cypriots .
" this could not have been done in europe because they are treated as civilzed people , " he said .

turkish cyprus has been isolated for years .

the united states , which has been campaigning to convince cypriots to vote " yes , " has accused the semi-governmental cyprus broadcasting corporation -lrb- cbc -rrb- of restricting press coverage for the plan 's proponents .
cypriot television aired a two-hour , prime-time interview with papadopoulos , but u.s. diplomats claim cbc has stopped interviewing foreign officials . european union enlargement commissioner günter verheugen said he felt " cheated " by the greek cypriot government , which had always pushed hard for a reunified cyprus to join the eu .

daimlerchrysler 's woes in the asian market deepened with south korean partner hyundai motors planning to scrap a joint truck venture .
earlier daimler abandoned beleaguered japanese partner mitsubishi motors corp. the south korean carmaker hyundai motors is planning to drop all cooperation projects with german carmaker daimlerchrysler in the coming week , according to media reports .

daimlerchrysler 's woes in the asian market deepened with south korean partner hyundai motors planning to scrap a joint truck venture .
earlier daimler abandoned beleaguered japanese partner mitsubishi motors corp. the south korean carmaker hyundai motors is planning to drop all cooperation projects with german carmaker daimlerchrysler in the coming week , according to media reports .
the move would affect a major planned alliance between daimlerchrysler and hyundai motors to jointly build heavy trucks and the yearly delivery of 50,000 truck engines to hyundai . quoting company sources , germany 's wirtschaftswoche financial news magazine said profitable hyundai had cold feet amid worries that daimlerchrysler , the world 's fifth-biggest automaker , would use the deal to seek greater influence over hyundi , as is currently happening to the troubled japanese automotive group mitsubishi motors . daimlerchrysler ' finance director manfred gentz earlier said that all cooperations with hyundai would continue as planned , but added that the strategic urgency of the joint trucking venture with hyundai was no longer as significant as when the two joined forces in 2001 . mercedes-benz chinese plans angers hyundai bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a mercedes-benz e-class car according to media reports , hyundai chief park hwang-ho is irked at the chinese expansion plans of mercedes-benz , a subsidiary of daimlerchrsyler .
starting 2005 , mercedes together with chinese manufacturer beijing automotive industry company -lrb- baic -rrb- wants to produce mercedes c-class and e-class -lrb- photo -rrb- models for the chinese market . but since hyundai itself has a cooperation with baic , it insists that baic deal exclusively with it for 30 years .
experts believe that if the south koreans get their way , mercedes-benz will be no longer be able to begin car production in china .
daimlerchrysler has an investment stake of just more than 10 percent in hyundai motors , which is part of the hyundai industrial group . daimlerchrsyler to review asian strategy kim yong-duk , vice president of keb commerz investment trust management in seoul , told the wirtschaftswoche that hyundai did not want to become " just another element in the shaky world inc. of herr schrempp -lsb- daimlerchrysler chief executive juergen schrempp -rsb- but rise to the top by its own efforts " . the magazine said a separate project to jointly manufacture truck engines was also unlikely to be carried out , but the two groups would persist in plans to make car engines together . though daimlerchrysler has not categorically confirmed the end of the joint trucking venture with hyundai , the negotiations which have dragged on for the past one and a half years , have reportedly been difficult .
gentz said daimlerchrysler would fundamentally review its asian strategy . daimlerchrsyler abandons mitsubishi motors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the headquarters of mitsubishi motors corp. in tokyo on friday , daimlerchrysler company executives announced they had abandoned plans to rescue ailing carmaker mitsubishi with a multi-billion-dollar investment . daimler shares rose as investors expressed relief as what appeared to be the end of the of its costly entanglement with japan 's only unprofitable carmaker .
but the decision came as a blow to daimlerchrysler ceo jürgen schrempp 's vision to turn the company into a worldwide player . after the 1998 merger with chrysler , schrempp had bought 37 percent of the japanese company three years ago , making daimlerchrysler mitsubishi 's largest shareholder .
mitsubishi is expecting a 72 billion yen -lrb- € 557.8 million , $ 659.4 million -rrb- loss for the fiscal year ending march 31 . daimlerchrysler officials on friday said injecting more money into mitsubishi made no sense for them , saying it would require a " very , very high capital infusion . " they added that they did n't know yet what they would do with their shares . " there is no decision for selling out stake and we are not looking for someone to buy it , " daimlerchrysler chief financial officer manfred gentz said , according to ap news agency .
in response , the mitsubishi group of companies , which holds the majority of mitsubishi motor shares , announced that it would " do their best " to revive the car maker . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de daimler forges engines joint venture with mitsubishi , hyundai in further pursuit of its globalization , daimlerchrysler is to set up a joint venture with japan 's mitsubishi motors and korea 's hyundai motor .

in a last report card for the 10 new countries joining the eu , members of the european parliament praised progress in adapting national laws to those of the union but also pointed out remaining problems . before handing out grades to individual countries , parliamentarians first looked at general problems shared by most accession countries that still need to be resolved .
the new states have adopted more than 80,000 pages of the eu 's common law , the so-called acquis communautaire .
but enforcing the union 's rules continues to be a " major problem , " according to the report . to fix this , countries need something that 's long been eyed with suspicion in existing eu countries - a well-oiled bureaucracy .
" the administrations are too weak overall , " elisabeth schroedter , a german member of the european parliament from the green party who co-wrote the report told dw-world .
she added that many governments have ignored the problem for too long , causing most young people to look for jobs in the private sector , since they do n't get paid as much while working for the government . others agree that finding more well-trained bureaucrats is the biggest challenge the new eu countries face .
" the better the administration , the better the courts , the easier it is to get foreign investment , " said german christian democrat elmar brok , schroedter 's colleague and the report 's head author . without a functioning bureaucracy on the national and especially the regional level , accession countries might also endanger the eu funding they could receive in areas such as agriculture , brok added .
" they know that if they are not fast , they lose money , " he told dw-world . the situation is more difficult for larger countries such as poland that find it more difficult to set up a proper administrative system simply because of their size , brok said .
smaller nations , such as estonia and slovenia , have already made much more progress in this area . food safety is another area that has parliamentarians worried : they criticized delays in some countries to adopt measures preventing the spread of bse , the so-called mad cow disease .
they also called on the european commission to stop the sale of food products from a member state as a last resort to protect consumers in major food scares . finally , legislators asked existing eu member states to reconsider plans not to issue work permits to people from the new countries for the first few years after enlargement .

many see berlin 's kottbusser tor neighborhood as a prime example for failed integration .
but while germans and immigrants might not interact much , they 're getting along just fine , say those living and working there . the tourists nadja sponholz is showing around kreuzberg have n't had to travel far .
a dozen teenagers from berlin 's eastern suburbs , they 've been on a bus for about half an hour to visit the city 's famous multicultural district . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nadja sponholz -lrb- left -rrb- then again , sponholz is n't offering a typical tour .
the 26-year-old history student and kreuzberg native , is trying to breaking down prejudices about a neighborhood many germans - even those living less than a few miles away - do n't dare visit . " i 've never really been here because of that - like you ca n't walk alone in the streets , " said linda lahmert , 16 , who is training to become a secretary . sitting in a turkish café near a square called kottbusser tor , everyone 's now sipping sweetened black tea and listening to sponholz 's stories about her part of town .
stories like the one about fanatical turks who decorate their entire apartments in the colors of their favorite soccer team , or why you should n't smoke in the presence of elderly turkish ladies .
they are anecdotes designed to make kreuzberg seem much less threatening . " i think it 's great that we have this day here , " said lahmert and quickly answers when asked whether she could imagine living here : " why not ?
i could learn turkish . " an immigrant quarter for 300 years it probably wouldn ’ t be a bad idea : turkish has long been the predominant language in the neighborhood . more than half of the people who live here are of foreign extraction . turkish fast food stores , groceries , banks and pharmacies cluster around kottbusser tor , a run-down traffic circle also known as little istanbul .
since the fall of the wall , those who could afford to move elsewhere did so , leaving behind a population that does n't step outside its own culture and speaks little or no german . people from more than 100 countries live here : turks make up the biggest group , followed by immigrants from the former yugoslavia , lebanon and other middle eastern states .
there 's little interaction between the groups and many people depend on social welfare , prompting conservative politicians to see the neighborhood as an example of failed integration and the problems big cities face when trying to integrate foreigners . others , such as kreuzberg museum director martin düspohl , like to put things in perspective : the turks have only been here since the 1960s and it took others much longer to feel at home .
" the huguenots settled here in 1704 , but it took a century for them to stop feeling french , " he says . integration clearly has suffered some drawbacks over the last 15 years , düspohl adds .
rising unemployment and xenophobic attacks have made turkish families wary of their german neighbors and led them to turn inward .
" now people who come here on work placement have to pray during the day , " düspohl says , referring to workers who now demand regular prayer breaks .
" that was n't the case during the 80s . " more headscarves around bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two young women wearing headscarves in kreuzberg .
manuela seidel , the principal of the area 's elementary school , has also seen religion take on a more important role .
" it sounds trite , but there 's more headscarves around , " she says , adding that 93 percent of her 600 students do n't have german parents . integration is a concept seidel would n't associate with the neighborhood .
" you 'd have to integrate the germans here , " she says .

in a last report card for the 10 new countries joining the eu , members of the european parliament praised progress in adapting national laws to those of the union but also pointed out remaining problems . before handing out grades to individual countries , parliamentarians first looked at general problems shared by most accession countries that still need to be resolved .
the new states have adopted more than 80,000 pages of the eu 's common law , the so-called acquis communautaire .
but enforcing the union 's rules continues to be a " major problem , " according to the report . to fix this , countries need something that 's long been eyed with suspicion in existing eu countries - a well-oiled bureaucracy .
" the administrations are too weak overall , " elisabeth schroedter , a german member of the european parliament from the green party who co-wrote the report told dw-world .
she added that many governments have ignored the problem for too long , causing most young people to look for jobs in the private sector , since they do n't get paid as much while working for the government . others agree that finding more well-trained bureaucrats is the biggest challenge the new eu countries face .
" the better the administration , the better the courts , the easier it is to get foreign investment , " said german christian democrat elmar brok , schroedter 's colleague and the report 's head author . without a functioning bureaucracy on the national and especially the regional level , accession countries might also endanger the eu funding they could receive in areas such as agriculture , brok added .
" they know that if they are not fast , they lose money , " he told dw-world . the situation is more difficult for larger countries such as poland that find it more difficult to set up a proper administrative system simply because of their size , brok said .
smaller nations , such as estonia and slovenia , have already made much more progress in this area . food safety is another area that has parliamentarians worried : they criticized delays in some countries to adopt measures preventing the spread of bse , the so-called mad cow disease .
they also called on the european commission to stop the sale of food products from a member state as a last resort to protect consumers in major food scares . finally , legislators asked existing eu member states to reconsider plans not to issue work permits to people from the new countries for the first few years after enlargement .
the report urges member states " to closely study real migratory patterns following the enlargement and to abolish these barriers to free movement as soon as possible .

many see berlin 's kottbusser tor neighborhood as a prime example for failed integration .
but while germans and immigrants might not interact much , they 're getting along just fine , say those living and working there . the tourists nadja sponholz is showing around kreuzberg have n't had to travel far .
a dozen teenagers from berlin 's eastern suburbs , they 've been on a bus for about half an hour to visit the city 's famous multicultural district . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nadja sponholz -lrb- left -rrb- then again , sponholz is n't offering a typical tour .
the 26-year-old history student and kreuzberg native , is trying to breaking down prejudices about a neighborhood many germans - even those living less than a few miles away - do n't dare visit . " i 've never really been here because of that - like you ca n't walk alone in the streets , " said linda lahmert , 16 , who is training to become a secretary . sitting in a turkish café near a square called kottbusser tor , everyone 's now sipping sweetened black tea and listening to sponholz 's stories about her part of town .
stories like the one about fanatical turks who decorate their entire apartments in the colors of their favorite soccer team , or why you should n't smoke in the presence of elderly turkish ladies .
they are anecdotes designed to make kreuzberg seem much less threatening . " i think it 's great that we have this day here , " said lahmert and quickly answers when asked whether she could imagine living here : " why not ?
i could learn turkish . " an immigrant quarter for 300 years it probably wouldn ’ t be a bad idea : turkish has long been the predominant language in the neighborhood . more than half of the people who live here are of foreign extraction . turkish fast food stores , groceries , banks and pharmacies cluster around kottbusser tor , a run-down traffic circle also known as little istanbul .
since the fall of the wall , those who could afford to move elsewhere did so , leaving behind a population that does n't step outside its own culture and speaks little or no german . people from more than 100 countries live here : turks make up the biggest group , followed by immigrants from the former yugoslavia , lebanon and other middle eastern states .
there 's little interaction between the groups and many people depend on social welfare , prompting conservative politicians to see the neighborhood as an example of failed integration and the problems big cities face when trying to integrate foreigners . others , such as kreuzberg museum director martin düspohl , like to put things in perspective : the turks have only been here since the 1960s and it took others much longer to feel at home .
" the huguenots settled here in 1704 , but it took a century for them to stop feeling french , " he says . integration clearly has suffered some drawbacks over the last 15 years , düspohl adds .
rising unemployment and xenophobic attacks have made turkish families wary of their german neighbors and led them to turn inward .
" now people who come here on work placement have to pray during the day , " düspohl says , referring to workers who now demand regular prayer breaks .

many see berlin 's kottbusser tor neighborhood as a prime example for failed integration .
but while germans and immigrants might not interact much , they 're getting along just fine , say those living and working there . the tourists nadja sponholz is showing around kreuzberg have n't had to travel far .
a dozen teenagers from berlin 's eastern suburbs , they 've been on a bus for about half an hour to visit the city 's famous multicultural district . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nadja sponholz -lrb- left -rrb- then again , sponholz is n't offering a typical tour .
the 26-year-old history student and kreuzberg native , is trying to breaking down prejudices about a neighborhood many germans - even those living less than a few miles away - do n't dare visit . " i 've never really been here because of that - like you ca n't walk alone in the streets , " said linda lahmert , 16 , who is training to become a secretary . sitting in a turkish café near a square called kottbusser tor , everyone 's now sipping sweetened black tea and listening to sponholz 's stories about her part of town .
stories like the one about fanatical turks who decorate their entire apartments in the colors of their favorite soccer team , or why you should n't smoke in the presence of elderly turkish ladies .
they are anecdotes designed to make kreuzberg seem much less threatening . " i think it 's great that we have this day here , " said lahmert and quickly answers when asked whether she could imagine living here : " why not ?

there 's little interaction between the groups and many people depend on social welfare , prompting conservative politicians to see the neighborhood as an example of failed integration and the problems big cities face when trying to integrate foreigners . others , such as kreuzberg museum director martin düspohl , like to put things in perspective : the turks have only been here since the 1960s and it took others much longer to feel at home .
" the huguenots settled here in 1704 , but it took a century for them to stop feeling french , " he says . integration clearly has suffered some drawbacks over the last 15 years , düspohl adds .
rising unemployment and xenophobic attacks have made turkish families wary of their german neighbors and led them to turn inward .

in a last report card for the 10 new countries joining the eu , members of the european parliament praised progress in adapting national laws to those of the union but also pointed out remaining problems . before handing out grades to individual countries , parliamentarians first looked at general problems shared by most accession countries that still need to be resolved .
the new states have adopted more than 80,000 pages of the eu 's common law , the so-called acquis communautaire .
but enforcing the union 's rules continues to be a " major problem , " according to the report . to fix this , countries need something that 's long been eyed with suspicion in existing eu countries - a well-oiled bureaucracy .
" the administrations are too weak overall , " elisabeth schroedter , a german member of the european parliament from the green party who co-wrote the report told dw-world .
she added that many governments have ignored the problem for too long , causing most young people to look for jobs in the private sector , since they do n't get paid as much while working for the government . others agree that finding more well-trained bureaucrats is the biggest challenge the new eu countries face .
" the better the administration , the better the courts , the easier it is to get foreign investment , " said german christian democrat elmar brok , schroedter 's colleague and the report 's head author . without a functioning bureaucracy on the national and especially the regional level , accession countries might also endanger the eu funding they could receive in areas such as agriculture , brok added .
" they know that if they are not fast , they lose money , " he told dw-world . the situation is more difficult for larger countries such as poland that find it more difficult to set up a proper administrative system simply because of their size , brok said .
smaller nations , such as estonia and slovenia , have already made much more progress in this area . food safety is another area that has parliamentarians worried : they criticized delays in some countries to adopt measures preventing the spread of bse , the so-called mad cow disease .
they also called on the european commission to stop the sale of food products from a member state as a last resort to protect consumers in major food scares . finally , legislators asked existing eu member states to reconsider plans not to issue work permits to people from the new countries for the first few years after enlargement .
the report urges member states " to closely study real migratory patterns following the enlargement and to abolish these barriers to free movement as soon as possible .

many see berlin 's kottbusser tor neighborhood as a prime example for failed integration .
but while germans and immigrants might not interact much , they 're getting along just fine , say those living and working there . the tourists nadja sponholz is showing around kreuzberg have n't had to travel far .
a dozen teenagers from berlin 's eastern suburbs , they 've been on a bus for about half an hour to visit the city 's famous multicultural district . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nadja sponholz -lrb- left -rrb- then again , sponholz is n't offering a typical tour .
the 26-year-old history student and kreuzberg native , is trying to breaking down prejudices about a neighborhood many germans - even those living less than a few miles away - do n't dare visit . " i 've never really been here because of that - like you ca n't walk alone in the streets , " said linda lahmert , 16 , who is training to become a secretary . sitting in a turkish café near a square called kottbusser tor , everyone 's now sipping sweetened black tea and listening to sponholz 's stories about her part of town .
stories like the one about fanatical turks who decorate their entire apartments in the colors of their favorite soccer team , or why you should n't smoke in the presence of elderly turkish ladies .
they are anecdotes designed to make kreuzberg seem much less threatening . " i think it 's great that we have this day here , " said lahmert and quickly answers when asked whether she could imagine living here : " why not ?
i could learn turkish . " an immigrant quarter for 300 years it probably wouldn ’ t be a bad idea : turkish has long been the predominant language in the neighborhood . more than half of the people who live here are of foreign extraction . turkish fast food stores , groceries , banks and pharmacies cluster around kottbusser tor , a run-down traffic circle also known as little istanbul .
since the fall of the wall , those who could afford to move elsewhere did so , leaving behind a population that does n't step outside its own culture and speaks little or no german . people from more than 100 countries live here : turks make up the biggest group , followed by immigrants from the former yugoslavia , lebanon and other middle eastern states .
there 's little interaction between the groups and many people depend on social welfare , prompting conservative politicians to see the neighborhood as an example of failed integration and the problems big cities face when trying to integrate foreigners . others , such as kreuzberg museum director martin düspohl , like to put things in perspective : the turks have only been here since the 1960s and it took others much longer to feel at home .
" the huguenots settled here in 1704 , but it took a century for them to stop feeling french , " he says . integration clearly has suffered some drawbacks over the last 15 years , düspohl adds .
rising unemployment and xenophobic attacks have made turkish families wary of their german neighbors and led them to turn inward .
" now people who come here on work placement have to pray during the day , " düspohl says , referring to workers who now demand regular prayer breaks .
" that was n't the case during the 80s . " more headscarves around bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two young women wearing headscarves in kreuzberg .
manuela seidel , the principal of the area 's elementary school , has also seen religion take on a more important role .
" it sounds trite , but there 's more headscarves around , " she says , adding that 93 percent of her 600 students do n't have german parents . integration is a concept seidel would n't associate with the neighborhood .
" you 'd have to integrate the germans here , " she says .
" every -lrb- ethnic -rrb- group lives by itself and tolerates the other as far as i can tell . " seidel has been trying to get parents more involved in school activities .
few , however , have shown interest so far , she says .
living in an area where everyone from the grocer to the doctor speaks turkish doesn ’ t help integration along , either . " i do n't have to speak german to get by around here , " seidel said , adding that she wants to give her students the necessary tools to succeed .
" i do n't want to take away their culture , but i want them to be able to lead average , central european lives without having to rely on social welfare .

stories like the one about fanatical turks who decorate their entire apartments in the colors of their favorite soccer team , or why you should n't smoke in the presence of elderly turkish ladies .
they are anecdotes designed to make kreuzberg seem much less threatening . " i think it 's great that we have this day here , " said lahmert and quickly answers when asked whether she could imagine living here : " why not ?
i could learn turkish . " an immigrant quarter for 300 years it probably wouldn ’ t be a bad idea : turkish has long been the predominant language in the neighborhood . more than half of the people who live here are of foreign extraction . turkish fast food stores , groceries , banks and pharmacies cluster around kottbusser tor , a run-down traffic circle also known as little istanbul .
since the fall of the wall , those who could afford to move elsewhere did so , leaving behind a population that does n't step outside its own culture and speaks little or no german . people from more than 100 countries live here : turks make up the biggest group , followed by immigrants from the former yugoslavia , lebanon and other middle eastern states .
there 's little interaction between the groups and many people depend on social welfare , prompting conservative politicians to see the neighborhood as an example of failed integration and the problems big cities face when trying to integrate foreigners . others , such as kreuzberg museum director martin düspohl , like to put things in perspective : the turks have only been here since the 1960s and it took others much longer to feel at home .
" the huguenots settled here in 1704 , but it took a century for them to stop feeling french , " he says . integration clearly has suffered some drawbacks over the last 15 years , düspohl adds .
rising unemployment and xenophobic attacks have made turkish families wary of their german neighbors and led them to turn inward .
" now people who come here on work placement have to pray during the day , " düspohl says , referring to workers who now demand regular prayer breaks .
" that was n't the case during the 80s . " more headscarves around bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two young women wearing headscarves in kreuzberg .
manuela seidel , the principal of the area 's elementary school , has also seen religion take on a more important role .
" it sounds trite , but there 's more headscarves around , " she says , adding that 93 percent of her 600 students do n't have german parents . integration is a concept seidel would n't associate with the neighborhood .
" you 'd have to integrate the germans here , " she says .
" every -lrb- ethnic -rrb- group lives by itself and tolerates the other as far as i can tell . " seidel has been trying to get parents more involved in school activities .
few , however , have shown interest so far , she says .
living in an area where everyone from the grocer to the doctor speaks turkish doesn ’ t help integration along , either . " i do n't have to speak german to get by around here , " seidel said , adding that she wants to give her students the necessary tools to succeed .
" i do n't want to take away their culture , but i want them to be able to lead average , central european lives without having to rely on social welfare .

in a last report card for the 10 new countries joining the eu , members of the european parliament praised progress in adapting national laws to those of the union but also pointed out remaining problems . before handing out grades to individual countries , parliamentarians first looked at general problems shared by most accession countries that still need to be resolved .
the new states have adopted more than 80,000 pages of the eu 's common law , the so-called acquis communautaire .
but enforcing the union 's rules continues to be a " major problem , " according to the report . to fix this , countries need something that 's long been eyed with suspicion in existing eu countries - a well-oiled bureaucracy .
" the administrations are too weak overall , " elisabeth schroedter , a german member of the european parliament from the green party who co-wrote the report told dw-world .
she added that many governments have ignored the problem for too long , causing most young people to look for jobs in the private sector , since they do n't get paid as much while working for the government . others agree that finding more well-trained bureaucrats is the biggest challenge the new eu countries face .
" the better the administration , the better the courts , the easier it is to get foreign investment , " said german christian democrat elmar brok , schroedter 's colleague and the report 's head author . without a functioning bureaucracy on the national and especially the regional level , accession countries might also endanger the eu funding they could receive in areas such as agriculture , brok added .
" they know that if they are not fast , they lose money , " he told dw-world . the situation is more difficult for larger countries such as poland that find it more difficult to set up a proper administrative system simply because of their size , brok said .
smaller nations , such as estonia and slovenia , have already made much more progress in this area . food safety is another area that has parliamentarians worried : they criticized delays in some countries to adopt measures preventing the spread of bse , the so-called mad cow disease .
they also called on the european commission to stop the sale of food products from a member state as a last resort to protect consumers in major food scares . finally , legislators asked existing eu member states to reconsider plans not to issue work permits to people from the new countries for the first few years after enlargement .

many see berlin 's kottbusser tor neighborhood as a prime example for failed integration .
but while germans and immigrants might not interact much , they 're getting along just fine , say those living and working there . the tourists nadja sponholz is showing around kreuzberg have n't had to travel far .
a dozen teenagers from berlin 's eastern suburbs , they 've been on a bus for about half an hour to visit the city 's famous multicultural district . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nadja sponholz -lrb- left -rrb- then again , sponholz is n't offering a typical tour .

" i 've never really been here because of that - like you ca n't walk alone in the streets , " said linda lahmert , 16 , who is training to become a secretary . sitting in a turkish café near a square called kottbusser tor , everyone 's now sipping sweetened black tea and listening to sponholz 's stories about her part of town .
stories like the one about fanatical turks who decorate their entire apartments in the colors of their favorite soccer team , or why you should n't smoke in the presence of elderly turkish ladies .
they are anecdotes designed to make kreuzberg seem much less threatening . " i think it 's great that we have this day here , " said lahmert and quickly answers when asked whether she could imagine living here : " why not ?
i could learn turkish . " an immigrant quarter for 300 years it probably wouldn ’ t be a bad idea : turkish has long been the predominant language in the neighborhood . more than half of the people who live here are of foreign extraction . turkish fast food stores , groceries , banks and pharmacies cluster around kottbusser tor , a run-down traffic circle also known as little istanbul .

there 's little interaction between the groups and many people depend on social welfare , prompting conservative politicians to see the neighborhood as an example of failed integration and the problems big cities face when trying to integrate foreigners . others , such as kreuzberg museum director martin düspohl , like to put things in perspective : the turks have only been here since the 1960s and it took others much longer to feel at home .
" the huguenots settled here in 1704 , but it took a century for them to stop feeling french , " he says . integration clearly has suffered some drawbacks over the last 15 years , düspohl adds .
rising unemployment and xenophobic attacks have made turkish families wary of their german neighbors and led them to turn inward .
" now people who come here on work placement have to pray during the day , " düspohl says , referring to workers who now demand regular prayer breaks .
" that was n't the case during the 80s . " more headscarves around bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two young women wearing headscarves in kreuzberg .

" it sounds trite , but there 's more headscarves around , " she says , adding that 93 percent of her 600 students do n't have german parents . integration is a concept seidel would n't associate with the neighborhood .

many see berlin 's kottbusser tor neighborhood as a prime example for failed integration .
but while germans and immigrants might not interact much , they 're getting along just fine , say those living and working there . the tourists nadja sponholz is showing around kreuzberg have n't had to travel far .
a dozen teenagers from berlin 's eastern suburbs , they 've been on a bus for about half an hour to visit the city 's famous multicultural district . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nadja sponholz -lrb- left -rrb- then again , sponholz is n't offering a typical tour .
the 26-year-old history student and kreuzberg native , is trying to breaking down prejudices about a neighborhood many germans - even those living less than a few miles away - do n't dare visit . " i 've never really been here because of that - like you ca n't walk alone in the streets , " said linda lahmert , 16 , who is training to become a secretary . sitting in a turkish café near a square called kottbusser tor , everyone 's now sipping sweetened black tea and listening to sponholz 's stories about her part of town .
stories like the one about fanatical turks who decorate their entire apartments in the colors of their favorite soccer team , or why you should n't smoke in the presence of elderly turkish ladies .
they are anecdotes designed to make kreuzberg seem much less threatening . " i think it 's great that we have this day here , " said lahmert and quickly answers when asked whether she could imagine living here : " why not ?

" the huguenots settled here in 1704 , but it took a century for them to stop feeling french , " he says . integration clearly has suffered some drawbacks over the last 15 years , düspohl adds .
rising unemployment and xenophobic attacks have made turkish families wary of their german neighbors and led them to turn inward .

many see berlin 's kottbusser tor neighborhood as a prime example for failed integration .
but while germans and immigrants might not interact much , they 're getting along just fine , say those living and working there . the tourists nadja sponholz is showing around kreuzberg have n't had to travel far .
a dozen teenagers from berlin 's eastern suburbs , they 've been on a bus for about half an hour to visit the city 's famous multicultural district . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nadja sponholz -lrb- left -rrb- then again , sponholz is n't offering a typical tour .
the 26-year-old history student and kreuzberg native , is trying to breaking down prejudices about a neighborhood many germans - even those living less than a few miles away - do n't dare visit . " i 've never really been here because of that - like you ca n't walk alone in the streets , " said linda lahmert , 16 , who is training to become a secretary . sitting in a turkish café near a square called kottbusser tor , everyone 's now sipping sweetened black tea and listening to sponholz 's stories about her part of town .
stories like the one about fanatical turks who decorate their entire apartments in the colors of their favorite soccer team , or why you should n't smoke in the presence of elderly turkish ladies .
they are anecdotes designed to make kreuzberg seem much less threatening . " i think it 's great that we have this day here , " said lahmert and quickly answers when asked whether she could imagine living here : " why not ?
i could learn turkish . " an immigrant quarter for 300 years it probably wouldn ’ t be a bad idea : turkish has long been the predominant language in the neighborhood . more than half of the people who live here are of foreign extraction . turkish fast food stores , groceries , banks and pharmacies cluster around kottbusser tor , a run-down traffic circle also known as little istanbul .
since the fall of the wall , those who could afford to move elsewhere did so , leaving behind a population that does n't step outside its own culture and speaks little or no german . people from more than 100 countries live here : turks make up the biggest group , followed by immigrants from the former yugoslavia , lebanon and other middle eastern states .
there 's little interaction between the groups and many people depend on social welfare , prompting conservative politicians to see the neighborhood as an example of failed integration and the problems big cities face when trying to integrate foreigners . others , such as kreuzberg museum director martin düspohl , like to put things in perspective : the turks have only been here since the 1960s and it took others much longer to feel at home .
" the huguenots settled here in 1704 , but it took a century for them to stop feeling french , " he says . integration clearly has suffered some drawbacks over the last 15 years , düspohl adds .
rising unemployment and xenophobic attacks have made turkish families wary of their german neighbors and led them to turn inward .
" now people who come here on work placement have to pray during the day , " düspohl says , referring to workers who now demand regular prayer breaks .
" that was n't the case during the 80s . " more headscarves around bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two young women wearing headscarves in kreuzberg .
manuela seidel , the principal of the area 's elementary school , has also seen religion take on a more important role .
" it sounds trite , but there 's more headscarves around , " she says , adding that 93 percent of her 600 students do n't have german parents . integration is a concept seidel would n't associate with the neighborhood .
" you 'd have to integrate the germans here , " she says .
" every -lrb- ethnic -rrb- group lives by itself and tolerates the other as far as i can tell . " seidel has been trying to get parents more involved in school activities .
few , however , have shown interest so far , she says .
living in an area where everyone from the grocer to the doctor speaks turkish doesn ’ t help integration along , either . " i do n't have to speak german to get by around here , " seidel said , adding that she wants to give her students the necessary tools to succeed .
" i do n't want to take away their culture , but i want them to be able to lead average , central european lives without having to rely on social welfare .

greek cypriots on saturday voted overwhelmingly against reunification with turkish cypriots , sounding the death knell for a un-backed peace plan to end a 30-year division of the island . television exit polls forecast that the greek cypriots voted against the u.n. blueprint in large numbers , while the turkish cypriots voted heavily in favor . the polls on the south of the island said 78.5 percent of greek cypriots had rejected the plan .
a separate exit poll by turkey 's private cnn-turk television found 61 percent of turkish cypriots accepted the plan .
the rejection means that only greek cypriots will enter the european union on may 1 . greek and turkish cypriots were voting in separate referendums on whether to accept a peace plan drawn up by un secretary-general kofi anan in reuniting the island that has been divided for 30 years ever since turkey invaded the north in the wake of a greek cypriot coup in an attempt to unite the island with greece .
a mined no-man 's land , the " green line , " which is policed by u.n. peacekeepers , separates the northern one-third of the island from the south . papadopoulos gets his way but the peace plan 's outcome was more or less sealed after prominent greek cypriot leaders said they were unhappy with the details that favored the turkish cypriots .
the plan envisaged a federation of two politically equal states , one for the 643,000 greek cypriots and one for the 180,000 turks and turkish cypriots in the north , under a weak central government . greek cypriot leaders in particular objected to the fact that the blueprint restricts the rights of an estimated 200,000 refugees to return to their former homes in the north , while allowing more than 60,000 settlers from turkey to remain on the island . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tassos papadopoulos greek cypriot president tassos papadopoulos along with his nationalist allies has been accused of running a campaign playing on greek cypriot fears that turkey and the turkish cypriots would fail to hand back nine percent of the island 's territory and gradually withdraw 38,000 turkish troops . earlier on saturday papdopoulos cast his vote and said , " today 's voting will determine the future of our country .

" denktash : voters did n't know the plan for his part , veteran turkish cypriot leader rauf denktash , who also vociferously opposed the peace plan in the face of widespread support for it among his own people , said that cypriots did n't really know the 220-page document they were voting on . " unfortunately we are not voting for a document that has been agreed on , but a document that has not been agreed on , " he said .
" we are not voting for harmony , peace and agreement , but disagreement . " denktash criticized the international community for forcing the referendums on cypriots .
" this could not have been done in europe because they are treated as civilzed people , " he said .
" we are cypriots ; we can be pushed around , kicked around and told what to do . " many turkish cypriot ssupported the " yes " vote because they saw the plan as a path to greater prosperity and entry into the eu .
turkish cyprus has been isolated for years .

the united states , which has been campaigning to convince cypriots to vote " yes , " has accused the semi-governmental cyprus broadcasting corporation -lrb- cbc -rrb- of restricting press coverage for the plan 's proponents .
cypriot television aired a two-hour , prime-time interview with papadopoulos , but u.s. diplomats claim cbc has stopped interviewing foreign officials . european union enlargement commissioner günter verheugen said he felt " cheated " by the greek cypriot government , which had always pushed hard for a reunified cyprus to join the eu .

greek cypriots on saturday voted overwhelmingly against reunification with turkish cypriots , sounding the death knell for a un-backed peace plan to end a 30-year division of the island . television exit polls forecast that the greek cypriots voted against the u.n. blueprint in large numbers , while the turkish cypriots voted heavily in favor . the polls on the south of the island said 78.5 percent of greek cypriots had rejected the plan .
a separate exit poll by turkey 's private cnn-turk television found 61 percent of turkish cypriots accepted the plan .
the rejection means that only greek cypriots will enter the european union on may 1 . greek and turkish cypriots were voting in separate referendums on whether to accept a peace plan drawn up by un secretary-general kofi anan in reuniting the island that has been divided for 30 years ever since turkey invaded the north in the wake of a greek cypriot coup in an attempt to unite the island with greece .
a mined no-man 's land , the " green line , " which is policed by u.n. peacekeepers , separates the northern one-third of the island from the south . papadopoulos gets his way but the peace plan 's outcome was more or less sealed after prominent greek cypriot leaders said they were unhappy with the details that favored the turkish cypriots .
the plan envisaged a federation of two politically equal states , one for the 643,000 greek cypriots and one for the 180,000 turks and turkish cypriots in the north , under a weak central government . greek cypriot leaders in particular objected to the fact that the blueprint restricts the rights of an estimated 200,000 refugees to return to their former homes in the north , while allowing more than 60,000 settlers from turkey to remain on the island . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tassos papadopoulos greek cypriot president tassos papadopoulos along with his nationalist allies has been accused of running a campaign playing on greek cypriot fears that turkey and the turkish cypriots would fail to hand back nine percent of the island 's territory and gradually withdraw 38,000 turkish troops . earlier on saturday papdopoulos cast his vote and said , " today 's voting will determine the future of our country .
greek cypriots and turkish cypriots deserve better days and i am sure these will come . " denktash : voters did n't know the plan for his part , veteran turkish cypriot leader rauf denktash , who also vociferously opposed the peace plan in the face of widespread support for it among his own people , said that cypriots did n't really know the 220-page document they were voting on . " unfortunately we are not voting for a document that has been agreed on , but a document that has not been agreed on , " he said .
" we are not voting for harmony , peace and agreement , but disagreement . " denktash criticized the international community for forcing the referendums on cypriots .
" this could not have been done in europe because they are treated as civilzed people , " he said .
" we are cypriots ; we can be pushed around , kicked around and told what to do . " many turkish cypriot ssupported the " yes " vote because they saw the plan as a path to greater prosperity and entry into the eu .

the united states , which has been campaigning to convince cypriots to vote " yes , " has accused the semi-governmental cyprus broadcasting corporation -lrb- cbc -rrb- of restricting press coverage for the plan 's proponents .
cypriot television aired a two-hour , prime-time interview with papadopoulos , but u.s. diplomats claim cbc has stopped interviewing foreign officials . european union enlargement commissioner günter verheugen said he felt " cheated " by the greek cypriot government , which had always pushed hard for a reunified cyprus to join the eu .

the move would affect a major planned alliance between daimlerchrysler and hyundai motors to jointly build heavy trucks and the yearly delivery of 50,000 truck engines to hyundai . quoting company sources , germany 's wirtschaftswoche financial news magazine said profitable hyundai had cold feet amid worries that daimlerchrysler , the world 's fifth-biggest automaker , would use the deal to seek greater influence over hyundi , as is currently happening to the troubled japanese automotive group mitsubishi motors . daimlerchrysler ' finance director manfred gentz earlier said that all cooperations with hyundai would continue as planned , but added that the strategic urgency of the joint trucking venture with hyundai was no longer as significant as when the two joined forces in 2001 . mercedes-benz chinese plans angers hyundai bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a mercedes-benz e-class car according to media reports , hyundai chief park hwang-ho is irked at the chinese expansion plans of mercedes-benz , a subsidiary of daimlerchrsyler .

daimlerchrysler has an investment stake of just more than 10 percent in hyundai motors , which is part of the hyundai industrial group . daimlerchrsyler to review asian strategy kim yong-duk , vice president of keb commerz investment trust management in seoul , told the wirtschaftswoche that hyundai did not want to become " just another element in the shaky world inc. of herr schrempp -lsb- daimlerchrysler chief executive juergen schrempp -rsb- but rise to the top by its own efforts " . the magazine said a separate project to jointly manufacture truck engines was also unlikely to be carried out , but the two groups would persist in plans to make car engines together . though daimlerchrysler has not categorically confirmed the end of the joint trucking venture with hyundai , the negotiations which have dragged on for the past one and a half years , have reportedly been difficult .

but the decision came as a blow to daimlerchrysler ceo jürgen schrempp 's vision to turn the company into a worldwide player . after the 1998 merger with chrysler , schrempp had bought 37 percent of the japanese company three years ago , making daimlerchrysler mitsubishi 's largest shareholder .

greek cypriots on saturday voted overwhelmingly against reunification with turkish cypriots , sounding the death knell for a un-backed peace plan to end a 30-year division of the island . television exit polls forecast that the greek cypriots voted against the u.n. blueprint in large numbers , while the turkish cypriots voted heavily in favor . the polls on the south of the island said 78.5 percent of greek cypriots had rejected the plan .
a separate exit poll by turkey 's private cnn-turk television found 61 percent of turkish cypriots accepted the plan .
the rejection means that only greek cypriots will enter the european union on may 1 . greek and turkish cypriots were voting in separate referendums on whether to accept a peace plan drawn up by un secretary-general kofi anan in reuniting the island that has been divided for 30 years ever since turkey invaded the north in the wake of a greek cypriot coup in an attempt to unite the island with greece .

the plan envisaged a federation of two politically equal states , one for the 643,000 greek cypriots and one for the 180,000 turks and turkish cypriots in the north , under a weak central government . greek cypriot leaders in particular objected to the fact that the blueprint restricts the rights of an estimated 200,000 refugees to return to their former homes in the north , while allowing more than 60,000 settlers from turkey to remain on the island . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tassos papadopoulos greek cypriot president tassos papadopoulos along with his nationalist allies has been accused of running a campaign playing on greek cypriot fears that turkey and the turkish cypriots would fail to hand back nine percent of the island 's territory and gradually withdraw 38,000 turkish troops . earlier on saturday papdopoulos cast his vote and said , " today 's voting will determine the future of our country .

greek cypriots on saturday voted overwhelmingly against reunification with turkish cypriots , sounding the death knell for a un-backed peace plan to end a 30-year division of the island . television exit polls forecast that the greek cypriots voted against the u.n. blueprint in large numbers , while the turkish cypriots voted heavily in favor . the polls on the south of the island said 78.5 percent of greek cypriots had rejected the plan .
a separate exit poll by turkey 's private cnn-turk television found 61 percent of turkish cypriots accepted the plan .
the rejection means that only greek cypriots will enter the european union on may 1 . greek and turkish cypriots were voting in separate referendums on whether to accept a peace plan drawn up by un secretary-general kofi anan in reuniting the island that has been divided for 30 years ever since turkey invaded the north in the wake of a greek cypriot coup in an attempt to unite the island with greece .

daimlerchrysler 's woes in the asian market deepened with south korean partner hyundai motors planning to scrap a joint truck venture .
earlier daimler abandoned beleaguered japanese partner mitsubishi motors corp. the south korean carmaker hyundai motors is planning to drop all cooperation projects with german carmaker daimlerchrysler in the coming week , according to media reports .
the move would affect a major planned alliance between daimlerchrysler and hyundai motors to jointly build heavy trucks and the yearly delivery of 50,000 truck engines to hyundai . quoting company sources , germany 's wirtschaftswoche financial news magazine said profitable hyundai had cold feet amid worries that daimlerchrysler , the world 's fifth-biggest automaker , would use the deal to seek greater influence over hyundi , as is currently happening to the troubled japanese automotive group mitsubishi motors . daimlerchrysler ' finance director manfred gentz earlier said that all cooperations with hyundai would continue as planned , but added that the strategic urgency of the joint trucking venture with hyundai was no longer as significant as when the two joined forces in 2001 . mercedes-benz chinese plans angers hyundai bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a mercedes-benz e-class car according to media reports , hyundai chief park hwang-ho is irked at the chinese expansion plans of mercedes-benz , a subsidiary of daimlerchrsyler .
starting 2005 , mercedes together with chinese manufacturer beijing automotive industry company -lrb- baic -rrb- wants to produce mercedes c-class and e-class -lrb- photo -rrb- models for the chinese market . but since hyundai itself has a cooperation with baic , it insists that baic deal exclusively with it for 30 years .
experts believe that if the south koreans get their way , mercedes-benz will be no longer be able to begin car production in china .
daimlerchrysler has an investment stake of just more than 10 percent in hyundai motors , which is part of the hyundai industrial group . daimlerchrsyler to review asian strategy kim yong-duk , vice president of keb commerz investment trust management in seoul , told the wirtschaftswoche that hyundai did not want to become " just another element in the shaky world inc. of herr schrempp -lsb- daimlerchrysler chief executive juergen schrempp -rsb- but rise to the top by its own efforts " . the magazine said a separate project to jointly manufacture truck engines was also unlikely to be carried out , but the two groups would persist in plans to make car engines together . though daimlerchrysler has not categorically confirmed the end of the joint trucking venture with hyundai , the negotiations which have dragged on for the past one and a half years , have reportedly been difficult .
gentz said daimlerchrysler would fundamentally review its asian strategy . daimlerchrsyler abandons mitsubishi motors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the headquarters of mitsubishi motors corp. in tokyo on friday , daimlerchrysler company executives announced they had abandoned plans to rescue ailing carmaker mitsubishi with a multi-billion-dollar investment . daimler shares rose as investors expressed relief as what appeared to be the end of the of its costly entanglement with japan 's only unprofitable carmaker .
but the decision came as a blow to daimlerchrysler ceo jürgen schrempp 's vision to turn the company into a worldwide player . after the 1998 merger with chrysler , schrempp had bought 37 percent of the japanese company three years ago , making daimlerchrysler mitsubishi 's largest shareholder .
mitsubishi is expecting a 72 billion yen -lrb- € 557.8 million , $ 659.4 million -rrb- loss for the fiscal year ending march 31 . daimlerchrysler officials on friday said injecting more money into mitsubishi made no sense for them , saying it would require a " very , very high capital infusion . " they added that they did n't know yet what they would do with their shares . " there is no decision for selling out stake and we are not looking for someone to buy it , " daimlerchrysler chief financial officer manfred gentz said , according to ap news agency .
in response , the mitsubishi group of companies , which holds the majority of mitsubishi motor shares , announced that it would " do their best " to revive the car maker . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de daimler forges engines joint venture with mitsubishi , hyundai in further pursuit of its globalization , daimlerchrysler is to set up a joint venture with japan 's mitsubishi motors and korea 's hyundai motor .

in a last report card for the 10 new countries joining the eu , members of the european parliament praised progress in adapting national laws to those of the union but also pointed out remaining problems . before handing out grades to individual countries , parliamentarians first looked at general problems shared by most accession countries that still need to be resolved .
the new states have adopted more than 80,000 pages of the eu 's common law , the so-called acquis communautaire .
but enforcing the union 's rules continues to be a " major problem , " according to the report . to fix this , countries need something that 's long been eyed with suspicion in existing eu countries - a well-oiled bureaucracy .
" the administrations are too weak overall , " elisabeth schroedter , a german member of the european parliament from the green party who co-wrote the report told dw-world .
she added that many governments have ignored the problem for too long , causing most young people to look for jobs in the private sector , since they do n't get paid as much while working for the government . others agree that finding more well-trained bureaucrats is the biggest challenge the new eu countries face .
" the better the administration , the better the courts , the easier it is to get foreign investment , " said german christian democrat elmar brok , schroedter 's colleague and the report 's head author . without a functioning bureaucracy on the national and especially the regional level , accession countries might also endanger the eu funding they could receive in areas such as agriculture , brok added .
" they know that if they are not fast , they lose money , " he told dw-world . the situation is more difficult for larger countries such as poland that find it more difficult to set up a proper administrative system simply because of their size , brok said .
smaller nations , such as estonia and slovenia , have already made much more progress in this area . food safety is another area that has parliamentarians worried : they criticized delays in some countries to adopt measures preventing the spread of bse , the so-called mad cow disease .
they also called on the european commission to stop the sale of food products from a member state as a last resort to protect consumers in major food scares . finally , legislators asked existing eu member states to reconsider plans not to issue work permits to people from the new countries for the first few years after enlargement .

in a last report card for the 10 new countries joining the eu , members of the european parliament praised progress in adapting national laws to those of the union but also pointed out remaining problems . before handing out grades to individual countries , parliamentarians first looked at general problems shared by most accession countries that still need to be resolved .
the new states have adopted more than 80,000 pages of the eu 's common law , the so-called acquis communautaire .
but enforcing the union 's rules continues to be a " major problem , " according to the report . to fix this , countries need something that 's long been eyed with suspicion in existing eu countries - a well-oiled bureaucracy .
" the administrations are too weak overall , " elisabeth schroedter , a german member of the european parliament from the green party who co-wrote the report told dw-world .
she added that many governments have ignored the problem for too long , causing most young people to look for jobs in the private sector , since they do n't get paid as much while working for the government . others agree that finding more well-trained bureaucrats is the biggest challenge the new eu countries face .
" the better the administration , the better the courts , the easier it is to get foreign investment , " said german christian democrat elmar brok , schroedter 's colleague and the report 's head author . without a functioning bureaucracy on the national and especially the regional level , accession countries might also endanger the eu funding they could receive in areas such as agriculture , brok added .
" they know that if they are not fast , they lose money , " he told dw-world . the situation is more difficult for larger countries such as poland that find it more difficult to set up a proper administrative system simply because of their size , brok said .
smaller nations , such as estonia and slovenia , have already made much more progress in this area . food safety is another area that has parliamentarians worried : they criticized delays in some countries to adopt measures preventing the spread of bse , the so-called mad cow disease .
they also called on the european commission to stop the sale of food products from a member state as a last resort to protect consumers in major food scares . finally , legislators asked existing eu member states to reconsider plans not to issue work permits to people from the new countries for the first few years after enlargement .
the report urges member states " to closely study real migratory patterns following the enlargement and to abolish these barriers to free movement as soon as possible .

in a last report card for the 10 new countries joining the eu , members of the european parliament praised progress in adapting national laws to those of the union but also pointed out remaining problems . before handing out grades to individual countries , parliamentarians first looked at general problems shared by most accession countries that still need to be resolved .
the new states have adopted more than 80,000 pages of the eu 's common law , the so-called acquis communautaire .
but enforcing the union 's rules continues to be a " major problem , " according to the report . to fix this , countries need something that 's long been eyed with suspicion in existing eu countries - a well-oiled bureaucracy .
" the administrations are too weak overall , " elisabeth schroedter , a german member of the european parliament from the green party who co-wrote the report told dw-world .
she added that many governments have ignored the problem for too long , causing most young people to look for jobs in the private sector , since they do n't get paid as much while working for the government . others agree that finding more well-trained bureaucrats is the biggest challenge the new eu countries face .
" the better the administration , the better the courts , the easier it is to get foreign investment , " said german christian democrat elmar brok , schroedter 's colleague and the report 's head author . without a functioning bureaucracy on the national and especially the regional level , accession countries might also endanger the eu funding they could receive in areas such as agriculture , brok added .
" they know that if they are not fast , they lose money , " he told dw-world . the situation is more difficult for larger countries such as poland that find it more difficult to set up a proper administrative system simply because of their size , brok said .
smaller nations , such as estonia and slovenia , have already made much more progress in this area . food safety is another area that has parliamentarians worried : they criticized delays in some countries to adopt measures preventing the spread of bse , the so-called mad cow disease .
they also called on the european commission to stop the sale of food products from a member state as a last resort to protect consumers in major food scares . finally , legislators asked existing eu member states to reconsider plans not to issue work permits to people from the new countries for the first few years after enlargement .

many see berlin 's kottbusser tor neighborhood as a prime example for failed integration .
but while germans and immigrants might not interact much , they 're getting along just fine , say those living and working there . the tourists nadja sponholz is showing around kreuzberg have n't had to travel far .
a dozen teenagers from berlin 's eastern suburbs , they 've been on a bus for about half an hour to visit the city 's famous multicultural district . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nadja sponholz -lrb- left -rrb- then again , sponholz is n't offering a typical tour .
the 26-year-old history student and kreuzberg native , is trying to breaking down prejudices about a neighborhood many germans - even those living less than a few miles away - do n't dare visit . " i 've never really been here because of that - like you ca n't walk alone in the streets , " said linda lahmert , 16 , who is training to become a secretary . sitting in a turkish café near a square called kottbusser tor , everyone 's now sipping sweetened black tea and listening to sponholz 's stories about her part of town .
stories like the one about fanatical turks who decorate their entire apartments in the colors of their favorite soccer team , or why you should n't smoke in the presence of elderly turkish ladies .
they are anecdotes designed to make kreuzberg seem much less threatening . " i think it 's great that we have this day here , " said lahmert and quickly answers when asked whether she could imagine living here : " why not ?
i could learn turkish . " an immigrant quarter for 300 years it probably wouldn ’ t be a bad idea : turkish has long been the predominant language in the neighborhood . more than half of the people who live here are of foreign extraction . turkish fast food stores , groceries , banks and pharmacies cluster around kottbusser tor , a run-down traffic circle also known as little istanbul .
since the fall of the wall , those who could afford to move elsewhere did so , leaving behind a population that does n't step outside its own culture and speaks little or no german . people from more than 100 countries live here : turks make up the biggest group , followed by immigrants from the former yugoslavia , lebanon and other middle eastern states .
there 's little interaction between the groups and many people depend on social welfare , prompting conservative politicians to see the neighborhood as an example of failed integration and the problems big cities face when trying to integrate foreigners . others , such as kreuzberg museum director martin düspohl , like to put things in perspective : the turks have only been here since the 1960s and it took others much longer to feel at home .
" the huguenots settled here in 1704 , but it took a century for them to stop feeling french , " he says . integration clearly has suffered some drawbacks over the last 15 years , düspohl adds .
rising unemployment and xenophobic attacks have made turkish families wary of their german neighbors and led them to turn inward .
" now people who come here on work placement have to pray during the day , " düspohl says , referring to workers who now demand regular prayer breaks .
" that was n't the case during the 80s . " more headscarves around bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two young women wearing headscarves in kreuzberg .
manuela seidel , the principal of the area 's elementary school , has also seen religion take on a more important role .
" it sounds trite , but there 's more headscarves around , " she says , adding that 93 percent of her 600 students do n't have german parents . integration is a concept seidel would n't associate with the neighborhood .
" you 'd have to integrate the germans here , " she says .
" every -lrb- ethnic -rrb- group lives by itself and tolerates the other as far as i can tell . " seidel has been trying to get parents more involved in school activities .
few , however , have shown interest so far , she says .
living in an area where everyone from the grocer to the doctor speaks turkish doesn ’ t help integration along , either . " i do n't have to speak german to get by around here , " seidel said , adding that she wants to give her students the necessary tools to succeed .
" i do n't want to take away their culture , but i want them to be able to lead average , central european lives without having to rely on social welfare .

the 22-year-old dreams of opening his own turkish restaurant and attends a school to learn how to be a manager .
he gets his practical training at burger king . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fatih haslak in his spare time , haslak -lrb- photo -rrb- comes to mevlana mosque , which sits at the bottom of a dilapidated apartment complex that towers over kottbusser tor .
he 's the mosque 's secretary and assures visitors that this is a place that 's open to anyone . " we do n't have any problems with other cultures , " he said , adding that he unfortunately does n't have time to find german friends .
haslak sees the increase in women wearing headscarves as a normal development : " wherever turks live , they try to showcase their culture . " but other turkish people living in the area view things quite differently .
take mustafa sükrü cakiroglu , who has decorated his office with prayer plates , turkish flags and a painting of kemal atatürk , the founder of modern-day turkey . " that 's just there for my customers , " said the interpreter , who has lived in germany for 30 years .
like haslak , cakiroglu also has no german friends in berlin , a fact he 's unhappy about .
" there 's no opportunity to mix , " he says . things were different in western germany , where he lived for many years before coming to the capital .
there , turks and germans lived next to each other and expressed more interest in their cultures , he said . he believes that 's less likely in berlin , where immigrants tend to cluster in certain neighborhoods .
" i tell everyone to leave , " he says and adds that he 'd like to move to another part of germany himself . a good relationship horst wiessner would never think of leaving kreuzberg .
the 82-year-old has lived in the neighborhood all his life .
he 's seen it transform from a predominantly german to a mostly turkish quarter , a fact that does n't worry him in the least .
" we have a really good relationship with our turkish neighbors , " says wiessner , who is the president of the kottbusser tor apartment complex 's tenant association . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst wiessner stands on his roof terrace .
thirty years ago , wiessner -lrb- photo -rrb- and his late wife were the first ones to move into the complex .
they came with high hopes of living in a modern urban building and managed to get a top floor apartment with a roof garden that offers sweeping views across the city .
up there , things have n't changed much , but it 's a different story down on the ground . the building is covered in graffiti and berlin 's drug addicts who hang out in the area use the dark hallways for injections .
despite constant setbacks and disputes with the owners of the building , wiessner keeps working to improve the neighborhood . " i have a job here that still is n't finished , " he said . little cross-cultural contact sponholz does n't even have children of her own yet .
" but when i do , they should grow up here , " she said after sending off the group of teenagers she led around the neighborhood .
" i 've acquired so much social competence here , i can see that when i compare myself to others at university . " sponholz has german parents , she became familiar with turkish culture through her best friend .
she said kottbusser tor has changed since she was a child .
" there 's really very little contact with german society , " she said .
" it 's not necessary , because there 's a turkish infrastructure now . " she says she knows that her neighborhood has its problems .
she knows that it 's bad that a lot of germans have left - but so have a lot of turkish families , who could afford homes elsewhere .
maybe a new group of immigrants will take over in the future : " maybe it 's going to be a polish kreuzberg some day .

greek cypriots on saturday voted overwhelmingly against reunification with turkish cypriots , sounding the death knell for a un-backed peace plan to end a 30-year division of the island . television exit polls forecast that the greek cypriots voted against the u.n. blueprint in large numbers , while the turkish cypriots voted heavily in favor . the polls on the south of the island said 78.5 percent of greek cypriots had rejected the plan .
a separate exit poll by turkey 's private cnn-turk television found 61 percent of turkish cypriots accepted the plan .
the rejection means that only greek cypriots will enter the european union on may 1 . greek and turkish cypriots were voting in separate referendums on whether to accept a peace plan drawn up by un secretary-general kofi anan in reuniting the island that has been divided for 30 years ever since turkey invaded the north in the wake of a greek cypriot coup in an attempt to unite the island with greece .

the plan envisaged a federation of two politically equal states , one for the 643,000 greek cypriots and one for the 180,000 turks and turkish cypriots in the north , under a weak central government . greek cypriot leaders in particular objected to the fact that the blueprint restricts the rights of an estimated 200,000 refugees to return to their former homes in the north , while allowing more than 60,000 settlers from turkey to remain on the island . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tassos papadopoulos greek cypriot president tassos papadopoulos along with his nationalist allies has been accused of running a campaign playing on greek cypriot fears that turkey and the turkish cypriots would fail to hand back nine percent of the island 's territory and gradually withdraw 38,000 turkish troops . earlier on saturday papdopoulos cast his vote and said , " today 's voting will determine the future of our country .

" denktash : voters did n't know the plan for his part , veteran turkish cypriot leader rauf denktash , who also vociferously opposed the peace plan in the face of widespread support for it among his own people , said that cypriots did n't really know the 220-page document they were voting on . " unfortunately we are not voting for a document that has been agreed on , but a document that has not been agreed on , " he said .
" we are not voting for harmony , peace and agreement , but disagreement . " denktash criticized the international community for forcing the referendums on cypriots .
" this could not have been done in europe because they are treated as civilzed people , " he said .
" we are cypriots ; we can be pushed around , kicked around and told what to do . " many turkish cypriot ssupported the " yes " vote because they saw the plan as a path to greater prosperity and entry into the eu .
turkish cyprus has been isolated for years .
legally , it can only trade with turkey , the only country that recognizes it as a separate state . feeling " cheated " the prospect of failure had already brought irritation to much of the international community .
the united states , which has been campaigning to convince cypriots to vote " yes , " has accused the semi-governmental cyprus broadcasting corporation -lrb- cbc -rrb- of restricting press coverage for the plan 's proponents .
cypriot television aired a two-hour , prime-time interview with papadopoulos , but u.s. diplomats claim cbc has stopped interviewing foreign officials . european union enlargement commissioner günter verheugen said he felt " cheated " by the greek cypriot government , which had always pushed hard for a reunified cyprus to join the eu .

both the united states and the eu have said the international community will open up to the northern turkish cypriot part of the island , which is only recognized by turkey , if the turkish cypriots turn down the plan .
eu foreign policy chief javier solana said the bloc would n't leave the turkish cypriots " in the cold forever . " the standard of living is dramatically lower in the north .

greek cypriots on saturday voted overwhelmingly against reunification with turkish cypriots , sounding the death knell for a un-backed peace plan to end a 30-year division of the island . television exit polls forecast that the greek cypriots voted against the u.n. blueprint in large numbers , while the turkish cypriots voted heavily in favor . the polls on the south of the island said 78.5 percent of greek cypriots had rejected the plan .
a separate exit poll by turkey 's private cnn-turk television found 61 percent of turkish cypriots accepted the plan .
the rejection means that only greek cypriots will enter the european union on may 1 . greek and turkish cypriots were voting in separate referendums on whether to accept a peace plan drawn up by un secretary-general kofi anan in reuniting the island that has been divided for 30 years ever since turkey invaded the north in the wake of a greek cypriot coup in an attempt to unite the island with greece .
a mined no-man 's land , the " green line , " which is policed by u.n. peacekeepers , separates the northern one-third of the island from the south . papadopoulos gets his way but the peace plan 's outcome was more or less sealed after prominent greek cypriot leaders said they were unhappy with the details that favored the turkish cypriots .
the plan envisaged a federation of two politically equal states , one for the 643,000 greek cypriots and one for the 180,000 turks and turkish cypriots in the north , under a weak central government . greek cypriot leaders in particular objected to the fact that the blueprint restricts the rights of an estimated 200,000 refugees to return to their former homes in the north , while allowing more than 60,000 settlers from turkey to remain on the island . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tassos papadopoulos greek cypriot president tassos papadopoulos along with his nationalist allies has been accused of running a campaign playing on greek cypriot fears that turkey and the turkish cypriots would fail to hand back nine percent of the island 's territory and gradually withdraw 38,000 turkish troops . earlier on saturday papdopoulos cast his vote and said , " today 's voting will determine the future of our country .
greek cypriots and turkish cypriots deserve better days and i am sure these will come . " denktash : voters did n't know the plan for his part , veteran turkish cypriot leader rauf denktash , who also vociferously opposed the peace plan in the face of widespread support for it among his own people , said that cypriots did n't really know the 220-page document they were voting on . " unfortunately we are not voting for a document that has been agreed on , but a document that has not been agreed on , " he said .
" we are not voting for harmony , peace and agreement , but disagreement . " denktash criticized the international community for forcing the referendums on cypriots .
" this could not have been done in europe because they are treated as civilzed people , " he said .
" we are cypriots ; we can be pushed around , kicked around and told what to do . " many turkish cypriot ssupported the " yes " vote because they saw the plan as a path to greater prosperity and entry into the eu .
turkish cyprus has been isolated for years .
legally , it can only trade with turkey , the only country that recognizes it as a separate state . feeling " cheated " the prospect of failure had already brought irritation to much of the international community .
the united states , which has been campaigning to convince cypriots to vote " yes , " has accused the semi-governmental cyprus broadcasting corporation -lrb- cbc -rrb- of restricting press coverage for the plan 's proponents .
cypriot television aired a two-hour , prime-time interview with papadopoulos , but u.s. diplomats claim cbc has stopped interviewing foreign officials . european union enlargement commissioner günter verheugen said he felt " cheated " by the greek cypriot government , which had always pushed hard for a reunified cyprus to join the eu .

greek cypriots on saturday voted overwhelmingly against reunification with turkish cypriots , sounding the death knell for a un-backed peace plan to end a 30-year division of the island . television exit polls forecast that the greek cypriots voted against the u.n. blueprint in large numbers , while the turkish cypriots voted heavily in favor . the polls on the south of the island said 78.5 percent of greek cypriots had rejected the plan .
a separate exit poll by turkey 's private cnn-turk television found 61 percent of turkish cypriots accepted the plan .
the rejection means that only greek cypriots will enter the european union on may 1 . greek and turkish cypriots were voting in separate referendums on whether to accept a peace plan drawn up by un secretary-general kofi anan in reuniting the island that has been divided for 30 years ever since turkey invaded the north in the wake of a greek cypriot coup in an attempt to unite the island with greece .
a mined no-man 's land , the " green line , " which is policed by u.n. peacekeepers , separates the northern one-third of the island from the south . papadopoulos gets his way but the peace plan 's outcome was more or less sealed after prominent greek cypriot leaders said they were unhappy with the details that favored the turkish cypriots .
the plan envisaged a federation of two politically equal states , one for the 643,000 greek cypriots and one for the 180,000 turks and turkish cypriots in the north , under a weak central government . greek cypriot leaders in particular objected to the fact that the blueprint restricts the rights of an estimated 200,000 refugees to return to their former homes in the north , while allowing more than 60,000 settlers from turkey to remain on the island . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tassos papadopoulos greek cypriot president tassos papadopoulos along with his nationalist allies has been accused of running a campaign playing on greek cypriot fears that turkey and the turkish cypriots would fail to hand back nine percent of the island 's territory and gradually withdraw 38,000 turkish troops . earlier on saturday papdopoulos cast his vote and said , " today 's voting will determine the future of our country .
greek cypriots and turkish cypriots deserve better days and i am sure these will come . " denktash : voters did n't know the plan for his part , veteran turkish cypriot leader rauf denktash , who also vociferously opposed the peace plan in the face of widespread support for it among his own people , said that cypriots did n't really know the 220-page document they were voting on . " unfortunately we are not voting for a document that has been agreed on , but a document that has not been agreed on , " he said .
" we are not voting for harmony , peace and agreement , but disagreement . " denktash criticized the international community for forcing the referendums on cypriots .
" this could not have been done in europe because they are treated as civilzed people , " he said .
" we are cypriots ; we can be pushed around , kicked around and told what to do . " many turkish cypriot ssupported the " yes " vote because they saw the plan as a path to greater prosperity and entry into the eu .
turkish cyprus has been isolated for years .
legally , it can only trade with turkey , the only country that recognizes it as a separate state . feeling " cheated " the prospect of failure had already brought irritation to much of the international community .
the united states , which has been campaigning to convince cypriots to vote " yes , " has accused the semi-governmental cyprus broadcasting corporation -lrb- cbc -rrb- of restricting press coverage for the plan 's proponents .
cypriot television aired a two-hour , prime-time interview with papadopoulos , but u.s. diplomats claim cbc has stopped interviewing foreign officials . european union enlargement commissioner günter verheugen said he felt " cheated " by the greek cypriot government , which had always pushed hard for a reunified cyprus to join the eu .
he suggested that some greek cypriots opposed the plan for economic reasons , fearing that the north could become a rival tourist destination .
tourism is one of the south 's most important industries .
isolation could end bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish cypriots overwhelmingly are in favor of the u.n. peace plan .
both the united states and the eu have said the international community will open up to the northern turkish cypriot part of the island , which is only recognized by turkey , if the turkish cypriots turn down the plan .
eu foreign policy chief javier solana said the bloc would n't leave the turkish cypriots " in the cold forever . " the standard of living is dramatically lower in the north .
an international trade embargo has cut off the turkish cypriots politically , economically and culturally . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de verheugen feels ' cheated ' by greek cypriot government " i personally feel that i have been cheated by the government of the republic of cyprus , " verheugen said in strasbourg .
-lrb- april 22 , 2004 -rrb- greek cypriot leader rejects peace plan in a fresh blow to the cyprus peace process , greek cypriot leader tassos papadopoulos has urged voters to reject a u.n. plan to reunify the island in a referendum later this month .

daimlerchrysler has an investment stake of just more than 10 percent in hyundai motors , which is part of the hyundai industrial group . daimlerchrsyler to review asian strategy kim yong-duk , vice president of keb commerz investment trust management in seoul , told the wirtschaftswoche that hyundai did not want to become " just another element in the shaky world inc. of herr schrempp -lsb- daimlerchrysler chief executive juergen schrempp -rsb- but rise to the top by its own efforts " . the magazine said a separate project to jointly manufacture truck engines was also unlikely to be carried out , but the two groups would persist in plans to make car engines together . though daimlerchrysler has not categorically confirmed the end of the joint trucking venture with hyundai , the negotiations which have dragged on for the past one and a half years , have reportedly been difficult .

daimlerchrysler 's woes in the asian market deepened with south korean partner hyundai motors planning to scrap a joint truck venture .
earlier daimler abandoned beleaguered japanese partner mitsubishi motors corp. the south korean carmaker hyundai motors is planning to drop all cooperation projects with german carmaker daimlerchrysler in the coming week , according to media reports .
the move would affect a major planned alliance between daimlerchrysler and hyundai motors to jointly build heavy trucks and the yearly delivery of 50,000 truck engines to hyundai . quoting company sources , germany 's wirtschaftswoche financial news magazine said profitable hyundai had cold feet amid worries that daimlerchrysler , the world 's fifth-biggest automaker , would use the deal to seek greater influence over hyundi , as is currently happening to the troubled japanese automotive group mitsubishi motors . daimlerchrysler ' finance director manfred gentz earlier said that all cooperations with hyundai would continue as planned , but added that the strategic urgency of the joint trucking venture with hyundai was no longer as significant as when the two joined forces in 2001 . mercedes-benz chinese plans angers hyundai bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a mercedes-benz e-class car according to media reports , hyundai chief park hwang-ho is irked at the chinese expansion plans of mercedes-benz , a subsidiary of daimlerchrsyler .
starting 2005 , mercedes together with chinese manufacturer beijing automotive industry company -lrb- baic -rrb- wants to produce mercedes c-class and e-class -lrb- photo -rrb- models for the chinese market . but since hyundai itself has a cooperation with baic , it insists that baic deal exclusively with it for 30 years .
experts believe that if the south koreans get their way , mercedes-benz will be no longer be able to begin car production in china .
daimlerchrysler has an investment stake of just more than 10 percent in hyundai motors , which is part of the hyundai industrial group . daimlerchrsyler to review asian strategy kim yong-duk , vice president of keb commerz investment trust management in seoul , told the wirtschaftswoche that hyundai did not want to become " just another element in the shaky world inc. of herr schrempp -lsb- daimlerchrysler chief executive juergen schrempp -rsb- but rise to the top by its own efforts " . the magazine said a separate project to jointly manufacture truck engines was also unlikely to be carried out , but the two groups would persist in plans to make car engines together . though daimlerchrysler has not categorically confirmed the end of the joint trucking venture with hyundai , the negotiations which have dragged on for the past one and a half years , have reportedly been difficult .
gentz said daimlerchrysler would fundamentally review its asian strategy . daimlerchrsyler abandons mitsubishi motors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the headquarters of mitsubishi motors corp. in tokyo on friday , daimlerchrysler company executives announced they had abandoned plans to rescue ailing carmaker mitsubishi with a multi-billion-dollar investment . daimler shares rose as investors expressed relief as what appeared to be the end of the of its costly entanglement with japan 's only unprofitable carmaker .
but the decision came as a blow to daimlerchrysler ceo jürgen schrempp 's vision to turn the company into a worldwide player . after the 1998 merger with chrysler , schrempp had bought 37 percent of the japanese company three years ago , making daimlerchrysler mitsubishi 's largest shareholder .
mitsubishi is expecting a 72 billion yen -lrb- € 557.8 million , $ 659.4 million -rrb- loss for the fiscal year ending march 31 . daimlerchrysler officials on friday said injecting more money into mitsubishi made no sense for them , saying it would require a " very , very high capital infusion . " they added that they did n't know yet what they would do with their shares . " there is no decision for selling out stake and we are not looking for someone to buy it , " daimlerchrysler chief financial officer manfred gentz said , according to ap news agency .
in response , the mitsubishi group of companies , which holds the majority of mitsubishi motor shares , announced that it would " do their best " to revive the car maker . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de daimler forges engines joint venture with mitsubishi , hyundai in further pursuit of its globalization , daimlerchrysler is to set up a joint venture with japan 's mitsubishi motors and korea 's hyundai motor .

greek cypriots on saturday voted overwhelmingly against reunification with turkish cypriots , sounding the death knell for a un-backed peace plan to end a 30-year division of the island . television exit polls forecast that the greek cypriots voted against the u.n. blueprint in large numbers , while the turkish cypriots voted heavily in favor . the polls on the south of the island said 78.5 percent of greek cypriots had rejected the plan .
a separate exit poll by turkey 's private cnn-turk television found 61 percent of turkish cypriots accepted the plan .
the rejection means that only greek cypriots will enter the european union on may 1 . greek and turkish cypriots were voting in separate referendums on whether to accept a peace plan drawn up by un secretary-general kofi anan in reuniting the island that has been divided for 30 years ever since turkey invaded the north in the wake of a greek cypriot coup in an attempt to unite the island with greece .

greek cypriots on saturday voted overwhelmingly against reunification with turkish cypriots , sounding the death knell for a un-backed peace plan to end a 30-year division of the island . television exit polls forecast that the greek cypriots voted against the u.n. blueprint in large numbers , while the turkish cypriots voted heavily in favor . the polls on the south of the island said 78.5 percent of greek cypriots had rejected the plan .
a separate exit poll by turkey 's private cnn-turk television found 61 percent of turkish cypriots accepted the plan .
the rejection means that only greek cypriots will enter the european union on may 1 . greek and turkish cypriots were voting in separate referendums on whether to accept a peace plan drawn up by un secretary-general kofi anan in reuniting the island that has been divided for 30 years ever since turkey invaded the north in the wake of a greek cypriot coup in an attempt to unite the island with greece .
a mined no-man 's land , the " green line , " which is policed by u.n. peacekeepers , separates the northern one-third of the island from the south . papadopoulos gets his way but the peace plan 's outcome was more or less sealed after prominent greek cypriot leaders said they were unhappy with the details that favored the turkish cypriots .
the plan envisaged a federation of two politically equal states , one for the 643,000 greek cypriots and one for the 180,000 turks and turkish cypriots in the north , under a weak central government . greek cypriot leaders in particular objected to the fact that the blueprint restricts the rights of an estimated 200,000 refugees to return to their former homes in the north , while allowing more than 60,000 settlers from turkey to remain on the island . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tassos papadopoulos greek cypriot president tassos papadopoulos along with his nationalist allies has been accused of running a campaign playing on greek cypriot fears that turkey and the turkish cypriots would fail to hand back nine percent of the island 's territory and gradually withdraw 38,000 turkish troops . earlier on saturday papdopoulos cast his vote and said , " today 's voting will determine the future of our country .

" denktash : voters did n't know the plan for his part , veteran turkish cypriot leader rauf denktash , who also vociferously opposed the peace plan in the face of widespread support for it among his own people , said that cypriots did n't really know the 220-page document they were voting on . " unfortunately we are not voting for a document that has been agreed on , but a document that has not been agreed on , " he said .
" we are not voting for harmony , peace and agreement , but disagreement . " denktash criticized the international community for forcing the referendums on cypriots .
" this could not have been done in europe because they are treated as civilzed people , " he said .

daimlerchrysler 's woes in the asian market deepened with south korean partner hyundai motors planning to scrap a joint truck venture .
earlier daimler abandoned beleaguered japanese partner mitsubishi motors corp. the south korean carmaker hyundai motors is planning to drop all cooperation projects with german carmaker daimlerchrysler in the coming week , according to media reports .
the move would affect a major planned alliance between daimlerchrysler and hyundai motors to jointly build heavy trucks and the yearly delivery of 50,000 truck engines to hyundai . quoting company sources , germany 's wirtschaftswoche financial news magazine said profitable hyundai had cold feet amid worries that daimlerchrysler , the world 's fifth-biggest automaker , would use the deal to seek greater influence over hyundi , as is currently happening to the troubled japanese automotive group mitsubishi motors . daimlerchrysler ' finance director manfred gentz earlier said that all cooperations with hyundai would continue as planned , but added that the strategic urgency of the joint trucking venture with hyundai was no longer as significant as when the two joined forces in 2001 . mercedes-benz chinese plans angers hyundai bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a mercedes-benz e-class car according to media reports , hyundai chief park hwang-ho is irked at the chinese expansion plans of mercedes-benz , a subsidiary of daimlerchrsyler .
starting 2005 , mercedes together with chinese manufacturer beijing automotive industry company -lrb- baic -rrb- wants to produce mercedes c-class and e-class -lrb- photo -rrb- models for the chinese market . but since hyundai itself has a cooperation with baic , it insists that baic deal exclusively with it for 30 years .
experts believe that if the south koreans get their way , mercedes-benz will be no longer be able to begin car production in china .
daimlerchrysler has an investment stake of just more than 10 percent in hyundai motors , which is part of the hyundai industrial group . daimlerchrsyler to review asian strategy kim yong-duk , vice president of keb commerz investment trust management in seoul , told the wirtschaftswoche that hyundai did not want to become " just another element in the shaky world inc. of herr schrempp -lsb- daimlerchrysler chief executive juergen schrempp -rsb- but rise to the top by its own efforts " . the magazine said a separate project to jointly manufacture truck engines was also unlikely to be carried out , but the two groups would persist in plans to make car engines together . though daimlerchrysler has not categorically confirmed the end of the joint trucking venture with hyundai , the negotiations which have dragged on for the past one and a half years , have reportedly been difficult .
gentz said daimlerchrysler would fundamentally review its asian strategy . daimlerchrsyler abandons mitsubishi motors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the headquarters of mitsubishi motors corp. in tokyo on friday , daimlerchrysler company executives announced they had abandoned plans to rescue ailing carmaker mitsubishi with a multi-billion-dollar investment . daimler shares rose as investors expressed relief as what appeared to be the end of the of its costly entanglement with japan 's only unprofitable carmaker .
but the decision came as a blow to daimlerchrysler ceo jürgen schrempp 's vision to turn the company into a worldwide player . after the 1998 merger with chrysler , schrempp had bought 37 percent of the japanese company three years ago , making daimlerchrysler mitsubishi 's largest shareholder .
mitsubishi is expecting a 72 billion yen -lrb- € 557.8 million , $ 659.4 million -rrb- loss for the fiscal year ending march 31 . daimlerchrysler officials on friday said injecting more money into mitsubishi made no sense for them , saying it would require a " very , very high capital infusion . " they added that they did n't know yet what they would do with their shares . " there is no decision for selling out stake and we are not looking for someone to buy it , " daimlerchrysler chief financial officer manfred gentz said , according to ap news agency .
in response , the mitsubishi group of companies , which holds the majority of mitsubishi motor shares , announced that it would " do their best " to revive the car maker . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de daimler forges engines joint venture with mitsubishi , hyundai in further pursuit of its globalization , daimlerchrysler is to set up a joint venture with japan 's mitsubishi motors and korea 's hyundai motor .

greek cypriots on saturday voted overwhelmingly against reunification with turkish cypriots , sounding the death knell for a un-backed peace plan to end a 30-year division of the island . television exit polls forecast that the greek cypriots voted against the u.n. blueprint in large numbers , while the turkish cypriots voted heavily in favor . the polls on the south of the island said 78.5 percent of greek cypriots had rejected the plan .
a separate exit poll by turkey 's private cnn-turk television found 61 percent of turkish cypriots accepted the plan .
the rejection means that only greek cypriots will enter the european union on may 1 . greek and turkish cypriots were voting in separate referendums on whether to accept a peace plan drawn up by un secretary-general kofi anan in reuniting the island that has been divided for 30 years ever since turkey invaded the north in the wake of a greek cypriot coup in an attempt to unite the island with greece .
a mined no-man 's land , the " green line , " which is policed by u.n. peacekeepers , separates the northern one-third of the island from the south . papadopoulos gets his way but the peace plan 's outcome was more or less sealed after prominent greek cypriot leaders said they were unhappy with the details that favored the turkish cypriots .
the plan envisaged a federation of two politically equal states , one for the 643,000 greek cypriots and one for the 180,000 turks and turkish cypriots in the north , under a weak central government . greek cypriot leaders in particular objected to the fact that the blueprint restricts the rights of an estimated 200,000 refugees to return to their former homes in the north , while allowing more than 60,000 settlers from turkey to remain on the island . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tassos papadopoulos greek cypriot president tassos papadopoulos along with his nationalist allies has been accused of running a campaign playing on greek cypriot fears that turkey and the turkish cypriots would fail to hand back nine percent of the island 's territory and gradually withdraw 38,000 turkish troops . earlier on saturday papdopoulos cast his vote and said , " today 's voting will determine the future of our country .
greek cypriots and turkish cypriots deserve better days and i am sure these will come . " denktash : voters did n't know the plan for his part , veteran turkish cypriot leader rauf denktash , who also vociferously opposed the peace plan in the face of widespread support for it among his own people , said that cypriots did n't really know the 220-page document they were voting on . " unfortunately we are not voting for a document that has been agreed on , but a document that has not been agreed on , " he said .
" we are not voting for harmony , peace and agreement , but disagreement . " denktash criticized the international community for forcing the referendums on cypriots .
" this could not have been done in europe because they are treated as civilzed people , " he said .
" we are cypriots ; we can be pushed around , kicked around and told what to do . " many turkish cypriot ssupported the " yes " vote because they saw the plan as a path to greater prosperity and entry into the eu .
turkish cyprus has been isolated for years .

the united states , which has been campaigning to convince cypriots to vote " yes , " has accused the semi-governmental cyprus broadcasting corporation -lrb- cbc -rrb- of restricting press coverage for the plan 's proponents .
cypriot television aired a two-hour , prime-time interview with papadopoulos , but u.s. diplomats claim cbc has stopped interviewing foreign officials . european union enlargement commissioner günter verheugen said he felt " cheated " by the greek cypriot government , which had always pushed hard for a reunified cyprus to join the eu .

take mustafa sükrü cakiroglu , who has decorated his office with prayer plates , turkish flags and a painting of kemal atatürk , the founder of modern-day turkey . " that 's just there for my customers , " said the interpreter , who has lived in germany for 30 years .
like haslak , cakiroglu also has no german friends in berlin , a fact he 's unhappy about .
" there 's no opportunity to mix , " he says . things were different in western germany , where he lived for many years before coming to the capital .
there , turks and germans lived next to each other and expressed more interest in their cultures , he said . he believes that 's less likely in berlin , where immigrants tend to cluster in certain neighborhoods .
" i tell everyone to leave , " he says and adds that he 'd like to move to another part of germany himself . a good relationship horst wiessner would never think of leaving kreuzberg .
the 82-year-old has lived in the neighborhood all his life .
he 's seen it transform from a predominantly german to a mostly turkish quarter , a fact that does n't worry him in the least .
" we have a really good relationship with our turkish neighbors , " says wiessner , who is the president of the kottbusser tor apartment complex 's tenant association . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst wiessner stands on his roof terrace .
thirty years ago , wiessner -lrb- photo -rrb- and his late wife were the first ones to move into the complex .
they came with high hopes of living in a modern urban building and managed to get a top floor apartment with a roof garden that offers sweeping views across the city .
up there , things have n't changed much , but it 's a different story down on the ground . the building is covered in graffiti and berlin 's drug addicts who hang out in the area use the dark hallways for injections .
despite constant setbacks and disputes with the owners of the building , wiessner keeps working to improve the neighborhood . " i have a job here that still is n't finished , " he said . little cross-cultural contact sponholz does n't even have children of her own yet .
" but when i do , they should grow up here , " she said after sending off the group of teenagers she led around the neighborhood .
" i 've acquired so much social competence here , i can see that when i compare myself to others at university . " sponholz has german parents , she became familiar with turkish culture through her best friend .
she said kottbusser tor has changed since she was a child .
" there 's really very little contact with german society , " she said .
" it 's not necessary , because there 's a turkish infrastructure now . " she says she knows that her neighborhood has its problems .
she knows that it 's bad that a lot of germans have left - but so have a lot of turkish families , who could afford homes elsewhere .
maybe a new group of immigrants will take over in the future : " maybe it 's going to be a polish kreuzberg some day .

the 22-year-old dreams of opening his own turkish restaurant and attends a school to learn how to be a manager .
he gets his practical training at burger king . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fatih haslak in his spare time , haslak -lrb- photo -rrb- comes to mevlana mosque , which sits at the bottom of a dilapidated apartment complex that towers over kottbusser tor .
he 's the mosque 's secretary and assures visitors that this is a place that 's open to anyone . " we do n't have any problems with other cultures , " he said , adding that he unfortunately does n't have time to find german friends .
haslak sees the increase in women wearing headscarves as a normal development : " wherever turks live , they try to showcase their culture . " but other turkish people living in the area view things quite differently .
take mustafa sükrü cakiroglu , who has decorated his office with prayer plates , turkish flags and a painting of kemal atatürk , the founder of modern-day turkey . " that 's just there for my customers , " said the interpreter , who has lived in germany for 30 years .
like haslak , cakiroglu also has no german friends in berlin , a fact he 's unhappy about .
" there 's no opportunity to mix , " he says . things were different in western germany , where he lived for many years before coming to the capital .
there , turks and germans lived next to each other and expressed more interest in their cultures , he said . he believes that 's less likely in berlin , where immigrants tend to cluster in certain neighborhoods .
" i tell everyone to leave , " he says and adds that he 'd like to move to another part of germany himself . a good relationship horst wiessner would never think of leaving kreuzberg .
the 82-year-old has lived in the neighborhood all his life .
he 's seen it transform from a predominantly german to a mostly turkish quarter , a fact that does n't worry him in the least .
" we have a really good relationship with our turkish neighbors , " says wiessner , who is the president of the kottbusser tor apartment complex 's tenant association . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst wiessner stands on his roof terrace .
thirty years ago , wiessner -lrb- photo -rrb- and his late wife were the first ones to move into the complex .
they came with high hopes of living in a modern urban building and managed to get a top floor apartment with a roof garden that offers sweeping views across the city .
up there , things have n't changed much , but it 's a different story down on the ground . the building is covered in graffiti and berlin 's drug addicts who hang out in the area use the dark hallways for injections .
despite constant setbacks and disputes with the owners of the building , wiessner keeps working to improve the neighborhood . " i have a job here that still is n't finished , " he said . little cross-cultural contact sponholz does n't even have children of her own yet .
" but when i do , they should grow up here , " she said after sending off the group of teenagers she led around the neighborhood .
" i 've acquired so much social competence here , i can see that when i compare myself to others at university . " sponholz has german parents , she became familiar with turkish culture through her best friend .
she said kottbusser tor has changed since she was a child .
" there 's really very little contact with german society , " she said .
" it 's not necessary , because there 's a turkish infrastructure now . " she says she knows that her neighborhood has its problems .
she knows that it 's bad that a lot of germans have left - but so have a lot of turkish families , who could afford homes elsewhere .

in a last report card for the 10 new countries joining the eu , members of the european parliament praised progress in adapting national laws to those of the union but also pointed out remaining problems . before handing out grades to individual countries , parliamentarians first looked at general problems shared by most accession countries that still need to be resolved .
the new states have adopted more than 80,000 pages of the eu 's common law , the so-called acquis communautaire .
but enforcing the union 's rules continues to be a " major problem , " according to the report . to fix this , countries need something that 's long been eyed with suspicion in existing eu countries - a well-oiled bureaucracy .
" the administrations are too weak overall , " elisabeth schroedter , a german member of the european parliament from the green party who co-wrote the report told dw-world .
she added that many governments have ignored the problem for too long , causing most young people to look for jobs in the private sector , since they do n't get paid as much while working for the government . others agree that finding more well-trained bureaucrats is the biggest challenge the new eu countries face .
" the better the administration , the better the courts , the easier it is to get foreign investment , " said german christian democrat elmar brok , schroedter 's colleague and the report 's head author . without a functioning bureaucracy on the national and especially the regional level , accession countries might also endanger the eu funding they could receive in areas such as agriculture , brok added .
" they know that if they are not fast , they lose money , " he told dw-world . the situation is more difficult for larger countries such as poland that find it more difficult to set up a proper administrative system simply because of their size , brok said .
smaller nations , such as estonia and slovenia , have already made much more progress in this area . food safety is another area that has parliamentarians worried : they criticized delays in some countries to adopt measures preventing the spread of bse , the so-called mad cow disease .
they also called on the european commission to stop the sale of food products from a member state as a last resort to protect consumers in major food scares . finally , legislators asked existing eu member states to reconsider plans not to issue work permits to people from the new countries for the first few years after enlargement .

in a last report card for the 10 new countries joining the eu , members of the european parliament praised progress in adapting national laws to those of the union but also pointed out remaining problems . before handing out grades to individual countries , parliamentarians first looked at general problems shared by most accession countries that still need to be resolved .
the new states have adopted more than 80,000 pages of the eu 's common law , the so-called acquis communautaire .
but enforcing the union 's rules continues to be a " major problem , " according to the report . to fix this , countries need something that 's long been eyed with suspicion in existing eu countries - a well-oiled bureaucracy .
" the administrations are too weak overall , " elisabeth schroedter , a german member of the european parliament from the green party who co-wrote the report told dw-world .
she added that many governments have ignored the problem for too long , causing most young people to look for jobs in the private sector , since they do n't get paid as much while working for the government . others agree that finding more well-trained bureaucrats is the biggest challenge the new eu countries face .
" the better the administration , the better the courts , the easier it is to get foreign investment , " said german christian democrat elmar brok , schroedter 's colleague and the report 's head author . without a functioning bureaucracy on the national and especially the regional level , accession countries might also endanger the eu funding they could receive in areas such as agriculture , brok added .
" they know that if they are not fast , they lose money , " he told dw-world . the situation is more difficult for larger countries such as poland that find it more difficult to set up a proper administrative system simply because of their size , brok said .
smaller nations , such as estonia and slovenia , have already made much more progress in this area . food safety is another area that has parliamentarians worried : they criticized delays in some countries to adopt measures preventing the spread of bse , the so-called mad cow disease .
they also called on the european commission to stop the sale of food products from a member state as a last resort to protect consumers in major food scares . finally , legislators asked existing eu member states to reconsider plans not to issue work permits to people from the new countries for the first few years after enlargement .
the report urges member states " to closely study real migratory patterns following the enlargement and to abolish these barriers to free movement as soon as possible .

in a last report card for the 10 new countries joining the eu , members of the european parliament praised progress in adapting national laws to those of the union but also pointed out remaining problems . before handing out grades to individual countries , parliamentarians first looked at general problems shared by most accession countries that still need to be resolved .
the new states have adopted more than 80,000 pages of the eu 's common law , the so-called acquis communautaire .
but enforcing the union 's rules continues to be a " major problem , " according to the report . to fix this , countries need something that 's long been eyed with suspicion in existing eu countries - a well-oiled bureaucracy .
" the administrations are too weak overall , " elisabeth schroedter , a german member of the european parliament from the green party who co-wrote the report told dw-world .
she added that many governments have ignored the problem for too long , causing most young people to look for jobs in the private sector , since they do n't get paid as much while working for the government . others agree that finding more well-trained bureaucrats is the biggest challenge the new eu countries face .
" the better the administration , the better the courts , the easier it is to get foreign investment , " said german christian democrat elmar brok , schroedter 's colleague and the report 's head author . without a functioning bureaucracy on the national and especially the regional level , accession countries might also endanger the eu funding they could receive in areas such as agriculture , brok added .
" they know that if they are not fast , they lose money , " he told dw-world . the situation is more difficult for larger countries such as poland that find it more difficult to set up a proper administrative system simply because of their size , brok said .
smaller nations , such as estonia and slovenia , have already made much more progress in this area . food safety is another area that has parliamentarians worried : they criticized delays in some countries to adopt measures preventing the spread of bse , the so-called mad cow disease .
they also called on the european commission to stop the sale of food products from a member state as a last resort to protect consumers in major food scares . finally , legislators asked existing eu member states to reconsider plans not to issue work permits to people from the new countries for the first few years after enlargement .
the report urges member states " to closely study real migratory patterns following the enlargement and to abolish these barriers to free movement as soon as possible .

daimlerchrysler 's woes in the asian market deepened with south korean partner hyundai motors planning to scrap a joint truck venture .
earlier daimler abandoned beleaguered japanese partner mitsubishi motors corp. the south korean carmaker hyundai motors is planning to drop all cooperation projects with german carmaker daimlerchrysler in the coming week , according to media reports .
the move would affect a major planned alliance between daimlerchrysler and hyundai motors to jointly build heavy trucks and the yearly delivery of 50,000 truck engines to hyundai . quoting company sources , germany 's wirtschaftswoche financial news magazine said profitable hyundai had cold feet amid worries that daimlerchrysler , the world 's fifth-biggest automaker , would use the deal to seek greater influence over hyundi , as is currently happening to the troubled japanese automotive group mitsubishi motors . daimlerchrysler ' finance director manfred gentz earlier said that all cooperations with hyundai would continue as planned , but added that the strategic urgency of the joint trucking venture with hyundai was no longer as significant as when the two joined forces in 2001 . mercedes-benz chinese plans angers hyundai bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a mercedes-benz e-class car according to media reports , hyundai chief park hwang-ho is irked at the chinese expansion plans of mercedes-benz , a subsidiary of daimlerchrsyler .
starting 2005 , mercedes together with chinese manufacturer beijing automotive industry company -lrb- baic -rrb- wants to produce mercedes c-class and e-class -lrb- photo -rrb- models for the chinese market . but since hyundai itself has a cooperation with baic , it insists that baic deal exclusively with it for 30 years .
experts believe that if the south koreans get their way , mercedes-benz will be no longer be able to begin car production in china .
daimlerchrysler has an investment stake of just more than 10 percent in hyundai motors , which is part of the hyundai industrial group . daimlerchrsyler to review asian strategy kim yong-duk , vice president of keb commerz investment trust management in seoul , told the wirtschaftswoche that hyundai did not want to become " just another element in the shaky world inc. of herr schrempp -lsb- daimlerchrysler chief executive juergen schrempp -rsb- but rise to the top by its own efforts " . the magazine said a separate project to jointly manufacture truck engines was also unlikely to be carried out , but the two groups would persist in plans to make car engines together . though daimlerchrysler has not categorically confirmed the end of the joint trucking venture with hyundai , the negotiations which have dragged on for the past one and a half years , have reportedly been difficult .
gentz said daimlerchrysler would fundamentally review its asian strategy . daimlerchrsyler abandons mitsubishi motors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the headquarters of mitsubishi motors corp. in tokyo on friday , daimlerchrysler company executives announced they had abandoned plans to rescue ailing carmaker mitsubishi with a multi-billion-dollar investment . daimler shares rose as investors expressed relief as what appeared to be the end of the of its costly entanglement with japan 's only unprofitable carmaker .
but the decision came as a blow to daimlerchrysler ceo jürgen schrempp 's vision to turn the company into a worldwide player . after the 1998 merger with chrysler , schrempp had bought 37 percent of the japanese company three years ago , making daimlerchrysler mitsubishi 's largest shareholder .
mitsubishi is expecting a 72 billion yen -lrb- € 557.8 million , $ 659.4 million -rrb- loss for the fiscal year ending march 31 . daimlerchrysler officials on friday said injecting more money into mitsubishi made no sense for them , saying it would require a " very , very high capital infusion . " they added that they did n't know yet what they would do with their shares . " there is no decision for selling out stake and we are not looking for someone to buy it , " daimlerchrysler chief financial officer manfred gentz said , according to ap news agency .
in response , the mitsubishi group of companies , which holds the majority of mitsubishi motor shares , announced that it would " do their best " to revive the car maker . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de daimler forges engines joint venture with mitsubishi , hyundai in further pursuit of its globalization , daimlerchrysler is to set up a joint venture with japan 's mitsubishi motors and korea 's hyundai motor .

in a last report card for the 10 new countries joining the eu , members of the european parliament praised progress in adapting national laws to those of the union but also pointed out remaining problems . before handing out grades to individual countries , parliamentarians first looked at general problems shared by most accession countries that still need to be resolved .
the new states have adopted more than 80,000 pages of the eu 's common law , the so-called acquis communautaire .
but enforcing the union 's rules continues to be a " major problem , " according to the report . to fix this , countries need something that 's long been eyed with suspicion in existing eu countries - a well-oiled bureaucracy .
" the administrations are too weak overall , " elisabeth schroedter , a german member of the european parliament from the green party who co-wrote the report told dw-world .
she added that many governments have ignored the problem for too long , causing most young people to look for jobs in the private sector , since they do n't get paid as much while working for the government . others agree that finding more well-trained bureaucrats is the biggest challenge the new eu countries face .
" the better the administration , the better the courts , the easier it is to get foreign investment , " said german christian democrat elmar brok , schroedter 's colleague and the report 's head author . without a functioning bureaucracy on the national and especially the regional level , accession countries might also endanger the eu funding they could receive in areas such as agriculture , brok added .

smaller nations , such as estonia and slovenia , have already made much more progress in this area . food safety is another area that has parliamentarians worried : they criticized delays in some countries to adopt measures preventing the spread of bse , the so-called mad cow disease .

in a last report card for the 10 new countries joining the eu , members of the european parliament praised progress in adapting national laws to those of the union but also pointed out remaining problems . before handing out grades to individual countries , parliamentarians first looked at general problems shared by most accession countries that still need to be resolved .
the new states have adopted more than 80,000 pages of the eu 's common law , the so-called acquis communautaire .
but enforcing the union 's rules continues to be a " major problem , " according to the report . to fix this , countries need something that 's long been eyed with suspicion in existing eu countries - a well-oiled bureaucracy .
" the administrations are too weak overall , " elisabeth schroedter , a german member of the european parliament from the green party who co-wrote the report told dw-world .
she added that many governments have ignored the problem for too long , causing most young people to look for jobs in the private sector , since they do n't get paid as much while working for the government . others agree that finding more well-trained bureaucrats is the biggest challenge the new eu countries face .
" the better the administration , the better the courts , the easier it is to get foreign investment , " said german christian democrat elmar brok , schroedter 's colleague and the report 's head author . without a functioning bureaucracy on the national and especially the regional level , accession countries might also endanger the eu funding they could receive in areas such as agriculture , brok added .
" they know that if they are not fast , they lose money , " he told dw-world . the situation is more difficult for larger countries such as poland that find it more difficult to set up a proper administrative system simply because of their size , brok said .
smaller nations , such as estonia and slovenia , have already made much more progress in this area . food safety is another area that has parliamentarians worried : they criticized delays in some countries to adopt measures preventing the spread of bse , the so-called mad cow disease .
they also called on the european commission to stop the sale of food products from a member state as a last resort to protect consumers in major food scares . finally , legislators asked existing eu member states to reconsider plans not to issue work permits to people from the new countries for the first few years after enlargement .
the report urges member states " to closely study real migratory patterns following the enlargement and to abolish these barriers to free movement as soon as possible .

greek cypriots on saturday voted overwhelmingly against reunification with turkish cypriots , sounding the death knell for a un-backed peace plan to end a 30-year division of the island . television exit polls forecast that the greek cypriots voted against the u.n. blueprint in large numbers , while the turkish cypriots voted heavily in favor . the polls on the south of the island said 78.5 percent of greek cypriots had rejected the plan .
a separate exit poll by turkey 's private cnn-turk television found 61 percent of turkish cypriots accepted the plan .
the rejection means that only greek cypriots will enter the european union on may 1 . greek and turkish cypriots were voting in separate referendums on whether to accept a peace plan drawn up by un secretary-general kofi anan in reuniting the island that has been divided for 30 years ever since turkey invaded the north in the wake of a greek cypriot coup in an attempt to unite the island with greece .
a mined no-man 's land , the " green line , " which is policed by u.n. peacekeepers , separates the northern one-third of the island from the south . papadopoulos gets his way but the peace plan 's outcome was more or less sealed after prominent greek cypriot leaders said they were unhappy with the details that favored the turkish cypriots .
the plan envisaged a federation of two politically equal states , one for the 643,000 greek cypriots and one for the 180,000 turks and turkish cypriots in the north , under a weak central government . greek cypriot leaders in particular objected to the fact that the blueprint restricts the rights of an estimated 200,000 refugees to return to their former homes in the north , while allowing more than 60,000 settlers from turkey to remain on the island . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tassos papadopoulos greek cypriot president tassos papadopoulos along with his nationalist allies has been accused of running a campaign playing on greek cypriot fears that turkey and the turkish cypriots would fail to hand back nine percent of the island 's territory and gradually withdraw 38,000 turkish troops . earlier on saturday papdopoulos cast his vote and said , " today 's voting will determine the future of our country .
greek cypriots and turkish cypriots deserve better days and i am sure these will come . " denktash : voters did n't know the plan for his part , veteran turkish cypriot leader rauf denktash , who also vociferously opposed the peace plan in the face of widespread support for it among his own people , said that cypriots did n't really know the 220-page document they were voting on . " unfortunately we are not voting for a document that has been agreed on , but a document that has not been agreed on , " he said .
" we are not voting for harmony , peace and agreement , but disagreement . " denktash criticized the international community for forcing the referendums on cypriots .
" this could not have been done in europe because they are treated as civilzed people , " he said .
" we are cypriots ; we can be pushed around , kicked around and told what to do . " many turkish cypriot ssupported the " yes " vote because they saw the plan as a path to greater prosperity and entry into the eu .
turkish cyprus has been isolated for years .
legally , it can only trade with turkey , the only country that recognizes it as a separate state . feeling " cheated " the prospect of failure had already brought irritation to much of the international community .
the united states , which has been campaigning to convince cypriots to vote " yes , " has accused the semi-governmental cyprus broadcasting corporation -lrb- cbc -rrb- of restricting press coverage for the plan 's proponents .
cypriot television aired a two-hour , prime-time interview with papadopoulos , but u.s. diplomats claim cbc has stopped interviewing foreign officials . european union enlargement commissioner günter verheugen said he felt " cheated " by the greek cypriot government , which had always pushed hard for a reunified cyprus to join the eu .
he suggested that some greek cypriots opposed the plan for economic reasons , fearing that the north could become a rival tourist destination .
tourism is one of the south 's most important industries .
isolation could end bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish cypriots overwhelmingly are in favor of the u.n. peace plan .
both the united states and the eu have said the international community will open up to the northern turkish cypriot part of the island , which is only recognized by turkey , if the turkish cypriots turn down the plan .
eu foreign policy chief javier solana said the bloc would n't leave the turkish cypriots " in the cold forever . " the standard of living is dramatically lower in the north .

greek cypriots on saturday voted overwhelmingly against reunification with turkish cypriots , sounding the death knell for a un-backed peace plan to end a 30-year division of the island . television exit polls forecast that the greek cypriots voted against the u.n. blueprint in large numbers , while the turkish cypriots voted heavily in favor . the polls on the south of the island said 78.5 percent of greek cypriots had rejected the plan .
a separate exit poll by turkey 's private cnn-turk television found 61 percent of turkish cypriots accepted the plan .
the rejection means that only greek cypriots will enter the european union on may 1 . greek and turkish cypriots were voting in separate referendums on whether to accept a peace plan drawn up by un secretary-general kofi anan in reuniting the island that has been divided for 30 years ever since turkey invaded the north in the wake of a greek cypriot coup in an attempt to unite the island with greece .
a mined no-man 's land , the " green line , " which is policed by u.n. peacekeepers , separates the northern one-third of the island from the south . papadopoulos gets his way but the peace plan 's outcome was more or less sealed after prominent greek cypriot leaders said they were unhappy with the details that favored the turkish cypriots .
the plan envisaged a federation of two politically equal states , one for the 643,000 greek cypriots and one for the 180,000 turks and turkish cypriots in the north , under a weak central government . greek cypriot leaders in particular objected to the fact that the blueprint restricts the rights of an estimated 200,000 refugees to return to their former homes in the north , while allowing more than 60,000 settlers from turkey to remain on the island . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tassos papadopoulos greek cypriot president tassos papadopoulos along with his nationalist allies has been accused of running a campaign playing on greek cypriot fears that turkey and the turkish cypriots would fail to hand back nine percent of the island 's territory and gradually withdraw 38,000 turkish troops . earlier on saturday papdopoulos cast his vote and said , " today 's voting will determine the future of our country .
greek cypriots and turkish cypriots deserve better days and i am sure these will come . " denktash : voters did n't know the plan for his part , veteran turkish cypriot leader rauf denktash , who also vociferously opposed the peace plan in the face of widespread support for it among his own people , said that cypriots did n't really know the 220-page document they were voting on . " unfortunately we are not voting for a document that has been agreed on , but a document that has not been agreed on , " he said .
" we are not voting for harmony , peace and agreement , but disagreement . " denktash criticized the international community for forcing the referendums on cypriots .
" this could not have been done in europe because they are treated as civilzed people , " he said .
" we are cypriots ; we can be pushed around , kicked around and told what to do . " many turkish cypriot ssupported the " yes " vote because they saw the plan as a path to greater prosperity and entry into the eu .
turkish cyprus has been isolated for years .
legally , it can only trade with turkey , the only country that recognizes it as a separate state . feeling " cheated " the prospect of failure had already brought irritation to much of the international community .
the united states , which has been campaigning to convince cypriots to vote " yes , " has accused the semi-governmental cyprus broadcasting corporation -lrb- cbc -rrb- of restricting press coverage for the plan 's proponents .
cypriot television aired a two-hour , prime-time interview with papadopoulos , but u.s. diplomats claim cbc has stopped interviewing foreign officials . european union enlargement commissioner günter verheugen said he felt " cheated " by the greek cypriot government , which had always pushed hard for a reunified cyprus to join the eu .

in a last report card for the 10 new countries joining the eu , members of the european parliament praised progress in adapting national laws to those of the union but also pointed out remaining problems . before handing out grades to individual countries , parliamentarians first looked at general problems shared by most accession countries that still need to be resolved .
the new states have adopted more than 80,000 pages of the eu 's common law , the so-called acquis communautaire .
but enforcing the union 's rules continues to be a " major problem , " according to the report . to fix this , countries need something that 's long been eyed with suspicion in existing eu countries - a well-oiled bureaucracy .
" the administrations are too weak overall , " elisabeth schroedter , a german member of the european parliament from the green party who co-wrote the report told dw-world .
she added that many governments have ignored the problem for too long , causing most young people to look for jobs in the private sector , since they do n't get paid as much while working for the government . others agree that finding more well-trained bureaucrats is the biggest challenge the new eu countries face .
" the better the administration , the better the courts , the easier it is to get foreign investment , " said german christian democrat elmar brok , schroedter 's colleague and the report 's head author . without a functioning bureaucracy on the national and especially the regional level , accession countries might also endanger the eu funding they could receive in areas such as agriculture , brok added .
" they know that if they are not fast , they lose money , " he told dw-world . the situation is more difficult for larger countries such as poland that find it more difficult to set up a proper administrative system simply because of their size , brok said .
smaller nations , such as estonia and slovenia , have already made much more progress in this area . food safety is another area that has parliamentarians worried : they criticized delays in some countries to adopt measures preventing the spread of bse , the so-called mad cow disease .
they also called on the european commission to stop the sale of food products from a member state as a last resort to protect consumers in major food scares . finally , legislators asked existing eu member states to reconsider plans not to issue work permits to people from the new countries for the first few years after enlargement .
the report urges member states " to closely study real migratory patterns following the enlargement and to abolish these barriers to free movement as soon as possible .

in a last report card for the 10 new countries joining the eu , members of the european parliament praised progress in adapting national laws to those of the union but also pointed out remaining problems . before handing out grades to individual countries , parliamentarians first looked at general problems shared by most accession countries that still need to be resolved .
the new states have adopted more than 80,000 pages of the eu 's common law , the so-called acquis communautaire .
but enforcing the union 's rules continues to be a " major problem , " according to the report . to fix this , countries need something that 's long been eyed with suspicion in existing eu countries - a well-oiled bureaucracy .
" the administrations are too weak overall , " elisabeth schroedter , a german member of the european parliament from the green party who co-wrote the report told dw-world .
she added that many governments have ignored the problem for too long , causing most young people to look for jobs in the private sector , since they do n't get paid as much while working for the government . others agree that finding more well-trained bureaucrats is the biggest challenge the new eu countries face .
" the better the administration , the better the courts , the easier it is to get foreign investment , " said german christian democrat elmar brok , schroedter 's colleague and the report 's head author . without a functioning bureaucracy on the national and especially the regional level , accession countries might also endanger the eu funding they could receive in areas such as agriculture , brok added .
" they know that if they are not fast , they lose money , " he told dw-world . the situation is more difficult for larger countries such as poland that find it more difficult to set up a proper administrative system simply because of their size , brok said .
smaller nations , such as estonia and slovenia , have already made much more progress in this area . food safety is another area that has parliamentarians worried : they criticized delays in some countries to adopt measures preventing the spread of bse , the so-called mad cow disease .
they also called on the european commission to stop the sale of food products from a member state as a last resort to protect consumers in major food scares . finally , legislators asked existing eu member states to reconsider plans not to issue work permits to people from the new countries for the first few years after enlargement .
the report urges member states " to closely study real migratory patterns following the enlargement and to abolish these barriers to free movement as soon as possible .

in a last report card for the 10 new countries joining the eu , members of the european parliament praised progress in adapting national laws to those of the union but also pointed out remaining problems . before handing out grades to individual countries , parliamentarians first looked at general problems shared by most accession countries that still need to be resolved .
the new states have adopted more than 80,000 pages of the eu 's common law , the so-called acquis communautaire .
but enforcing the union 's rules continues to be a " major problem , " according to the report . to fix this , countries need something that 's long been eyed with suspicion in existing eu countries - a well-oiled bureaucracy .
" the administrations are too weak overall , " elisabeth schroedter , a german member of the european parliament from the green party who co-wrote the report told dw-world .
she added that many governments have ignored the problem for too long , causing most young people to look for jobs in the private sector , since they do n't get paid as much while working for the government . others agree that finding more well-trained bureaucrats is the biggest challenge the new eu countries face .
" the better the administration , the better the courts , the easier it is to get foreign investment , " said german christian democrat elmar brok , schroedter 's colleague and the report 's head author . without a functioning bureaucracy on the national and especially the regional level , accession countries might also endanger the eu funding they could receive in areas such as agriculture , brok added .
" they know that if they are not fast , they lose money , " he told dw-world . the situation is more difficult for larger countries such as poland that find it more difficult to set up a proper administrative system simply because of their size , brok said .
smaller nations , such as estonia and slovenia , have already made much more progress in this area . food safety is another area that has parliamentarians worried : they criticized delays in some countries to adopt measures preventing the spread of bse , the so-called mad cow disease .
they also called on the european commission to stop the sale of food products from a member state as a last resort to protect consumers in major food scares . finally , legislators asked existing eu member states to reconsider plans not to issue work permits to people from the new countries for the first few years after enlargement .
the report urges member states " to closely study real migratory patterns following the enlargement and to abolish these barriers to free movement as soon as possible .

in a last report card for the 10 new countries joining the eu , members of the european parliament praised progress in adapting national laws to those of the union but also pointed out remaining problems . before handing out grades to individual countries , parliamentarians first looked at general problems shared by most accession countries that still need to be resolved .
the new states have adopted more than 80,000 pages of the eu 's common law , the so-called acquis communautaire .
but enforcing the union 's rules continues to be a " major problem , " according to the report . to fix this , countries need something that 's long been eyed with suspicion in existing eu countries - a well-oiled bureaucracy .
" the administrations are too weak overall , " elisabeth schroedter , a german member of the european parliament from the green party who co-wrote the report told dw-world .
she added that many governments have ignored the problem for too long , causing most young people to look for jobs in the private sector , since they do n't get paid as much while working for the government . others agree that finding more well-trained bureaucrats is the biggest challenge the new eu countries face .
" the better the administration , the better the courts , the easier it is to get foreign investment , " said german christian democrat elmar brok , schroedter 's colleague and the report 's head author . without a functioning bureaucracy on the national and especially the regional level , accession countries might also endanger the eu funding they could receive in areas such as agriculture , brok added .
" they know that if they are not fast , they lose money , " he told dw-world . the situation is more difficult for larger countries such as poland that find it more difficult to set up a proper administrative system simply because of their size , brok said .
smaller nations , such as estonia and slovenia , have already made much more progress in this area . food safety is another area that has parliamentarians worried : they criticized delays in some countries to adopt measures preventing the spread of bse , the so-called mad cow disease .
they also called on the european commission to stop the sale of food products from a member state as a last resort to protect consumers in major food scares . finally , legislators asked existing eu member states to reconsider plans not to issue work permits to people from the new countries for the first few years after enlargement .

the association for payment clearing services -lrb- apacs -rrb- confirmed the cost to the bbc 's money box programme , and said the problem is getting worse .
lloyds tsb , nat west , and barclays have all admitted that customer accounts have been accessed and cash stolen , but none would say how much was taken .
the credit card provider mbna , which was the victim of a high profile e-mail scam last year would not even confirm whether its customers had lost any cash at all . "
it is something we are extremely concerned about " sandra quinn , apacs but sandra quinn of apacs told money box the problem is starting to cost the banks significant sums : " the losses now we think are over a million , and we know that figure is growing ...
it is something we are extremely concerned about . "
phishing this type of fraud is known as " phishing " .
people are sent an e-mail claiming to be from a bank which asks the person to respond with their account details and password .
fraudsters then use that information to steal money from the account . "
you just feel so stupid , you feel that you have been taken in by a con that should have been glaringly obvious " " andrea from cleveland when phishing began around 18 months ago , the e-mails were often crude , written in poor english , and with spelling mistakes .
however , the fraudsters - believed to be criminal gangs working in eastern europe - are now sending far more impressive e-mails , and copying the graphics and typeface from the banks ' own websites .
this method is fooling an increasing number of customers .
andrea from cleveland had £ 6000 stolen from her account .

richard lancelyn green , 50 , from kensington , died from asphyxiation , westminster coroner 's court was told .
coroner dr paul knapman recorded an open verdict and said the ex-chairman of the sherlock holmes society of london suffered a " very unusual death " .
mr lancelyn green was paranoid people were trying to smear his name and plot against him , the inquest was told .
' obsessed with legacy ' dr knapman said there was not enough evidence to rule in or out suicide , murder or a sexual act gone wrong .
mr lancelyn green was found in his bed , surrounded by cuddly toys and a bottle , after a wooden spoon was used to tighten the shoelace around his neck .
mr lancelyn green , who co-edited a book about the sherlock holmes creator sir arthur conan doyle , had strong concerns about the planned auction of the author 's papers , the inquest heard .
the court was told he thought " someone in america " was preparing to dirty his name and he was becoming increasingly obsessed with the conan doyle legacy and the impending sale .
the death has provoked more rumours about the so-called " curse of conan doyle " - several people connected with the sherlock holmes author have died unexpectedly early or have faced legal battles over the family archives .

richard lancelyn green , 50 , from kensington , died from asphyxiation , westminster coroner 's court was told .
coroner dr paul knapman recorded an open verdict and said the ex-chairman of the sherlock holmes society of london suffered a " very unusual death " .
mr lancelyn green was paranoid people were trying to smear his name and plot against him , the inquest was told .
' obsessed with legacy ' dr knapman said there was not enough evidence to rule in or out suicide , murder or a sexual act gone wrong .
mr lancelyn green was found in his bed , surrounded by cuddly toys and a bottle , after a wooden spoon was used to tighten the shoelace around his neck .
lawrence keen told of his friend 's bugging fears mr lancelyn green , who co-edited a book about the sherlock holmes creator sir arthur conan doyle , had strong concerns about the planned auction of the author 's papers , the inquest heard .
the court was told he thought " someone in america " was preparing to dirty his name and he was becoming increasingly obsessed with the conan doyle legacy and the impending sale .
the death has provoked more rumours about the so-called " curse of conan doyle " - several people connected with the sherlock holmes author have died unexpectedly early or have faced legal battles over the family archives .
verdict the coroner said : " there are many comments in this case in favour of suicide .
he was acting strangely and he seemed to be scared and there is no evidence of violence .
" i am perfectly content to say that suicide is the most likely possibility but we have no note and it 's a very unusual way of killing yourself to put a lace , which must hurt , around the neck and continue to twist it .
" the second possibility is unusual behaviour - often some form of deviant sexual behaviour .
there is nothing that actually points to this form of death .
" as for murder , there is not much in the way of direct evidence .
" it 's an unusual form of death that can be done by others .
we do have interesting messages from him about the paranoia he was feeling but it is assumed by all to be without much foundation . "
' like a thriller ' mr lancelyn green 's sister , priscilla , told the inquest she had become worried about her brother in the week before his death after a string of bizarre conversations .
" it was clear he was very concerned about the upcoming sherlock holmes sale , " she said .

richard lancelyn green , 50 , from kensington , died from asphyxiation , westminster coroner 's court was told .
coroner dr paul knapman recorded an open verdict and said the ex-chairman of the sherlock holmes society of london suffered a " very unusual death " .
mr lancelyn green was paranoid people were trying to smear his name and plot against him , the inquest was told .
' obsessed with legacy ' dr knapman said there was not enough evidence to rule in or out suicide , murder or a sexual act gone wrong .
mr lancelyn green was found in his bed , surrounded by cuddly toys and a bottle , after a wooden spoon was used to tighten the shoelace around his neck .
lawrence keen told of his friend 's bugging fears mr lancelyn green , who co-edited a book about the sherlock holmes creator sir arthur conan doyle , had strong concerns about the planned auction of the author 's papers , the inquest heard .
the court was told he thought " someone in america " was preparing to dirty his name and he was becoming increasingly obsessed with the conan doyle legacy and the impending sale .
the death has provoked more rumours about the so-called " curse of conan doyle " - several people connected with the sherlock holmes author have died unexpectedly early or have faced legal battles over the family archives .
verdict the coroner said : " there are many comments in this case in favour of suicide .
he was acting strangely and he seemed to be scared and there is no evidence of violence .
" i am perfectly content to say that suicide is the most likely possibility but we have no note and it 's a very unusual way of killing yourself to put a lace , which must hurt , around the neck and continue to twist it .
" the second possibility is unusual behaviour - often some form of deviant sexual behaviour .
there is nothing that actually points to this form of death .
" as for murder , there is not much in the way of direct evidence .
" it 's an unusual form of death that can be done by others .
we do have interesting messages from him about the paranoia he was feeling but it is assumed by all to be without much foundation . "
' like a thriller ' mr lancelyn green 's sister , priscilla , told the inquest she had become worried about her brother in the week before his death after a string of bizarre conversations .
" it was clear he was very concerned about the upcoming sherlock holmes sale , " she said .
" this was richard 's life - conan doyle .
it seemed that something about this sale was worrying him enormously and i tried to get him to explain to me what it was .
" he made comments about his own reputation , about the possibility of his name being in the papers , about people behaving in a way he did not expect them to and doing things he did not expect them to . "
he had sent here a strange note with three names and their telephone numbers on it which had seemed to ms lancelyn green " to be the beginning of a thriller novel " .
the document had " please keep these names safe " written on it .
hunted ?
police found mr lancelyn green 's body after his sister could reach no reply from his london house .
the last known person to see the holmes expert alive was his former boyfriend , care worker lawrence keen , from roehampton .
they had been out for dinner the night before mr lancelyn green 's body was found and mr keen said his friend had been " quite depressed " .

malcolm crabb believes his wife pamela , 51 , suffered so-called beauty parlour stroke syndrome after her head was bent back while being washed at a salon .
mr crabb , 49 , said he wanted to " alert others to the dangers of beauty parlour syndrome , especially those with high blood pressure " .
" i think there should be warnings in hairdressers about it , " he added .
mrs crabb suffered her first stroke following a hair appointment in september 2000 , but died last week when a second stroke proved fatal .
her grieving husband says she never fully recovered from the first stroke , which he blames on beauty parlour stroke syndrome .
after the hair appointment in september 2000 mrs crabb felt ill , her speech became slurred and her hands became claw-like .
she felt awful and i did n't know what the matter was - her speech then became slurred and her hands became like claws malcolm crabb hospital tests showed that she had suffered a stroke .
a spokesman from the stroke association said : " there is no real research to support it as yet but cases have been published in medical journals .
" although there is not yet a proven link there is anecdotal evidence and we would welcome research into this area . "
' kinks ' experts believe that when the head is pushed backwards onto a sink it can lead to overextension in the neck .
a consultant neurologist at cumberland infirmary , david bateman , said : " if your neck is stretched and it kinks for a long time - as happens during hairwashing - you stretch the arteries and if you are unlucky you can tear them . "
bleeding between layers of tissue can cause blood clots to build up , leading to a stroke , he told the times .
mr crabb remembers that during the first stroke his wife 's face " had gone very , very red " .
" when she got up she was n't speaking like she normally would .
" she felt awful and i did n't know what the matter was .
her speech then became slurred and her hands became like claws . "
at the hospital she was asked if she had had any neck injuries , and if she had had her hair done recently .
" after that it all fell in to place and we connected the stroke with the way she had her hair washed , " mr crabb said .
the couple recently moved from their home in poole , dorset , to spain 's costa del sol because of the hotter climate .
mr crabb said : " she was always cold and could never get warm so we decided to move to spain and we flew over on new year 's day this year . "
five-minute wash in 1997 medical journal the lancet published a report by two british doctors about a 42-year-old woman who suffered a stroke after having her hair washed .
the experts said the stroke was due to " dissection of her right internal carotid artery " .
her head had been extended backwards for about five minutes while being washed and after the treatment she felt numb and suffered slurred speech .
she made a partial recovery after being treated with anticoagulants .
the doctors recommended that hairdressers use a cushion and that the neck is not overextended .

' kinks ' experts believe that when the head is pushed backwards onto a sink it can lead to overextension in the neck .
a consultant neurologist at cumberland infirmary , david bateman , said : " if your neck is stretched and it kinks for a long time - as happens during hairwashing - you stretch the arteries and if you are unlucky you can tear them . "

the couple recently moved from their home in poole , dorset , to spain 's costa del sol because of the hotter climate .
mr crabb said : " she was always cold and could never get warm so we decided to move to spain and we flew over on new year 's day this year . "

sparrowhawks in particular had been blamed for killing the birds at lofts and during races .
but the study , funded by scottish natural heritage and the scottish homing union , said they were responsible for fewer than 1 % of the disappearances .
the report said more could be done to tackle successful attacks .
the two-year study was carried out by the central science laboratory -lrb- csl -rrb- and overseen by a working group chaired by scottish national party msp alex neil .
more than 50 % of racing pigeons are lost each year its aim was to assess the level of raptor attacks on racing pigeons and investigate ways to reduce their impact .
shu members supplied researchers with data on pigeon losses , recoveries of pigeon rings from peregrine eyries and pigeon carcasses .
the study found that 56 % of racing pigeons were reported lost each year .
however , more than 50 % of lofts reported no losses to sparrowhawks .
fewer than 1 % of pigeons were reported to have been taken by sparrowhawks .
mirrors and reflectors it was estimated that a minimum of 2 % of racing pigeons were taken by peregrine falcons .
the report said that a variety of measures were needed to protect racing pigeons .
the research suggested that steps such as using mirrors and reflectors may help reduce the number of pigeons being taken around lofts .
sparrowhawks had been blamed by some for the losses the csl said further research was needed to investigate why so many racing pigeons stray and scatter on race routes .
it also said that further guidelines could be produced to help loft owners in the use of deterrents and the siting and management of pigeon lofts .
snh deputy chairman michael scott , a member of the working group , said : " the central science laboratory has completed an admirable piece of research and has provided a valuable assessment of losses of racing pigeons to a wide range of factors .
" the estimated losses of racing pigeons to raptors appear to be small .
" we note that more research is recommended , notably on the causes of straying and on management measures to minimise pigeon losses around lofts . "
