he 's accompanied by a delegation of business and science leaders pushing for deeper economic and political ties . schröder is visiting hungary on the occasion of the 15th anniversary of the date hungary opened its borders to east germans and allowed them to leave to the west - a development that created an extremely positive new dimension in west germany 's ties with the then-eastern bloc nation .
earlier this year , former german president johannes rau spoke of the importance of that development during a visit to budapest .
" we owe an awful lot to hungary ...
if hungary had n't shut off its electrical fence on may 2 , 1989 , which allowed many from the ddr to come to west germany , the developments in prague on sept .
20 would n't have happened and the -lrb- berlin -rrb- wall would n't have fallen on nov .
9 , " rau said .
" in some respects , the hungarians were the intiators of german unity . "
for a long time , the magyars would have been thankful for a few handouts from germany .
but the burdens of german unity and the costs of rebuilding the east german infrastructure left little room for german financial aid to the hungarians .
a visit with new prime minister designate still , relations between the two countries have developed positively .
there are no major sticking points between the countries , and schröder can look forward to a relaxing trip aimed at deepening the countries ' political , economic and scientific cooperation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- right -rrb- , and outgoing hungarian prime minister peter medgyessy schröder will be meeting with outgoing hungarian prime minister peter medgyessy , who announced his resignation in august following a government coalition crisis , as well as his nominated successor , ferenc gyurcsany .
the 43-year-old shooting star of the socialists is expected to be confirmed as prime minister by parliament at the end of the month .
like the political developments between germany and hungary , business ties are also both strong and dynamic .
currently , germany is hungary 's most-important trading partner - a position that could further grow with hungary 's european union membership , which came into effect on may 1 .
germany is also an important foreign investor in hungary .
since 1989 , german companies have invested over € 12 billion -lrb- $ 14.6 billion -rrb- in hungary , representing 55 percent of all foreign investment and creating more than 200,000 jobs .
hungary has an abundance of red tape nevertheless , german companies do n't shy away from the fact that hungary has become less attractive for business .
the country has continually failed in efforts to trim red tape , and there is also a lack of educated workers .
additionally , salaries have risen by 50 percent since 2002 and the exchange of hungary 's currency , the forint , has been a roller coaster ride since june 2003 .
worse yet , contradictory statements about the country 's currency exchange rates and inflation goals and a lax fiscal policy have engendered considerable uncertainty .
but these facts have not been lost on gyurcsany , who has said making hungary more attractive to foreign investors will be a priority .
" in my opinion , it 's important that the country 's economic policy reflect stability and calm so that hungary can continue to be a goal for foreign investors , " he said .
despite some tougher times in recent months , most of the 54 german companies active there are satisfied with hungary as a place for doing business .
indeed , many are planning additional investments - a good basis for deepening economic ties between the two countries .
and on his visit on wednesday , schröder will make that his priority . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hungary mulls future of nuclear energy hungary has been a proponent of nuclear energy for decades .

after getting bad grades from the oecd , german politicians are calling for extensive reforms of the nation 's schools .
it 's not enough to spend more money , the education system needs to be completely re-worked , they said . a day after germany brought home failing grades from the organization for economic cooperation and development for its education system , the nation 's politicians responded like worried parents .
it was the second time in two years that the country , which prides itself on producing some of the world 's leading philosophers and scientists , had received negative marks for government spending , number of hours spent in the classroom and pupil-teacher ratios .
on wednesday , education experts in the government coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens minced no words in calling on germany to prepare itself better for the future .
in addition to increasing much-needed government investment in the education system -lrb- only about 9.7 percent of total spending goes towards schools -rrb- , the politicians called for far-reaching reforms of the nation 's traditional school structure .
school for all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teachers need to spend more time with each pupil in the elementary schools .
krista sager , parliamentary fraction leader for the greens , told the berliner zeitung germany needed to move away from its three-tiered school model and introduce " a school for all , " where pupils would stay together in one system for nine or ten years .
the current division into three different schools , each tailored to specific education abilities and skills , is " more befitting of a medieval feudal system than a modern society , " criticized christoph matschie , head of the spd for the eastern state of thuringia .
a general school for all pupils is better equipped for promoting common education standards than a system that " sorts " children at an early age according to their abilities , explained the former state secretary for the education ministry .
matschie told the paper that the traditional division into college-prep highschool , secondary school and vocational school , was partially to blame for the poor results in the oecd study .
pupils performed better when they learned together , he and sager argued .
schleswig-holstein 's state minister for culture and education was also convinced that the three-tiered education system is no longer beneficial to the country .
ute erdsiek-rave said her party of social democrats would campaign together with the greens during the next state election for a reform that supports a " school for all . "
however , a complete revamping of the school system would take between 10 and 15 years , she admitted .
more financial support needed opposition leader angela merkel dismissed calls to introduce such far-reaching reforms .
the head of the conservative christian democrats union said the oecd in no way implied that germany 's traditional three-tiered school model was to blame for failures in german education .
the international study indicated specifically that germany had done too little to improve standards in kindergartens and elementary schools , she argued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a typical german classroom ?
germany 's problems were largely the result of large classrooms and too little instruction time , she said , both of which could be rectified with more investment .
the pupil-teacher ratio needs to be improved , merkel said , pointing to the statistic that germany had 24 pupils per teacher in elementary schools , the highest number among the 30 industrial countries surveyed .
t with a view to government plans to expand the number of all-day schools , merkel said germany was on the right road to increasing the amount of time children spend in the classroom .
the oecd study showed that german pupils aged seven and eight attend school on average for 626 hours a year , compared with 788 on average in the oecd .
germany needs to invest more in building all-day schools , she said and called for a speedy introduction of tax reforms that would open up more funds for education .
money is not the answer " we must once and for all start investing in the education system , " merkel told rbb information radio on wednesday .
but the head of the german union for teachers and researchers , eva-maria stange , cautioned against thinking only in terms of financial support .
german politicians needed to " do their homework , " she said .

after getting bad grades from the oecd , german politicians are calling for extensive reforms of the nation 's schools .
it 's not enough to spend more money , the education system needs to be completely re-worked , they said . a day after germany brought home failing grades from the organization for economic cooperation and development for its education system , the nation 's politicians responded like worried parents .
it was the second time in two years that the country , which prides itself on producing some of the world 's leading philosophers and scientists , had received negative marks for government spending , number of hours spent in the classroom and pupil-teacher ratios .
on wednesday , education experts in the government coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens minced no words in calling on germany to prepare itself better for the future .
in addition to increasing much-needed government investment in the education system -lrb- only about 9.7 percent of total spending goes towards schools -rrb- , the politicians called for far-reaching reforms of the nation 's traditional school structure .
school for all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teachers need to spend more time with each pupil in the elementary schools .
krista sager , parliamentary fraction leader for the greens , told the berliner zeitung germany needed to move away from its three-tiered school model and introduce " a school for all , " where pupils would stay together in one system for nine or ten years .
the current division into three different schools , each tailored to specific education abilities and skills , is " more befitting of a medieval feudal system than a modern society , " criticized christoph matschie , head of the spd for the eastern state of thuringia .
a general school for all pupils is better equipped for promoting common education standards than a system that " sorts " children at an early age according to their abilities , explained the former state secretary for the education ministry .
matschie told the paper that the traditional division into college-prep highschool , secondary school and vocational school , was partially to blame for the poor results in the oecd study .
pupils performed better when they learned together , he and sager argued .
schleswig-holstein 's state minister for culture and education was also convinced that the three-tiered education system is no longer beneficial to the country .

he 's accompanied by a delegation of business and science leaders pushing for deeper economic and political ties . schröder is visiting hungary on the occasion of the 15th anniversary of the date hungary opened its borders to east germans and allowed them to leave to the west - a development that created an extremely positive new dimension in west germany 's ties with the then-eastern bloc nation .
earlier this year , former german president johannes rau spoke of the importance of that development during a visit to budapest .
" we owe an awful lot to hungary ...

currently , germany is hungary 's most-important trading partner - a position that could further grow with hungary 's european union membership , which came into effect on may 1 .
germany is also an important foreign investor in hungary .

additionally , salaries have risen by 50 percent since 2002 and the exchange of hungary 's currency , the forint , has been a roller coaster ride since june 2003 .
worse yet , contradictory statements about the country 's currency exchange rates and inflation goals and a lax fiscal policy have engendered considerable uncertainty .
but these facts have not been lost on gyurcsany , who has said making hungary more attractive to foreign investors will be a priority .
" in my opinion , it 's important that the country 's economic policy reflect stability and calm so that hungary can continue to be a goal for foreign investors , " he said .
despite some tougher times in recent months , most of the 54 german companies active there are satisfied with hungary as a place for doing business .

he 's accompanied by a delegation of business and science leaders pushing for deeper economic and political ties . schröder is visiting hungary on the occasion of the 15th anniversary of the date hungary opened its borders to east germans and allowed them to leave to the west - a development that created an extremely positive new dimension in west germany 's ties with the then-eastern bloc nation .
earlier this year , former german president johannes rau spoke of the importance of that development during a visit to budapest .
" we owe an awful lot to hungary ...
if hungary had n't shut off its electrical fence on may 2 , 1989 , which allowed many from the ddr to come to west germany , the developments in prague on sept .
20 would n't have happened and the -lrb- berlin -rrb- wall would n't have fallen on nov .
9 , " rau said .
" in some respects , the hungarians were the intiators of german unity . "
for a long time , the magyars would have been thankful for a few handouts from germany .
but the burdens of german unity and the costs of rebuilding the east german infrastructure left little room for german financial aid to the hungarians .
a visit with new prime minister designate still , relations between the two countries have developed positively .
there are no major sticking points between the countries , and schröder can look forward to a relaxing trip aimed at deepening the countries ' political , economic and scientific cooperation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- right -rrb- , and outgoing hungarian prime minister peter medgyessy schröder will be meeting with outgoing hungarian prime minister peter medgyessy , who announced his resignation in august following a government coalition crisis , as well as his nominated successor , ferenc gyurcsany .
the 43-year-old shooting star of the socialists is expected to be confirmed as prime minister by parliament at the end of the month .
like the political developments between germany and hungary , business ties are also both strong and dynamic .
currently , germany is hungary 's most-important trading partner - a position that could further grow with hungary 's european union membership , which came into effect on may 1 .
germany is also an important foreign investor in hungary .
since 1989 , german companies have invested over € 12 billion -lrb- $ 14.6 billion -rrb- in hungary , representing 55 percent of all foreign investment and creating more than 200,000 jobs .
hungary has an abundance of red tape nevertheless , german companies do n't shy away from the fact that hungary has become less attractive for business .
the country has continually failed in efforts to trim red tape , and there is also a lack of educated workers .
additionally , salaries have risen by 50 percent since 2002 and the exchange of hungary 's currency , the forint , has been a roller coaster ride since june 2003 .
worse yet , contradictory statements about the country 's currency exchange rates and inflation goals and a lax fiscal policy have engendered considerable uncertainty .
but these facts have not been lost on gyurcsany , who has said making hungary more attractive to foreign investors will be a priority .
" in my opinion , it 's important that the country 's economic policy reflect stability and calm so that hungary can continue to be a goal for foreign investors , " he said .
despite some tougher times in recent months , most of the 54 german companies active there are satisfied with hungary as a place for doing business .
indeed , many are planning additional investments - a good basis for deepening economic ties between the two countries .
and on his visit on wednesday , schröder will make that his priority . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hungary mulls future of nuclear energy hungary has been a proponent of nuclear energy for decades .

after getting bad grades from the oecd , german politicians are calling for extensive reforms of the nation 's schools .
it 's not enough to spend more money , the education system needs to be completely re-worked , they said . a day after germany brought home failing grades from the organization for economic cooperation and development for its education system , the nation 's politicians responded like worried parents .
it was the second time in two years that the country , which prides itself on producing some of the world 's leading philosophers and scientists , had received negative marks for government spending , number of hours spent in the classroom and pupil-teacher ratios .
on wednesday , education experts in the government coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens minced no words in calling on germany to prepare itself better for the future .
in addition to increasing much-needed government investment in the education system -lrb- only about 9.7 percent of total spending goes towards schools -rrb- , the politicians called for far-reaching reforms of the nation 's traditional school structure .
school for all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teachers need to spend more time with each pupil in the elementary schools .
krista sager , parliamentary fraction leader for the greens , told the berliner zeitung germany needed to move away from its three-tiered school model and introduce " a school for all , " where pupils would stay together in one system for nine or ten years .
the current division into three different schools , each tailored to specific education abilities and skills , is " more befitting of a medieval feudal system than a modern society , " criticized christoph matschie , head of the spd for the eastern state of thuringia .
a general school for all pupils is better equipped for promoting common education standards than a system that " sorts " children at an early age according to their abilities , explained the former state secretary for the education ministry .
matschie told the paper that the traditional division into college-prep highschool , secondary school and vocational school , was partially to blame for the poor results in the oecd study .
pupils performed better when they learned together , he and sager argued .
schleswig-holstein 's state minister for culture and education was also convinced that the three-tiered education system is no longer beneficial to the country .
ute erdsiek-rave said her party of social democrats would campaign together with the greens during the next state election for a reform that supports a " school for all . "
however , a complete revamping of the school system would take between 10 and 15 years , she admitted .
more financial support needed opposition leader angela merkel dismissed calls to introduce such far-reaching reforms .
the head of the conservative christian democrats union said the oecd in no way implied that germany 's traditional three-tiered school model was to blame for failures in german education .
the international study indicated specifically that germany had done too little to improve standards in kindergartens and elementary schools , she argued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a typical german classroom ?
germany 's problems were largely the result of large classrooms and too little instruction time , she said , both of which could be rectified with more investment .
the pupil-teacher ratio needs to be improved , merkel said , pointing to the statistic that germany had 24 pupils per teacher in elementary schools , the highest number among the 30 industrial countries surveyed .
t with a view to government plans to expand the number of all-day schools , merkel said germany was on the right road to increasing the amount of time children spend in the classroom .
the oecd study showed that german pupils aged seven and eight attend school on average for 626 hours a year , compared with 788 on average in the oecd .
germany needs to invest more in building all-day schools , she said and called for a speedy introduction of tax reforms that would open up more funds for education .
money is not the answer " we must once and for all start investing in the education system , " merkel told rbb information radio on wednesday .
but the head of the german union for teachers and researchers , eva-maria stange , cautioned against thinking only in terms of financial support .
german politicians needed to " do their homework , " she said .
the oecd report clearly showed " german schools need not just more money , but fundamental reforms . " dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bad grades for german schools germany ’ s school system has gotten bad marks yet again .

young germans have long labored under the weight of guilt from the nation 's past but have recently pushed for more pride in their country .
however , pro-german lyrics in pop songs are causing concern . germany 's gradual relaxation towards its national identity is causing concern among recording artists and musicians as an increasing number of songs appearing in the pop charts seem to contain lyrics which could be misconstrued as nationalist . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul van dyk for months , the single " we " has been riding high in the german charts .
a collaboration between techno dj paul van dyk -lrb- photo -rrb- and wolfsheim singer peter heppner , the song proudly recounts german post-war history with lyrics such as " i ask myself who we are .
we are we .
divided , defeated but , nevertheless , in the end , we 're still alive . " the song is accompanied by a video that contains images of women rebuilding bombed cities with their bare hands and amputee soldiers returning from the war . " we " portrays germans as victims in a land split between the allies and its people humiliated .
but there is no mention of the war , of the holocaust or the third reich .
instead the song celebrates the german success history : the reconstruction , the miracle of bern and the reunification . it is , essentially , a love song to germany . no more shame over nationality another example comes from the group mia in the song " it is what it is . "
front woman mieze sings about german pride and the creation of the national colors displayed in the post-war flag : " a gulp of the black coffee wakes me up , your red mouth touches me gently , at this moment , it clicks and the yellow sun rises , " referring to the colors in germany 's national flag : black , red and gold . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mieze and other mia members in a publicity shot mieze later sings about the rejection of past generations and the embracing of a new german identity : " if anyone asks me now where i come from , i no longer feel sorry for myself … i risk it all for love , i feel ready . " such words and images are making some people uncomfortable .
germans have struggled for years with the weight of guilt associated with the nation 's record in two world wars but younger generations have begun to reclaim german identity and move on from the crimes of the past to take pride in their country . target audience rich pickings for neo-nazis but some commentators see a danger in popular music becoming the voice of a new german pride , fearing it could be hijacked by far right organizations and used as nationalist propaganda in a market targeted at a young , impressionable record buying public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazi demonstrators anetta kahane of the amadeu antonio foundation , a group based in berlin which promotes democratic initiatives to resist right wing extremism , views the development in german pop music with concern . " far right organizations think this is great , " she said .
" they rightly perceive this as national pride suddenly becoming something normal . " far-right groups use music 's influence the reactions of the neo-nazis show that kahane is right .
the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- mouthpiece national voice wrote that mia stands up for a " relaxed attitude to its own nation . "
mia 's attitude has " scratched out " the left-wing supremacy in german youth , wrote the paper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rammstein flirtations with the far-right are not a new phenomenon .
groups such as rammstein -lrb- photo -rrb- and , more specifically , böhse onkelz which made no secret the fact that it was a part of the german skinhead scene in the 1980s and published songs with titles like " turks out " and " germany for the germans , " were championed by neo-nazis but have since renounced their right-wing leanings . mia on the other hand keeps pointing out that they do not want to be associated with rightwing extremists .
they add that they simply want to help jump-start a discussion about german identity . but musicians can not choose their fans : at a mia concert in the western german town of bielefeld , three rightwing extremists attacked a dark-skinned student , according to local news reports .

young germans have long labored under the weight of guilt from the nation 's past but have recently pushed for more pride in their country .
however , pro-german lyrics in pop songs are causing concern . germany 's gradual relaxation towards its national identity is causing concern among recording artists and musicians as an increasing number of songs appearing in the pop charts seem to contain lyrics which could be misconstrued as nationalist . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul van dyk for months , the single " we " has been riding high in the german charts .
a collaboration between techno dj paul van dyk -lrb- photo -rrb- and wolfsheim singer peter heppner , the song proudly recounts german post-war history with lyrics such as " i ask myself who we are .
we are we .
divided , defeated but , nevertheless , in the end , we 're still alive . " the song is accompanied by a video that contains images of women rebuilding bombed cities with their bare hands and amputee soldiers returning from the war . " we " portrays germans as victims in a land split between the allies and its people humiliated .
but there is no mention of the war , of the holocaust or the third reich .
instead the song celebrates the german success history : the reconstruction , the miracle of bern and the reunification . it is , essentially , a love song to germany . no more shame over nationality another example comes from the group mia in the song " it is what it is . "
front woman mieze sings about german pride and the creation of the national colors displayed in the post-war flag : " a gulp of the black coffee wakes me up , your red mouth touches me gently , at this moment , it clicks and the yellow sun rises , " referring to the colors in germany 's national flag : black , red and gold . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mieze and other mia members in a publicity shot mieze later sings about the rejection of past generations and the embracing of a new german identity : " if anyone asks me now where i come from , i no longer feel sorry for myself … i risk it all for love , i feel ready . " such words and images are making some people uncomfortable .
germans have struggled for years with the weight of guilt associated with the nation 's record in two world wars but younger generations have begun to reclaim german identity and move on from the crimes of the past to take pride in their country . target audience rich pickings for neo-nazis but some commentators see a danger in popular music becoming the voice of a new german pride , fearing it could be hijacked by far right organizations and used as nationalist propaganda in a market targeted at a young , impressionable record buying public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazi demonstrators anetta kahane of the amadeu antonio foundation , a group based in berlin which promotes democratic initiatives to resist right wing extremism , views the development in german pop music with concern . " far right organizations think this is great , " she said .
" they rightly perceive this as national pride suddenly becoming something normal . " far-right groups use music 's influence the reactions of the neo-nazis show that kahane is right .
the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- mouthpiece national voice wrote that mia stands up for a " relaxed attitude to its own nation . "
mia 's attitude has " scratched out " the left-wing supremacy in german youth , wrote the paper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rammstein flirtations with the far-right are not a new phenomenon .
groups such as rammstein -lrb- photo -rrb- and , more specifically , böhse onkelz which made no secret the fact that it was a part of the german skinhead scene in the 1980s and published songs with titles like " turks out " and " germany for the germans , " were championed by neo-nazis but have since renounced their right-wing leanings . mia on the other hand keeps pointing out that they do not want to be associated with rightwing extremists .
they add that they simply want to help jump-start a discussion about german identity . but musicians can not choose their fans : at a mia concert in the western german town of bielefeld , three rightwing extremists attacked a dark-skinned student , according to local news reports .
organizers of another festival at which mia was scheduled to appear asked the band 's management to comment on the incident .

" if the company is looking for a conflict , we are ready to back up our claims with protest action and warning strikes , " chief ig metall negotiator harmut meine told die welt newspaper ahead of the talks . " shareholders get a dividend and the workers have to tighten their belts with a wage freeze , " he said .
" it 's not fair . " ig metall , germany 's most powerful industrial union , blamed volkswagen for creating a climate of conflict ahead of the negotiations , whose first rounds start later wednesday , and asked vw to be prudent with its public comments . " we have not even started to negotiate and here comes a financial wizard from the management board who heats up the climate of negotiations with unnecessary chatter , " he said in reference to comments by chief financial officer hans-dieter pötsch . pötsch last week said about 30,000 jobs are at risk if wage negotiations end without cutting costs .

they also demanded that the german government of social democrats and greens finally depart from what they described as an economic and social zigzag course . the industry associations in eastern germany say the current debate about equal living standards in the two halves of the reunited country wo n't serve as an excuse to do nothing about the current discrepancies . but in a statement issued in berlin , walter botschatzki , the president of the business associations in the eastern state of thuringia , said the east remains grateful for the billions of euros in western aid it has received and will continue to receive in the framework of a solidarity pact geared to making the east more competitive . he warned though that the current social and economic woes in the east are being misused by both left and right-wing forces to push their own agenda for next weekend 's regional elections in the states of brandenburg and saxony . achievements should be recognized " the enormous achievements that the whole country has recorded in the east ’ s economic recovery over the past 15 years are being belittled on purpose by some forces in our society , " botschatzki told dw-radio .
" let ’ s not forget that eastern germany now has an extremely modern transport and telecommunications infrastructure .
there are also very competitive clusters of industry in the east , like the semi-conductor centers in dresden or the automobile industry in leipzig . " botschatzki also spoke of the big strides which have been made in the metal-working and electronics industries in the east .
following a downturn in productivity in the period before 1997 , he said the past seven years had seen an enormous upswing in these sectors , creating more than 50,000 jobs across the east . he added that much more could be achieved with clear political signals from berlin .
easterners , he claimed , had proven in the past that they were willing to take their share of reforms , as long as those reforms made sense to them . people need faith in reforms " the current political zig-zag course , the lack of real reform prospects and the poor communication of reform efforts by the government have resulted in more and more people feeling insecure , " botschatzki said .
" confidence and faith in the government ’ s policies is decreasing , and that leads in the end to less stability in our democratic system . " botschatzki added that right after german unification in 1990 , easterners had hoped that living standards across the country would level out within 10 years or so .
they now had to accept that this was wishful thinking .
the same applied to their hopes for equal wages . klaus von dohnanyi , who was commissioned by the government to work out a more effective economic program for the east , says people have to face current realities . they 'll have to accept new low-wage employment opportunities rather than going on the dole . " we have new competition also from eastern europe and must see that these people in east germany are capable of making a living , " he said .
" and therefore we discuss the earned tax credit systems in the united states , for example , something we should add to the wages to remain competitive and at the same time have adequate living in the relatively high cost country germany . " von dohnanyi has explicitly supported president köhler 's recent statement that equal living conditions will not be achieved . he said the man had the courage to speak the truth rather than stooping to populist formulas which didn ’ t help anyone in the country .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 15.09.2004 ig metall union threatens vw with strikes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things do n't look so shiny for vw at the moment germany 's powerful ig metall union has threatened europe 's biggest car maker , volkswagen , with strikes if its wage demands are not met , setting the stage wednesday for a confrontational round of talks . " if the company is looking for a conflict , we are ready to back up our claims with protest action and warning strikes , " chief ig metall negotiator harmut meine told die welt newspaper ahead of the talks . " shareholders get a dividend and the workers have to tighten their belts with a wage freeze , " he said .
" it 's not fair . " ig metall , germany 's most powerful industrial union , blamed volkswagen for creating a climate of conflict ahead of the negotiations , whose first rounds start later wednesday , and asked vw to be prudent with its public comments . " we have not even started to negotiate and here comes a financial wizard from the management board who heats up the climate of negotiations with unnecessary chatter , " he said in reference to comments by chief financial officer hans-dieter pötsch . pötsch last week said about 30,000 jobs are at risk if wage negotiations end without cutting costs . " that is irresponsible , " meine said . the wage negotiations at vw often set the standard for the rest of the industry , and the country 's biggest industrial union and employers typically take distant but firm positions as the talks get under way . ig metall , which is negotiating on behalf of 103,000 manufacturing employees , is asking for job guarantees and a 4 percent pay rise from oct .
1 , after a two-year wage agreement expires at the end of this month . a pre-emptive strike ? but vw , in an unusual negotiating stance , has already disclosed what it intends to propose to the union even before the talks start : a two-year wage freeze and various cuts in pay and benefits . the usual negotiating tactic of companies is to wait for the union to declare its demands during the first round , then wait a few weeks before divulging its counter-proposals . " we will not agree to a wage freeze , " meine said , adding that he could not say how long the talks would drag on . " but i expect difficult negotiations and a heated conflict , " he said . analysts polled by the afx financial news service on the eve of the talks said the positions of the two sides are so far apart that they may well be on a collision course that could lead to production disruptions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it will definitely be a very difficult negotiation , " said economist eckhard tuchtfeld at commerzbank .
he added it would be very difficult for ig metall to agree to a wage freeze because they were already insisting on a four percent increase . " if it had said it wanted two percent or so , then it would be easier to back down from the original demand .
but from four percent to zero , they would really look funny , " tuchtfeld said . other analysts said the investor community has already factored into this year 's estimates for vw the possibility of output cuts as a result of strikes which ig metall might call to back its wage demands . abu dhabi deal fails in more bad news for volkswagen on wednesday , the company said that talks to sell a 9.8 percent stake in vw to an investment group from abu dhabi had been called off due to disagreement over the price . " both sides regret this development , but see promising prospectives for working together on other present projects , " vw said in a statement . vw wanted to the sale of shares to help finance the purchase of 50 percent of dutch car leasing and management firm leaseplan .
the deal will now be paid for out of vw 's current operating revenue . vw 's stock fell sharply after news of the ending of the talks broke .

they also demanded that the german government of social democrats and greens finally depart from what they described as an economic and social zigzag course . the industry associations in eastern germany say the current debate about equal living standards in the two halves of the reunited country wo n't serve as an excuse to do nothing about the current discrepancies . but in a statement issued in berlin , walter botschatzki , the president of the business associations in the eastern state of thuringia , said the east remains grateful for the billions of euros in western aid it has received and will continue to receive in the framework of a solidarity pact geared to making the east more competitive . he warned though that the current social and economic woes in the east are being misused by both left and right-wing forces to push their own agenda for next weekend 's regional elections in the states of brandenburg and saxony . achievements should be recognized " the enormous achievements that the whole country has recorded in the east ’ s economic recovery over the past 15 years are being belittled on purpose by some forces in our society , " botschatzki told dw-radio .
" let ’ s not forget that eastern germany now has an extremely modern transport and telecommunications infrastructure .
there are also very competitive clusters of industry in the east , like the semi-conductor centers in dresden or the automobile industry in leipzig . " botschatzki also spoke of the big strides which have been made in the metal-working and electronics industries in the east .
following a downturn in productivity in the period before 1997 , he said the past seven years had seen an enormous upswing in these sectors , creating more than 50,000 jobs across the east . he added that much more could be achieved with clear political signals from berlin .
easterners , he claimed , had proven in the past that they were willing to take their share of reforms , as long as those reforms made sense to them . people need faith in reforms " the current political zig-zag course , the lack of real reform prospects and the poor communication of reform efforts by the government have resulted in more and more people feeling insecure , " botschatzki said .
" confidence and faith in the government ’ s policies is decreasing , and that leads in the end to less stability in our democratic system . " botschatzki added that right after german unification in 1990 , easterners had hoped that living standards across the country would level out within 10 years or so .
they now had to accept that this was wishful thinking .
the same applied to their hopes for equal wages . klaus von dohnanyi , who was commissioned by the government to work out a more effective economic program for the east , says people have to face current realities . they 'll have to accept new low-wage employment opportunities rather than going on the dole . " we have new competition also from eastern europe and must see that these people in east germany are capable of making a living , " he said .
" and therefore we discuss the earned tax credit systems in the united states , for example , something we should add to the wages to remain competitive and at the same time have adequate living in the relatively high cost country germany . " von dohnanyi has explicitly supported president köhler 's recent statement that equal living conditions will not be achieved . he said the man had the courage to speak the truth rather than stooping to populist formulas which didn ’ t help anyone in the country .
president köhler continues to draw massive criticism from predominantly eastern policy-makers for saying that equal living standards are nothing but a myth . hardy graupner -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a land of differences while the core of german president horst köhler 's remarks on differences in living and employment standards focused on eastern and western states , figures published on tuesday show discrepencies across the whole country .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 15.09.2004 ig metall union threatens vw with strikes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things do n't look so shiny for vw at the moment germany 's powerful ig metall union has threatened europe 's biggest car maker , volkswagen , with strikes if its wage demands are not met , setting the stage wednesday for a confrontational round of talks . " if the company is looking for a conflict , we are ready to back up our claims with protest action and warning strikes , " chief ig metall negotiator harmut meine told die welt newspaper ahead of the talks . " shareholders get a dividend and the workers have to tighten their belts with a wage freeze , " he said .
" it 's not fair . " ig metall , germany 's most powerful industrial union , blamed volkswagen for creating a climate of conflict ahead of the negotiations , whose first rounds start later wednesday , and asked vw to be prudent with its public comments . " we have not even started to negotiate and here comes a financial wizard from the management board who heats up the climate of negotiations with unnecessary chatter , " he said in reference to comments by chief financial officer hans-dieter pötsch . pötsch last week said about 30,000 jobs are at risk if wage negotiations end without cutting costs . " that is irresponsible , " meine said . the wage negotiations at vw often set the standard for the rest of the industry , and the country 's biggest industrial union and employers typically take distant but firm positions as the talks get under way . ig metall , which is negotiating on behalf of 103,000 manufacturing employees , is asking for job guarantees and a 4 percent pay rise from oct .
1 , after a two-year wage agreement expires at the end of this month . a pre-emptive strike ? but vw , in an unusual negotiating stance , has already disclosed what it intends to propose to the union even before the talks start : a two-year wage freeze and various cuts in pay and benefits . the usual negotiating tactic of companies is to wait for the union to declare its demands during the first round , then wait a few weeks before divulging its counter-proposals . " we will not agree to a wage freeze , " meine said , adding that he could not say how long the talks would drag on . " but i expect difficult negotiations and a heated conflict , " he said . analysts polled by the afx financial news service on the eve of the talks said the positions of the two sides are so far apart that they may well be on a collision course that could lead to production disruptions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it will definitely be a very difficult negotiation , " said economist eckhard tuchtfeld at commerzbank .
he added it would be very difficult for ig metall to agree to a wage freeze because they were already insisting on a four percent increase . " if it had said it wanted two percent or so , then it would be easier to back down from the original demand .
but from four percent to zero , they would really look funny , " tuchtfeld said . other analysts said the investor community has already factored into this year 's estimates for vw the possibility of output cuts as a result of strikes which ig metall might call to back its wage demands . abu dhabi deal fails in more bad news for volkswagen on wednesday , the company said that talks to sell a 9.8 percent stake in vw to an investment group from abu dhabi had been called off due to disagreement over the price . " both sides regret this development , but see promising prospectives for working together on other present projects , " vw said in a statement . vw wanted to the sale of shares to help finance the purchase of 50 percent of dutch car leasing and management firm leaseplan .
the deal will now be paid for out of vw 's current operating revenue . vw 's stock fell sharply after news of the ending of the talks broke .
in late afternoon trade on wednesday , volkswagen shares dropped 2.67 percent to € 32.47 -lrb- $ 39.46 -rrb- . afp / dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german auto industry at risk germany 's tradition as a center of car manufacturing could be in jeopardy as more businesses look to move east in response to rising wages and inflexible labor markets .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 15.09.2004 fears of nationalism as pop pushes german pride großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin band mia promotes pride in germany but is it really nationalist ?
young germans have long labored under the weight of guilt from the nation 's past but have recently pushed for more pride in their country .
however , pro-german lyrics in pop songs are causing concern . germany 's gradual relaxation towards its national identity is causing concern among recording artists and musicians as an increasing number of songs appearing in the pop charts seem to contain lyrics which could be misconstrued as nationalist . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul van dyk for months , the single " we " has been riding high in the german charts .
a collaboration between techno dj paul van dyk -lrb- photo -rrb- and wolfsheim singer peter heppner , the song proudly recounts german post-war history with lyrics such as " i ask myself who we are .
we are we .
divided , defeated but , nevertheless , in the end , we 're still alive . " the song is accompanied by a video that contains images of women rebuilding bombed cities with their bare hands and amputee soldiers returning from the war . " we " portrays germans as victims in a land split between the allies and its people humiliated .
but there is no mention of the war , of the holocaust or the third reich .
instead the song celebrates the german success history : the reconstruction , the miracle of bern and the reunification . it is , essentially , a love song to germany . no more shame over nationality another example comes from the group mia in the song " it is what it is . "
front woman mieze sings about german pride and the creation of the national colors displayed in the post-war flag : " a gulp of the black coffee wakes me up , your red mouth touches me gently , at this moment , it clicks and the yellow sun rises , " referring to the colors in germany 's national flag : black , red and gold . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mieze and other mia members in a publicity shot mieze later sings about the rejection of past generations and the embracing of a new german identity : " if anyone asks me now where i come from , i no longer feel sorry for myself … i risk it all for love , i feel ready . " such words and images are making some people uncomfortable .
germans have struggled for years with the weight of guilt associated with the nation 's record in two world wars but younger generations have begun to reclaim german identity and move on from the crimes of the past to take pride in their country . target audience rich pickings for neo-nazis but some commentators see a danger in popular music becoming the voice of a new german pride , fearing it could be hijacked by far right organizations and used as nationalist propaganda in a market targeted at a young , impressionable record buying public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazi demonstrators anetta kahane of the amadeu antonio foundation , a group based in berlin which promotes democratic initiatives to resist right wing extremism , views the development in german pop music with concern . " far right organizations think this is great , " she said .
" they rightly perceive this as national pride suddenly becoming something normal . " far-right groups use music 's influence the reactions of the neo-nazis show that kahane is right .
the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- mouthpiece national voice wrote that mia stands up for a " relaxed attitude to its own nation . "
mia 's attitude has " scratched out " the left-wing supremacy in german youth , wrote the paper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rammstein flirtations with the far-right are not a new phenomenon .
groups such as rammstein -lrb- photo -rrb- and , more specifically , böhse onkelz which made no secret the fact that it was a part of the german skinhead scene in the 1980s and published songs with titles like " turks out " and " germany for the germans , " were championed by neo-nazis but have since renounced their right-wing leanings . mia on the other hand keeps pointing out that they do not want to be associated with rightwing extremists .
they add that they simply want to help jump-start a discussion about german identity . but musicians can not choose their fans : at a mia concert in the western german town of bielefeld , three rightwing extremists attacked a dark-skinned student , according to local news reports .
organizers of another festival at which mia was scheduled to appear asked the band 's management to comment on the incident .

now , a recent spate of books , films , and exhibitions is taking a critical look at this chapter - and making it a matter of debate . england , france and belgium are among the countries most often mentioned when historians consider europe 's colonial history and its related atrocities .
lesser known , however , is the fact that for 20 years , between 1884 and 1914 , germany lorded over its own swaths of the african continent , including areas of what are today namibia , cameroon , togo , rwanda and burundi . in fact , the infamous congo conference , where european colonial interests divided-up africa and its natural resources , took place in berlin in 1884 .
and though germany only managed to hold onto its share for two decades , it certainly wracked up a record of carnage on par with that of better-known colonial powers . despite these uncomfortable facts , this historical chapter has been all but forgotten by the german public .
now , a spate of new books , films , exhibitions and conferences - all coinciding with the 100th anniversary of two of germany 's most bloody african episodes - are making it a matter of public debate .
for a country already fatigued by efforts to come to terms with the atrocities of world war ii , that 's quite an accomplishment . a short and violent occupation the brief 20 years germany controlled parts of west and east africa were not peaceful .
in 1904 in the german territory of south west africa , today namibia , german troops led by general lothar von trotha mercilessly put down a rebellion of the indigenous herero people . by the time the conflict ended four years later , between 45,000 to 65,000 herero were killed , many of whom suffered in work camps some consider the forerunners to wwii-era concentration camps . a year later , in the german held south east africa , today tanzania , the so-called maji-maji war broke out .
there , the local population also rebelled against german rule and likewise suffered the consequences : an estimated 250,000 to 300,000 - one third of the total population - were killed . slow to offer an apology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on the anniversary of the massacre , a group of herero march to honor the dead .
with this year 's 100th anniversary of the atrocities in namibia and the upcoming 100th anniversary of the war in tanzania , the german government has been under added pressure to offer an official apology , which , much to the dismay of herero leaders , has been slow in coming . but in august at the anniversary event in namibia honoring the herero dead , german development and aid minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul came the closest yet any german official has ever gotten to those magic words . " we germans accept our historic and moral responsibility and the guilt incurred by germans , " she told a delighted crowd of more than 1,000 people . " the atrocities committed at that time would have been termed genocide , " she added . however , she ruled out financial compensation for the victims ' descendents ; there is an ongoing lawsuit seeking € 3.3 billion -lrb- $ 4 billion -rrb- in damages . books , exhibitions remind a reluctant public with that historic statement , the german government showed its willingness to take on board yet another difficult chapter in the country 's history .
the general public - with the help of several recent books , films and exhibitions , all addressing the subject - is following suit . gerhard seyfried 's book " herero , " a novel written from the point of view of a young german sent to the western region of africa at the height of the conflict , came out last year and was followed this year by martin baer 's film " white ghosts , " a documentary also looking at the plight of the herero . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the house of world cultures is looking at the legacy of colonialism .
on thursday , the house of world cultures -lrb- haus der kulturen der welt -rrb- in berlin will launch a major multi-disciplinary exhibition entitled " black atlantic " , that - among other things , will look at the legacy of colonial occupation , including that undertaken by germany .
capping things off , an anti-colonialism conference is scheduled to take place in berlin in november . the issue of germany 's colonial legacy has gone beyond the halls of academia , where a few experts debated its significance in relative obscurity , and into the realm of popular culture .
in the process , some say germany is shedding its colonial amnesia . what took so long ? in critically examining its colonial past , germany is following a trend already evident in other former colonial powers .
the question is , what took germany so long ? " when it comes to questions of guilt and responsibility , the germans are simply tired , " gerhard seyfried , author of the novel " herero " , told dw-world , referring to the arduous task of working through the legacy of nazi atrocities . colonial history greatly interested germans before the war , but was simply eclipsed by subsequent events , seyfried said . pascal grosse , a historian who has written extensively on the subject and will participate in a panel discussion on the topic in conjunction with the " black atlantic " exhibition in berlin , concurred . " the scale of the holocaust overshadowed previous events , " he told dw-world . but with an ever-more interconnected world resulting from globalization , germans , like others in different countries , are increasingly interested in their role in the world - both past and present , grosse said . a century later , some debate relevance but that said , what purpose does dredging up events so far in the past serve ? " we need to look at this material again and again , it 's never enough to say we 've done that , let 's move on , " shaheen merali , a curator who put together the visual arts component of the " black atlantic " exhibition told dw-world . for seyfried , such critical self reflection of colonial atrocities serves the same purpose similar reflection on world war ii-era crimes does .

" an inter-ministerial group will be charged with evaluating the losses suffered by poland as a result of world war ii , " the polish foreign minister said tuesday following a government meeting to examine a controversial parliament resolution last week that called for war reparations from germany .
cimoszewicz said the exercise was purely intended to provide a " reminder of the causes and effects of war , " and reiterated the government 's refusal to seek reparations from berlin .
" our intention is not linked to any demand for compensation , " he said .
" it is a case of illustrating and reminding those who may have forgotten about world war ii and its consequences . "
" it is perhaps such forgetfulness that has led to demands for compensation from us , " he added , in reference to a series of recent claims for restitution of property seized from germans forced to flee poland after 1945 .
cimoszewicz added that the government would " work out provisions to support its citizens if they were brought before the courts over a claim for compensation . "
" the question of compensation on either side is closed , " he said , while calling for a " stronger dialogue " to prevent the debate between warsaw and berlin from " veering in the wrong direction . "
restitution tug-of-war polish lawmakers last friday voted unanimously , with one abstention , for a resolution calling on germany to pay for war damages - drawing an embarrassed reaction from the government in warsaw and a firm rebuttal from berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder , left , alexander kwasniewski .
the move was seen as a tit-for-tat response to a series of claims by german civilians seeking compensation for property lost after poland 's borders shifted westwards in 1945 and they were expelled from the newly re-drawn state .
but jozef oleksy , the speaker of the polish parliament , said on wednesday that the resolution demanding compensation was in fact aimed at prodding the european union over regional aid for poland . oleksy said the demand " is aimed at the eu as a reminder -lrb- of poland 's losses -rrb- when it comes to hand out regional fund and aid money .
it could lead to particular goodwill -lrb- on the part of the eu -rrb- to help us regain lost ground . " six million poles , including most of the country 's pre-war population of 3.1 million jews , are believed to have been killed after nazi germany invaded poland on sept .

a further 2.5 million people were deported to labor camps in germany , while warsaw and many other cities were extensively damaged in a nazi campaign to eradicate polish culture .

they also demanded that the german government of social democrats and greens finally depart from what they described as an economic and social zigzag course . the industry associations in eastern germany say the current debate about equal living standards in the two halves of the reunited country wo n't serve as an excuse to do nothing about the current discrepancies . but in a statement issued in berlin , walter botschatzki , the president of the business associations in the eastern state of thuringia , said the east remains grateful for the billions of euros in western aid it has received and will continue to receive in the framework of a solidarity pact geared to making the east more competitive . he warned though that the current social and economic woes in the east are being misused by both left and right-wing forces to push their own agenda for next weekend 's regional elections in the states of brandenburg and saxony . achievements should be recognized " the enormous achievements that the whole country has recorded in the east ’ s economic recovery over the past 15 years are being belittled on purpose by some forces in our society , " botschatzki told dw-radio .
" let ’ s not forget that eastern germany now has an extremely modern transport and telecommunications infrastructure .
there are also very competitive clusters of industry in the east , like the semi-conductor centers in dresden or the automobile industry in leipzig . " botschatzki also spoke of the big strides which have been made in the metal-working and electronics industries in the east .
following a downturn in productivity in the period before 1997 , he said the past seven years had seen an enormous upswing in these sectors , creating more than 50,000 jobs across the east . he added that much more could be achieved with clear political signals from berlin .
easterners , he claimed , had proven in the past that they were willing to take their share of reforms , as long as those reforms made sense to them . people need faith in reforms " the current political zig-zag course , the lack of real reform prospects and the poor communication of reform efforts by the government have resulted in more and more people feeling insecure , " botschatzki said .
" confidence and faith in the government ’ s policies is decreasing , and that leads in the end to less stability in our democratic system . " botschatzki added that right after german unification in 1990 , easterners had hoped that living standards across the country would level out within 10 years or so .
they now had to accept that this was wishful thinking .
the same applied to their hopes for equal wages . klaus von dohnanyi , who was commissioned by the government to work out a more effective economic program for the east , says people have to face current realities . they 'll have to accept new low-wage employment opportunities rather than going on the dole . " we have new competition also from eastern europe and must see that these people in east germany are capable of making a living , " he said .
" and therefore we discuss the earned tax credit systems in the united states , for example , something we should add to the wages to remain competitive and at the same time have adequate living in the relatively high cost country germany . " von dohnanyi has explicitly supported president köhler 's recent statement that equal living conditions will not be achieved . he said the man had the courage to speak the truth rather than stooping to populist formulas which didn ’ t help anyone in the country .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 15.09.2004 fears of nationalism as pop pushes german pride großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin band mia promotes pride in germany but is it really nationalist ?
young germans have long labored under the weight of guilt from the nation 's past but have recently pushed for more pride in their country .
however , pro-german lyrics in pop songs are causing concern . germany 's gradual relaxation towards its national identity is causing concern among recording artists and musicians as an increasing number of songs appearing in the pop charts seem to contain lyrics which could be misconstrued as nationalist . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul van dyk for months , the single " we " has been riding high in the german charts .
a collaboration between techno dj paul van dyk -lrb- photo -rrb- and wolfsheim singer peter heppner , the song proudly recounts german post-war history with lyrics such as " i ask myself who we are .
we are we .
divided , defeated but , nevertheless , in the end , we 're still alive . " the song is accompanied by a video that contains images of women rebuilding bombed cities with their bare hands and amputee soldiers returning from the war . " we " portrays germans as victims in a land split between the allies and its people humiliated .
but there is no mention of the war , of the holocaust or the third reich .
instead the song celebrates the german success history : the reconstruction , the miracle of bern and the reunification . it is , essentially , a love song to germany . no more shame over nationality another example comes from the group mia in the song " it is what it is . "
front woman mieze sings about german pride and the creation of the national colors displayed in the post-war flag : " a gulp of the black coffee wakes me up , your red mouth touches me gently , at this moment , it clicks and the yellow sun rises , " referring to the colors in germany 's national flag : black , red and gold . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mieze and other mia members in a publicity shot mieze later sings about the rejection of past generations and the embracing of a new german identity : " if anyone asks me now where i come from , i no longer feel sorry for myself … i risk it all for love , i feel ready . " such words and images are making some people uncomfortable .
germans have struggled for years with the weight of guilt associated with the nation 's record in two world wars but younger generations have begun to reclaim german identity and move on from the crimes of the past to take pride in their country . target audience rich pickings for neo-nazis but some commentators see a danger in popular music becoming the voice of a new german pride , fearing it could be hijacked by far right organizations and used as nationalist propaganda in a market targeted at a young , impressionable record buying public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazi demonstrators anetta kahane of the amadeu antonio foundation , a group based in berlin which promotes democratic initiatives to resist right wing extremism , views the development in german pop music with concern . " far right organizations think this is great , " she said .
" they rightly perceive this as national pride suddenly becoming something normal . " far-right groups use music 's influence the reactions of the neo-nazis show that kahane is right .
the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- mouthpiece national voice wrote that mia stands up for a " relaxed attitude to its own nation . "
mia 's attitude has " scratched out " the left-wing supremacy in german youth , wrote the paper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rammstein flirtations with the far-right are not a new phenomenon .
groups such as rammstein -lrb- photo -rrb- and , more specifically , böhse onkelz which made no secret the fact that it was a part of the german skinhead scene in the 1980s and published songs with titles like " turks out " and " germany for the germans , " were championed by neo-nazis but have since renounced their right-wing leanings . mia on the other hand keeps pointing out that they do not want to be associated with rightwing extremists .
they add that they simply want to help jump-start a discussion about german identity . but musicians can not choose their fans : at a mia concert in the western german town of bielefeld , three rightwing extremists attacked a dark-skinned student , according to local news reports .
organizers of another festival at which mia was scheduled to appear asked the band 's management to comment on the incident .

they also demanded that the german government of social democrats and greens finally depart from what they described as an economic and social zigzag course . the industry associations in eastern germany say the current debate about equal living standards in the two halves of the reunited country wo n't serve as an excuse to do nothing about the current discrepancies . but in a statement issued in berlin , walter botschatzki , the president of the business associations in the eastern state of thuringia , said the east remains grateful for the billions of euros in western aid it has received and will continue to receive in the framework of a solidarity pact geared to making the east more competitive . he warned though that the current social and economic woes in the east are being misused by both left and right-wing forces to push their own agenda for next weekend 's regional elections in the states of brandenburg and saxony . achievements should be recognized " the enormous achievements that the whole country has recorded in the east ’ s economic recovery over the past 15 years are being belittled on purpose by some forces in our society , " botschatzki told dw-radio .
" let ’ s not forget that eastern germany now has an extremely modern transport and telecommunications infrastructure .
there are also very competitive clusters of industry in the east , like the semi-conductor centers in dresden or the automobile industry in leipzig . " botschatzki also spoke of the big strides which have been made in the metal-working and electronics industries in the east .
following a downturn in productivity in the period before 1997 , he said the past seven years had seen an enormous upswing in these sectors , creating more than 50,000 jobs across the east . he added that much more could be achieved with clear political signals from berlin .
easterners , he claimed , had proven in the past that they were willing to take their share of reforms , as long as those reforms made sense to them . people need faith in reforms " the current political zig-zag course , the lack of real reform prospects and the poor communication of reform efforts by the government have resulted in more and more people feeling insecure , " botschatzki said .
" confidence and faith in the government ’ s policies is decreasing , and that leads in the end to less stability in our democratic system . " botschatzki added that right after german unification in 1990 , easterners had hoped that living standards across the country would level out within 10 years or so .
they now had to accept that this was wishful thinking .
the same applied to their hopes for equal wages . klaus von dohnanyi , who was commissioned by the government to work out a more effective economic program for the east , says people have to face current realities . they 'll have to accept new low-wage employment opportunities rather than going on the dole . " we have new competition also from eastern europe and must see that these people in east germany are capable of making a living , " he said .
" and therefore we discuss the earned tax credit systems in the united states , for example , something we should add to the wages to remain competitive and at the same time have adequate living in the relatively high cost country germany . " von dohnanyi has explicitly supported president köhler 's recent statement that equal living conditions will not be achieved . he said the man had the courage to speak the truth rather than stooping to populist formulas which didn ’ t help anyone in the country .
president köhler continues to draw massive criticism from predominantly eastern policy-makers for saying that equal living standards are nothing but a myth . hardy graupner -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a land of differences while the core of german president horst köhler 's remarks on differences in living and employment standards focused on eastern and western states , figures published on tuesday show discrepencies across the whole country .

one of them is the müritz national park in mecklenburg-western pomerania . the landscape formed 10,000 years ago by the ice age belongs today to the most beautiful areas in the northeastern germany .
over 1000 sparkling blue and immaculate-clean lakes are surrounded by forests and open country side . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : picnic on lake müritz the biggest lakes in this area are next to the müritz lake plauer , lake fleesen and lake kölpen . müritz is a slavic word and means little sea .
lake müritz is 117 square kilometers -lrb- 45.2 square miles -rrb- big , 23 kilometers -lrb- 14.3 miles -rrb- wide and 29 kilometers long .
almost a jungle the müritz national park is half way between hamburg and berlin .
the 322 square kilometer big park consists mostly of forests and water .
when taking a journey through the park , one realizes quickly that the word natural stems indeed from the word nature - the green paradise resembles a jungle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müritz-steam ship the so-called developing zone comprises the biggest part of the national park .
this means that in that zone as little as possible is intervened with nature , giving nature the chance to mature in the course of time to an important completely untouched core zone .
however , much attention is devoted to eco tourism in order to make this unique nature heritage accessible to the general public . bird watching the national park is most notably famous for its white-tailed-eagles , ospreys and cranes .
the cranes -lrb- a species that has almost died out -rrb- are a living proof of the faultless nature .
observing the white-tailed-eagles in their nests is a truly unique experience . a camera , focused on the nest , makes it possible to follow every movement of the raptors and their babies on a television set in the national park information center .
such a close up view in the daily lives of the eagles would otherwise not be possible . mobile without boundaries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müritz national park the best way to discover the müritz national park is by bike .
however , walks , boat trips or horse rides offer great alternatives .
the priesterbäckersee is definitely worth a visit .
a long moor catwalk leads you to this beautiful lake which forms part of the many lakes in this area and from which the water lilies can be marvelled at best . because of the rising number of visitors the national park arranged for a so-called visitor-control device to keep its original beauty intact .
when entering the park , visitors are informed on how to use the park ’ s facilities .
national park tickets come in handy .
buses , ships and canoes provide an excellent transportation net .
moreover , bikers can take their bikes on the national park lanes for free . flora , fauna and geology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boathouses on lake müritz the city of waren , close to the national park , acts as a tourist center .
the natural history müritz museum there is worthwhile visiting .
during the exhibitions information on the flora , fauna and geology of the region are given and a cultural-historic link to mecklenburg-western pomerania is drawn . elke roessler -lrb- wo -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schorfheide-chorin : environmental protection and economic development the biosphere reserve schorfheide-chorin is located in the scarcely populated area of the former east germany known as the uckermark .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 15.09.2004 undoing germany 's colonial amnesia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of german troops crushed the herero uprising germany 's colonial past was almost entirely erased from the public 's memory .
now , a recent spate of books , films , and exhibitions is taking a critical look at this chapter - and making it a matter of debate . england , france and belgium are among the countries most often mentioned when historians consider europe 's colonial history and its related atrocities .
lesser known , however , is the fact that for 20 years , between 1884 and 1914 , germany lorded over its own swaths of the african continent , including areas of what are today namibia , cameroon , togo , rwanda and burundi . in fact , the infamous congo conference , where european colonial interests divided-up africa and its natural resources , took place in berlin in 1884 .
and though germany only managed to hold onto its share for two decades , it certainly wracked up a record of carnage on par with that of better-known colonial powers . despite these uncomfortable facts , this historical chapter has been all but forgotten by the german public .
now , a spate of new books , films , exhibitions and conferences - all coinciding with the 100th anniversary of two of germany 's most bloody african episodes - are making it a matter of public debate .
for a country already fatigued by efforts to come to terms with the atrocities of world war ii , that 's quite an accomplishment . a short and violent occupation the brief 20 years germany controlled parts of west and east africa were not peaceful .
in 1904 in the german territory of south west africa , today namibia , german troops led by general lothar von trotha mercilessly put down a rebellion of the indigenous herero people . by the time the conflict ended four years later , between 45,000 to 65,000 herero were killed , many of whom suffered in work camps some consider the forerunners to wwii-era concentration camps . a year later , in the german held south east africa , today tanzania , the so-called maji-maji war broke out .
there , the local population also rebelled against german rule and likewise suffered the consequences : an estimated 250,000 to 300,000 - one third of the total population - were killed . slow to offer an apology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on the anniversary of the massacre , a group of herero march to honor the dead .
with this year 's 100th anniversary of the atrocities in namibia and the upcoming 100th anniversary of the war in tanzania , the german government has been under added pressure to offer an official apology , which , much to the dismay of herero leaders , has been slow in coming . but in august at the anniversary event in namibia honoring the herero dead , german development and aid minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul came the closest yet any german official has ever gotten to those magic words . " we germans accept our historic and moral responsibility and the guilt incurred by germans , " she told a delighted crowd of more than 1,000 people . " the atrocities committed at that time would have been termed genocide , " she added . however , she ruled out financial compensation for the victims ' descendents ; there is an ongoing lawsuit seeking € 3.3 billion -lrb- $ 4 billion -rrb- in damages . books , exhibitions remind a reluctant public with that historic statement , the german government showed its willingness to take on board yet another difficult chapter in the country 's history .
the general public - with the help of several recent books , films and exhibitions , all addressing the subject - is following suit . gerhard seyfried 's book " herero , " a novel written from the point of view of a young german sent to the western region of africa at the height of the conflict , came out last year and was followed this year by martin baer 's film " white ghosts , " a documentary also looking at the plight of the herero . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the house of world cultures is looking at the legacy of colonialism .
on thursday , the house of world cultures -lrb- haus der kulturen der welt -rrb- in berlin will launch a major multi-disciplinary exhibition entitled " black atlantic " , that - among other things , will look at the legacy of colonial occupation , including that undertaken by germany .
capping things off , an anti-colonialism conference is scheduled to take place in berlin in november . the issue of germany 's colonial legacy has gone beyond the halls of academia , where a few experts debated its significance in relative obscurity , and into the realm of popular culture .
in the process , some say germany is shedding its colonial amnesia . what took so long ? in critically examining its colonial past , germany is following a trend already evident in other former colonial powers .
the question is , what took germany so long ? " when it comes to questions of guilt and responsibility , the germans are simply tired , " gerhard seyfried , author of the novel " herero " , told dw-world , referring to the arduous task of working through the legacy of nazi atrocities . colonial history greatly interested germans before the war , but was simply eclipsed by subsequent events , seyfried said . pascal grosse , a historian who has written extensively on the subject and will participate in a panel discussion on the topic in conjunction with the " black atlantic " exhibition in berlin , concurred .

now , a recent spate of books , films , and exhibitions is taking a critical look at this chapter - and making it a matter of debate . england , france and belgium are among the countries most often mentioned when historians consider europe 's colonial history and its related atrocities .
lesser known , however , is the fact that for 20 years , between 1884 and 1914 , germany lorded over its own swaths of the african continent , including areas of what are today namibia , cameroon , togo , rwanda and burundi . in fact , the infamous congo conference , where european colonial interests divided-up africa and its natural resources , took place in berlin in 1884 .
and though germany only managed to hold onto its share for two decades , it certainly wracked up a record of carnage on par with that of better-known colonial powers . despite these uncomfortable facts , this historical chapter has been all but forgotten by the german public .
now , a spate of new books , films , exhibitions and conferences - all coinciding with the 100th anniversary of two of germany 's most bloody african episodes - are making it a matter of public debate .
for a country already fatigued by efforts to come to terms with the atrocities of world war ii , that 's quite an accomplishment . a short and violent occupation the brief 20 years germany controlled parts of west and east africa were not peaceful .
in 1904 in the german territory of south west africa , today namibia , german troops led by general lothar von trotha mercilessly put down a rebellion of the indigenous herero people . by the time the conflict ended four years later , between 45,000 to 65,000 herero were killed , many of whom suffered in work camps some consider the forerunners to wwii-era concentration camps . a year later , in the german held south east africa , today tanzania , the so-called maji-maji war broke out .
there , the local population also rebelled against german rule and likewise suffered the consequences : an estimated 250,000 to 300,000 - one third of the total population - were killed . slow to offer an apology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on the anniversary of the massacre , a group of herero march to honor the dead .
with this year 's 100th anniversary of the atrocities in namibia and the upcoming 100th anniversary of the war in tanzania , the german government has been under added pressure to offer an official apology , which , much to the dismay of herero leaders , has been slow in coming . but in august at the anniversary event in namibia honoring the herero dead , german development and aid minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul came the closest yet any german official has ever gotten to those magic words . " we germans accept our historic and moral responsibility and the guilt incurred by germans , " she told a delighted crowd of more than 1,000 people . " the atrocities committed at that time would have been termed genocide , " she added . however , she ruled out financial compensation for the victims ' descendents ; there is an ongoing lawsuit seeking € 3.3 billion -lrb- $ 4 billion -rrb- in damages . books , exhibitions remind a reluctant public with that historic statement , the german government showed its willingness to take on board yet another difficult chapter in the country 's history .
the general public - with the help of several recent books , films and exhibitions , all addressing the subject - is following suit . gerhard seyfried 's book " herero , " a novel written from the point of view of a young german sent to the western region of africa at the height of the conflict , came out last year and was followed this year by martin baer 's film " white ghosts , " a documentary also looking at the plight of the herero . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the house of world cultures is looking at the legacy of colonialism .
on thursday , the house of world cultures -lrb- haus der kulturen der welt -rrb- in berlin will launch a major multi-disciplinary exhibition entitled " black atlantic " , that - among other things , will look at the legacy of colonial occupation , including that undertaken by germany .
capping things off , an anti-colonialism conference is scheduled to take place in berlin in november . the issue of germany 's colonial legacy has gone beyond the halls of academia , where a few experts debated its significance in relative obscurity , and into the realm of popular culture .
in the process , some say germany is shedding its colonial amnesia . what took so long ? in critically examining its colonial past , germany is following a trend already evident in other former colonial powers .
the question is , what took germany so long ? " when it comes to questions of guilt and responsibility , the germans are simply tired , " gerhard seyfried , author of the novel " herero " , told dw-world , referring to the arduous task of working through the legacy of nazi atrocities . colonial history greatly interested germans before the war , but was simply eclipsed by subsequent events , seyfried said . pascal grosse , a historian who has written extensively on the subject and will participate in a panel discussion on the topic in conjunction with the " black atlantic " exhibition in berlin , concurred .

" if the company is looking for a conflict , we are ready to back up our claims with protest action and warning strikes , " chief ig metall negotiator harmut meine told die welt newspaper ahead of the talks . " shareholders get a dividend and the workers have to tighten their belts with a wage freeze , " he said .
" it 's not fair . " ig metall , germany 's most powerful industrial union , blamed volkswagen for creating a climate of conflict ahead of the negotiations , whose first rounds start later wednesday , and asked vw to be prudent with its public comments . " we have not even started to negotiate and here comes a financial wizard from the management board who heats up the climate of negotiations with unnecessary chatter , " he said in reference to comments by chief financial officer hans-dieter pötsch . pötsch last week said about 30,000 jobs are at risk if wage negotiations end without cutting costs . " that is irresponsible , " meine said . the wage negotiations at vw often set the standard for the rest of the industry , and the country 's biggest industrial union and employers typically take distant but firm positions as the talks get under way . ig metall , which is negotiating on behalf of 103,000 manufacturing employees , is asking for job guarantees and a 4 percent pay rise from oct .

" we will not agree to a wage freeze , " meine said , adding that he could not say how long the talks would drag on . " but i expect difficult negotiations and a heated conflict , " he said . analysts polled by the afx financial news service on the eve of the talks said the positions of the two sides are so far apart that they may well be on a collision course that could lead to production disruptions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it will definitely be a very difficult negotiation , " said economist eckhard tuchtfeld at commerzbank .
he added it would be very difficult for ig metall to agree to a wage freeze because they were already insisting on a four percent increase . " if it had said it wanted two percent or so , then it would be easier to back down from the original demand .
but from four percent to zero , they would really look funny , " tuchtfeld said . other analysts said the investor community has already factored into this year 's estimates for vw the possibility of output cuts as a result of strikes which ig metall might call to back its wage demands . abu dhabi deal fails in more bad news for volkswagen on wednesday , the company said that talks to sell a 9.8 percent stake in vw to an investment group from abu dhabi had been called off due to disagreement over the price .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 15.09.2004 undoing germany 's colonial amnesia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of german troops crushed the herero uprising germany 's colonial past was almost entirely erased from the public 's memory .
now , a recent spate of books , films , and exhibitions is taking a critical look at this chapter - and making it a matter of debate . england , france and belgium are among the countries most often mentioned when historians consider europe 's colonial history and its related atrocities .
lesser known , however , is the fact that for 20 years , between 1884 and 1914 , germany lorded over its own swaths of the african continent , including areas of what are today namibia , cameroon , togo , rwanda and burundi . in fact , the infamous congo conference , where european colonial interests divided-up africa and its natural resources , took place in berlin in 1884 .
and though germany only managed to hold onto its share for two decades , it certainly wracked up a record of carnage on par with that of better-known colonial powers . despite these uncomfortable facts , this historical chapter has been all but forgotten by the german public .
now , a spate of new books , films , exhibitions and conferences - all coinciding with the 100th anniversary of two of germany 's most bloody african episodes - are making it a matter of public debate .
for a country already fatigued by efforts to come to terms with the atrocities of world war ii , that 's quite an accomplishment . a short and violent occupation the brief 20 years germany controlled parts of west and east africa were not peaceful .
in 1904 in the german territory of south west africa , today namibia , german troops led by general lothar von trotha mercilessly put down a rebellion of the indigenous herero people . by the time the conflict ended four years later , between 45,000 to 65,000 herero were killed , many of whom suffered in work camps some consider the forerunners to wwii-era concentration camps . a year later , in the german held south east africa , today tanzania , the so-called maji-maji war broke out .
there , the local population also rebelled against german rule and likewise suffered the consequences : an estimated 250,000 to 300,000 - one third of the total population - were killed . slow to offer an apology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on the anniversary of the massacre , a group of herero march to honor the dead .
with this year 's 100th anniversary of the atrocities in namibia and the upcoming 100th anniversary of the war in tanzania , the german government has been under added pressure to offer an official apology , which , much to the dismay of herero leaders , has been slow in coming . but in august at the anniversary event in namibia honoring the herero dead , german development and aid minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul came the closest yet any german official has ever gotten to those magic words . " we germans accept our historic and moral responsibility and the guilt incurred by germans , " she told a delighted crowd of more than 1,000 people . " the atrocities committed at that time would have been termed genocide , " she added . however , she ruled out financial compensation for the victims ' descendents ; there is an ongoing lawsuit seeking € 3.3 billion -lrb- $ 4 billion -rrb- in damages . books , exhibitions remind a reluctant public with that historic statement , the german government showed its willingness to take on board yet another difficult chapter in the country 's history .
the general public - with the help of several recent books , films and exhibitions , all addressing the subject - is following suit . gerhard seyfried 's book " herero , " a novel written from the point of view of a young german sent to the western region of africa at the height of the conflict , came out last year and was followed this year by martin baer 's film " white ghosts , " a documentary also looking at the plight of the herero . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the house of world cultures is looking at the legacy of colonialism .
on thursday , the house of world cultures -lrb- haus der kulturen der welt -rrb- in berlin will launch a major multi-disciplinary exhibition entitled " black atlantic " , that - among other things , will look at the legacy of colonial occupation , including that undertaken by germany .
capping things off , an anti-colonialism conference is scheduled to take place in berlin in november . the issue of germany 's colonial legacy has gone beyond the halls of academia , where a few experts debated its significance in relative obscurity , and into the realm of popular culture .
in the process , some say germany is shedding its colonial amnesia . what took so long ? in critically examining its colonial past , germany is following a trend already evident in other former colonial powers .
the question is , what took germany so long ? " when it comes to questions of guilt and responsibility , the germans are simply tired , " gerhard seyfried , author of the novel " herero " , told dw-world , referring to the arduous task of working through the legacy of nazi atrocities . colonial history greatly interested germans before the war , but was simply eclipsed by subsequent events , seyfried said . pascal grosse , a historian who has written extensively on the subject and will participate in a panel discussion on the topic in conjunction with the " black atlantic " exhibition in berlin , concurred . " the scale of the holocaust overshadowed previous events , " he told dw-world . but with an ever-more interconnected world resulting from globalization , germans , like others in different countries , are increasingly interested in their role in the world - both past and present , grosse said . a century later , some debate relevance but that said , what purpose does dredging up events so far in the past serve ? " we need to look at this material again and again , it 's never enough to say we 've done that , let 's move on , " shaheen merali , a curator who put together the visual arts component of the " black atlantic " exhibition told dw-world . for seyfried , such critical self reflection of colonial atrocities serves the same purpose similar reflection on world war ii-era crimes does . " we must learn from history , " he said . kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany urges herero to drop lawsuit germany 's ambassador to namibia has called on the herero people to drop a $ 4 billion -lrb- € 3.3 billion -rrb- lawsuit filed three years ago in us courts for atrocities committed under colonial rule .

young germans have long labored under the weight of guilt from the nation 's past but have recently pushed for more pride in their country .
however , pro-german lyrics in pop songs are causing concern . germany 's gradual relaxation towards its national identity is causing concern among recording artists and musicians as an increasing number of songs appearing in the pop charts seem to contain lyrics which could be misconstrued as nationalist . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul van dyk for months , the single " we " has been riding high in the german charts .
a collaboration between techno dj paul van dyk -lrb- photo -rrb- and wolfsheim singer peter heppner , the song proudly recounts german post-war history with lyrics such as " i ask myself who we are .
we are we .
divided , defeated but , nevertheless , in the end , we 're still alive . " the song is accompanied by a video that contains images of women rebuilding bombed cities with their bare hands and amputee soldiers returning from the war . " we " portrays germans as victims in a land split between the allies and its people humiliated .
but there is no mention of the war , of the holocaust or the third reich .
instead the song celebrates the german success history : the reconstruction , the miracle of bern and the reunification . it is , essentially , a love song to germany . no more shame over nationality another example comes from the group mia in the song " it is what it is . "
front woman mieze sings about german pride and the creation of the national colors displayed in the post-war flag : " a gulp of the black coffee wakes me up , your red mouth touches me gently , at this moment , it clicks and the yellow sun rises , " referring to the colors in germany 's national flag : black , red and gold . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mieze and other mia members in a publicity shot mieze later sings about the rejection of past generations and the embracing of a new german identity : " if anyone asks me now where i come from , i no longer feel sorry for myself … i risk it all for love , i feel ready . " such words and images are making some people uncomfortable .

he 's accompanied by a delegation of business and science leaders pushing for deeper economic and political ties . schröder is visiting hungary on the occasion of the 15th anniversary of the date hungary opened its borders to east germans and allowed them to leave to the west - a development that created an extremely positive new dimension in west germany 's ties with the then-eastern bloc nation .
earlier this year , former german president johannes rau spoke of the importance of that development during a visit to budapest .
" we owe an awful lot to hungary ...
if hungary had n't shut off its electrical fence on may 2 , 1989 , which allowed many from the ddr to come to west germany , the developments in prague on sept .
20 would n't have happened and the -lrb- berlin -rrb- wall would n't have fallen on nov .
9 , " rau said .
" in some respects , the hungarians were the intiators of german unity . "
for a long time , the magyars would have been thankful for a few handouts from germany .
but the burdens of german unity and the costs of rebuilding the east german infrastructure left little room for german financial aid to the hungarians .
a visit with new prime minister designate still , relations between the two countries have developed positively .
there are no major sticking points between the countries , and schröder can look forward to a relaxing trip aimed at deepening the countries ' political , economic and scientific cooperation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- right -rrb- , and outgoing hungarian prime minister peter medgyessy schröder will be meeting with outgoing hungarian prime minister peter medgyessy , who announced his resignation in august following a government coalition crisis , as well as his nominated successor , ferenc gyurcsany .
the 43-year-old shooting star of the socialists is expected to be confirmed as prime minister by parliament at the end of the month .
like the political developments between germany and hungary , business ties are also both strong and dynamic .
currently , germany is hungary 's most-important trading partner - a position that could further grow with hungary 's european union membership , which came into effect on may 1 .
germany is also an important foreign investor in hungary .
since 1989 , german companies have invested over € 12 billion -lrb- $ 14.6 billion -rrb- in hungary , representing 55 percent of all foreign investment and creating more than 200,000 jobs .
hungary has an abundance of red tape nevertheless , german companies do n't shy away from the fact that hungary has become less attractive for business .
the country has continually failed in efforts to trim red tape , and there is also a lack of educated workers .
additionally , salaries have risen by 50 percent since 2002 and the exchange of hungary 's currency , the forint , has been a roller coaster ride since june 2003 .
worse yet , contradictory statements about the country 's currency exchange rates and inflation goals and a lax fiscal policy have engendered considerable uncertainty .
but these facts have not been lost on gyurcsany , who has said making hungary more attractive to foreign investors will be a priority .
" in my opinion , it 's important that the country 's economic policy reflect stability and calm so that hungary can continue to be a goal for foreign investors , " he said .
despite some tougher times in recent months , most of the 54 german companies active there are satisfied with hungary as a place for doing business .
indeed , many are planning additional investments - a good basis for deepening economic ties between the two countries .
and on his visit on wednesday , schröder will make that his priority . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hungary mulls future of nuclear energy hungary has been a proponent of nuclear energy for decades .

" in some respects , the hungarians were the intiators of german unity . "
for a long time , the magyars would have been thankful for a few handouts from germany .
but the burdens of german unity and the costs of rebuilding the east german infrastructure left little room for german financial aid to the hungarians .
a visit with new prime minister designate still , relations between the two countries have developed positively .
there are no major sticking points between the countries , and schröder can look forward to a relaxing trip aimed at deepening the countries ' political , economic and scientific cooperation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- right -rrb- , and outgoing hungarian prime minister peter medgyessy schröder will be meeting with outgoing hungarian prime minister peter medgyessy , who announced his resignation in august following a government coalition crisis , as well as his nominated successor , ferenc gyurcsany .
the 43-year-old shooting star of the socialists is expected to be confirmed as prime minister by parliament at the end of the month .
like the political developments between germany and hungary , business ties are also both strong and dynamic .
currently , germany is hungary 's most-important trading partner - a position that could further grow with hungary 's european union membership , which came into effect on may 1 .
germany is also an important foreign investor in hungary .
since 1989 , german companies have invested over € 12 billion -lrb- $ 14.6 billion -rrb- in hungary , representing 55 percent of all foreign investment and creating more than 200,000 jobs .
hungary has an abundance of red tape nevertheless , german companies do n't shy away from the fact that hungary has become less attractive for business .
the country has continually failed in efforts to trim red tape , and there is also a lack of educated workers .
additionally , salaries have risen by 50 percent since 2002 and the exchange of hungary 's currency , the forint , has been a roller coaster ride since june 2003 .
worse yet , contradictory statements about the country 's currency exchange rates and inflation goals and a lax fiscal policy have engendered considerable uncertainty .
but these facts have not been lost on gyurcsany , who has said making hungary more attractive to foreign investors will be a priority .
" in my opinion , it 's important that the country 's economic policy reflect stability and calm so that hungary can continue to be a goal for foreign investors , " he said .
despite some tougher times in recent months , most of the 54 german companies active there are satisfied with hungary as a place for doing business .
indeed , many are planning additional investments - a good basis for deepening economic ties between the two countries .
and on his visit on wednesday , schröder will make that his priority . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hungary mulls future of nuclear energy hungary has been a proponent of nuclear energy for decades .

" an inter-ministerial group will be charged with evaluating the losses suffered by poland as a result of world war ii , " the polish foreign minister said tuesday following a government meeting to examine a controversial parliament resolution last week that called for war reparations from germany .
cimoszewicz said the exercise was purely intended to provide a " reminder of the causes and effects of war , " and reiterated the government 's refusal to seek reparations from berlin .
" our intention is not linked to any demand for compensation , " he said .
" it is a case of illustrating and reminding those who may have forgotten about world war ii and its consequences . "
" it is perhaps such forgetfulness that has led to demands for compensation from us , " he added , in reference to a series of recent claims for restitution of property seized from germans forced to flee poland after 1945 .
cimoszewicz added that the government would " work out provisions to support its citizens if they were brought before the courts over a claim for compensation . "
" the question of compensation on either side is closed , " he said , while calling for a " stronger dialogue " to prevent the debate between warsaw and berlin from " veering in the wrong direction . "
restitution tug-of-war polish lawmakers last friday voted unanimously , with one abstention , for a resolution calling on germany to pay for war damages - drawing an embarrassed reaction from the government in warsaw and a firm rebuttal from berlin .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.09.2004 eastern german industry calls for more optimism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern german success stories include dresden 's " silicon valley " industry leaders in eastern germany have called for full economic parity across the country to remain on track as concerns over east-west discrepencies continue . following controversial remarks by german president horst köhler that the country ’ s east will probably never reach western living standards , industry associations from the new federal states on tuesday issued an appeal which called on germans not to let full economic unity slip out of sight .
they also demanded that the german government of social democrats and greens finally depart from what they described as an economic and social zigzag course . the industry associations in eastern germany say the current debate about equal living standards in the two halves of the reunited country wo n't serve as an excuse to do nothing about the current discrepancies . but in a statement issued in berlin , walter botschatzki , the president of the business associations in the eastern state of thuringia , said the east remains grateful for the billions of euros in western aid it has received and will continue to receive in the framework of a solidarity pact geared to making the east more competitive . he warned though that the current social and economic woes in the east are being misused by both left and right-wing forces to push their own agenda for next weekend 's regional elections in the states of brandenburg and saxony . achievements should be recognized " the enormous achievements that the whole country has recorded in the east ’ s economic recovery over the past 15 years are being belittled on purpose by some forces in our society , " botschatzki told dw-radio .
" let ’ s not forget that eastern germany now has an extremely modern transport and telecommunications infrastructure .
there are also very competitive clusters of industry in the east , like the semi-conductor centers in dresden or the automobile industry in leipzig . " botschatzki also spoke of the big strides which have been made in the metal-working and electronics industries in the east .
following a downturn in productivity in the period before 1997 , he said the past seven years had seen an enormous upswing in these sectors , creating more than 50,000 jobs across the east . he added that much more could be achieved with clear political signals from berlin .
easterners , he claimed , had proven in the past that they were willing to take their share of reforms , as long as those reforms made sense to them . people need faith in reforms " the current political zig-zag course , the lack of real reform prospects and the poor communication of reform efforts by the government have resulted in more and more people feeling insecure , " botschatzki said .
" confidence and faith in the government ’ s policies is decreasing , and that leads in the end to less stability in our democratic system . " botschatzki added that right after german unification in 1990 , easterners had hoped that living standards across the country would level out within 10 years or so .
they now had to accept that this was wishful thinking .
the same applied to their hopes for equal wages . klaus von dohnanyi , who was commissioned by the government to work out a more effective economic program for the east , says people have to face current realities . they 'll have to accept new low-wage employment opportunities rather than going on the dole . " we have new competition also from eastern europe and must see that these people in east germany are capable of making a living , " he said .
" and therefore we discuss the earned tax credit systems in the united states , for example , something we should add to the wages to remain competitive and at the same time have adequate living in the relatively high cost country germany . " von dohnanyi has explicitly supported president köhler 's recent statement that equal living conditions will not be achieved . he said the man had the courage to speak the truth rather than stooping to populist formulas which didn ’ t help anyone in the country .
president köhler continues to draw massive criticism from predominantly eastern policy-makers for saying that equal living standards are nothing but a myth . hardy graupner -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a land of differences while the core of german president horst köhler 's remarks on differences in living and employment standards focused on eastern and western states , figures published on tuesday show discrepencies across the whole country .

after getting bad grades from the oecd , german politicians are calling for extensive reforms of the nation 's schools .
it 's not enough to spend more money , the education system needs to be completely re-worked , they said . a day after germany brought home failing grades from the organization for economic cooperation and development for its education system , the nation 's politicians responded like worried parents .
it was the second time in two years that the country , which prides itself on producing some of the world 's leading philosophers and scientists , had received negative marks for government spending , number of hours spent in the classroom and pupil-teacher ratios .
on wednesday , education experts in the government coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens minced no words in calling on germany to prepare itself better for the future .
in addition to increasing much-needed government investment in the education system -lrb- only about 9.7 percent of total spending goes towards schools -rrb- , the politicians called for far-reaching reforms of the nation 's traditional school structure .

krista sager , parliamentary fraction leader for the greens , told the berliner zeitung germany needed to move away from its three-tiered school model and introduce " a school for all , " where pupils would stay together in one system for nine or ten years .
the current division into three different schools , each tailored to specific education abilities and skills , is " more befitting of a medieval feudal system than a modern society , " criticized christoph matschie , head of the spd for the eastern state of thuringia .
a general school for all pupils is better equipped for promoting common education standards than a system that " sorts " children at an early age according to their abilities , explained the former state secretary for the education ministry .
matschie told the paper that the traditional division into college-prep highschool , secondary school and vocational school , was partially to blame for the poor results in the oecd study .
pupils performed better when they learned together , he and sager argued .
schleswig-holstein 's state minister for culture and education was also convinced that the three-tiered education system is no longer beneficial to the country .
ute erdsiek-rave said her party of social democrats would campaign together with the greens during the next state election for a reform that supports a " school for all . "

t with a view to government plans to expand the number of all-day schools , merkel said germany was on the right road to increasing the amount of time children spend in the classroom .
the oecd study showed that german pupils aged seven and eight attend school on average for 626 hours a year , compared with 788 on average in the oecd .
germany needs to invest more in building all-day schools , she said and called for a speedy introduction of tax reforms that would open up more funds for education .

krista sager , parliamentary fraction leader for the greens , told the berliner zeitung germany needed to move away from its three-tiered school model and introduce " a school for all , " where pupils would stay together in one system for nine or ten years .
the current division into three different schools , each tailored to specific education abilities and skills , is " more befitting of a medieval feudal system than a modern society , " criticized christoph matschie , head of the spd for the eastern state of thuringia .
a general school for all pupils is better equipped for promoting common education standards than a system that " sorts " children at an early age according to their abilities , explained the former state secretary for the education ministry .
matschie told the paper that the traditional division into college-prep highschool , secondary school and vocational school , was partially to blame for the poor results in the oecd study .

germany 's problems were largely the result of large classrooms and too little instruction time , she said , both of which could be rectified with more investment .

the oecd study showed that german pupils aged seven and eight attend school on average for 626 hours a year , compared with 788 on average in the oecd .
germany needs to invest more in building all-day schools , she said and called for a speedy introduction of tax reforms that would open up more funds for education .

" an inter-ministerial group will be charged with evaluating the losses suffered by poland as a result of world war ii , " the polish foreign minister said tuesday following a government meeting to examine a controversial parliament resolution last week that called for war reparations from germany .
cimoszewicz said the exercise was purely intended to provide a " reminder of the causes and effects of war , " and reiterated the government 's refusal to seek reparations from berlin .
" our intention is not linked to any demand for compensation , " he said .
" it is a case of illustrating and reminding those who may have forgotten about world war ii and its consequences . "
" it is perhaps such forgetfulness that has led to demands for compensation from us , " he added , in reference to a series of recent claims for restitution of property seized from germans forced to flee poland after 1945 .
cimoszewicz added that the government would " work out provisions to support its citizens if they were brought before the courts over a claim for compensation . "
" the question of compensation on either side is closed , " he said , while calling for a " stronger dialogue " to prevent the debate between warsaw and berlin from " veering in the wrong direction . "
restitution tug-of-war polish lawmakers last friday voted unanimously , with one abstention , for a resolution calling on germany to pay for war damages - drawing an embarrassed reaction from the government in warsaw and a firm rebuttal from berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder , left , alexander kwasniewski .
the move was seen as a tit-for-tat response to a series of claims by german civilians seeking compensation for property lost after poland 's borders shifted westwards in 1945 and they were expelled from the newly re-drawn state .
but jozef oleksy , the speaker of the polish parliament , said on wednesday that the resolution demanding compensation was in fact aimed at prodding the european union over regional aid for poland . oleksy said the demand " is aimed at the eu as a reminder -lrb- of poland 's losses -rrb- when it comes to hand out regional fund and aid money .
it could lead to particular goodwill -lrb- on the part of the eu -rrb- to help us regain lost ground . " six million poles , including most of the country 's pre-war population of 3.1 million jews , are believed to have been killed after nazi germany invaded poland on sept .

a further 2.5 million people were deported to labor camps in germany , while warsaw and many other cities were extensively damaged in a nazi campaign to eradicate polish culture .

one of them is the müritz national park in mecklenburg-western pomerania . the landscape formed 10,000 years ago by the ice age belongs today to the most beautiful areas in the northeastern germany .
over 1000 sparkling blue and immaculate-clean lakes are surrounded by forests and open country side . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : picnic on lake müritz the biggest lakes in this area are next to the müritz lake plauer , lake fleesen and lake kölpen . müritz is a slavic word and means little sea .
lake müritz is 117 square kilometers -lrb- 45.2 square miles -rrb- big , 23 kilometers -lrb- 14.3 miles -rrb- wide and 29 kilometers long .
almost a jungle the müritz national park is half way between hamburg and berlin .
the 322 square kilometer big park consists mostly of forests and water .
when taking a journey through the park , one realizes quickly that the word natural stems indeed from the word nature - the green paradise resembles a jungle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müritz-steam ship the so-called developing zone comprises the biggest part of the national park .
this means that in that zone as little as possible is intervened with nature , giving nature the chance to mature in the course of time to an important completely untouched core zone .
however , much attention is devoted to eco tourism in order to make this unique nature heritage accessible to the general public . bird watching the national park is most notably famous for its white-tailed-eagles , ospreys and cranes .
the cranes -lrb- a species that has almost died out -rrb- are a living proof of the faultless nature .
observing the white-tailed-eagles in their nests is a truly unique experience . a camera , focused on the nest , makes it possible to follow every movement of the raptors and their babies on a television set in the national park information center .
such a close up view in the daily lives of the eagles would otherwise not be possible . mobile without boundaries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müritz national park the best way to discover the müritz national park is by bike .
however , walks , boat trips or horse rides offer great alternatives .
the priesterbäckersee is definitely worth a visit .
a long moor catwalk leads you to this beautiful lake which forms part of the many lakes in this area and from which the water lilies can be marvelled at best . because of the rising number of visitors the national park arranged for a so-called visitor-control device to keep its original beauty intact .
when entering the park , visitors are informed on how to use the park ’ s facilities .
national park tickets come in handy .
buses , ships and canoes provide an excellent transportation net .
moreover , bikers can take their bikes on the national park lanes for free . flora , fauna and geology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boathouses on lake müritz the city of waren , close to the national park , acts as a tourist center .

lesser known , however , is the fact that for 20 years , between 1884 and 1914 , germany lorded over its own swaths of the african continent , including areas of what are today namibia , cameroon , togo , rwanda and burundi . in fact , the infamous congo conference , where european colonial interests divided-up africa and its natural resources , took place in berlin in 1884 .
and though germany only managed to hold onto its share for two decades , it certainly wracked up a record of carnage on par with that of better-known colonial powers . despite these uncomfortable facts , this historical chapter has been all but forgotten by the german public .
now , a spate of new books , films , exhibitions and conferences - all coinciding with the 100th anniversary of two of germany 's most bloody african episodes - are making it a matter of public debate .
for a country already fatigued by efforts to come to terms with the atrocities of world war ii , that 's quite an accomplishment . a short and violent occupation the brief 20 years germany controlled parts of west and east africa were not peaceful .
in 1904 in the german territory of south west africa , today namibia , german troops led by general lothar von trotha mercilessly put down a rebellion of the indigenous herero people . by the time the conflict ended four years later , between 45,000 to 65,000 herero were killed , many of whom suffered in work camps some consider the forerunners to wwii-era concentration camps . a year later , in the german held south east africa , today tanzania , the so-called maji-maji war broke out .
there , the local population also rebelled against german rule and likewise suffered the consequences : an estimated 250,000 to 300,000 - one third of the total population - were killed . slow to offer an apology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on the anniversary of the massacre , a group of herero march to honor the dead .
with this year 's 100th anniversary of the atrocities in namibia and the upcoming 100th anniversary of the war in tanzania , the german government has been under added pressure to offer an official apology , which , much to the dismay of herero leaders , has been slow in coming . but in august at the anniversary event in namibia honoring the herero dead , german development and aid minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul came the closest yet any german official has ever gotten to those magic words . " we germans accept our historic and moral responsibility and the guilt incurred by germans , " she told a delighted crowd of more than 1,000 people . " the atrocities committed at that time would have been termed genocide , " she added . however , she ruled out financial compensation for the victims ' descendents ; there is an ongoing lawsuit seeking € 3.3 billion -lrb- $ 4 billion -rrb- in damages . books , exhibitions remind a reluctant public with that historic statement , the german government showed its willingness to take on board yet another difficult chapter in the country 's history .

the question is , what took germany so long ?

now , a recent spate of books , films , and exhibitions is taking a critical look at this chapter - and making it a matter of debate . england , france and belgium are among the countries most often mentioned when historians consider europe 's colonial history and its related atrocities .
lesser known , however , is the fact that for 20 years , between 1884 and 1914 , germany lorded over its own swaths of the african continent , including areas of what are today namibia , cameroon , togo , rwanda and burundi . in fact , the infamous congo conference , where european colonial interests divided-up africa and its natural resources , took place in berlin in 1884 .
and though germany only managed to hold onto its share for two decades , it certainly wracked up a record of carnage on par with that of better-known colonial powers . despite these uncomfortable facts , this historical chapter has been all but forgotten by the german public .
now , a spate of new books , films , exhibitions and conferences - all coinciding with the 100th anniversary of two of germany 's most bloody african episodes - are making it a matter of public debate .
for a country already fatigued by efforts to come to terms with the atrocities of world war ii , that 's quite an accomplishment . a short and violent occupation the brief 20 years germany controlled parts of west and east africa were not peaceful .
in 1904 in the german territory of south west africa , today namibia , german troops led by general lothar von trotha mercilessly put down a rebellion of the indigenous herero people . by the time the conflict ended four years later , between 45,000 to 65,000 herero were killed , many of whom suffered in work camps some consider the forerunners to wwii-era concentration camps . a year later , in the german held south east africa , today tanzania , the so-called maji-maji war broke out .
there , the local population also rebelled against german rule and likewise suffered the consequences : an estimated 250,000 to 300,000 - one third of the total population - were killed . slow to offer an apology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on the anniversary of the massacre , a group of herero march to honor the dead .
with this year 's 100th anniversary of the atrocities in namibia and the upcoming 100th anniversary of the war in tanzania , the german government has been under added pressure to offer an official apology , which , much to the dismay of herero leaders , has been slow in coming . but in august at the anniversary event in namibia honoring the herero dead , german development and aid minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul came the closest yet any german official has ever gotten to those magic words . " we germans accept our historic and moral responsibility and the guilt incurred by germans , " she told a delighted crowd of more than 1,000 people . " the atrocities committed at that time would have been termed genocide , " she added . however , she ruled out financial compensation for the victims ' descendents ; there is an ongoing lawsuit seeking € 3.3 billion -lrb- $ 4 billion -rrb- in damages . books , exhibitions remind a reluctant public with that historic statement , the german government showed its willingness to take on board yet another difficult chapter in the country 's history .
the general public - with the help of several recent books , films and exhibitions , all addressing the subject - is following suit . gerhard seyfried 's book " herero , " a novel written from the point of view of a young german sent to the western region of africa at the height of the conflict , came out last year and was followed this year by martin baer 's film " white ghosts , " a documentary also looking at the plight of the herero . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the house of world cultures is looking at the legacy of colonialism .
on thursday , the house of world cultures -lrb- haus der kulturen der welt -rrb- in berlin will launch a major multi-disciplinary exhibition entitled " black atlantic " , that - among other things , will look at the legacy of colonial occupation , including that undertaken by germany .
capping things off , an anti-colonialism conference is scheduled to take place in berlin in november . the issue of germany 's colonial legacy has gone beyond the halls of academia , where a few experts debated its significance in relative obscurity , and into the realm of popular culture .
in the process , some say germany is shedding its colonial amnesia . what took so long ? in critically examining its colonial past , germany is following a trend already evident in other former colonial powers .
the question is , what took germany so long ? " when it comes to questions of guilt and responsibility , the germans are simply tired , " gerhard seyfried , author of the novel " herero " , told dw-world , referring to the arduous task of working through the legacy of nazi atrocities . colonial history greatly interested germans before the war , but was simply eclipsed by subsequent events , seyfried said . pascal grosse , a historian who has written extensively on the subject and will participate in a panel discussion on the topic in conjunction with the " black atlantic " exhibition in berlin , concurred . " the scale of the holocaust overshadowed previous events , " he told dw-world . but with an ever-more interconnected world resulting from globalization , germans , like others in different countries , are increasingly interested in their role in the world - both past and present , grosse said . a century later , some debate relevance but that said , what purpose does dredging up events so far in the past serve ?

he 's accompanied by a delegation of business and science leaders pushing for deeper economic and political ties . schröder is visiting hungary on the occasion of the 15th anniversary of the date hungary opened its borders to east germans and allowed them to leave to the west - a development that created an extremely positive new dimension in west germany 's ties with the then-eastern bloc nation .
earlier this year , former german president johannes rau spoke of the importance of that development during a visit to budapest .
" we owe an awful lot to hungary ...
if hungary had n't shut off its electrical fence on may 2 , 1989 , which allowed many from the ddr to come to west germany , the developments in prague on sept .

" in some respects , the hungarians were the intiators of german unity . "

the 43-year-old shooting star of the socialists is expected to be confirmed as prime minister by parliament at the end of the month .
like the political developments between germany and hungary , business ties are also both strong and dynamic .
currently , germany is hungary 's most-important trading partner - a position that could further grow with hungary 's european union membership , which came into effect on may 1 .
germany is also an important foreign investor in hungary .
since 1989 , german companies have invested over € 12 billion -lrb- $ 14.6 billion -rrb- in hungary , representing 55 percent of all foreign investment and creating more than 200,000 jobs .
hungary has an abundance of red tape nevertheless , german companies do n't shy away from the fact that hungary has become less attractive for business .
the country has continually failed in efforts to trim red tape , and there is also a lack of educated workers .
additionally , salaries have risen by 50 percent since 2002 and the exchange of hungary 's currency , the forint , has been a roller coaster ride since june 2003 .
worse yet , contradictory statements about the country 's currency exchange rates and inflation goals and a lax fiscal policy have engendered considerable uncertainty .
but these facts have not been lost on gyurcsany , who has said making hungary more attractive to foreign investors will be a priority .
" in my opinion , it 's important that the country 's economic policy reflect stability and calm so that hungary can continue to be a goal for foreign investors , " he said .
despite some tougher times in recent months , most of the 54 german companies active there are satisfied with hungary as a place for doing business .

he 's accompanied by a delegation of business and science leaders pushing for deeper economic and political ties . schröder is visiting hungary on the occasion of the 15th anniversary of the date hungary opened its borders to east germans and allowed them to leave to the west - a development that created an extremely positive new dimension in west germany 's ties with the then-eastern bloc nation .
earlier this year , former german president johannes rau spoke of the importance of that development during a visit to budapest .
" we owe an awful lot to hungary ...
if hungary had n't shut off its electrical fence on may 2 , 1989 , which allowed many from the ddr to come to west germany , the developments in prague on sept .
20 would n't have happened and the -lrb- berlin -rrb- wall would n't have fallen on nov .

" in some respects , the hungarians were the intiators of german unity . "
for a long time , the magyars would have been thankful for a few handouts from germany .
but the burdens of german unity and the costs of rebuilding the east german infrastructure left little room for german financial aid to the hungarians .
a visit with new prime minister designate still , relations between the two countries have developed positively .
there are no major sticking points between the countries , and schröder can look forward to a relaxing trip aimed at deepening the countries ' political , economic and scientific cooperation .

the 43-year-old shooting star of the socialists is expected to be confirmed as prime minister by parliament at the end of the month .
like the political developments between germany and hungary , business ties are also both strong and dynamic .
currently , germany is hungary 's most-important trading partner - a position that could further grow with hungary 's european union membership , which came into effect on may 1 .
germany is also an important foreign investor in hungary .
since 1989 , german companies have invested over € 12 billion -lrb- $ 14.6 billion -rrb- in hungary , representing 55 percent of all foreign investment and creating more than 200,000 jobs .
hungary has an abundance of red tape nevertheless , german companies do n't shy away from the fact that hungary has become less attractive for business .
the country has continually failed in efforts to trim red tape , and there is also a lack of educated workers .
additionally , salaries have risen by 50 percent since 2002 and the exchange of hungary 's currency , the forint , has been a roller coaster ride since june 2003 .
worse yet , contradictory statements about the country 's currency exchange rates and inflation goals and a lax fiscal policy have engendered considerable uncertainty .
but these facts have not been lost on gyurcsany , who has said making hungary more attractive to foreign investors will be a priority .
" in my opinion , it 's important that the country 's economic policy reflect stability and calm so that hungary can continue to be a goal for foreign investors , " he said .
despite some tougher times in recent months , most of the 54 german companies active there are satisfied with hungary as a place for doing business .
indeed , many are planning additional investments - a good basis for deepening economic ties between the two countries .

" an inter-ministerial group will be charged with evaluating the losses suffered by poland as a result of world war ii , " the polish foreign minister said tuesday following a government meeting to examine a controversial parliament resolution last week that called for war reparations from germany .
cimoszewicz said the exercise was purely intended to provide a " reminder of the causes and effects of war , " and reiterated the government 's refusal to seek reparations from berlin .
" our intention is not linked to any demand for compensation , " he said .
" it is a case of illustrating and reminding those who may have forgotten about world war ii and its consequences . "
" it is perhaps such forgetfulness that has led to demands for compensation from us , " he added , in reference to a series of recent claims for restitution of property seized from germans forced to flee poland after 1945 .
cimoszewicz added that the government would " work out provisions to support its citizens if they were brought before the courts over a claim for compensation . "
" the question of compensation on either side is closed , " he said , while calling for a " stronger dialogue " to prevent the debate between warsaw and berlin from " veering in the wrong direction . "

the move was seen as a tit-for-tat response to a series of claims by german civilians seeking compensation for property lost after poland 's borders shifted westwards in 1945 and they were expelled from the newly re-drawn state .
but jozef oleksy , the speaker of the polish parliament , said on wednesday that the resolution demanding compensation was in fact aimed at prodding the european union over regional aid for poland . oleksy said the demand " is aimed at the eu as a reminder -lrb- of poland 's losses -rrb- when it comes to hand out regional fund and aid money .

" an inter-ministerial group will be charged with evaluating the losses suffered by poland as a result of world war ii , " the polish foreign minister said tuesday following a government meeting to examine a controversial parliament resolution last week that called for war reparations from germany .
cimoszewicz said the exercise was purely intended to provide a " reminder of the causes and effects of war , " and reiterated the government 's refusal to seek reparations from berlin .
" our intention is not linked to any demand for compensation , " he said .
" it is a case of illustrating and reminding those who may have forgotten about world war ii and its consequences . "
" it is perhaps such forgetfulness that has led to demands for compensation from us , " he added , in reference to a series of recent claims for restitution of property seized from germans forced to flee poland after 1945 .
cimoszewicz added that the government would " work out provisions to support its citizens if they were brought before the courts over a claim for compensation . "

they also demanded that the german government of social democrats and greens finally depart from what they described as an economic and social zigzag course . the industry associations in eastern germany say the current debate about equal living standards in the two halves of the reunited country wo n't serve as an excuse to do nothing about the current discrepancies . but in a statement issued in berlin , walter botschatzki , the president of the business associations in the eastern state of thuringia , said the east remains grateful for the billions of euros in western aid it has received and will continue to receive in the framework of a solidarity pact geared to making the east more competitive . he warned though that the current social and economic woes in the east are being misused by both left and right-wing forces to push their own agenda for next weekend 's regional elections in the states of brandenburg and saxony . achievements should be recognized " the enormous achievements that the whole country has recorded in the east ’ s economic recovery over the past 15 years are being belittled on purpose by some forces in our society , " botschatzki told dw-radio .
" let ’ s not forget that eastern germany now has an extremely modern transport and telecommunications infrastructure .
there are also very competitive clusters of industry in the east , like the semi-conductor centers in dresden or the automobile industry in leipzig . " botschatzki also spoke of the big strides which have been made in the metal-working and electronics industries in the east .
following a downturn in productivity in the period before 1997 , he said the past seven years had seen an enormous upswing in these sectors , creating more than 50,000 jobs across the east . he added that much more could be achieved with clear political signals from berlin .
easterners , he claimed , had proven in the past that they were willing to take their share of reforms , as long as those reforms made sense to them . people need faith in reforms " the current political zig-zag course , the lack of real reform prospects and the poor communication of reform efforts by the government have resulted in more and more people feeling insecure , " botschatzki said .
" confidence and faith in the government ’ s policies is decreasing , and that leads in the end to less stability in our democratic system . " botschatzki added that right after german unification in 1990 , easterners had hoped that living standards across the country would level out within 10 years or so .
they now had to accept that this was wishful thinking .
the same applied to their hopes for equal wages . klaus von dohnanyi , who was commissioned by the government to work out a more effective economic program for the east , says people have to face current realities . they 'll have to accept new low-wage employment opportunities rather than going on the dole . " we have new competition also from eastern europe and must see that these people in east germany are capable of making a living , " he said .
" and therefore we discuss the earned tax credit systems in the united states , for example , something we should add to the wages to remain competitive and at the same time have adequate living in the relatively high cost country germany . " von dohnanyi has explicitly supported president köhler 's recent statement that equal living conditions will not be achieved . he said the man had the courage to speak the truth rather than stooping to populist formulas which didn ’ t help anyone in the country .

they also demanded that the german government of social democrats and greens finally depart from what they described as an economic and social zigzag course . the industry associations in eastern germany say the current debate about equal living standards in the two halves of the reunited country wo n't serve as an excuse to do nothing about the current discrepancies . but in a statement issued in berlin , walter botschatzki , the president of the business associations in the eastern state of thuringia , said the east remains grateful for the billions of euros in western aid it has received and will continue to receive in the framework of a solidarity pact geared to making the east more competitive . he warned though that the current social and economic woes in the east are being misused by both left and right-wing forces to push their own agenda for next weekend 's regional elections in the states of brandenburg and saxony . achievements should be recognized " the enormous achievements that the whole country has recorded in the east ’ s economic recovery over the past 15 years are being belittled on purpose by some forces in our society , " botschatzki told dw-radio .
" let ’ s not forget that eastern germany now has an extremely modern transport and telecommunications infrastructure .
there are also very competitive clusters of industry in the east , like the semi-conductor centers in dresden or the automobile industry in leipzig . " botschatzki also spoke of the big strides which have been made in the metal-working and electronics industries in the east .
following a downturn in productivity in the period before 1997 , he said the past seven years had seen an enormous upswing in these sectors , creating more than 50,000 jobs across the east . he added that much more could be achieved with clear political signals from berlin .
easterners , he claimed , had proven in the past that they were willing to take their share of reforms , as long as those reforms made sense to them . people need faith in reforms " the current political zig-zag course , the lack of real reform prospects and the poor communication of reform efforts by the government have resulted in more and more people feeling insecure , " botschatzki said .
" confidence and faith in the government ’ s policies is decreasing , and that leads in the end to less stability in our democratic system . " botschatzki added that right after german unification in 1990 , easterners had hoped that living standards across the country would level out within 10 years or so .
they now had to accept that this was wishful thinking .
the same applied to their hopes for equal wages . klaus von dohnanyi , who was commissioned by the government to work out a more effective economic program for the east , says people have to face current realities . they 'll have to accept new low-wage employment opportunities rather than going on the dole . " we have new competition also from eastern europe and must see that these people in east germany are capable of making a living , " he said .
" and therefore we discuss the earned tax credit systems in the united states , for example , something we should add to the wages to remain competitive and at the same time have adequate living in the relatively high cost country germany .

after getting bad grades from the oecd , german politicians are calling for extensive reforms of the nation 's schools .
it 's not enough to spend more money , the education system needs to be completely re-worked , they said . a day after germany brought home failing grades from the organization for economic cooperation and development for its education system , the nation 's politicians responded like worried parents .
it was the second time in two years that the country , which prides itself on producing some of the world 's leading philosophers and scientists , had received negative marks for government spending , number of hours spent in the classroom and pupil-teacher ratios .
on wednesday , education experts in the government coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens minced no words in calling on germany to prepare itself better for the future .
in addition to increasing much-needed government investment in the education system -lrb- only about 9.7 percent of total spending goes towards schools -rrb- , the politicians called for far-reaching reforms of the nation 's traditional school structure .
school for all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teachers need to spend more time with each pupil in the elementary schools .
krista sager , parliamentary fraction leader for the greens , told the berliner zeitung germany needed to move away from its three-tiered school model and introduce " a school for all , " where pupils would stay together in one system for nine or ten years .
the current division into three different schools , each tailored to specific education abilities and skills , is " more befitting of a medieval feudal system than a modern society , " criticized christoph matschie , head of the spd for the eastern state of thuringia .
a general school for all pupils is better equipped for promoting common education standards than a system that " sorts " children at an early age according to their abilities , explained the former state secretary for the education ministry .
matschie told the paper that the traditional division into college-prep highschool , secondary school and vocational school , was partially to blame for the poor results in the oecd study .
pupils performed better when they learned together , he and sager argued .
schleswig-holstein 's state minister for culture and education was also convinced that the three-tiered education system is no longer beneficial to the country .
ute erdsiek-rave said her party of social democrats would campaign together with the greens during the next state election for a reform that supports a " school for all . "
however , a complete revamping of the school system would take between 10 and 15 years , she admitted .
more financial support needed opposition leader angela merkel dismissed calls to introduce such far-reaching reforms .
the head of the conservative christian democrats union said the oecd in no way implied that germany 's traditional three-tiered school model was to blame for failures in german education .
the international study indicated specifically that germany had done too little to improve standards in kindergartens and elementary schools , she argued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a typical german classroom ?
germany 's problems were largely the result of large classrooms and too little instruction time , she said , both of which could be rectified with more investment .
the pupil-teacher ratio needs to be improved , merkel said , pointing to the statistic that germany had 24 pupils per teacher in elementary schools , the highest number among the 30 industrial countries surveyed .
t with a view to government plans to expand the number of all-day schools , merkel said germany was on the right road to increasing the amount of time children spend in the classroom .
the oecd study showed that german pupils aged seven and eight attend school on average for 626 hours a year , compared with 788 on average in the oecd .
germany needs to invest more in building all-day schools , she said and called for a speedy introduction of tax reforms that would open up more funds for education .
money is not the answer " we must once and for all start investing in the education system , " merkel told rbb information radio on wednesday .
but the head of the german union for teachers and researchers , eva-maria stange , cautioned against thinking only in terms of financial support .
german politicians needed to " do their homework , " she said .
the oecd report clearly showed " german schools need not just more money , but fundamental reforms . " dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bad grades for german schools germany ’ s school system has gotten bad marks yet again .
an annual oecd report suggested that germany spends too little on learning , students get too little instruction and too few people get university degrees .
-lrb- sept .
15 , 2004 -rrb- germany moves to all-day schools the establishment of 10,000 all-day schools across the country is just part of a € 4 billion investment program to boost education standards in germany that began on monday .
-lrb- may 12 , 2003 -rrb- report lambastes german schools the first-ever nationwide education report for germany has castigated the country ’ s “ fault-riddled school system ” and urged policymakers to make education a priority despite budgetary constraints .

after getting bad grades from the oecd , german politicians are calling for extensive reforms of the nation 's schools .
it 's not enough to spend more money , the education system needs to be completely re-worked , they said . a day after germany brought home failing grades from the organization for economic cooperation and development for its education system , the nation 's politicians responded like worried parents .
it was the second time in two years that the country , which prides itself on producing some of the world 's leading philosophers and scientists , had received negative marks for government spending , number of hours spent in the classroom and pupil-teacher ratios .
on wednesday , education experts in the government coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens minced no words in calling on germany to prepare itself better for the future .
in addition to increasing much-needed government investment in the education system -lrb- only about 9.7 percent of total spending goes towards schools -rrb- , the politicians called for far-reaching reforms of the nation 's traditional school structure .
school for all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teachers need to spend more time with each pupil in the elementary schools .
krista sager , parliamentary fraction leader for the greens , told the berliner zeitung germany needed to move away from its three-tiered school model and introduce " a school for all , " where pupils would stay together in one system for nine or ten years .
the current division into three different schools , each tailored to specific education abilities and skills , is " more befitting of a medieval feudal system than a modern society , " criticized christoph matschie , head of the spd for the eastern state of thuringia .
a general school for all pupils is better equipped for promoting common education standards than a system that " sorts " children at an early age according to their abilities , explained the former state secretary for the education ministry .
matschie told the paper that the traditional division into college-prep highschool , secondary school and vocational school , was partially to blame for the poor results in the oecd study .
pupils performed better when they learned together , he and sager argued .
schleswig-holstein 's state minister for culture and education was also convinced that the three-tiered education system is no longer beneficial to the country .
ute erdsiek-rave said her party of social democrats would campaign together with the greens during the next state election for a reform that supports a " school for all . "
however , a complete revamping of the school system would take between 10 and 15 years , she admitted .
more financial support needed opposition leader angela merkel dismissed calls to introduce such far-reaching reforms .
the head of the conservative christian democrats union said the oecd in no way implied that germany 's traditional three-tiered school model was to blame for failures in german education .
the international study indicated specifically that germany had done too little to improve standards in kindergartens and elementary schools , she argued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a typical german classroom ?
germany 's problems were largely the result of large classrooms and too little instruction time , she said , both of which could be rectified with more investment .
the pupil-teacher ratio needs to be improved , merkel said , pointing to the statistic that germany had 24 pupils per teacher in elementary schools , the highest number among the 30 industrial countries surveyed .
t with a view to government plans to expand the number of all-day schools , merkel said germany was on the right road to increasing the amount of time children spend in the classroom .
the oecd study showed that german pupils aged seven and eight attend school on average for 626 hours a year , compared with 788 on average in the oecd .
germany needs to invest more in building all-day schools , she said and called for a speedy introduction of tax reforms that would open up more funds for education .
money is not the answer " we must once and for all start investing in the education system , " merkel told rbb information radio on wednesday .
but the head of the german union for teachers and researchers , eva-maria stange , cautioned against thinking only in terms of financial support .
german politicians needed to " do their homework , " she said .
the oecd report clearly showed " german schools need not just more money , but fundamental reforms . " dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bad grades for german schools germany ’ s school system has gotten bad marks yet again .

in addition to increasing much-needed government investment in the education system -lrb- only about 9.7 percent of total spending goes towards schools -rrb- , the politicians called for far-reaching reforms of the nation 's traditional school structure .
school for all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teachers need to spend more time with each pupil in the elementary schools .
krista sager , parliamentary fraction leader for the greens , told the berliner zeitung germany needed to move away from its three-tiered school model and introduce " a school for all , " where pupils would stay together in one system for nine or ten years .
the current division into three different schools , each tailored to specific education abilities and skills , is " more befitting of a medieval feudal system than a modern society , " criticized christoph matschie , head of the spd for the eastern state of thuringia .
a general school for all pupils is better equipped for promoting common education standards than a system that " sorts " children at an early age according to their abilities , explained the former state secretary for the education ministry .
matschie told the paper that the traditional division into college-prep highschool , secondary school and vocational school , was partially to blame for the poor results in the oecd study .
pupils performed better when they learned together , he and sager argued .
schleswig-holstein 's state minister for culture and education was also convinced that the three-tiered education system is no longer beneficial to the country .
ute erdsiek-rave said her party of social democrats would campaign together with the greens during the next state election for a reform that supports a " school for all . "
however , a complete revamping of the school system would take between 10 and 15 years , she admitted .
more financial support needed opposition leader angela merkel dismissed calls to introduce such far-reaching reforms .
the head of the conservative christian democrats union said the oecd in no way implied that germany 's traditional three-tiered school model was to blame for failures in german education .
the international study indicated specifically that germany had done too little to improve standards in kindergartens and elementary schools , she argued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a typical german classroom ?
germany 's problems were largely the result of large classrooms and too little instruction time , she said , both of which could be rectified with more investment .
the pupil-teacher ratio needs to be improved , merkel said , pointing to the statistic that germany had 24 pupils per teacher in elementary schools , the highest number among the 30 industrial countries surveyed .
t with a view to government plans to expand the number of all-day schools , merkel said germany was on the right road to increasing the amount of time children spend in the classroom .
the oecd study showed that german pupils aged seven and eight attend school on average for 626 hours a year , compared with 788 on average in the oecd .
germany needs to invest more in building all-day schools , she said and called for a speedy introduction of tax reforms that would open up more funds for education .
money is not the answer " we must once and for all start investing in the education system , " merkel told rbb information radio on wednesday .
but the head of the german union for teachers and researchers , eva-maria stange , cautioned against thinking only in terms of financial support .
german politicians needed to " do their homework , " she said .
the oecd report clearly showed " german schools need not just more money , but fundamental reforms . " dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bad grades for german schools germany ’ s school system has gotten bad marks yet again .
an annual oecd report suggested that germany spends too little on learning , students get too little instruction and too few people get university degrees .

15 , 2004 -rrb- germany moves to all-day schools the establishment of 10,000 all-day schools across the country is just part of a € 4 billion investment program to boost education standards in germany that began on monday .

young germans have long labored under the weight of guilt from the nation 's past but have recently pushed for more pride in their country .

young germans have long labored under the weight of guilt from the nation 's past but have recently pushed for more pride in their country .
however , pro-german lyrics in pop songs are causing concern . germany 's gradual relaxation towards its national identity is causing concern among recording artists and musicians as an increasing number of songs appearing in the pop charts seem to contain lyrics which could be misconstrued as nationalist . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul van dyk for months , the single " we " has been riding high in the german charts .
a collaboration between techno dj paul van dyk -lrb- photo -rrb- and wolfsheim singer peter heppner , the song proudly recounts german post-war history with lyrics such as " i ask myself who we are .
we are we .
divided , defeated but , nevertheless , in the end , we 're still alive . " the song is accompanied by a video that contains images of women rebuilding bombed cities with their bare hands and amputee soldiers returning from the war . " we " portrays germans as victims in a land split between the allies and its people humiliated .
but there is no mention of the war , of the holocaust or the third reich .
instead the song celebrates the german success history : the reconstruction , the miracle of bern and the reunification . it is , essentially , a love song to germany . no more shame over nationality another example comes from the group mia in the song " it is what it is . "
front woman mieze sings about german pride and the creation of the national colors displayed in the post-war flag : " a gulp of the black coffee wakes me up , your red mouth touches me gently , at this moment , it clicks and the yellow sun rises , " referring to the colors in germany 's national flag : black , red and gold . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mieze and other mia members in a publicity shot mieze later sings about the rejection of past generations and the embracing of a new german identity : " if anyone asks me now where i come from , i no longer feel sorry for myself … i risk it all for love , i feel ready .

" if the company is looking for a conflict , we are ready to back up our claims with protest action and warning strikes , " chief ig metall negotiator harmut meine told die welt newspaper ahead of the talks . " shareholders get a dividend and the workers have to tighten their belts with a wage freeze , " he said .
" it 's not fair . " ig metall , germany 's most powerful industrial union , blamed volkswagen for creating a climate of conflict ahead of the negotiations , whose first rounds start later wednesday , and asked vw to be prudent with its public comments . " we have not even started to negotiate and here comes a financial wizard from the management board who heats up the climate of negotiations with unnecessary chatter , " he said in reference to comments by chief financial officer hans-dieter pötsch . pötsch last week said about 30,000 jobs are at risk if wage negotiations end without cutting costs . " that is irresponsible , " meine said . the wage negotiations at vw often set the standard for the rest of the industry , and the country 's biggest industrial union and employers typically take distant but firm positions as the talks get under way . ig metall , which is negotiating on behalf of 103,000 manufacturing employees , is asking for job guarantees and a 4 percent pay rise from oct .
1 , after a two-year wage agreement expires at the end of this month . a pre-emptive strike ? but vw , in an unusual negotiating stance , has already disclosed what it intends to propose to the union even before the talks start : a two-year wage freeze and various cuts in pay and benefits . the usual negotiating tactic of companies is to wait for the union to declare its demands during the first round , then wait a few weeks before divulging its counter-proposals . " we will not agree to a wage freeze , " meine said , adding that he could not say how long the talks would drag on . " but i expect difficult negotiations and a heated conflict , " he said . analysts polled by the afx financial news service on the eve of the talks said the positions of the two sides are so far apart that they may well be on a collision course that could lead to production disruptions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it will definitely be a very difficult negotiation , " said economist eckhard tuchtfeld at commerzbank .
he added it would be very difficult for ig metall to agree to a wage freeze because they were already insisting on a four percent increase . " if it had said it wanted two percent or so , then it would be easier to back down from the original demand .
but from four percent to zero , they would really look funny , " tuchtfeld said . other analysts said the investor community has already factored into this year 's estimates for vw the possibility of output cuts as a result of strikes which ig metall might call to back its wage demands . abu dhabi deal fails in more bad news for volkswagen on wednesday , the company said that talks to sell a 9.8 percent stake in vw to an investment group from abu dhabi had been called off due to disagreement over the price . " both sides regret this development , but see promising prospectives for working together on other present projects , " vw said in a statement . vw wanted to the sale of shares to help finance the purchase of 50 percent of dutch car leasing and management firm leaseplan .

" if the company is looking for a conflict , we are ready to back up our claims with protest action and warning strikes , " chief ig metall negotiator harmut meine told die welt newspaper ahead of the talks . " shareholders get a dividend and the workers have to tighten their belts with a wage freeze , " he said .
" it 's not fair . " ig metall , germany 's most powerful industrial union , blamed volkswagen for creating a climate of conflict ahead of the negotiations , whose first rounds start later wednesday , and asked vw to be prudent with its public comments . " we have not even started to negotiate and here comes a financial wizard from the management board who heats up the climate of negotiations with unnecessary chatter , " he said in reference to comments by chief financial officer hans-dieter pötsch . pötsch last week said about 30,000 jobs are at risk if wage negotiations end without cutting costs . " that is irresponsible , " meine said . the wage negotiations at vw often set the standard for the rest of the industry , and the country 's biggest industrial union and employers typically take distant but firm positions as the talks get under way . ig metall , which is negotiating on behalf of 103,000 manufacturing employees , is asking for job guarantees and a 4 percent pay rise from oct .
1 , after a two-year wage agreement expires at the end of this month . a pre-emptive strike ? but vw , in an unusual negotiating stance , has already disclosed what it intends to propose to the union even before the talks start : a two-year wage freeze and various cuts in pay and benefits . the usual negotiating tactic of companies is to wait for the union to declare its demands during the first round , then wait a few weeks before divulging its counter-proposals . " we will not agree to a wage freeze , " meine said , adding that he could not say how long the talks would drag on . " but i expect difficult negotiations and a heated conflict , " he said . analysts polled by the afx financial news service on the eve of the talks said the positions of the two sides are so far apart that they may well be on a collision course that could lead to production disruptions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it will definitely be a very difficult negotiation , " said economist eckhard tuchtfeld at commerzbank .
he added it would be very difficult for ig metall to agree to a wage freeze because they were already insisting on a four percent increase . " if it had said it wanted two percent or so , then it would be easier to back down from the original demand .
but from four percent to zero , they would really look funny , " tuchtfeld said . other analysts said the investor community has already factored into this year 's estimates for vw the possibility of output cuts as a result of strikes which ig metall might call to back its wage demands . abu dhabi deal fails in more bad news for volkswagen on wednesday , the company said that talks to sell a 9.8 percent stake in vw to an investment group from abu dhabi had been called off due to disagreement over the price . " both sides regret this development , but see promising prospectives for working together on other present projects , " vw said in a statement . vw wanted to the sale of shares to help finance the purchase of 50 percent of dutch car leasing and management firm leaseplan .
the deal will now be paid for out of vw 's current operating revenue . vw 's stock fell sharply after news of the ending of the talks broke .
in late afternoon trade on wednesday , volkswagen shares dropped 2.67 percent to € 32.47 -lrb- $ 39.46 -rrb- . afp / dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german auto industry at risk germany 's tradition as a center of car manufacturing could be in jeopardy as more businesses look to move east in response to rising wages and inflexible labor markets .

he 's accompanied by a delegation of business and science leaders pushing for deeper economic and political ties . schröder is visiting hungary on the occasion of the 15th anniversary of the date hungary opened its borders to east germans and allowed them to leave to the west - a development that created an extremely positive new dimension in west germany 's ties with the then-eastern bloc nation .
earlier this year , former german president johannes rau spoke of the importance of that development during a visit to budapest .
" we owe an awful lot to hungary ...
if hungary had n't shut off its electrical fence on may 2 , 1989 , which allowed many from the ddr to come to west germany , the developments in prague on sept .
20 would n't have happened and the -lrb- berlin -rrb- wall would n't have fallen on nov .
9 , " rau said .
" in some respects , the hungarians were the intiators of german unity . "
for a long time , the magyars would have been thankful for a few handouts from germany .
but the burdens of german unity and the costs of rebuilding the east german infrastructure left little room for german financial aid to the hungarians .
a visit with new prime minister designate still , relations between the two countries have developed positively .
there are no major sticking points between the countries , and schröder can look forward to a relaxing trip aimed at deepening the countries ' political , economic and scientific cooperation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- right -rrb- , and outgoing hungarian prime minister peter medgyessy schröder will be meeting with outgoing hungarian prime minister peter medgyessy , who announced his resignation in august following a government coalition crisis , as well as his nominated successor , ferenc gyurcsany .
the 43-year-old shooting star of the socialists is expected to be confirmed as prime minister by parliament at the end of the month .
like the political developments between germany and hungary , business ties are also both strong and dynamic .
currently , germany is hungary 's most-important trading partner - a position that could further grow with hungary 's european union membership , which came into effect on may 1 .
germany is also an important foreign investor in hungary .
since 1989 , german companies have invested over € 12 billion -lrb- $ 14.6 billion -rrb- in hungary , representing 55 percent of all foreign investment and creating more than 200,000 jobs .
hungary has an abundance of red tape nevertheless , german companies do n't shy away from the fact that hungary has become less attractive for business .
the country has continually failed in efforts to trim red tape , and there is also a lack of educated workers .
additionally , salaries have risen by 50 percent since 2002 and the exchange of hungary 's currency , the forint , has been a roller coaster ride since june 2003 .
worse yet , contradictory statements about the country 's currency exchange rates and inflation goals and a lax fiscal policy have engendered considerable uncertainty .
but these facts have not been lost on gyurcsany , who has said making hungary more attractive to foreign investors will be a priority .
" in my opinion , it 's important that the country 's economic policy reflect stability and calm so that hungary can continue to be a goal for foreign investors , " he said .

he 's accompanied by a delegation of business and science leaders pushing for deeper economic and political ties . schröder is visiting hungary on the occasion of the 15th anniversary of the date hungary opened its borders to east germans and allowed them to leave to the west - a development that created an extremely positive new dimension in west germany 's ties with the then-eastern bloc nation .
earlier this year , former german president johannes rau spoke of the importance of that development during a visit to budapest .
" we owe an awful lot to hungary ...
if hungary had n't shut off its electrical fence on may 2 , 1989 , which allowed many from the ddr to come to west germany , the developments in prague on sept .
20 would n't have happened and the -lrb- berlin -rrb- wall would n't have fallen on nov .
9 , " rau said .
" in some respects , the hungarians were the intiators of german unity . "
for a long time , the magyars would have been thankful for a few handouts from germany .
but the burdens of german unity and the costs of rebuilding the east german infrastructure left little room for german financial aid to the hungarians .
a visit with new prime minister designate still , relations between the two countries have developed positively .
there are no major sticking points between the countries , and schröder can look forward to a relaxing trip aimed at deepening the countries ' political , economic and scientific cooperation .

now , a recent spate of books , films , and exhibitions is taking a critical look at this chapter - and making it a matter of debate . england , france and belgium are among the countries most often mentioned when historians consider europe 's colonial history and its related atrocities .
lesser known , however , is the fact that for 20 years , between 1884 and 1914 , germany lorded over its own swaths of the african continent , including areas of what are today namibia , cameroon , togo , rwanda and burundi . in fact , the infamous congo conference , where european colonial interests divided-up africa and its natural resources , took place in berlin in 1884 .
and though germany only managed to hold onto its share for two decades , it certainly wracked up a record of carnage on par with that of better-known colonial powers . despite these uncomfortable facts , this historical chapter has been all but forgotten by the german public .
now , a spate of new books , films , exhibitions and conferences - all coinciding with the 100th anniversary of two of germany 's most bloody african episodes - are making it a matter of public debate .
for a country already fatigued by efforts to come to terms with the atrocities of world war ii , that 's quite an accomplishment . a short and violent occupation the brief 20 years germany controlled parts of west and east africa were not peaceful .
in 1904 in the german territory of south west africa , today namibia , german troops led by general lothar von trotha mercilessly put down a rebellion of the indigenous herero people . by the time the conflict ended four years later , between 45,000 to 65,000 herero were killed , many of whom suffered in work camps some consider the forerunners to wwii-era concentration camps . a year later , in the german held south east africa , today tanzania , the so-called maji-maji war broke out .
there , the local population also rebelled against german rule and likewise suffered the consequences : an estimated 250,000 to 300,000 - one third of the total population - were killed . slow to offer an apology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on the anniversary of the massacre , a group of herero march to honor the dead .
with this year 's 100th anniversary of the atrocities in namibia and the upcoming 100th anniversary of the war in tanzania , the german government has been under added pressure to offer an official apology , which , much to the dismay of herero leaders , has been slow in coming . but in august at the anniversary event in namibia honoring the herero dead , german development and aid minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul came the closest yet any german official has ever gotten to those magic words . " we germans accept our historic and moral responsibility and the guilt incurred by germans , " she told a delighted crowd of more than 1,000 people . " the atrocities committed at that time would have been termed genocide , " she added . however , she ruled out financial compensation for the victims ' descendents ; there is an ongoing lawsuit seeking € 3.3 billion -lrb- $ 4 billion -rrb- in damages . books , exhibitions remind a reluctant public with that historic statement , the german government showed its willingness to take on board yet another difficult chapter in the country 's history .
the general public - with the help of several recent books , films and exhibitions , all addressing the subject - is following suit . gerhard seyfried 's book " herero , " a novel written from the point of view of a young german sent to the western region of africa at the height of the conflict , came out last year and was followed this year by martin baer 's film " white ghosts , " a documentary also looking at the plight of the herero . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the house of world cultures is looking at the legacy of colonialism .
on thursday , the house of world cultures -lrb- haus der kulturen der welt -rrb- in berlin will launch a major multi-disciplinary exhibition entitled " black atlantic " , that - among other things , will look at the legacy of colonial occupation , including that undertaken by germany .
capping things off , an anti-colonialism conference is scheduled to take place in berlin in november . the issue of germany 's colonial legacy has gone beyond the halls of academia , where a few experts debated its significance in relative obscurity , and into the realm of popular culture .
in the process , some say germany is shedding its colonial amnesia . what took so long ? in critically examining its colonial past , germany is following a trend already evident in other former colonial powers .
the question is , what took germany so long ? " when it comes to questions of guilt and responsibility , the germans are simply tired , " gerhard seyfried , author of the novel " herero " , told dw-world , referring to the arduous task of working through the legacy of nazi atrocities . colonial history greatly interested germans before the war , but was simply eclipsed by subsequent events , seyfried said . pascal grosse , a historian who has written extensively on the subject and will participate in a panel discussion on the topic in conjunction with the " black atlantic " exhibition in berlin , concurred . " the scale of the holocaust overshadowed previous events , " he told dw-world . but with an ever-more interconnected world resulting from globalization , germans , like others in different countries , are increasingly interested in their role in the world - both past and present , grosse said . a century later , some debate relevance but that said , what purpose does dredging up events so far in the past serve ? " we need to look at this material again and again , it 's never enough to say we 've done that , let 's move on , " shaheen merali , a curator who put together the visual arts component of the " black atlantic " exhibition told dw-world . for seyfried , such critical self reflection of colonial atrocities serves the same purpose similar reflection on world war ii-era crimes does . " we must learn from history , " he said . kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany urges herero to drop lawsuit germany 's ambassador to namibia has called on the herero people to drop a $ 4 billion -lrb- € 3.3 billion -rrb- lawsuit filed three years ago in us courts for atrocities committed under colonial rule .

now , a recent spate of books , films , and exhibitions is taking a critical look at this chapter - and making it a matter of debate . england , france and belgium are among the countries most often mentioned when historians consider europe 's colonial history and its related atrocities .
lesser known , however , is the fact that for 20 years , between 1884 and 1914 , germany lorded over its own swaths of the african continent , including areas of what are today namibia , cameroon , togo , rwanda and burundi . in fact , the infamous congo conference , where european colonial interests divided-up africa and its natural resources , took place in berlin in 1884 .
and though germany only managed to hold onto its share for two decades , it certainly wracked up a record of carnage on par with that of better-known colonial powers . despite these uncomfortable facts , this historical chapter has been all but forgotten by the german public .
now , a spate of new books , films , exhibitions and conferences - all coinciding with the 100th anniversary of two of germany 's most bloody african episodes - are making it a matter of public debate .
for a country already fatigued by efforts to come to terms with the atrocities of world war ii , that 's quite an accomplishment . a short and violent occupation the brief 20 years germany controlled parts of west and east africa were not peaceful .
in 1904 in the german territory of south west africa , today namibia , german troops led by general lothar von trotha mercilessly put down a rebellion of the indigenous herero people . by the time the conflict ended four years later , between 45,000 to 65,000 herero were killed , many of whom suffered in work camps some consider the forerunners to wwii-era concentration camps . a year later , in the german held south east africa , today tanzania , the so-called maji-maji war broke out .
there , the local population also rebelled against german rule and likewise suffered the consequences : an estimated 250,000 to 300,000 - one third of the total population - were killed . slow to offer an apology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on the anniversary of the massacre , a group of herero march to honor the dead .
with this year 's 100th anniversary of the atrocities in namibia and the upcoming 100th anniversary of the war in tanzania , the german government has been under added pressure to offer an official apology , which , much to the dismay of herero leaders , has been slow in coming . but in august at the anniversary event in namibia honoring the herero dead , german development and aid minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul came the closest yet any german official has ever gotten to those magic words . " we germans accept our historic and moral responsibility and the guilt incurred by germans , " she told a delighted crowd of more than 1,000 people . " the atrocities committed at that time would have been termed genocide , " she added . however , she ruled out financial compensation for the victims ' descendents ; there is an ongoing lawsuit seeking € 3.3 billion -lrb- $ 4 billion -rrb- in damages . books , exhibitions remind a reluctant public with that historic statement , the german government showed its willingness to take on board yet another difficult chapter in the country 's history .
the general public - with the help of several recent books , films and exhibitions , all addressing the subject - is following suit . gerhard seyfried 's book " herero , " a novel written from the point of view of a young german sent to the western region of africa at the height of the conflict , came out last year and was followed this year by martin baer 's film " white ghosts , " a documentary also looking at the plight of the herero . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the house of world cultures is looking at the legacy of colonialism .
on thursday , the house of world cultures -lrb- haus der kulturen der welt -rrb- in berlin will launch a major multi-disciplinary exhibition entitled " black atlantic " , that - among other things , will look at the legacy of colonial occupation , including that undertaken by germany .
capping things off , an anti-colonialism conference is scheduled to take place in berlin in november . the issue of germany 's colonial legacy has gone beyond the halls of academia , where a few experts debated its significance in relative obscurity , and into the realm of popular culture .
in the process , some say germany is shedding its colonial amnesia . what took so long ? in critically examining its colonial past , germany is following a trend already evident in other former colonial powers .
the question is , what took germany so long ? " when it comes to questions of guilt and responsibility , the germans are simply tired , " gerhard seyfried , author of the novel " herero " , told dw-world , referring to the arduous task of working through the legacy of nazi atrocities . colonial history greatly interested germans before the war , but was simply eclipsed by subsequent events , seyfried said . pascal grosse , a historian who has written extensively on the subject and will participate in a panel discussion on the topic in conjunction with the " black atlantic " exhibition in berlin , concurred . " the scale of the holocaust overshadowed previous events , " he told dw-world . but with an ever-more interconnected world resulting from globalization , germans , like others in different countries , are increasingly interested in their role in the world - both past and present , grosse said . a century later , some debate relevance but that said , what purpose does dredging up events so far in the past serve ? " we need to look at this material again and again , it 's never enough to say we 've done that , let 's move on , " shaheen merali , a curator who put together the visual arts component of the " black atlantic " exhibition told dw-world . for seyfried , such critical self reflection of colonial atrocities serves the same purpose similar reflection on world war ii-era crimes does . " we must learn from history , " he said . kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany urges herero to drop lawsuit germany 's ambassador to namibia has called on the herero people to drop a $ 4 billion -lrb- € 3.3 billion -rrb- lawsuit filed three years ago in us courts for atrocities committed under colonial rule .

" an inter-ministerial group will be charged with evaluating the losses suffered by poland as a result of world war ii , " the polish foreign minister said tuesday following a government meeting to examine a controversial parliament resolution last week that called for war reparations from germany .
cimoszewicz said the exercise was purely intended to provide a " reminder of the causes and effects of war , " and reiterated the government 's refusal to seek reparations from berlin .
" our intention is not linked to any demand for compensation , " he said .
" it is a case of illustrating and reminding those who may have forgotten about world war ii and its consequences . "
" it is perhaps such forgetfulness that has led to demands for compensation from us , " he added , in reference to a series of recent claims for restitution of property seized from germans forced to flee poland after 1945 .
cimoszewicz added that the government would " work out provisions to support its citizens if they were brought before the courts over a claim for compensation . "
" the question of compensation on either side is closed , " he said , while calling for a " stronger dialogue " to prevent the debate between warsaw and berlin from " veering in the wrong direction . "

" an inter-ministerial group will be charged with evaluating the losses suffered by poland as a result of world war ii , " the polish foreign minister said tuesday following a government meeting to examine a controversial parliament resolution last week that called for war reparations from germany .
cimoszewicz said the exercise was purely intended to provide a " reminder of the causes and effects of war , " and reiterated the government 's refusal to seek reparations from berlin .
" our intention is not linked to any demand for compensation , " he said .
" it is a case of illustrating and reminding those who may have forgotten about world war ii and its consequences . "
" it is perhaps such forgetfulness that has led to demands for compensation from us , " he added , in reference to a series of recent claims for restitution of property seized from germans forced to flee poland after 1945 .
cimoszewicz added that the government would " work out provisions to support its citizens if they were brought before the courts over a claim for compensation . "
" the question of compensation on either side is closed , " he said , while calling for a " stronger dialogue " to prevent the debate between warsaw and berlin from " veering in the wrong direction . "
restitution tug-of-war polish lawmakers last friday voted unanimously , with one abstention , for a resolution calling on germany to pay for war damages - drawing an embarrassed reaction from the government in warsaw and a firm rebuttal from berlin .

the move was seen as a tit-for-tat response to a series of claims by german civilians seeking compensation for property lost after poland 's borders shifted westwards in 1945 and they were expelled from the newly re-drawn state .
but jozef oleksy , the speaker of the polish parliament , said on wednesday that the resolution demanding compensation was in fact aimed at prodding the european union over regional aid for poland . oleksy said the demand " is aimed at the eu as a reminder -lrb- of poland 's losses -rrb- when it comes to hand out regional fund and aid money .

they also demanded that the german government of social democrats and greens finally depart from what they described as an economic and social zigzag course . the industry associations in eastern germany say the current debate about equal living standards in the two halves of the reunited country wo n't serve as an excuse to do nothing about the current discrepancies . but in a statement issued in berlin , walter botschatzki , the president of the business associations in the eastern state of thuringia , said the east remains grateful for the billions of euros in western aid it has received and will continue to receive in the framework of a solidarity pact geared to making the east more competitive . he warned though that the current social and economic woes in the east are being misused by both left and right-wing forces to push their own agenda for next weekend 's regional elections in the states of brandenburg and saxony . achievements should be recognized " the enormous achievements that the whole country has recorded in the east ’ s economic recovery over the past 15 years are being belittled on purpose by some forces in our society , " botschatzki told dw-radio .
" let ’ s not forget that eastern germany now has an extremely modern transport and telecommunications infrastructure .
there are also very competitive clusters of industry in the east , like the semi-conductor centers in dresden or the automobile industry in leipzig . " botschatzki also spoke of the big strides which have been made in the metal-working and electronics industries in the east .
following a downturn in productivity in the period before 1997 , he said the past seven years had seen an enormous upswing in these sectors , creating more than 50,000 jobs across the east . he added that much more could be achieved with clear political signals from berlin .
easterners , he claimed , had proven in the past that they were willing to take their share of reforms , as long as those reforms made sense to them . people need faith in reforms " the current political zig-zag course , the lack of real reform prospects and the poor communication of reform efforts by the government have resulted in more and more people feeling insecure , " botschatzki said .
" confidence and faith in the government ’ s policies is decreasing , and that leads in the end to less stability in our democratic system . " botschatzki added that right after german unification in 1990 , easterners had hoped that living standards across the country would level out within 10 years or so .
they now had to accept that this was wishful thinking .
the same applied to their hopes for equal wages . klaus von dohnanyi , who was commissioned by the government to work out a more effective economic program for the east , says people have to face current realities . they 'll have to accept new low-wage employment opportunities rather than going on the dole . " we have new competition also from eastern europe and must see that these people in east germany are capable of making a living , " he said .
" and therefore we discuss the earned tax credit systems in the united states , for example , something we should add to the wages to remain competitive and at the same time have adequate living in the relatively high cost country germany . " von dohnanyi has explicitly supported president köhler 's recent statement that equal living conditions will not be achieved . he said the man had the courage to speak the truth rather than stooping to populist formulas which didn ’ t help anyone in the country .
president köhler continues to draw massive criticism from predominantly eastern policy-makers for saying that equal living standards are nothing but a myth . hardy graupner -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a land of differences while the core of german president horst köhler 's remarks on differences in living and employment standards focused on eastern and western states , figures published on tuesday show discrepencies across the whole country .

they also demanded that the german government of social democrats and greens finally depart from what they described as an economic and social zigzag course . the industry associations in eastern germany say the current debate about equal living standards in the two halves of the reunited country wo n't serve as an excuse to do nothing about the current discrepancies . but in a statement issued in berlin , walter botschatzki , the president of the business associations in the eastern state of thuringia , said the east remains grateful for the billions of euros in western aid it has received and will continue to receive in the framework of a solidarity pact geared to making the east more competitive . he warned though that the current social and economic woes in the east are being misused by both left and right-wing forces to push their own agenda for next weekend 's regional elections in the states of brandenburg and saxony . achievements should be recognized " the enormous achievements that the whole country has recorded in the east ’ s economic recovery over the past 15 years are being belittled on purpose by some forces in our society , " botschatzki told dw-radio .
" let ’ s not forget that eastern germany now has an extremely modern transport and telecommunications infrastructure .
there are also very competitive clusters of industry in the east , like the semi-conductor centers in dresden or the automobile industry in leipzig . " botschatzki also spoke of the big strides which have been made in the metal-working and electronics industries in the east .
following a downturn in productivity in the period before 1997 , he said the past seven years had seen an enormous upswing in these sectors , creating more than 50,000 jobs across the east . he added that much more could be achieved with clear political signals from berlin .
easterners , he claimed , had proven in the past that they were willing to take their share of reforms , as long as those reforms made sense to them . people need faith in reforms " the current political zig-zag course , the lack of real reform prospects and the poor communication of reform efforts by the government have resulted in more and more people feeling insecure , " botschatzki said .
" confidence and faith in the government ’ s policies is decreasing , and that leads in the end to less stability in our democratic system . " botschatzki added that right after german unification in 1990 , easterners had hoped that living standards across the country would level out within 10 years or so .
they now had to accept that this was wishful thinking .
the same applied to their hopes for equal wages . klaus von dohnanyi , who was commissioned by the government to work out a more effective economic program for the east , says people have to face current realities . they 'll have to accept new low-wage employment opportunities rather than going on the dole . " we have new competition also from eastern europe and must see that these people in east germany are capable of making a living , " he said .
" and therefore we discuss the earned tax credit systems in the united states , for example , something we should add to the wages to remain competitive and at the same time have adequate living in the relatively high cost country germany . " von dohnanyi has explicitly supported president köhler 's recent statement that equal living conditions will not be achieved . he said the man had the courage to speak the truth rather than stooping to populist formulas which didn ’ t help anyone in the country .
president köhler continues to draw massive criticism from predominantly eastern policy-makers for saying that equal living standards are nothing but a myth . hardy graupner -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a land of differences while the core of german president horst köhler 's remarks on differences in living and employment standards focused on eastern and western states , figures published on tuesday show discrepencies across the whole country .

after getting bad grades from the oecd , german politicians are calling for extensive reforms of the nation 's schools .
it 's not enough to spend more money , the education system needs to be completely re-worked , they said . a day after germany brought home failing grades from the organization for economic cooperation and development for its education system , the nation 's politicians responded like worried parents .
it was the second time in two years that the country , which prides itself on producing some of the world 's leading philosophers and scientists , had received negative marks for government spending , number of hours spent in the classroom and pupil-teacher ratios .
on wednesday , education experts in the government coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens minced no words in calling on germany to prepare itself better for the future .
in addition to increasing much-needed government investment in the education system -lrb- only about 9.7 percent of total spending goes towards schools -rrb- , the politicians called for far-reaching reforms of the nation 's traditional school structure .
school for all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teachers need to spend more time with each pupil in the elementary schools .
krista sager , parliamentary fraction leader for the greens , told the berliner zeitung germany needed to move away from its three-tiered school model and introduce " a school for all , " where pupils would stay together in one system for nine or ten years .
the current division into three different schools , each tailored to specific education abilities and skills , is " more befitting of a medieval feudal system than a modern society , " criticized christoph matschie , head of the spd for the eastern state of thuringia .
a general school for all pupils is better equipped for promoting common education standards than a system that " sorts " children at an early age according to their abilities , explained the former state secretary for the education ministry .
matschie told the paper that the traditional division into college-prep highschool , secondary school and vocational school , was partially to blame for the poor results in the oecd study .
pupils performed better when they learned together , he and sager argued .
schleswig-holstein 's state minister for culture and education was also convinced that the three-tiered education system is no longer beneficial to the country .
ute erdsiek-rave said her party of social democrats would campaign together with the greens during the next state election for a reform that supports a " school for all . "
however , a complete revamping of the school system would take between 10 and 15 years , she admitted .
more financial support needed opposition leader angela merkel dismissed calls to introduce such far-reaching reforms .
the head of the conservative christian democrats union said the oecd in no way implied that germany 's traditional three-tiered school model was to blame for failures in german education .
the international study indicated specifically that germany had done too little to improve standards in kindergartens and elementary schools , she argued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a typical german classroom ?
germany 's problems were largely the result of large classrooms and too little instruction time , she said , both of which could be rectified with more investment .
the pupil-teacher ratio needs to be improved , merkel said , pointing to the statistic that germany had 24 pupils per teacher in elementary schools , the highest number among the 30 industrial countries surveyed .
t with a view to government plans to expand the number of all-day schools , merkel said germany was on the right road to increasing the amount of time children spend in the classroom .
the oecd study showed that german pupils aged seven and eight attend school on average for 626 hours a year , compared with 788 on average in the oecd .
germany needs to invest more in building all-day schools , she said and called for a speedy introduction of tax reforms that would open up more funds for education .
money is not the answer " we must once and for all start investing in the education system , " merkel told rbb information radio on wednesday .
but the head of the german union for teachers and researchers , eva-maria stange , cautioned against thinking only in terms of financial support .
german politicians needed to " do their homework , " she said .
the oecd report clearly showed " german schools need not just more money , but fundamental reforms . " dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bad grades for german schools germany ’ s school system has gotten bad marks yet again .

after getting bad grades from the oecd , german politicians are calling for extensive reforms of the nation 's schools .
it 's not enough to spend more money , the education system needs to be completely re-worked , they said . a day after germany brought home failing grades from the organization for economic cooperation and development for its education system , the nation 's politicians responded like worried parents .
it was the second time in two years that the country , which prides itself on producing some of the world 's leading philosophers and scientists , had received negative marks for government spending , number of hours spent in the classroom and pupil-teacher ratios .
on wednesday , education experts in the government coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens minced no words in calling on germany to prepare itself better for the future .
in addition to increasing much-needed government investment in the education system -lrb- only about 9.7 percent of total spending goes towards schools -rrb- , the politicians called for far-reaching reforms of the nation 's traditional school structure .
school for all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teachers need to spend more time with each pupil in the elementary schools .
krista sager , parliamentary fraction leader for the greens , told the berliner zeitung germany needed to move away from its three-tiered school model and introduce " a school for all , " where pupils would stay together in one system for nine or ten years .
the current division into three different schools , each tailored to specific education abilities and skills , is " more befitting of a medieval feudal system than a modern society , " criticized christoph matschie , head of the spd for the eastern state of thuringia .
a general school for all pupils is better equipped for promoting common education standards than a system that " sorts " children at an early age according to their abilities , explained the former state secretary for the education ministry .
matschie told the paper that the traditional division into college-prep highschool , secondary school and vocational school , was partially to blame for the poor results in the oecd study .
pupils performed better when they learned together , he and sager argued .
schleswig-holstein 's state minister for culture and education was also convinced that the three-tiered education system is no longer beneficial to the country .
ute erdsiek-rave said her party of social democrats would campaign together with the greens during the next state election for a reform that supports a " school for all . "
however , a complete revamping of the school system would take between 10 and 15 years , she admitted .
more financial support needed opposition leader angela merkel dismissed calls to introduce such far-reaching reforms .
the head of the conservative christian democrats union said the oecd in no way implied that germany 's traditional three-tiered school model was to blame for failures in german education .
the international study indicated specifically that germany had done too little to improve standards in kindergartens and elementary schools , she argued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a typical german classroom ?
germany 's problems were largely the result of large classrooms and too little instruction time , she said , both of which could be rectified with more investment .
the pupil-teacher ratio needs to be improved , merkel said , pointing to the statistic that germany had 24 pupils per teacher in elementary schools , the highest number among the 30 industrial countries surveyed .
t with a view to government plans to expand the number of all-day schools , merkel said germany was on the right road to increasing the amount of time children spend in the classroom .
the oecd study showed that german pupils aged seven and eight attend school on average for 626 hours a year , compared with 788 on average in the oecd .
germany needs to invest more in building all-day schools , she said and called for a speedy introduction of tax reforms that would open up more funds for education .
money is not the answer " we must once and for all start investing in the education system , " merkel told rbb information radio on wednesday .

young germans have long labored under the weight of guilt from the nation 's past but have recently pushed for more pride in their country .
however , pro-german lyrics in pop songs are causing concern . germany 's gradual relaxation towards its national identity is causing concern among recording artists and musicians as an increasing number of songs appearing in the pop charts seem to contain lyrics which could be misconstrued as nationalist . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul van dyk for months , the single " we " has been riding high in the german charts .
a collaboration between techno dj paul van dyk -lrb- photo -rrb- and wolfsheim singer peter heppner , the song proudly recounts german post-war history with lyrics such as " i ask myself who we are .
we are we .
divided , defeated but , nevertheless , in the end , we 're still alive . " the song is accompanied by a video that contains images of women rebuilding bombed cities with their bare hands and amputee soldiers returning from the war . " we " portrays germans as victims in a land split between the allies and its people humiliated .
but there is no mention of the war , of the holocaust or the third reich .
instead the song celebrates the german success history : the reconstruction , the miracle of bern and the reunification . it is , essentially , a love song to germany . no more shame over nationality another example comes from the group mia in the song " it is what it is . "
front woman mieze sings about german pride and the creation of the national colors displayed in the post-war flag : " a gulp of the black coffee wakes me up , your red mouth touches me gently , at this moment , it clicks and the yellow sun rises , " referring to the colors in germany 's national flag : black , red and gold . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mieze and other mia members in a publicity shot mieze later sings about the rejection of past generations and the embracing of a new german identity : " if anyone asks me now where i come from , i no longer feel sorry for myself … i risk it all for love , i feel ready . " such words and images are making some people uncomfortable .
germans have struggled for years with the weight of guilt associated with the nation 's record in two world wars but younger generations have begun to reclaim german identity and move on from the crimes of the past to take pride in their country . target audience rich pickings for neo-nazis but some commentators see a danger in popular music becoming the voice of a new german pride , fearing it could be hijacked by far right organizations and used as nationalist propaganda in a market targeted at a young , impressionable record buying public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazi demonstrators anetta kahane of the amadeu antonio foundation , a group based in berlin which promotes democratic initiatives to resist right wing extremism , views the development in german pop music with concern . " far right organizations think this is great , " she said .
" they rightly perceive this as national pride suddenly becoming something normal . " far-right groups use music 's influence the reactions of the neo-nazis show that kahane is right .
the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- mouthpiece national voice wrote that mia stands up for a " relaxed attitude to its own nation . "
mia 's attitude has " scratched out " the left-wing supremacy in german youth , wrote the paper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rammstein flirtations with the far-right are not a new phenomenon .
groups such as rammstein -lrb- photo -rrb- and , more specifically , böhse onkelz which made no secret the fact that it was a part of the german skinhead scene in the 1980s and published songs with titles like " turks out " and " germany for the germans , " were championed by neo-nazis but have since renounced their right-wing leanings . mia on the other hand keeps pointing out that they do not want to be associated with rightwing extremists .
they add that they simply want to help jump-start a discussion about german identity . but musicians can not choose their fans : at a mia concert in the western german town of bielefeld , three rightwing extremists attacked a dark-skinned student , according to local news reports .
organizers of another festival at which mia was scheduled to appear asked the band 's management to comment on the incident .

young germans have long labored under the weight of guilt from the nation 's past but have recently pushed for more pride in their country .
however , pro-german lyrics in pop songs are causing concern . germany 's gradual relaxation towards its national identity is causing concern among recording artists and musicians as an increasing number of songs appearing in the pop charts seem to contain lyrics which could be misconstrued as nationalist . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul van dyk for months , the single " we " has been riding high in the german charts .
a collaboration between techno dj paul van dyk -lrb- photo -rrb- and wolfsheim singer peter heppner , the song proudly recounts german post-war history with lyrics such as " i ask myself who we are .
we are we .
divided , defeated but , nevertheless , in the end , we 're still alive . " the song is accompanied by a video that contains images of women rebuilding bombed cities with their bare hands and amputee soldiers returning from the war . " we " portrays germans as victims in a land split between the allies and its people humiliated .
but there is no mention of the war , of the holocaust or the third reich .
instead the song celebrates the german success history : the reconstruction , the miracle of bern and the reunification . it is , essentially , a love song to germany . no more shame over nationality another example comes from the group mia in the song " it is what it is . "
front woman mieze sings about german pride and the creation of the national colors displayed in the post-war flag : " a gulp of the black coffee wakes me up , your red mouth touches me gently , at this moment , it clicks and the yellow sun rises , " referring to the colors in germany 's national flag : black , red and gold . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mieze and other mia members in a publicity shot mieze later sings about the rejection of past generations and the embracing of a new german identity : " if anyone asks me now where i come from , i no longer feel sorry for myself … i risk it all for love , i feel ready . " such words and images are making some people uncomfortable .
germans have struggled for years with the weight of guilt associated with the nation 's record in two world wars but younger generations have begun to reclaim german identity and move on from the crimes of the past to take pride in their country . target audience rich pickings for neo-nazis but some commentators see a danger in popular music becoming the voice of a new german pride , fearing it could be hijacked by far right organizations and used as nationalist propaganda in a market targeted at a young , impressionable record buying public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazi demonstrators anetta kahane of the amadeu antonio foundation , a group based in berlin which promotes democratic initiatives to resist right wing extremism , views the development in german pop music with concern .

the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- mouthpiece national voice wrote that mia stands up for a " relaxed attitude to its own nation . "
mia 's attitude has " scratched out " the left-wing supremacy in german youth , wrote the paper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rammstein flirtations with the far-right are not a new phenomenon .
groups such as rammstein -lrb- photo -rrb- and , more specifically , böhse onkelz which made no secret the fact that it was a part of the german skinhead scene in the 1980s and published songs with titles like " turks out " and " germany for the germans , " were championed by neo-nazis but have since renounced their right-wing leanings . mia on the other hand keeps pointing out that they do not want to be associated with rightwing extremists .
they add that they simply want to help jump-start a discussion about german identity . but musicians can not choose their fans : at a mia concert in the western german town of bielefeld , three rightwing extremists attacked a dark-skinned student , according to local news reports .

however , pro-german lyrics in pop songs are causing concern . germany 's gradual relaxation towards its national identity is causing concern among recording artists and musicians as an increasing number of songs appearing in the pop charts seem to contain lyrics which could be misconstrued as nationalist . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul van dyk for months , the single " we " has been riding high in the german charts .
a collaboration between techno dj paul van dyk -lrb- photo -rrb- and wolfsheim singer peter heppner , the song proudly recounts german post-war history with lyrics such as " i ask myself who we are .
we are we .
divided , defeated but , nevertheless , in the end , we 're still alive . " the song is accompanied by a video that contains images of women rebuilding bombed cities with their bare hands and amputee soldiers returning from the war . " we " portrays germans as victims in a land split between the allies and its people humiliated .
but there is no mention of the war , of the holocaust or the third reich .
instead the song celebrates the german success history : the reconstruction , the miracle of bern and the reunification . it is , essentially , a love song to germany . no more shame over nationality another example comes from the group mia in the song " it is what it is . "
front woman mieze sings about german pride and the creation of the national colors displayed in the post-war flag : " a gulp of the black coffee wakes me up , your red mouth touches me gently , at this moment , it clicks and the yellow sun rises , " referring to the colors in germany 's national flag : black , red and gold . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mieze and other mia members in a publicity shot mieze later sings about the rejection of past generations and the embracing of a new german identity : " if anyone asks me now where i come from , i no longer feel sorry for myself … i risk it all for love , i feel ready .

now , a recent spate of books , films , and exhibitions is taking a critical look at this chapter - and making it a matter of debate . england , france and belgium are among the countries most often mentioned when historians consider europe 's colonial history and its related atrocities .
lesser known , however , is the fact that for 20 years , between 1884 and 1914 , germany lorded over its own swaths of the african continent , including areas of what are today namibia , cameroon , togo , rwanda and burundi . in fact , the infamous congo conference , where european colonial interests divided-up africa and its natural resources , took place in berlin in 1884 .
and though germany only managed to hold onto its share for two decades , it certainly wracked up a record of carnage on par with that of better-known colonial powers . despite these uncomfortable facts , this historical chapter has been all but forgotten by the german public .
now , a spate of new books , films , exhibitions and conferences - all coinciding with the 100th anniversary of two of germany 's most bloody african episodes - are making it a matter of public debate .
for a country already fatigued by efforts to come to terms with the atrocities of world war ii , that 's quite an accomplishment . a short and violent occupation the brief 20 years germany controlled parts of west and east africa were not peaceful .
in 1904 in the german territory of south west africa , today namibia , german troops led by general lothar von trotha mercilessly put down a rebellion of the indigenous herero people . by the time the conflict ended four years later , between 45,000 to 65,000 herero were killed , many of whom suffered in work camps some consider the forerunners to wwii-era concentration camps . a year later , in the german held south east africa , today tanzania , the so-called maji-maji war broke out .
there , the local population also rebelled against german rule and likewise suffered the consequences : an estimated 250,000 to 300,000 - one third of the total population - were killed . slow to offer an apology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on the anniversary of the massacre , a group of herero march to honor the dead .
with this year 's 100th anniversary of the atrocities in namibia and the upcoming 100th anniversary of the war in tanzania , the german government has been under added pressure to offer an official apology , which , much to the dismay of herero leaders , has been slow in coming . but in august at the anniversary event in namibia honoring the herero dead , german development and aid minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul came the closest yet any german official has ever gotten to those magic words . " we germans accept our historic and moral responsibility and the guilt incurred by germans , " she told a delighted crowd of more than 1,000 people . " the atrocities committed at that time would have been termed genocide , " she added . however , she ruled out financial compensation for the victims ' descendents ; there is an ongoing lawsuit seeking € 3.3 billion -lrb- $ 4 billion -rrb- in damages . books , exhibitions remind a reluctant public with that historic statement , the german government showed its willingness to take on board yet another difficult chapter in the country 's history .
the general public - with the help of several recent books , films and exhibitions , all addressing the subject - is following suit . gerhard seyfried 's book " herero , " a novel written from the point of view of a young german sent to the western region of africa at the height of the conflict , came out last year and was followed this year by martin baer 's film " white ghosts , " a documentary also looking at the plight of the herero . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the house of world cultures is looking at the legacy of colonialism .
on thursday , the house of world cultures -lrb- haus der kulturen der welt -rrb- in berlin will launch a major multi-disciplinary exhibition entitled " black atlantic " , that - among other things , will look at the legacy of colonial occupation , including that undertaken by germany .
capping things off , an anti-colonialism conference is scheduled to take place in berlin in november . the issue of germany 's colonial legacy has gone beyond the halls of academia , where a few experts debated its significance in relative obscurity , and into the realm of popular culture .
in the process , some say germany is shedding its colonial amnesia . what took so long ? in critically examining its colonial past , germany is following a trend already evident in other former colonial powers .
the question is , what took germany so long ? " when it comes to questions of guilt and responsibility , the germans are simply tired , " gerhard seyfried , author of the novel " herero " , told dw-world , referring to the arduous task of working through the legacy of nazi atrocities . colonial history greatly interested germans before the war , but was simply eclipsed by subsequent events , seyfried said . pascal grosse , a historian who has written extensively on the subject and will participate in a panel discussion on the topic in conjunction with the " black atlantic " exhibition in berlin , concurred . " the scale of the holocaust overshadowed previous events , " he told dw-world . but with an ever-more interconnected world resulting from globalization , germans , like others in different countries , are increasingly interested in their role in the world - both past and present , grosse said . a century later , some debate relevance but that said , what purpose does dredging up events so far in the past serve ? " we need to look at this material again and again , it 's never enough to say we 've done that , let 's move on , " shaheen merali , a curator who put together the visual arts component of the " black atlantic " exhibition told dw-world . for seyfried , such critical self reflection of colonial atrocities serves the same purpose similar reflection on world war ii-era crimes does .

he 's accompanied by a delegation of business and science leaders pushing for deeper economic and political ties . schröder is visiting hungary on the occasion of the 15th anniversary of the date hungary opened its borders to east germans and allowed them to leave to the west - a development that created an extremely positive new dimension in west germany 's ties with the then-eastern bloc nation .
earlier this year , former german president johannes rau spoke of the importance of that development during a visit to budapest .
" we owe an awful lot to hungary ...
if hungary had n't shut off its electrical fence on may 2 , 1989 , which allowed many from the ddr to come to west germany , the developments in prague on sept .
20 would n't have happened and the -lrb- berlin -rrb- wall would n't have fallen on nov .
9 , " rau said .
" in some respects , the hungarians were the intiators of german unity . "
for a long time , the magyars would have been thankful for a few handouts from germany .
but the burdens of german unity and the costs of rebuilding the east german infrastructure left little room for german financial aid to the hungarians .
a visit with new prime minister designate still , relations between the two countries have developed positively .
there are no major sticking points between the countries , and schröder can look forward to a relaxing trip aimed at deepening the countries ' political , economic and scientific cooperation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- right -rrb- , and outgoing hungarian prime minister peter medgyessy schröder will be meeting with outgoing hungarian prime minister peter medgyessy , who announced his resignation in august following a government coalition crisis , as well as his nominated successor , ferenc gyurcsany .
the 43-year-old shooting star of the socialists is expected to be confirmed as prime minister by parliament at the end of the month .
like the political developments between germany and hungary , business ties are also both strong and dynamic .
currently , germany is hungary 's most-important trading partner - a position that could further grow with hungary 's european union membership , which came into effect on may 1 .
germany is also an important foreign investor in hungary .
since 1989 , german companies have invested over € 12 billion -lrb- $ 14.6 billion -rrb- in hungary , representing 55 percent of all foreign investment and creating more than 200,000 jobs .
hungary has an abundance of red tape nevertheless , german companies do n't shy away from the fact that hungary has become less attractive for business .
the country has continually failed in efforts to trim red tape , and there is also a lack of educated workers .
additionally , salaries have risen by 50 percent since 2002 and the exchange of hungary 's currency , the forint , has been a roller coaster ride since june 2003 .
worse yet , contradictory statements about the country 's currency exchange rates and inflation goals and a lax fiscal policy have engendered considerable uncertainty .
but these facts have not been lost on gyurcsany , who has said making hungary more attractive to foreign investors will be a priority .
" in my opinion , it 's important that the country 's economic policy reflect stability and calm so that hungary can continue to be a goal for foreign investors , " he said .
despite some tougher times in recent months , most of the 54 german companies active there are satisfied with hungary as a place for doing business .
indeed , many are planning additional investments - a good basis for deepening economic ties between the two countries .
and on his visit on wednesday , schröder will make that his priority . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hungary mulls future of nuclear energy hungary has been a proponent of nuclear energy for decades .

one of them is the müritz national park in mecklenburg-western pomerania . the landscape formed 10,000 years ago by the ice age belongs today to the most beautiful areas in the northeastern germany .
over 1000 sparkling blue and immaculate-clean lakes are surrounded by forests and open country side . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : picnic on lake müritz the biggest lakes in this area are next to the müritz lake plauer , lake fleesen and lake kölpen . müritz is a slavic word and means little sea .
lake müritz is 117 square kilometers -lrb- 45.2 square miles -rrb- big , 23 kilometers -lrb- 14.3 miles -rrb- wide and 29 kilometers long .
almost a jungle the müritz national park is half way between hamburg and berlin .
the 322 square kilometer big park consists mostly of forests and water .
when taking a journey through the park , one realizes quickly that the word natural stems indeed from the word nature - the green paradise resembles a jungle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müritz-steam ship the so-called developing zone comprises the biggest part of the national park .
this means that in that zone as little as possible is intervened with nature , giving nature the chance to mature in the course of time to an important completely untouched core zone .
however , much attention is devoted to eco tourism in order to make this unique nature heritage accessible to the general public . bird watching the national park is most notably famous for its white-tailed-eagles , ospreys and cranes .
the cranes -lrb- a species that has almost died out -rrb- are a living proof of the faultless nature .
observing the white-tailed-eagles in their nests is a truly unique experience . a camera , focused on the nest , makes it possible to follow every movement of the raptors and their babies on a television set in the national park information center .
such a close up view in the daily lives of the eagles would otherwise not be possible . mobile without boundaries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müritz national park the best way to discover the müritz national park is by bike .
however , walks , boat trips or horse rides offer great alternatives .
the priesterbäckersee is definitely worth a visit .
a long moor catwalk leads you to this beautiful lake which forms part of the many lakes in this area and from which the water lilies can be marvelled at best . because of the rising number of visitors the national park arranged for a so-called visitor-control device to keep its original beauty intact .
when entering the park , visitors are informed on how to use the park ’ s facilities .
national park tickets come in handy .
buses , ships and canoes provide an excellent transportation net .
moreover , bikers can take their bikes on the national park lanes for free . flora , fauna and geology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boathouses on lake müritz the city of waren , close to the national park , acts as a tourist center .
the natural history müritz museum there is worthwhile visiting .
during the exhibitions information on the flora , fauna and geology of the region are given and a cultural-historic link to mecklenburg-western pomerania is drawn . elke roessler -lrb- wo -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schorfheide-chorin : environmental protection and economic development the biosphere reserve schorfheide-chorin is located in the scarcely populated area of the former east germany known as the uckermark .

there , the local population also rebelled against german rule and likewise suffered the consequences : an estimated 250,000 to 300,000 - one third of the total population - were killed . slow to offer an apology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on the anniversary of the massacre , a group of herero march to honor the dead .
with this year 's 100th anniversary of the atrocities in namibia and the upcoming 100th anniversary of the war in tanzania , the german government has been under added pressure to offer an official apology , which , much to the dismay of herero leaders , has been slow in coming . but in august at the anniversary event in namibia honoring the herero dead , german development and aid minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul came the closest yet any german official has ever gotten to those magic words . " we germans accept our historic and moral responsibility and the guilt incurred by germans , " she told a delighted crowd of more than 1,000 people . " the atrocities committed at that time would have been termed genocide , " she added . however , she ruled out financial compensation for the victims ' descendents ; there is an ongoing lawsuit seeking € 3.3 billion -lrb- $ 4 billion -rrb- in damages . books , exhibitions remind a reluctant public with that historic statement , the german government showed its willingness to take on board yet another difficult chapter in the country 's history .
the general public - with the help of several recent books , films and exhibitions , all addressing the subject - is following suit . gerhard seyfried 's book " herero , " a novel written from the point of view of a young german sent to the western region of africa at the height of the conflict , came out last year and was followed this year by martin baer 's film " white ghosts , " a documentary also looking at the plight of the herero . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the house of world cultures is looking at the legacy of colonialism .
on thursday , the house of world cultures -lrb- haus der kulturen der welt -rrb- in berlin will launch a major multi-disciplinary exhibition entitled " black atlantic " , that - among other things , will look at the legacy of colonial occupation , including that undertaken by germany .
capping things off , an anti-colonialism conference is scheduled to take place in berlin in november . the issue of germany 's colonial legacy has gone beyond the halls of academia , where a few experts debated its significance in relative obscurity , and into the realm of popular culture .
in the process , some say germany is shedding its colonial amnesia . what took so long ? in critically examining its colonial past , germany is following a trend already evident in other former colonial powers .
the question is , what took germany so long ? " when it comes to questions of guilt and responsibility , the germans are simply tired , " gerhard seyfried , author of the novel " herero " , told dw-world , referring to the arduous task of working through the legacy of nazi atrocities . colonial history greatly interested germans before the war , but was simply eclipsed by subsequent events , seyfried said . pascal grosse , a historian who has written extensively on the subject and will participate in a panel discussion on the topic in conjunction with the " black atlantic " exhibition in berlin , concurred . " the scale of the holocaust overshadowed previous events , " he told dw-world . but with an ever-more interconnected world resulting from globalization , germans , like others in different countries , are increasingly interested in their role in the world - both past and present , grosse said . a century later , some debate relevance but that said , what purpose does dredging up events so far in the past serve ? " we need to look at this material again and again , it 's never enough to say we 've done that , let 's move on , " shaheen merali , a curator who put together the visual arts component of the " black atlantic " exhibition told dw-world . for seyfried , such critical self reflection of colonial atrocities serves the same purpose similar reflection on world war ii-era crimes does . " we must learn from history , " he said . kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany urges herero to drop lawsuit germany 's ambassador to namibia has called on the herero people to drop a $ 4 billion -lrb- € 3.3 billion -rrb- lawsuit filed three years ago in us courts for atrocities committed under colonial rule .

one of them is the müritz national park in mecklenburg-western pomerania . the landscape formed 10,000 years ago by the ice age belongs today to the most beautiful areas in the northeastern germany .
over 1000 sparkling blue and immaculate-clean lakes are surrounded by forests and open country side . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : picnic on lake müritz the biggest lakes in this area are next to the müritz lake plauer , lake fleesen and lake kölpen . müritz is a slavic word and means little sea .
lake müritz is 117 square kilometers -lrb- 45.2 square miles -rrb- big , 23 kilometers -lrb- 14.3 miles -rrb- wide and 29 kilometers long .
almost a jungle the müritz national park is half way between hamburg and berlin .
the 322 square kilometer big park consists mostly of forests and water .
when taking a journey through the park , one realizes quickly that the word natural stems indeed from the word nature - the green paradise resembles a jungle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müritz-steam ship the so-called developing zone comprises the biggest part of the national park .
this means that in that zone as little as possible is intervened with nature , giving nature the chance to mature in the course of time to an important completely untouched core zone .
however , much attention is devoted to eco tourism in order to make this unique nature heritage accessible to the general public . bird watching the national park is most notably famous for its white-tailed-eagles , ospreys and cranes .
the cranes -lrb- a species that has almost died out -rrb- are a living proof of the faultless nature .
observing the white-tailed-eagles in their nests is a truly unique experience . a camera , focused on the nest , makes it possible to follow every movement of the raptors and their babies on a television set in the national park information center .
such a close up view in the daily lives of the eagles would otherwise not be possible . mobile without boundaries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müritz national park the best way to discover the müritz national park is by bike .
however , walks , boat trips or horse rides offer great alternatives .
the priesterbäckersee is definitely worth a visit .
a long moor catwalk leads you to this beautiful lake which forms part of the many lakes in this area and from which the water lilies can be marvelled at best . because of the rising number of visitors the national park arranged for a so-called visitor-control device to keep its original beauty intact .
when entering the park , visitors are informed on how to use the park ’ s facilities .
national park tickets come in handy .
buses , ships and canoes provide an excellent transportation net .
moreover , bikers can take their bikes on the national park lanes for free . flora , fauna and geology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boathouses on lake müritz the city of waren , close to the national park , acts as a tourist center .
the natural history müritz museum there is worthwhile visiting .
during the exhibitions information on the flora , fauna and geology of the region are given and a cultural-historic link to mecklenburg-western pomerania is drawn . elke roessler -lrb- wo -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schorfheide-chorin : environmental protection and economic development the biosphere reserve schorfheide-chorin is located in the scarcely populated area of the former east germany known as the uckermark .

" if the company is looking for a conflict , we are ready to back up our claims with protest action and warning strikes , " chief ig metall negotiator harmut meine told die welt newspaper ahead of the talks .

" we have not even started to negotiate and here comes a financial wizard from the management board who heats up the climate of negotiations with unnecessary chatter , " he said in reference to comments by chief financial officer hans-dieter pötsch . pötsch last week said about 30,000 jobs are at risk if wage negotiations end without cutting costs .

but from four percent to zero , they would really look funny , " tuchtfeld said . other analysts said the investor community has already factored into this year 's estimates for vw the possibility of output cuts as a result of strikes which ig metall might call to back its wage demands . abu dhabi deal fails in more bad news for volkswagen on wednesday , the company said that talks to sell a 9.8 percent stake in vw to an investment group from abu dhabi had been called off due to disagreement over the price .

after getting bad grades from the oecd , german politicians are calling for extensive reforms of the nation 's schools .
it 's not enough to spend more money , the education system needs to be completely re-worked , they said . a day after germany brought home failing grades from the organization for economic cooperation and development for its education system , the nation 's politicians responded like worried parents .
it was the second time in two years that the country , which prides itself on producing some of the world 's leading philosophers and scientists , had received negative marks for government spending , number of hours spent in the classroom and pupil-teacher ratios .
on wednesday , education experts in the government coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens minced no words in calling on germany to prepare itself better for the future .
in addition to increasing much-needed government investment in the education system -lrb- only about 9.7 percent of total spending goes towards schools -rrb- , the politicians called for far-reaching reforms of the nation 's traditional school structure .
school for all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teachers need to spend more time with each pupil in the elementary schools .
krista sager , parliamentary fraction leader for the greens , told the berliner zeitung germany needed to move away from its three-tiered school model and introduce " a school for all , " where pupils would stay together in one system for nine or ten years .
the current division into three different schools , each tailored to specific education abilities and skills , is " more befitting of a medieval feudal system than a modern society , " criticized christoph matschie , head of the spd for the eastern state of thuringia .
a general school for all pupils is better equipped for promoting common education standards than a system that " sorts " children at an early age according to their abilities , explained the former state secretary for the education ministry .
matschie told the paper that the traditional division into college-prep highschool , secondary school and vocational school , was partially to blame for the poor results in the oecd study .
pupils performed better when they learned together , he and sager argued .
schleswig-holstein 's state minister for culture and education was also convinced that the three-tiered education system is no longer beneficial to the country .
ute erdsiek-rave said her party of social democrats would campaign together with the greens during the next state election for a reform that supports a " school for all . "
however , a complete revamping of the school system would take between 10 and 15 years , she admitted .
more financial support needed opposition leader angela merkel dismissed calls to introduce such far-reaching reforms .
the head of the conservative christian democrats union said the oecd in no way implied that germany 's traditional three-tiered school model was to blame for failures in german education .
the international study indicated specifically that germany had done too little to improve standards in kindergartens and elementary schools , she argued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a typical german classroom ?
germany 's problems were largely the result of large classrooms and too little instruction time , she said , both of which could be rectified with more investment .
the pupil-teacher ratio needs to be improved , merkel said , pointing to the statistic that germany had 24 pupils per teacher in elementary schools , the highest number among the 30 industrial countries surveyed .
t with a view to government plans to expand the number of all-day schools , merkel said germany was on the right road to increasing the amount of time children spend in the classroom .
the oecd study showed that german pupils aged seven and eight attend school on average for 626 hours a year , compared with 788 on average in the oecd .
germany needs to invest more in building all-day schools , she said and called for a speedy introduction of tax reforms that would open up more funds for education .
money is not the answer " we must once and for all start investing in the education system , " merkel told rbb information radio on wednesday .
but the head of the german union for teachers and researchers , eva-maria stange , cautioned against thinking only in terms of financial support .
german politicians needed to " do their homework , " she said .
the oecd report clearly showed " german schools need not just more money , but fundamental reforms . " dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bad grades for german schools germany ’ s school system has gotten bad marks yet again .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.09.2004 eastern german industry calls for more optimism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern german success stories include dresden 's " silicon valley " industry leaders in eastern germany have called for full economic parity across the country to remain on track as concerns over east-west discrepencies continue . following controversial remarks by german president horst köhler that the country ’ s east will probably never reach western living standards , industry associations from the new federal states on tuesday issued an appeal which called on germans not to let full economic unity slip out of sight .
they also demanded that the german government of social democrats and greens finally depart from what they described as an economic and social zigzag course . the industry associations in eastern germany say the current debate about equal living standards in the two halves of the reunited country wo n't serve as an excuse to do nothing about the current discrepancies . but in a statement issued in berlin , walter botschatzki , the president of the business associations in the eastern state of thuringia , said the east remains grateful for the billions of euros in western aid it has received and will continue to receive in the framework of a solidarity pact geared to making the east more competitive . he warned though that the current social and economic woes in the east are being misused by both left and right-wing forces to push their own agenda for next weekend 's regional elections in the states of brandenburg and saxony . achievements should be recognized " the enormous achievements that the whole country has recorded in the east ’ s economic recovery over the past 15 years are being belittled on purpose by some forces in our society , " botschatzki told dw-radio .
" let ’ s not forget that eastern germany now has an extremely modern transport and telecommunications infrastructure .
there are also very competitive clusters of industry in the east , like the semi-conductor centers in dresden or the automobile industry in leipzig . " botschatzki also spoke of the big strides which have been made in the metal-working and electronics industries in the east .
following a downturn in productivity in the period before 1997 , he said the past seven years had seen an enormous upswing in these sectors , creating more than 50,000 jobs across the east . he added that much more could be achieved with clear political signals from berlin .
easterners , he claimed , had proven in the past that they were willing to take their share of reforms , as long as those reforms made sense to them . people need faith in reforms " the current political zig-zag course , the lack of real reform prospects and the poor communication of reform efforts by the government have resulted in more and more people feeling insecure , " botschatzki said .
" confidence and faith in the government ’ s policies is decreasing , and that leads in the end to less stability in our democratic system . " botschatzki added that right after german unification in 1990 , easterners had hoped that living standards across the country would level out within 10 years or so .
they now had to accept that this was wishful thinking .
the same applied to their hopes for equal wages . klaus von dohnanyi , who was commissioned by the government to work out a more effective economic program for the east , says people have to face current realities . they 'll have to accept new low-wage employment opportunities rather than going on the dole . " we have new competition also from eastern europe and must see that these people in east germany are capable of making a living , " he said .
" and therefore we discuss the earned tax credit systems in the united states , for example , something we should add to the wages to remain competitive and at the same time have adequate living in the relatively high cost country germany . " von dohnanyi has explicitly supported president köhler 's recent statement that equal living conditions will not be achieved . he said the man had the courage to speak the truth rather than stooping to populist formulas which didn ’ t help anyone in the country .
president köhler continues to draw massive criticism from predominantly eastern policy-makers for saying that equal living standards are nothing but a myth . hardy graupner -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a land of differences while the core of german president horst köhler 's remarks on differences in living and employment standards focused on eastern and western states , figures published on tuesday show discrepencies across the whole country .
-lrb- september 14 , 2004 -rrb- fewer germans protest against reforms tens of thousands of germans hit the streets again late monday , particularly in the poorer east , in protest against the government 's job market reforms , ahead of two key state elections this weekend .

" an inter-ministerial group will be charged with evaluating the losses suffered by poland as a result of world war ii , " the polish foreign minister said tuesday following a government meeting to examine a controversial parliament resolution last week that called for war reparations from germany .
cimoszewicz said the exercise was purely intended to provide a " reminder of the causes and effects of war , " and reiterated the government 's refusal to seek reparations from berlin .
" our intention is not linked to any demand for compensation , " he said .
" it is a case of illustrating and reminding those who may have forgotten about world war ii and its consequences . "
" it is perhaps such forgetfulness that has led to demands for compensation from us , " he added , in reference to a series of recent claims for restitution of property seized from germans forced to flee poland after 1945 .
cimoszewicz added that the government would " work out provisions to support its citizens if they were brought before the courts over a claim for compensation . "
" the question of compensation on either side is closed , " he said , while calling for a " stronger dialogue " to prevent the debate between warsaw and berlin from " veering in the wrong direction . "
restitution tug-of-war polish lawmakers last friday voted unanimously , with one abstention , for a resolution calling on germany to pay for war damages - drawing an embarrassed reaction from the government in warsaw and a firm rebuttal from berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder , left , alexander kwasniewski .
the move was seen as a tit-for-tat response to a series of claims by german civilians seeking compensation for property lost after poland 's borders shifted westwards in 1945 and they were expelled from the newly re-drawn state .
but jozef oleksy , the speaker of the polish parliament , said on wednesday that the resolution demanding compensation was in fact aimed at prodding the european union over regional aid for poland . oleksy said the demand " is aimed at the eu as a reminder -lrb- of poland 's losses -rrb- when it comes to hand out regional fund and aid money .
it could lead to particular goodwill -lrb- on the part of the eu -rrb- to help us regain lost ground . " six million poles , including most of the country 's pre-war population of 3.1 million jews , are believed to have been killed after nazi germany invaded poland on sept .

a further 2.5 million people were deported to labor camps in germany , while warsaw and many other cities were extensively damaged in a nazi campaign to eradicate polish culture .

earlier this year , former german president johannes rau spoke of the importance of that development during a visit to budapest .
" we owe an awful lot to hungary ...

worse yet , contradictory statements about the country 's currency exchange rates and inflation goals and a lax fiscal policy have engendered considerable uncertainty .
but these facts have not been lost on gyurcsany , who has said making hungary more attractive to foreign investors will be a priority .
" in my opinion , it 's important that the country 's economic policy reflect stability and calm so that hungary can continue to be a goal for foreign investors , " he said .
despite some tougher times in recent months , most of the 54 german companies active there are satisfied with hungary as a place for doing business .

it was the second time in two years that the country , which prides itself on producing some of the world 's leading philosophers and scientists , had received negative marks for government spending , number of hours spent in the classroom and pupil-teacher ratios .
on wednesday , education experts in the government coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens minced no words in calling on germany to prepare itself better for the future .
in addition to increasing much-needed government investment in the education system -lrb- only about 9.7 percent of total spending goes towards schools -rrb- , the politicians called for far-reaching reforms of the nation 's traditional school structure .
school for all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teachers need to spend more time with each pupil in the elementary schools .
krista sager , parliamentary fraction leader for the greens , told the berliner zeitung germany needed to move away from its three-tiered school model and introduce " a school for all , " where pupils would stay together in one system for nine or ten years .
the current division into three different schools , each tailored to specific education abilities and skills , is " more befitting of a medieval feudal system than a modern society , " criticized christoph matschie , head of the spd for the eastern state of thuringia .
a general school for all pupils is better equipped for promoting common education standards than a system that " sorts " children at an early age according to their abilities , explained the former state secretary for the education ministry .
matschie told the paper that the traditional division into college-prep highschool , secondary school and vocational school , was partially to blame for the poor results in the oecd study .
pupils performed better when they learned together , he and sager argued .
schleswig-holstein 's state minister for culture and education was also convinced that the three-tiered education system is no longer beneficial to the country .
ute erdsiek-rave said her party of social democrats would campaign together with the greens during the next state election for a reform that supports a " school for all . "
however , a complete revamping of the school system would take between 10 and 15 years , she admitted .
more financial support needed opposition leader angela merkel dismissed calls to introduce such far-reaching reforms .
the head of the conservative christian democrats union said the oecd in no way implied that germany 's traditional three-tiered school model was to blame for failures in german education .
the international study indicated specifically that germany had done too little to improve standards in kindergartens and elementary schools , she argued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a typical german classroom ?
germany 's problems were largely the result of large classrooms and too little instruction time , she said , both of which could be rectified with more investment .
the pupil-teacher ratio needs to be improved , merkel said , pointing to the statistic that germany had 24 pupils per teacher in elementary schools , the highest number among the 30 industrial countries surveyed .
t with a view to government plans to expand the number of all-day schools , merkel said germany was on the right road to increasing the amount of time children spend in the classroom .
the oecd study showed that german pupils aged seven and eight attend school on average for 626 hours a year , compared with 788 on average in the oecd .
germany needs to invest more in building all-day schools , she said and called for a speedy introduction of tax reforms that would open up more funds for education .
money is not the answer " we must once and for all start investing in the education system , " merkel told rbb information radio on wednesday .
but the head of the german union for teachers and researchers , eva-maria stange , cautioned against thinking only in terms of financial support .
german politicians needed to " do their homework , " she said .
the oecd report clearly showed " german schools need not just more money , but fundamental reforms . " dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bad grades for german schools germany ’ s school system has gotten bad marks yet again .
an annual oecd report suggested that germany spends too little on learning , students get too little instruction and too few people get university degrees .

he 's accompanied by a delegation of business and science leaders pushing for deeper economic and political ties . schröder is visiting hungary on the occasion of the 15th anniversary of the date hungary opened its borders to east germans and allowed them to leave to the west - a development that created an extremely positive new dimension in west germany 's ties with the then-eastern bloc nation .
earlier this year , former german president johannes rau spoke of the importance of that development during a visit to budapest .
" we owe an awful lot to hungary ...
if hungary had n't shut off its electrical fence on may 2 , 1989 , which allowed many from the ddr to come to west germany , the developments in prague on sept .
20 would n't have happened and the -lrb- berlin -rrb- wall would n't have fallen on nov .
9 , " rau said .
" in some respects , the hungarians were the intiators of german unity . "
for a long time , the magyars would have been thankful for a few handouts from germany .
but the burdens of german unity and the costs of rebuilding the east german infrastructure left little room for german financial aid to the hungarians .
a visit with new prime minister designate still , relations between the two countries have developed positively .
there are no major sticking points between the countries , and schröder can look forward to a relaxing trip aimed at deepening the countries ' political , economic and scientific cooperation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- right -rrb- , and outgoing hungarian prime minister peter medgyessy schröder will be meeting with outgoing hungarian prime minister peter medgyessy , who announced his resignation in august following a government coalition crisis , as well as his nominated successor , ferenc gyurcsany .

young germans have long labored under the weight of guilt from the nation 's past but have recently pushed for more pride in their country .
however , pro-german lyrics in pop songs are causing concern . germany 's gradual relaxation towards its national identity is causing concern among recording artists and musicians as an increasing number of songs appearing in the pop charts seem to contain lyrics which could be misconstrued as nationalist . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul van dyk for months , the single " we " has been riding high in the german charts .
a collaboration between techno dj paul van dyk -lrb- photo -rrb- and wolfsheim singer peter heppner , the song proudly recounts german post-war history with lyrics such as " i ask myself who we are .
we are we .
divided , defeated but , nevertheless , in the end , we 're still alive . " the song is accompanied by a video that contains images of women rebuilding bombed cities with their bare hands and amputee soldiers returning from the war . " we " portrays germans as victims in a land split between the allies and its people humiliated .
but there is no mention of the war , of the holocaust or the third reich .
instead the song celebrates the german success history : the reconstruction , the miracle of bern and the reunification . it is , essentially , a love song to germany . no more shame over nationality another example comes from the group mia in the song " it is what it is . "
front woman mieze sings about german pride and the creation of the national colors displayed in the post-war flag : " a gulp of the black coffee wakes me up , your red mouth touches me gently , at this moment , it clicks and the yellow sun rises , " referring to the colors in germany 's national flag : black , red and gold . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mieze and other mia members in a publicity shot mieze later sings about the rejection of past generations and the embracing of a new german identity : " if anyone asks me now where i come from , i no longer feel sorry for myself … i risk it all for love , i feel ready . " such words and images are making some people uncomfortable .
germans have struggled for years with the weight of guilt associated with the nation 's record in two world wars but younger generations have begun to reclaim german identity and move on from the crimes of the past to take pride in their country . target audience rich pickings for neo-nazis but some commentators see a danger in popular music becoming the voice of a new german pride , fearing it could be hijacked by far right organizations and used as nationalist propaganda in a market targeted at a young , impressionable record buying public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazi demonstrators anetta kahane of the amadeu antonio foundation , a group based in berlin which promotes democratic initiatives to resist right wing extremism , views the development in german pop music with concern . " far right organizations think this is great , " she said .
" they rightly perceive this as national pride suddenly becoming something normal . " far-right groups use music 's influence the reactions of the neo-nazis show that kahane is right .
the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- mouthpiece national voice wrote that mia stands up for a " relaxed attitude to its own nation . "
mia 's attitude has " scratched out " the left-wing supremacy in german youth , wrote the paper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rammstein flirtations with the far-right are not a new phenomenon .
groups such as rammstein -lrb- photo -rrb- and , more specifically , böhse onkelz which made no secret the fact that it was a part of the german skinhead scene in the 1980s and published songs with titles like " turks out " and " germany for the germans , " were championed by neo-nazis but have since renounced their right-wing leanings . mia on the other hand keeps pointing out that they do not want to be associated with rightwing extremists .
they add that they simply want to help jump-start a discussion about german identity . but musicians can not choose their fans : at a mia concert in the western german town of bielefeld , three rightwing extremists attacked a dark-skinned student , according to local news reports .
organizers of another festival at which mia was scheduled to appear asked the band 's management to comment on the incident .

" if the company is looking for a conflict , we are ready to back up our claims with protest action and warning strikes , " chief ig metall negotiator harmut meine told die welt newspaper ahead of the talks . " shareholders get a dividend and the workers have to tighten their belts with a wage freeze , " he said .
" it 's not fair . " ig metall , germany 's most powerful industrial union , blamed volkswagen for creating a climate of conflict ahead of the negotiations , whose first rounds start later wednesday , and asked vw to be prudent with its public comments . " we have not even started to negotiate and here comes a financial wizard from the management board who heats up the climate of negotiations with unnecessary chatter , " he said in reference to comments by chief financial officer hans-dieter pötsch . pötsch last week said about 30,000 jobs are at risk if wage negotiations end without cutting costs . " that is irresponsible , " meine said . the wage negotiations at vw often set the standard for the rest of the industry , and the country 's biggest industrial union and employers typically take distant but firm positions as the talks get under way . ig metall , which is negotiating on behalf of 103,000 manufacturing employees , is asking for job guarantees and a 4 percent pay rise from oct .
1 , after a two-year wage agreement expires at the end of this month . a pre-emptive strike ? but vw , in an unusual negotiating stance , has already disclosed what it intends to propose to the union even before the talks start : a two-year wage freeze and various cuts in pay and benefits . the usual negotiating tactic of companies is to wait for the union to declare its demands during the first round , then wait a few weeks before divulging its counter-proposals . " we will not agree to a wage freeze , " meine said , adding that he could not say how long the talks would drag on . " but i expect difficult negotiations and a heated conflict , " he said . analysts polled by the afx financial news service on the eve of the talks said the positions of the two sides are so far apart that they may well be on a collision course that could lead to production disruptions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it will definitely be a very difficult negotiation , " said economist eckhard tuchtfeld at commerzbank .
he added it would be very difficult for ig metall to agree to a wage freeze because they were already insisting on a four percent increase . " if it had said it wanted two percent or so , then it would be easier to back down from the original demand .
but from four percent to zero , they would really look funny , " tuchtfeld said . other analysts said the investor community has already factored into this year 's estimates for vw the possibility of output cuts as a result of strikes which ig metall might call to back its wage demands . abu dhabi deal fails in more bad news for volkswagen on wednesday , the company said that talks to sell a 9.8 percent stake in vw to an investment group from abu dhabi had been called off due to disagreement over the price . " both sides regret this development , but see promising prospectives for working together on other present projects , " vw said in a statement . vw wanted to the sale of shares to help finance the purchase of 50 percent of dutch car leasing and management firm leaseplan .
the deal will now be paid for out of vw 's current operating revenue . vw 's stock fell sharply after news of the ending of the talks broke .

after getting bad grades from the oecd , german politicians are calling for extensive reforms of the nation 's schools .
it 's not enough to spend more money , the education system needs to be completely re-worked , they said . a day after germany brought home failing grades from the organization for economic cooperation and development for its education system , the nation 's politicians responded like worried parents .
it was the second time in two years that the country , which prides itself on producing some of the world 's leading philosophers and scientists , had received negative marks for government spending , number of hours spent in the classroom and pupil-teacher ratios .
on wednesday , education experts in the government coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens minced no words in calling on germany to prepare itself better for the future .
in addition to increasing much-needed government investment in the education system -lrb- only about 9.7 percent of total spending goes towards schools -rrb- , the politicians called for far-reaching reforms of the nation 's traditional school structure .
school for all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teachers need to spend more time with each pupil in the elementary schools .
krista sager , parliamentary fraction leader for the greens , told the berliner zeitung germany needed to move away from its three-tiered school model and introduce " a school for all , " where pupils would stay together in one system for nine or ten years .
the current division into three different schools , each tailored to specific education abilities and skills , is " more befitting of a medieval feudal system than a modern society , " criticized christoph matschie , head of the spd for the eastern state of thuringia .
a general school for all pupils is better equipped for promoting common education standards than a system that " sorts " children at an early age according to their abilities , explained the former state secretary for the education ministry .
matschie told the paper that the traditional division into college-prep highschool , secondary school and vocational school , was partially to blame for the poor results in the oecd study .
pupils performed better when they learned together , he and sager argued .
schleswig-holstein 's state minister for culture and education was also convinced that the three-tiered education system is no longer beneficial to the country .
ute erdsiek-rave said her party of social democrats would campaign together with the greens during the next state election for a reform that supports a " school for all . "
however , a complete revamping of the school system would take between 10 and 15 years , she admitted .
more financial support needed opposition leader angela merkel dismissed calls to introduce such far-reaching reforms .
the head of the conservative christian democrats union said the oecd in no way implied that germany 's traditional three-tiered school model was to blame for failures in german education .
the international study indicated specifically that germany had done too little to improve standards in kindergartens and elementary schools , she argued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a typical german classroom ?
germany 's problems were largely the result of large classrooms and too little instruction time , she said , both of which could be rectified with more investment .
the pupil-teacher ratio needs to be improved , merkel said , pointing to the statistic that germany had 24 pupils per teacher in elementary schools , the highest number among the 30 industrial countries surveyed .
t with a view to government plans to expand the number of all-day schools , merkel said germany was on the right road to increasing the amount of time children spend in the classroom .
the oecd study showed that german pupils aged seven and eight attend school on average for 626 hours a year , compared with 788 on average in the oecd .
germany needs to invest more in building all-day schools , she said and called for a speedy introduction of tax reforms that would open up more funds for education .
money is not the answer " we must once and for all start investing in the education system , " merkel told rbb information radio on wednesday .
but the head of the german union for teachers and researchers , eva-maria stange , cautioned against thinking only in terms of financial support .
german politicians needed to " do their homework , " she said .

young germans have long labored under the weight of guilt from the nation 's past but have recently pushed for more pride in their country .
however , pro-german lyrics in pop songs are causing concern . germany 's gradual relaxation towards its national identity is causing concern among recording artists and musicians as an increasing number of songs appearing in the pop charts seem to contain lyrics which could be misconstrued as nationalist . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul van dyk for months , the single " we " has been riding high in the german charts .
a collaboration between techno dj paul van dyk -lrb- photo -rrb- and wolfsheim singer peter heppner , the song proudly recounts german post-war history with lyrics such as " i ask myself who we are .
we are we .
divided , defeated but , nevertheless , in the end , we 're still alive . " the song is accompanied by a video that contains images of women rebuilding bombed cities with their bare hands and amputee soldiers returning from the war . " we " portrays germans as victims in a land split between the allies and its people humiliated .
but there is no mention of the war , of the holocaust or the third reich .
instead the song celebrates the german success history : the reconstruction , the miracle of bern and the reunification . it is , essentially , a love song to germany . no more shame over nationality another example comes from the group mia in the song " it is what it is . "

" such words and images are making some people uncomfortable .
germans have struggled for years with the weight of guilt associated with the nation 's record in two world wars but younger generations have begun to reclaim german identity and move on from the crimes of the past to take pride in their country . target audience rich pickings for neo-nazis but some commentators see a danger in popular music becoming the voice of a new german pride , fearing it could be hijacked by far right organizations and used as nationalist propaganda in a market targeted at a young , impressionable record buying public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazi demonstrators anetta kahane of the amadeu antonio foundation , a group based in berlin which promotes democratic initiatives to resist right wing extremism , views the development in german pop music with concern . " far right organizations think this is great , " she said .
" they rightly perceive this as national pride suddenly becoming something normal . " far-right groups use music 's influence the reactions of the neo-nazis show that kahane is right .

mia 's attitude has " scratched out " the left-wing supremacy in german youth , wrote the paper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rammstein flirtations with the far-right are not a new phenomenon .

they add that they simply want to help jump-start a discussion about german identity . but musicians can not choose their fans : at a mia concert in the western german town of bielefeld , three rightwing extremists attacked a dark-skinned student , according to local news reports .

one of them is the müritz national park in mecklenburg-western pomerania . the landscape formed 10,000 years ago by the ice age belongs today to the most beautiful areas in the northeastern germany .
over 1000 sparkling blue and immaculate-clean lakes are surrounded by forests and open country side . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : picnic on lake müritz the biggest lakes in this area are next to the müritz lake plauer , lake fleesen and lake kölpen . müritz is a slavic word and means little sea .

almost a jungle the müritz national park is half way between hamburg and berlin .
the 322 square kilometer big park consists mostly of forests and water .
when taking a journey through the park , one realizes quickly that the word natural stems indeed from the word nature - the green paradise resembles a jungle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müritz-steam ship the so-called developing zone comprises the biggest part of the national park .

when entering the park , visitors are informed on how to use the park ’ s facilities .
national park tickets come in handy .
buses , ships and canoes provide an excellent transportation net .
moreover , bikers can take their bikes on the national park lanes for free . flora , fauna and geology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boathouses on lake müritz the city of waren , close to the national park , acts as a tourist center .

after getting bad grades from the oecd , german politicians are calling for extensive reforms of the nation 's schools .
it 's not enough to spend more money , the education system needs to be completely re-worked , they said . a day after germany brought home failing grades from the organization for economic cooperation and development for its education system , the nation 's politicians responded like worried parents .
it was the second time in two years that the country , which prides itself on producing some of the world 's leading philosophers and scientists , had received negative marks for government spending , number of hours spent in the classroom and pupil-teacher ratios .
on wednesday , education experts in the government coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens minced no words in calling on germany to prepare itself better for the future .
in addition to increasing much-needed government investment in the education system -lrb- only about 9.7 percent of total spending goes towards schools -rrb- , the politicians called for far-reaching reforms of the nation 's traditional school structure .
school for all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teachers need to spend more time with each pupil in the elementary schools .
krista sager , parliamentary fraction leader for the greens , told the berliner zeitung germany needed to move away from its three-tiered school model and introduce " a school for all , " where pupils would stay together in one system for nine or ten years .
the current division into three different schools , each tailored to specific education abilities and skills , is " more befitting of a medieval feudal system than a modern society , " criticized christoph matschie , head of the spd for the eastern state of thuringia .
a general school for all pupils is better equipped for promoting common education standards than a system that " sorts " children at an early age according to their abilities , explained the former state secretary for the education ministry .
matschie told the paper that the traditional division into college-prep highschool , secondary school and vocational school , was partially to blame for the poor results in the oecd study .
pupils performed better when they learned together , he and sager argued .
schleswig-holstein 's state minister for culture and education was also convinced that the three-tiered education system is no longer beneficial to the country .
ute erdsiek-rave said her party of social democrats would campaign together with the greens during the next state election for a reform that supports a " school for all . "
however , a complete revamping of the school system would take between 10 and 15 years , she admitted .
more financial support needed opposition leader angela merkel dismissed calls to introduce such far-reaching reforms .
the head of the conservative christian democrats union said the oecd in no way implied that germany 's traditional three-tiered school model was to blame for failures in german education .
the international study indicated specifically that germany had done too little to improve standards in kindergartens and elementary schools , she argued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a typical german classroom ?
germany 's problems were largely the result of large classrooms and too little instruction time , she said , both of which could be rectified with more investment .
the pupil-teacher ratio needs to be improved , merkel said , pointing to the statistic that germany had 24 pupils per teacher in elementary schools , the highest number among the 30 industrial countries surveyed .
t with a view to government plans to expand the number of all-day schools , merkel said germany was on the right road to increasing the amount of time children spend in the classroom .
the oecd study showed that german pupils aged seven and eight attend school on average for 626 hours a year , compared with 788 on average in the oecd .
germany needs to invest more in building all-day schools , she said and called for a speedy introduction of tax reforms that would open up more funds for education .
money is not the answer " we must once and for all start investing in the education system , " merkel told rbb information radio on wednesday .
but the head of the german union for teachers and researchers , eva-maria stange , cautioned against thinking only in terms of financial support .
german politicians needed to " do their homework , " she said .

a general school for all pupils is better equipped for promoting common education standards than a system that " sorts " children at an early age according to their abilities , explained the former state secretary for the education ministry .
matschie told the paper that the traditional division into college-prep highschool , secondary school and vocational school , was partially to blame for the poor results in the oecd study .
pupils performed better when they learned together , he and sager argued .
schleswig-holstein 's state minister for culture and education was also convinced that the three-tiered education system is no longer beneficial to the country .
ute erdsiek-rave said her party of social democrats would campaign together with the greens during the next state election for a reform that supports a " school for all . "
however , a complete revamping of the school system would take between 10 and 15 years , she admitted .
more financial support needed opposition leader angela merkel dismissed calls to introduce such far-reaching reforms .
the head of the conservative christian democrats union said the oecd in no way implied that germany 's traditional three-tiered school model was to blame for failures in german education .
the international study indicated specifically that germany had done too little to improve standards in kindergartens and elementary schools , she argued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a typical german classroom ?
germany 's problems were largely the result of large classrooms and too little instruction time , she said , both of which could be rectified with more investment .
the pupil-teacher ratio needs to be improved , merkel said , pointing to the statistic that germany had 24 pupils per teacher in elementary schools , the highest number among the 30 industrial countries surveyed .
t with a view to government plans to expand the number of all-day schools , merkel said germany was on the right road to increasing the amount of time children spend in the classroom .
the oecd study showed that german pupils aged seven and eight attend school on average for 626 hours a year , compared with 788 on average in the oecd .
germany needs to invest more in building all-day schools , she said and called for a speedy introduction of tax reforms that would open up more funds for education .
money is not the answer " we must once and for all start investing in the education system , " merkel told rbb information radio on wednesday .
but the head of the german union for teachers and researchers , eva-maria stange , cautioned against thinking only in terms of financial support .
german politicians needed to " do their homework , " she said .
the oecd report clearly showed " german schools need not just more money , but fundamental reforms . " dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bad grades for german schools germany ’ s school system has gotten bad marks yet again .

in 1904 in the german territory of south west africa , today namibia , german troops led by general lothar von trotha mercilessly put down a rebellion of the indigenous herero people . by the time the conflict ended four years later , between 45,000 to 65,000 herero were killed , many of whom suffered in work camps some consider the forerunners to wwii-era concentration camps . a year later , in the german held south east africa , today tanzania , the so-called maji-maji war broke out .

however , much attention is devoted to eco tourism in order to make this unique nature heritage accessible to the general public . bird watching the national park is most notably famous for its white-tailed-eagles , ospreys and cranes .
the cranes -lrb- a species that has almost died out -rrb- are a living proof of the faultless nature .
observing the white-tailed-eagles in their nests is a truly unique experience . a camera , focused on the nest , makes it possible to follow every movement of the raptors and their babies on a television set in the national park information center .

national park tickets come in handy .
buses , ships and canoes provide an excellent transportation net .

they also demanded that the german government of social democrats and greens finally depart from what they described as an economic and social zigzag course . the industry associations in eastern germany say the current debate about equal living standards in the two halves of the reunited country wo n't serve as an excuse to do nothing about the current discrepancies . but in a statement issued in berlin , walter botschatzki , the president of the business associations in the eastern state of thuringia , said the east remains grateful for the billions of euros in western aid it has received and will continue to receive in the framework of a solidarity pact geared to making the east more competitive . he warned though that the current social and economic woes in the east are being misused by both left and right-wing forces to push their own agenda for next weekend 's regional elections in the states of brandenburg and saxony . achievements should be recognized " the enormous achievements that the whole country has recorded in the east ’ s economic recovery over the past 15 years are being belittled on purpose by some forces in our society , " botschatzki told dw-radio .

the move was seen as a tit-for-tat response to a series of claims by german civilians seeking compensation for property lost after poland 's borders shifted westwards in 1945 and they were expelled from the newly re-drawn state .
but jozef oleksy , the speaker of the polish parliament , said on wednesday that the resolution demanding compensation was in fact aimed at prodding the european union over regional aid for poland . oleksy said the demand " is aimed at the eu as a reminder -lrb- of poland 's losses -rrb- when it comes to hand out regional fund and aid money .

they also demanded that the german government of social democrats and greens finally depart from what they described as an economic and social zigzag course . the industry associations in eastern germany say the current debate about equal living standards in the two halves of the reunited country wo n't serve as an excuse to do nothing about the current discrepancies . but in a statement issued in berlin , walter botschatzki , the president of the business associations in the eastern state of thuringia , said the east remains grateful for the billions of euros in western aid it has received and will continue to receive in the framework of a solidarity pact geared to making the east more competitive . he warned though that the current social and economic woes in the east are being misused by both left and right-wing forces to push their own agenda for next weekend 's regional elections in the states of brandenburg and saxony . achievements should be recognized " the enormous achievements that the whole country has recorded in the east ’ s economic recovery over the past 15 years are being belittled on purpose by some forces in our society , " botschatzki told dw-radio .
" let ’ s not forget that eastern germany now has an extremely modern transport and telecommunications infrastructure .
there are also very competitive clusters of industry in the east , like the semi-conductor centers in dresden or the automobile industry in leipzig . " botschatzki also spoke of the big strides which have been made in the metal-working and electronics industries in the east .
following a downturn in productivity in the period before 1997 , he said the past seven years had seen an enormous upswing in these sectors , creating more than 50,000 jobs across the east . he added that much more could be achieved with clear political signals from berlin .
easterners , he claimed , had proven in the past that they were willing to take their share of reforms , as long as those reforms made sense to them . people need faith in reforms " the current political zig-zag course , the lack of real reform prospects and the poor communication of reform efforts by the government have resulted in more and more people feeling insecure , " botschatzki said .

they also demanded that the german government of social democrats and greens finally depart from what they described as an economic and social zigzag course . the industry associations in eastern germany say the current debate about equal living standards in the two halves of the reunited country wo n't serve as an excuse to do nothing about the current discrepancies . but in a statement issued in berlin , walter botschatzki , the president of the business associations in the eastern state of thuringia , said the east remains grateful for the billions of euros in western aid it has received and will continue to receive in the framework of a solidarity pact geared to making the east more competitive . he warned though that the current social and economic woes in the east are being misused by both left and right-wing forces to push their own agenda for next weekend 's regional elections in the states of brandenburg and saxony . achievements should be recognized " the enormous achievements that the whole country has recorded in the east ’ s economic recovery over the past 15 years are being belittled on purpose by some forces in our society , " botschatzki told dw-radio .
" let ’ s not forget that eastern germany now has an extremely modern transport and telecommunications infrastructure .
there are also very competitive clusters of industry in the east , like the semi-conductor centers in dresden or the automobile industry in leipzig . " botschatzki also spoke of the big strides which have been made in the metal-working and electronics industries in the east .
following a downturn in productivity in the period before 1997 , he said the past seven years had seen an enormous upswing in these sectors , creating more than 50,000 jobs across the east . he added that much more could be achieved with clear political signals from berlin .
easterners , he claimed , had proven in the past that they were willing to take their share of reforms , as long as those reforms made sense to them . people need faith in reforms " the current political zig-zag course , the lack of real reform prospects and the poor communication of reform efforts by the government have resulted in more and more people feeling insecure , " botschatzki said .
" confidence and faith in the government ’ s policies is decreasing , and that leads in the end to less stability in our democratic system . " botschatzki added that right after german unification in 1990 , easterners had hoped that living standards across the country would level out within 10 years or so .
they now had to accept that this was wishful thinking .
the same applied to their hopes for equal wages . klaus von dohnanyi , who was commissioned by the government to work out a more effective economic program for the east , says people have to face current realities . they 'll have to accept new low-wage employment opportunities rather than going on the dole . " we have new competition also from eastern europe and must see that these people in east germany are capable of making a living , " he said .
" and therefore we discuss the earned tax credit systems in the united states , for example , something we should add to the wages to remain competitive and at the same time have adequate living in the relatively high cost country germany . " von dohnanyi has explicitly supported president köhler 's recent statement that equal living conditions will not be achieved . he said the man had the courage to speak the truth rather than stooping to populist formulas which didn ’ t help anyone in the country .
president köhler continues to draw massive criticism from predominantly eastern policy-makers for saying that equal living standards are nothing but a myth . hardy graupner -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a land of differences while the core of german president horst köhler 's remarks on differences in living and employment standards focused on eastern and western states , figures published on tuesday show discrepencies across the whole country .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.09.2004 eastern german industry calls for more optimism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern german success stories include dresden 's " silicon valley " industry leaders in eastern germany have called for full economic parity across the country to remain on track as concerns over east-west discrepencies continue . following controversial remarks by german president horst köhler that the country ’ s east will probably never reach western living standards , industry associations from the new federal states on tuesday issued an appeal which called on germans not to let full economic unity slip out of sight .
they also demanded that the german government of social democrats and greens finally depart from what they described as an economic and social zigzag course . the industry associations in eastern germany say the current debate about equal living standards in the two halves of the reunited country wo n't serve as an excuse to do nothing about the current discrepancies . but in a statement issued in berlin , walter botschatzki , the president of the business associations in the eastern state of thuringia , said the east remains grateful for the billions of euros in western aid it has received and will continue to receive in the framework of a solidarity pact geared to making the east more competitive . he warned though that the current social and economic woes in the east are being misused by both left and right-wing forces to push their own agenda for next weekend 's regional elections in the states of brandenburg and saxony . achievements should be recognized " the enormous achievements that the whole country has recorded in the east ’ s economic recovery over the past 15 years are being belittled on purpose by some forces in our society , " botschatzki told dw-radio .
" let ’ s not forget that eastern germany now has an extremely modern transport and telecommunications infrastructure .
there are also very competitive clusters of industry in the east , like the semi-conductor centers in dresden or the automobile industry in leipzig . " botschatzki also spoke of the big strides which have been made in the metal-working and electronics industries in the east .
following a downturn in productivity in the period before 1997 , he said the past seven years had seen an enormous upswing in these sectors , creating more than 50,000 jobs across the east . he added that much more could be achieved with clear political signals from berlin .
easterners , he claimed , had proven in the past that they were willing to take their share of reforms , as long as those reforms made sense to them . people need faith in reforms " the current political zig-zag course , the lack of real reform prospects and the poor communication of reform efforts by the government have resulted in more and more people feeling insecure , " botschatzki said .
" confidence and faith in the government ’ s policies is decreasing , and that leads in the end to less stability in our democratic system . " botschatzki added that right after german unification in 1990 , easterners had hoped that living standards across the country would level out within 10 years or so .
they now had to accept that this was wishful thinking .
the same applied to their hopes for equal wages . klaus von dohnanyi , who was commissioned by the government to work out a more effective economic program for the east , says people have to face current realities . they 'll have to accept new low-wage employment opportunities rather than going on the dole . " we have new competition also from eastern europe and must see that these people in east germany are capable of making a living , " he said .
" and therefore we discuss the earned tax credit systems in the united states , for example , something we should add to the wages to remain competitive and at the same time have adequate living in the relatively high cost country germany .

seb , which has 175 branch offices in germany , expects to profit from the end of government liability for state-backed savings banks in mid-2005 as well as from the consolidation of those banks and cooperative banks , thunell said .

" if the company is looking for a conflict , we are ready to back up our claims with protest action and warning strikes , " chief ig metall negotiator harmut meine told die welt newspaper ahead of the talks . " shareholders get a dividend and the workers have to tighten their belts with a wage freeze , " he said .
" it 's not fair . " ig metall , germany 's most powerful industrial union , blamed volkswagen for creating a climate of conflict ahead of the negotiations , whose first rounds start later wednesday , and asked vw to be prudent with its public comments . " we have not even started to negotiate and here comes a financial wizard from the management board who heats up the climate of negotiations with unnecessary chatter , " he said in reference to comments by chief financial officer hans-dieter pötsch . pötsch last week said about 30,000 jobs are at risk if wage negotiations end without cutting costs . " that is irresponsible , " meine said . the wage negotiations at vw often set the standard for the rest of the industry , and the country 's biggest industrial union and employers typically take distant but firm positions as the talks get under way . ig metall , which is negotiating on behalf of 103,000 manufacturing employees , is asking for job guarantees and a 4 percent pay rise from oct .
1 , after a two-year wage agreement expires at the end of this month . a pre-emptive strike ? but vw , in an unusual negotiating stance , has already disclosed what it intends to propose to the union even before the talks start : a two-year wage freeze and various cuts in pay and benefits . the usual negotiating tactic of companies is to wait for the union to declare its demands during the first round , then wait a few weeks before divulging its counter-proposals . " we will not agree to a wage freeze , " meine said , adding that he could not say how long the talks would drag on . " but i expect difficult negotiations and a heated conflict , " he said . analysts polled by the afx financial news service on the eve of the talks said the positions of the two sides are so far apart that they may well be on a collision course that could lead to production disruptions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it will definitely be a very difficult negotiation , " said economist eckhard tuchtfeld at commerzbank .
he added it would be very difficult for ig metall to agree to a wage freeze because they were already insisting on a four percent increase . " if it had said it wanted two percent or so , then it would be easier to back down from the original demand .
but from four percent to zero , they would really look funny , " tuchtfeld said . other analysts said the investor community has already factored into this year 's estimates for vw the possibility of output cuts as a result of strikes which ig metall might call to back its wage demands . abu dhabi deal fails in more bad news for volkswagen on wednesday , the company said that talks to sell a 9.8 percent stake in vw to an investment group from abu dhabi had been called off due to disagreement over the price . " both sides regret this development , but see promising prospectives for working together on other present projects , " vw said in a statement . vw wanted to the sale of shares to help finance the purchase of 50 percent of dutch car leasing and management firm leaseplan .
the deal will now be paid for out of vw 's current operating revenue . vw 's stock fell sharply after news of the ending of the talks broke .

seb germany chief thomas altenhain stressed that the bank was more interested in financial institutes with mobile distribution which could strengthen seb in the wealth management sector .
seb , which has 175 branch offices in germany , expects to profit from the end of government liability for state-backed savings banks in mid-2005 as well as from the consolidation of those banks and cooperative banks , thunell said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 15.09.2004 ig metall union threatens vw with strikes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things do n't look so shiny for vw at the moment germany 's powerful ig metall union has threatened europe 's biggest car maker , volkswagen , with strikes if its wage demands are not met , setting the stage wednesday for a confrontational round of talks . " if the company is looking for a conflict , we are ready to back up our claims with protest action and warning strikes , " chief ig metall negotiator harmut meine told die welt newspaper ahead of the talks . " shareholders get a dividend and the workers have to tighten their belts with a wage freeze , " he said .
" it 's not fair . " ig metall , germany 's most powerful industrial union , blamed volkswagen for creating a climate of conflict ahead of the negotiations , whose first rounds start later wednesday , and asked vw to be prudent with its public comments . " we have not even started to negotiate and here comes a financial wizard from the management board who heats up the climate of negotiations with unnecessary chatter , " he said in reference to comments by chief financial officer hans-dieter pötsch . pötsch last week said about 30,000 jobs are at risk if wage negotiations end without cutting costs . " that is irresponsible , " meine said . the wage negotiations at vw often set the standard for the rest of the industry , and the country 's biggest industrial union and employers typically take distant but firm positions as the talks get under way . ig metall , which is negotiating on behalf of 103,000 manufacturing employees , is asking for job guarantees and a 4 percent pay rise from oct .
1 , after a two-year wage agreement expires at the end of this month . a pre-emptive strike ? but vw , in an unusual negotiating stance , has already disclosed what it intends to propose to the union even before the talks start : a two-year wage freeze and various cuts in pay and benefits . the usual negotiating tactic of companies is to wait for the union to declare its demands during the first round , then wait a few weeks before divulging its counter-proposals . " we will not agree to a wage freeze , " meine said , adding that he could not say how long the talks would drag on . " but i expect difficult negotiations and a heated conflict , " he said . analysts polled by the afx financial news service on the eve of the talks said the positions of the two sides are so far apart that they may well be on a collision course that could lead to production disruptions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it will definitely be a very difficult negotiation , " said economist eckhard tuchtfeld at commerzbank .
he added it would be very difficult for ig metall to agree to a wage freeze because they were already insisting on a four percent increase . " if it had said it wanted two percent or so , then it would be easier to back down from the original demand .
but from four percent to zero , they would really look funny , " tuchtfeld said . other analysts said the investor community has already factored into this year 's estimates for vw the possibility of output cuts as a result of strikes which ig metall might call to back its wage demands . abu dhabi deal fails in more bad news for volkswagen on wednesday , the company said that talks to sell a 9.8 percent stake in vw to an investment group from abu dhabi had been called off due to disagreement over the price . " both sides regret this development , but see promising prospectives for working together on other present projects , " vw said in a statement . vw wanted to the sale of shares to help finance the purchase of 50 percent of dutch car leasing and management firm leaseplan .
the deal will now be paid for out of vw 's current operating revenue . vw 's stock fell sharply after news of the ending of the talks broke .
in late afternoon trade on wednesday , volkswagen shares dropped 2.67 percent to € 32.47 -lrb- $ 39.46 -rrb- . afp / dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german auto industry at risk germany 's tradition as a center of car manufacturing could be in jeopardy as more businesses look to move east in response to rising wages and inflexible labor markets .

they also demanded that the german government of social democrats and greens finally depart from what they described as an economic and social zigzag course . the industry associations in eastern germany say the current debate about equal living standards in the two halves of the reunited country wo n't serve as an excuse to do nothing about the current discrepancies . but in a statement issued in berlin , walter botschatzki , the president of the business associations in the eastern state of thuringia , said the east remains grateful for the billions of euros in western aid it has received and will continue to receive in the framework of a solidarity pact geared to making the east more competitive . he warned though that the current social and economic woes in the east are being misused by both left and right-wing forces to push their own agenda for next weekend 's regional elections in the states of brandenburg and saxony . achievements should be recognized " the enormous achievements that the whole country has recorded in the east ’ s economic recovery over the past 15 years are being belittled on purpose by some forces in our society , " botschatzki told dw-radio .
" let ’ s not forget that eastern germany now has an extremely modern transport and telecommunications infrastructure .
there are also very competitive clusters of industry in the east , like the semi-conductor centers in dresden or the automobile industry in leipzig . " botschatzki also spoke of the big strides which have been made in the metal-working and electronics industries in the east .
following a downturn in productivity in the period before 1997 , he said the past seven years had seen an enormous upswing in these sectors , creating more than 50,000 jobs across the east . he added that much more could be achieved with clear political signals from berlin .
easterners , he claimed , had proven in the past that they were willing to take their share of reforms , as long as those reforms made sense to them . people need faith in reforms " the current political zig-zag course , the lack of real reform prospects and the poor communication of reform efforts by the government have resulted in more and more people feeling insecure , " botschatzki said .
" confidence and faith in the government ’ s policies is decreasing , and that leads in the end to less stability in our democratic system . " botschatzki added that right after german unification in 1990 , easterners had hoped that living standards across the country would level out within 10 years or so .
they now had to accept that this was wishful thinking .
the same applied to their hopes for equal wages . klaus von dohnanyi , who was commissioned by the government to work out a more effective economic program for the east , says people have to face current realities . they 'll have to accept new low-wage employment opportunities rather than going on the dole . " we have new competition also from eastern europe and must see that these people in east germany are capable of making a living , " he said .
" and therefore we discuss the earned tax credit systems in the united states , for example , something we should add to the wages to remain competitive and at the same time have adequate living in the relatively high cost country germany . " von dohnanyi has explicitly supported president köhler 's recent statement that equal living conditions will not be achieved . he said the man had the courage to speak the truth rather than stooping to populist formulas which didn ’ t help anyone in the country .
president köhler continues to draw massive criticism from predominantly eastern policy-makers for saying that equal living standards are nothing but a myth . hardy graupner -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a land of differences while the core of german president horst köhler 's remarks on differences in living and employment standards focused on eastern and western states , figures published on tuesday show discrepencies across the whole country .

easterners , he claimed , had proven in the past that they were willing to take their share of reforms , as long as those reforms made sense to them . people need faith in reforms " the current political zig-zag course , the lack of real reform prospects and the poor communication of reform efforts by the government have resulted in more and more people feeling insecure , " botschatzki said .

" and therefore we discuss the earned tax credit systems in the united states , for example , something we should add to the wages to remain competitive and at the same time have adequate living in the relatively high cost country germany . " von dohnanyi has explicitly supported president köhler 's recent statement that equal living conditions will not be achieved . he said the man had the courage to speak the truth rather than stooping to populist formulas which didn ’ t help anyone in the country .

" let ’ s not forget that eastern germany now has an extremely modern transport and telecommunications infrastructure .
there are also very competitive clusters of industry in the east , like the semi-conductor centers in dresden or the automobile industry in leipzig . " botschatzki also spoke of the big strides which have been made in the metal-working and electronics industries in the east .
following a downturn in productivity in the period before 1997 , he said the past seven years had seen an enormous upswing in these sectors , creating more than 50,000 jobs across the east . he added that much more could be achieved with clear political signals from berlin .
easterners , he claimed , had proven in the past that they were willing to take their share of reforms , as long as those reforms made sense to them . people need faith in reforms " the current political zig-zag course , the lack of real reform prospects and the poor communication of reform efforts by the government have resulted in more and more people feeling insecure , " botschatzki said .
" confidence and faith in the government ’ s policies is decreasing , and that leads in the end to less stability in our democratic system . " botschatzki added that right after german unification in 1990 , easterners had hoped that living standards across the country would level out within 10 years or so .
they now had to accept that this was wishful thinking .
the same applied to their hopes for equal wages . klaus von dohnanyi , who was commissioned by the government to work out a more effective economic program for the east , says people have to face current realities . they 'll have to accept new low-wage employment opportunities rather than going on the dole . " we have new competition also from eastern europe and must see that these people in east germany are capable of making a living , " he said .
" and therefore we discuss the earned tax credit systems in the united states , for example , something we should add to the wages to remain competitive and at the same time have adequate living in the relatively high cost country germany . " von dohnanyi has explicitly supported president köhler 's recent statement that equal living conditions will not be achieved . he said the man had the courage to speak the truth rather than stooping to populist formulas which didn ’ t help anyone in the country .
president köhler continues to draw massive criticism from predominantly eastern policy-makers for saying that equal living standards are nothing but a myth . hardy graupner -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a land of differences while the core of german president horst köhler 's remarks on differences in living and employment standards focused on eastern and western states , figures published on tuesday show discrepencies across the whole country .

now , a recent spate of books , films , and exhibitions is taking a critical look at this chapter - and making it a matter of debate . england , france and belgium are among the countries most often mentioned when historians consider europe 's colonial history and its related atrocities .
lesser known , however , is the fact that for 20 years , between 1884 and 1914 , germany lorded over its own swaths of the african continent , including areas of what are today namibia , cameroon , togo , rwanda and burundi . in fact , the infamous congo conference , where european colonial interests divided-up africa and its natural resources , took place in berlin in 1884 .
and though germany only managed to hold onto its share for two decades , it certainly wracked up a record of carnage on par with that of better-known colonial powers . despite these uncomfortable facts , this historical chapter has been all but forgotten by the german public .
now , a spate of new books , films , exhibitions and conferences - all coinciding with the 100th anniversary of two of germany 's most bloody african episodes - are making it a matter of public debate .
for a country already fatigued by efforts to come to terms with the atrocities of world war ii , that 's quite an accomplishment . a short and violent occupation the brief 20 years germany controlled parts of west and east africa were not peaceful .
in 1904 in the german territory of south west africa , today namibia , german troops led by general lothar von trotha mercilessly put down a rebellion of the indigenous herero people . by the time the conflict ended four years later , between 45,000 to 65,000 herero were killed , many of whom suffered in work camps some consider the forerunners to wwii-era concentration camps . a year later , in the german held south east africa , today tanzania , the so-called maji-maji war broke out .
there , the local population also rebelled against german rule and likewise suffered the consequences : an estimated 250,000 to 300,000 - one third of the total population - were killed . slow to offer an apology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on the anniversary of the massacre , a group of herero march to honor the dead .
with this year 's 100th anniversary of the atrocities in namibia and the upcoming 100th anniversary of the war in tanzania , the german government has been under added pressure to offer an official apology , which , much to the dismay of herero leaders , has been slow in coming . but in august at the anniversary event in namibia honoring the herero dead , german development and aid minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul came the closest yet any german official has ever gotten to those magic words . " we germans accept our historic and moral responsibility and the guilt incurred by germans , " she told a delighted crowd of more than 1,000 people . " the atrocities committed at that time would have been termed genocide , " she added . however , she ruled out financial compensation for the victims ' descendents ; there is an ongoing lawsuit seeking € 3.3 billion -lrb- $ 4 billion -rrb- in damages . books , exhibitions remind a reluctant public with that historic statement , the german government showed its willingness to take on board yet another difficult chapter in the country 's history .
the general public - with the help of several recent books , films and exhibitions , all addressing the subject - is following suit . gerhard seyfried 's book " herero , " a novel written from the point of view of a young german sent to the western region of africa at the height of the conflict , came out last year and was followed this year by martin baer 's film " white ghosts , " a documentary also looking at the plight of the herero . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the house of world cultures is looking at the legacy of colonialism .
on thursday , the house of world cultures -lrb- haus der kulturen der welt -rrb- in berlin will launch a major multi-disciplinary exhibition entitled " black atlantic " , that - among other things , will look at the legacy of colonial occupation , including that undertaken by germany .
capping things off , an anti-colonialism conference is scheduled to take place in berlin in november . the issue of germany 's colonial legacy has gone beyond the halls of academia , where a few experts debated its significance in relative obscurity , and into the realm of popular culture .
in the process , some say germany is shedding its colonial amnesia . what took so long ? in critically examining its colonial past , germany is following a trend already evident in other former colonial powers .
the question is , what took germany so long ? " when it comes to questions of guilt and responsibility , the germans are simply tired , " gerhard seyfried , author of the novel " herero " , told dw-world , referring to the arduous task of working through the legacy of nazi atrocities . colonial history greatly interested germans before the war , but was simply eclipsed by subsequent events , seyfried said . pascal grosse , a historian who has written extensively on the subject and will participate in a panel discussion on the topic in conjunction with the " black atlantic " exhibition in berlin , concurred . " the scale of the holocaust overshadowed previous events , " he told dw-world . but with an ever-more interconnected world resulting from globalization , germans , like others in different countries , are increasingly interested in their role in the world - both past and present , grosse said . a century later , some debate relevance but that said , what purpose does dredging up events so far in the past serve ? " we need to look at this material again and again , it 's never enough to say we 've done that , let 's move on , " shaheen merali , a curator who put together the visual arts component of the " black atlantic " exhibition told dw-world . for seyfried , such critical self reflection of colonial atrocities serves the same purpose similar reflection on world war ii-era crimes does .

the exhibition contains an 80 meter panoramic mural depicting world events on a lower level and european and eu events on an upper level .
the display uses pictures of european figures , past and present , graphs , pictograms as well as sound recordings and a video projection of the latest european news .
the lower level spans global history , beginning with the big bang roughly 13.7 billion years ago and ending with the eu 's row over the us-led invasion of iraq .
describing the european leaders in favor of the action as " the axis of reflexive atlanticism , " the exhibition notes , " ignoring public opinion in their home countries , many of europe 's leaders follow america to war in iraq . "
but perhaps the most interesting part of the exhibition is its projection of the eu 's future .
this slightly tongue-in-cheek section projects several highly ambitious and some downright impossible events in the next ten to 15 years .
in 2010 , according to the exhibition , the eu will expand to include albania , armenia , belarus , bosnia and herzegovina , georgia , macedonia , moldova , montenegro , serbia and the ukraine .
following this , in 2015 , the eu will take in morocco , algeria , egypt , tunisia , libya , jordan , israel , palestine and change its name from the european union to simply " the union . "
the exhibition also sees the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- being phased out in 2012 after a massive " scrap the cap " campaign by citizens .
also in this vision of the future , the eu will adopt chinese as its official language in 2012 .

the exhibition contains an 80 meter panoramic mural depicting world events on a lower level and european and eu events on an upper level .
the display uses pictures of european figures , past and present , graphs , pictograms as well as sound recordings and a video projection of the latest european news .
the lower level spans global history , beginning with the big bang roughly 13.7 billion years ago and ending with the eu 's row over the us-led invasion of iraq .
describing the european leaders in favor of the action as " the axis of reflexive atlanticism , " the exhibition notes , " ignoring public opinion in their home countries , many of europe 's leaders follow america to war in iraq . "
but perhaps the most interesting part of the exhibition is its projection of the eu 's future .
this slightly tongue-in-cheek section projects several highly ambitious and some downright impossible events in the next ten to 15 years .
in 2010 , according to the exhibition , the eu will expand to include albania , armenia , belarus , bosnia and herzegovina , georgia , macedonia , moldova , montenegro , serbia and the ukraine .
following this , in 2015 , the eu will take in morocco , algeria , egypt , tunisia , libya , jordan , israel , palestine and change its name from the european union to simply " the union . "

one of them is the müritz national park in mecklenburg-western pomerania . the landscape formed 10,000 years ago by the ice age belongs today to the most beautiful areas in the northeastern germany .
over 1000 sparkling blue and immaculate-clean lakes are surrounded by forests and open country side . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : picnic on lake müritz the biggest lakes in this area are next to the müritz lake plauer , lake fleesen and lake kölpen . müritz is a slavic word and means little sea .
lake müritz is 117 square kilometers -lrb- 45.2 square miles -rrb- big , 23 kilometers -lrb- 14.3 miles -rrb- wide and 29 kilometers long .
almost a jungle the müritz national park is half way between hamburg and berlin .
the 322 square kilometer big park consists mostly of forests and water .
when taking a journey through the park , one realizes quickly that the word natural stems indeed from the word nature - the green paradise resembles a jungle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müritz-steam ship the so-called developing zone comprises the biggest part of the national park .
this means that in that zone as little as possible is intervened with nature , giving nature the chance to mature in the course of time to an important completely untouched core zone .
however , much attention is devoted to eco tourism in order to make this unique nature heritage accessible to the general public . bird watching the national park is most notably famous for its white-tailed-eagles , ospreys and cranes .
the cranes -lrb- a species that has almost died out -rrb- are a living proof of the faultless nature .
observing the white-tailed-eagles in their nests is a truly unique experience . a camera , focused on the nest , makes it possible to follow every movement of the raptors and their babies on a television set in the national park information center .
such a close up view in the daily lives of the eagles would otherwise not be possible . mobile without boundaries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müritz national park the best way to discover the müritz national park is by bike .
however , walks , boat trips or horse rides offer great alternatives .
the priesterbäckersee is definitely worth a visit .
a long moor catwalk leads you to this beautiful lake which forms part of the many lakes in this area and from which the water lilies can be marvelled at best . because of the rising number of visitors the national park arranged for a so-called visitor-control device to keep its original beauty intact .
when entering the park , visitors are informed on how to use the park ’ s facilities .
national park tickets come in handy .
buses , ships and canoes provide an excellent transportation net .

but it would be " inconceivable to remain silent " , stressed parliament 's new president josep borrell while setting out his priorities for the next two and a half years to the house .
the main thing at stake is " our relations with the islamic world " , whatever the decision on turkey , borrell said .
promises made over 40 years ago must be reliable .
the prospect of eu membership has led to more reform in the last few years in turkey than had been achieved in 40 years of discussion , said martin schulz , speaking on behalf of the socialist group .
borrell will deliver parliament 's opinion to eu leaders in december .
before this , on sept .
23 , turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan will hold talks with the leaders of the parliamentary groups .
the commission will then publish its opinion on turkey 's readiness to join the eu on oct .

after getting bad grades from the oecd , german politicians are calling for extensive reforms of the nation 's schools .
it 's not enough to spend more money , the education system needs to be completely re-worked , they said . a day after germany brought home failing grades from the organization for economic cooperation and development for its education system , the nation 's politicians responded like worried parents .
it was the second time in two years that the country , which prides itself on producing some of the world 's leading philosophers and scientists , had received negative marks for government spending , number of hours spent in the classroom and pupil-teacher ratios .
on wednesday , education experts in the government coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens minced no words in calling on germany to prepare itself better for the future .
in addition to increasing much-needed government investment in the education system -lrb- only about 9.7 percent of total spending goes towards schools -rrb- , the politicians called for far-reaching reforms of the nation 's traditional school structure .
school for all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teachers need to spend more time with each pupil in the elementary schools .
krista sager , parliamentary fraction leader for the greens , told the berliner zeitung germany needed to move away from its three-tiered school model and introduce " a school for all , " where pupils would stay together in one system for nine or ten years .
the current division into three different schools , each tailored to specific education abilities and skills , is " more befitting of a medieval feudal system than a modern society , " criticized christoph matschie , head of the spd for the eastern state of thuringia .
a general school for all pupils is better equipped for promoting common education standards than a system that " sorts " children at an early age according to their abilities , explained the former state secretary for the education ministry .
matschie told the paper that the traditional division into college-prep highschool , secondary school and vocational school , was partially to blame for the poor results in the oecd study .
pupils performed better when they learned together , he and sager argued .
schleswig-holstein 's state minister for culture and education was also convinced that the three-tiered education system is no longer beneficial to the country .
ute erdsiek-rave said her party of social democrats would campaign together with the greens during the next state election for a reform that supports a " school for all . "
however , a complete revamping of the school system would take between 10 and 15 years , she admitted .
more financial support needed opposition leader angela merkel dismissed calls to introduce such far-reaching reforms .
the head of the conservative christian democrats union said the oecd in no way implied that germany 's traditional three-tiered school model was to blame for failures in german education .
the international study indicated specifically that germany had done too little to improve standards in kindergartens and elementary schools , she argued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a typical german classroom ?
germany 's problems were largely the result of large classrooms and too little instruction time , she said , both of which could be rectified with more investment .
the pupil-teacher ratio needs to be improved , merkel said , pointing to the statistic that germany had 24 pupils per teacher in elementary schools , the highest number among the 30 industrial countries surveyed .
t with a view to government plans to expand the number of all-day schools , merkel said germany was on the right road to increasing the amount of time children spend in the classroom .
the oecd study showed that german pupils aged seven and eight attend school on average for 626 hours a year , compared with 788 on average in the oecd .
germany needs to invest more in building all-day schools , she said and called for a speedy introduction of tax reforms that would open up more funds for education .
money is not the answer " we must once and for all start investing in the education system , " merkel told rbb information radio on wednesday .
but the head of the german union for teachers and researchers , eva-maria stange , cautioned against thinking only in terms of financial support .
german politicians needed to " do their homework , " she said .

after getting bad grades from the oecd , german politicians are calling for extensive reforms of the nation 's schools .
it 's not enough to spend more money , the education system needs to be completely re-worked , they said . a day after germany brought home failing grades from the organization for economic cooperation and development for its education system , the nation 's politicians responded like worried parents .
it was the second time in two years that the country , which prides itself on producing some of the world 's leading philosophers and scientists , had received negative marks for government spending , number of hours spent in the classroom and pupil-teacher ratios .
on wednesday , education experts in the government coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens minced no words in calling on germany to prepare itself better for the future .
in addition to increasing much-needed government investment in the education system -lrb- only about 9.7 percent of total spending goes towards schools -rrb- , the politicians called for far-reaching reforms of the nation 's traditional school structure .
school for all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teachers need to spend more time with each pupil in the elementary schools .
krista sager , parliamentary fraction leader for the greens , told the berliner zeitung germany needed to move away from its three-tiered school model and introduce " a school for all , " where pupils would stay together in one system for nine or ten years .
the current division into three different schools , each tailored to specific education abilities and skills , is " more befitting of a medieval feudal system than a modern society , " criticized christoph matschie , head of the spd for the eastern state of thuringia .
a general school for all pupils is better equipped for promoting common education standards than a system that " sorts " children at an early age according to their abilities , explained the former state secretary for the education ministry .
matschie told the paper that the traditional division into college-prep highschool , secondary school and vocational school , was partially to blame for the poor results in the oecd study .
pupils performed better when they learned together , he and sager argued .
schleswig-holstein 's state minister for culture and education was also convinced that the three-tiered education system is no longer beneficial to the country .
ute erdsiek-rave said her party of social democrats would campaign together with the greens during the next state election for a reform that supports a " school for all . "
however , a complete revamping of the school system would take between 10 and 15 years , she admitted .
more financial support needed opposition leader angela merkel dismissed calls to introduce such far-reaching reforms .
the head of the conservative christian democrats union said the oecd in no way implied that germany 's traditional three-tiered school model was to blame for failures in german education .
the international study indicated specifically that germany had done too little to improve standards in kindergartens and elementary schools , she argued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a typical german classroom ?
germany 's problems were largely the result of large classrooms and too little instruction time , she said , both of which could be rectified with more investment .
the pupil-teacher ratio needs to be improved , merkel said , pointing to the statistic that germany had 24 pupils per teacher in elementary schools , the highest number among the 30 industrial countries surveyed .
t with a view to government plans to expand the number of all-day schools , merkel said germany was on the right road to increasing the amount of time children spend in the classroom .
the oecd study showed that german pupils aged seven and eight attend school on average for 626 hours a year , compared with 788 on average in the oecd .
germany needs to invest more in building all-day schools , she said and called for a speedy introduction of tax reforms that would open up more funds for education .
money is not the answer " we must once and for all start investing in the education system , " merkel told rbb information radio on wednesday .
but the head of the german union for teachers and researchers , eva-maria stange , cautioned against thinking only in terms of financial support .
german politicians needed to " do their homework , " she said .

after getting bad grades from the oecd , german politicians are calling for extensive reforms of the nation 's schools .
it 's not enough to spend more money , the education system needs to be completely re-worked , they said . a day after germany brought home failing grades from the organization for economic cooperation and development for its education system , the nation 's politicians responded like worried parents .
it was the second time in two years that the country , which prides itself on producing some of the world 's leading philosophers and scientists , had received negative marks for government spending , number of hours spent in the classroom and pupil-teacher ratios .
on wednesday , education experts in the government coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens minced no words in calling on germany to prepare itself better for the future .
in addition to increasing much-needed government investment in the education system -lrb- only about 9.7 percent of total spending goes towards schools -rrb- , the politicians called for far-reaching reforms of the nation 's traditional school structure .
school for all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teachers need to spend more time with each pupil in the elementary schools .
krista sager , parliamentary fraction leader for the greens , told the berliner zeitung germany needed to move away from its three-tiered school model and introduce " a school for all , " where pupils would stay together in one system for nine or ten years .
the current division into three different schools , each tailored to specific education abilities and skills , is " more befitting of a medieval feudal system than a modern society , " criticized christoph matschie , head of the spd for the eastern state of thuringia .
a general school for all pupils is better equipped for promoting common education standards than a system that " sorts " children at an early age according to their abilities , explained the former state secretary for the education ministry .
matschie told the paper that the traditional division into college-prep highschool , secondary school and vocational school , was partially to blame for the poor results in the oecd study .
pupils performed better when they learned together , he and sager argued .
schleswig-holstein 's state minister for culture and education was also convinced that the three-tiered education system is no longer beneficial to the country .
ute erdsiek-rave said her party of social democrats would campaign together with the greens during the next state election for a reform that supports a " school for all . "
however , a complete revamping of the school system would take between 10 and 15 years , she admitted .
more financial support needed opposition leader angela merkel dismissed calls to introduce such far-reaching reforms .
the head of the conservative christian democrats union said the oecd in no way implied that germany 's traditional three-tiered school model was to blame for failures in german education .
the international study indicated specifically that germany had done too little to improve standards in kindergartens and elementary schools , she argued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a typical german classroom ?
germany 's problems were largely the result of large classrooms and too little instruction time , she said , both of which could be rectified with more investment .
the pupil-teacher ratio needs to be improved , merkel said , pointing to the statistic that germany had 24 pupils per teacher in elementary schools , the highest number among the 30 industrial countries surveyed .
t with a view to government plans to expand the number of all-day schools , merkel said germany was on the right road to increasing the amount of time children spend in the classroom .
the oecd study showed that german pupils aged seven and eight attend school on average for 626 hours a year , compared with 788 on average in the oecd .
germany needs to invest more in building all-day schools , she said and called for a speedy introduction of tax reforms that would open up more funds for education .
money is not the answer " we must once and for all start investing in the education system , " merkel told rbb information radio on wednesday .
but the head of the german union for teachers and researchers , eva-maria stange , cautioned against thinking only in terms of financial support .
german politicians needed to " do their homework , " she said .
the oecd report clearly showed " german schools need not just more money , but fundamental reforms . " dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bad grades for german schools germany ’ s school system has gotten bad marks yet again .
an annual oecd report suggested that germany spends too little on learning , students get too little instruction and too few people get university degrees .

young germans have long labored under the weight of guilt from the nation 's past but have recently pushed for more pride in their country .
however , pro-german lyrics in pop songs are causing concern . germany 's gradual relaxation towards its national identity is causing concern among recording artists and musicians as an increasing number of songs appearing in the pop charts seem to contain lyrics which could be misconstrued as nationalist . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul van dyk for months , the single " we " has been riding high in the german charts .
a collaboration between techno dj paul van dyk -lrb- photo -rrb- and wolfsheim singer peter heppner , the song proudly recounts german post-war history with lyrics such as " i ask myself who we are .
we are we .
divided , defeated but , nevertheless , in the end , we 're still alive . " the song is accompanied by a video that contains images of women rebuilding bombed cities with their bare hands and amputee soldiers returning from the war . " we " portrays germans as victims in a land split between the allies and its people humiliated .
but there is no mention of the war , of the holocaust or the third reich .
instead the song celebrates the german success history : the reconstruction , the miracle of bern and the reunification . it is , essentially , a love song to germany . no more shame over nationality another example comes from the group mia in the song " it is what it is . "
front woman mieze sings about german pride and the creation of the national colors displayed in the post-war flag : " a gulp of the black coffee wakes me up , your red mouth touches me gently , at this moment , it clicks and the yellow sun rises , " referring to the colors in germany 's national flag : black , red and gold . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mieze and other mia members in a publicity shot mieze later sings about the rejection of past generations and the embracing of a new german identity : " if anyone asks me now where i come from , i no longer feel sorry for myself … i risk it all for love , i feel ready . " such words and images are making some people uncomfortable .
germans have struggled for years with the weight of guilt associated with the nation 's record in two world wars but younger generations have begun to reclaim german identity and move on from the crimes of the past to take pride in their country . target audience rich pickings for neo-nazis but some commentators see a danger in popular music becoming the voice of a new german pride , fearing it could be hijacked by far right organizations and used as nationalist propaganda in a market targeted at a young , impressionable record buying public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazi demonstrators anetta kahane of the amadeu antonio foundation , a group based in berlin which promotes democratic initiatives to resist right wing extremism , views the development in german pop music with concern . " far right organizations think this is great , " she said .
" they rightly perceive this as national pride suddenly becoming something normal . " far-right groups use music 's influence the reactions of the neo-nazis show that kahane is right .
the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- mouthpiece national voice wrote that mia stands up for a " relaxed attitude to its own nation . "
mia 's attitude has " scratched out " the left-wing supremacy in german youth , wrote the paper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rammstein flirtations with the far-right are not a new phenomenon .
groups such as rammstein -lrb- photo -rrb- and , more specifically , böhse onkelz which made no secret the fact that it was a part of the german skinhead scene in the 1980s and published songs with titles like " turks out " and " germany for the germans , " were championed by neo-nazis but have since renounced their right-wing leanings . mia on the other hand keeps pointing out that they do not want to be associated with rightwing extremists .
they add that they simply want to help jump-start a discussion about german identity . but musicians can not choose their fans : at a mia concert in the western german town of bielefeld , three rightwing extremists attacked a dark-skinned student , according to local news reports .
organizers of another festival at which mia was scheduled to appear asked the band 's management to comment on the incident .

young germans have long labored under the weight of guilt from the nation 's past but have recently pushed for more pride in their country .
however , pro-german lyrics in pop songs are causing concern . germany 's gradual relaxation towards its national identity is causing concern among recording artists and musicians as an increasing number of songs appearing in the pop charts seem to contain lyrics which could be misconstrued as nationalist . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul van dyk for months , the single " we " has been riding high in the german charts .
a collaboration between techno dj paul van dyk -lrb- photo -rrb- and wolfsheim singer peter heppner , the song proudly recounts german post-war history with lyrics such as " i ask myself who we are .
we are we .
divided , defeated but , nevertheless , in the end , we 're still alive . " the song is accompanied by a video that contains images of women rebuilding bombed cities with their bare hands and amputee soldiers returning from the war . " we " portrays germans as victims in a land split between the allies and its people humiliated .
but there is no mention of the war , of the holocaust or the third reich .
instead the song celebrates the german success history : the reconstruction , the miracle of bern and the reunification . it is , essentially , a love song to germany . no more shame over nationality another example comes from the group mia in the song " it is what it is . "
front woman mieze sings about german pride and the creation of the national colors displayed in the post-war flag : " a gulp of the black coffee wakes me up , your red mouth touches me gently , at this moment , it clicks and the yellow sun rises , " referring to the colors in germany 's national flag : black , red and gold . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mieze and other mia members in a publicity shot mieze later sings about the rejection of past generations and the embracing of a new german identity : " if anyone asks me now where i come from , i no longer feel sorry for myself … i risk it all for love , i feel ready . " such words and images are making some people uncomfortable .

he 's accompanied by a delegation of business and science leaders pushing for deeper economic and political ties . schröder is visiting hungary on the occasion of the 15th anniversary of the date hungary opened its borders to east germans and allowed them to leave to the west - a development that created an extremely positive new dimension in west germany 's ties with the then-eastern bloc nation .
earlier this year , former german president johannes rau spoke of the importance of that development during a visit to budapest .
" we owe an awful lot to hungary ...
if hungary had n't shut off its electrical fence on may 2 , 1989 , which allowed many from the ddr to come to west germany , the developments in prague on sept .
20 would n't have happened and the -lrb- berlin -rrb- wall would n't have fallen on nov .
9 , " rau said .
" in some respects , the hungarians were the intiators of german unity . "
for a long time , the magyars would have been thankful for a few handouts from germany .
but the burdens of german unity and the costs of rebuilding the east german infrastructure left little room for german financial aid to the hungarians .
a visit with new prime minister designate still , relations between the two countries have developed positively .
there are no major sticking points between the countries , and schröder can look forward to a relaxing trip aimed at deepening the countries ' political , economic and scientific cooperation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- right -rrb- , and outgoing hungarian prime minister peter medgyessy schröder will be meeting with outgoing hungarian prime minister peter medgyessy , who announced his resignation in august following a government coalition crisis , as well as his nominated successor , ferenc gyurcsany .
the 43-year-old shooting star of the socialists is expected to be confirmed as prime minister by parliament at the end of the month .
like the political developments between germany and hungary , business ties are also both strong and dynamic .
currently , germany is hungary 's most-important trading partner - a position that could further grow with hungary 's european union membership , which came into effect on may 1 .
germany is also an important foreign investor in hungary .
since 1989 , german companies have invested over € 12 billion -lrb- $ 14.6 billion -rrb- in hungary , representing 55 percent of all foreign investment and creating more than 200,000 jobs .
hungary has an abundance of red tape nevertheless , german companies do n't shy away from the fact that hungary has become less attractive for business .
the country has continually failed in efforts to trim red tape , and there is also a lack of educated workers .
additionally , salaries have risen by 50 percent since 2002 and the exchange of hungary 's currency , the forint , has been a roller coaster ride since june 2003 .
worse yet , contradictory statements about the country 's currency exchange rates and inflation goals and a lax fiscal policy have engendered considerable uncertainty .
but these facts have not been lost on gyurcsany , who has said making hungary more attractive to foreign investors will be a priority .
" in my opinion , it 's important that the country 's economic policy reflect stability and calm so that hungary can continue to be a goal for foreign investors , " he said .
despite some tougher times in recent months , most of the 54 german companies active there are satisfied with hungary as a place for doing business .
indeed , many are planning additional investments - a good basis for deepening economic ties between the two countries .
and on his visit on wednesday , schröder will make that his priority . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hungary mulls future of nuclear energy hungary has been a proponent of nuclear energy for decades .

worse yet , contradictory statements about the country 's currency exchange rates and inflation goals and a lax fiscal policy have engendered considerable uncertainty .
but these facts have not been lost on gyurcsany , who has said making hungary more attractive to foreign investors will be a priority .
" in my opinion , it 's important that the country 's economic policy reflect stability and calm so that hungary can continue to be a goal for foreign investors , " he said .

" an inter-ministerial group will be charged with evaluating the losses suffered by poland as a result of world war ii , " the polish foreign minister said tuesday following a government meeting to examine a controversial parliament resolution last week that called for war reparations from germany .
cimoszewicz said the exercise was purely intended to provide a " reminder of the causes and effects of war , " and reiterated the government 's refusal to seek reparations from berlin .
" our intention is not linked to any demand for compensation , " he said .
" it is a case of illustrating and reminding those who may have forgotten about world war ii and its consequences . "
" it is perhaps such forgetfulness that has led to demands for compensation from us , " he added , in reference to a series of recent claims for restitution of property seized from germans forced to flee poland after 1945 .
cimoszewicz added that the government would " work out provisions to support its citizens if they were brought before the courts over a claim for compensation . "
" the question of compensation on either side is closed , " he said , while calling for a " stronger dialogue " to prevent the debate between warsaw and berlin from " veering in the wrong direction . "

after getting bad grades from the oecd , german politicians are calling for extensive reforms of the nation 's schools .
it 's not enough to spend more money , the education system needs to be completely re-worked , they said . a day after germany brought home failing grades from the organization for economic cooperation and development for its education system , the nation 's politicians responded like worried parents .
it was the second time in two years that the country , which prides itself on producing some of the world 's leading philosophers and scientists , had received negative marks for government spending , number of hours spent in the classroom and pupil-teacher ratios .
on wednesday , education experts in the government coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens minced no words in calling on germany to prepare itself better for the future .
in addition to increasing much-needed government investment in the education system -lrb- only about 9.7 percent of total spending goes towards schools -rrb- , the politicians called for far-reaching reforms of the nation 's traditional school structure .
school for all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teachers need to spend more time with each pupil in the elementary schools .
krista sager , parliamentary fraction leader for the greens , told the berliner zeitung germany needed to move away from its three-tiered school model and introduce " a school for all , " where pupils would stay together in one system for nine or ten years .
the current division into three different schools , each tailored to specific education abilities and skills , is " more befitting of a medieval feudal system than a modern society , " criticized christoph matschie , head of the spd for the eastern state of thuringia .
a general school for all pupils is better equipped for promoting common education standards than a system that " sorts " children at an early age according to their abilities , explained the former state secretary for the education ministry .
matschie told the paper that the traditional division into college-prep highschool , secondary school and vocational school , was partially to blame for the poor results in the oecd study .
pupils performed better when they learned together , he and sager argued .
schleswig-holstein 's state minister for culture and education was also convinced that the three-tiered education system is no longer beneficial to the country .
ute erdsiek-rave said her party of social democrats would campaign together with the greens during the next state election for a reform that supports a " school for all . "
however , a complete revamping of the school system would take between 10 and 15 years , she admitted .
more financial support needed opposition leader angela merkel dismissed calls to introduce such far-reaching reforms .
the head of the conservative christian democrats union said the oecd in no way implied that germany 's traditional three-tiered school model was to blame for failures in german education .
the international study indicated specifically that germany had done too little to improve standards in kindergartens and elementary schools , she argued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a typical german classroom ?
germany 's problems were largely the result of large classrooms and too little instruction time , she said , both of which could be rectified with more investment .
the pupil-teacher ratio needs to be improved , merkel said , pointing to the statistic that germany had 24 pupils per teacher in elementary schools , the highest number among the 30 industrial countries surveyed .
t with a view to government plans to expand the number of all-day schools , merkel said germany was on the right road to increasing the amount of time children spend in the classroom .
the oecd study showed that german pupils aged seven and eight attend school on average for 626 hours a year , compared with 788 on average in the oecd .
germany needs to invest more in building all-day schools , she said and called for a speedy introduction of tax reforms that would open up more funds for education .
money is not the answer " we must once and for all start investing in the education system , " merkel told rbb information radio on wednesday .
but the head of the german union for teachers and researchers , eva-maria stange , cautioned against thinking only in terms of financial support .
german politicians needed to " do their homework , " she said .

he 's accompanied by a delegation of business and science leaders pushing for deeper economic and political ties . schröder is visiting hungary on the occasion of the 15th anniversary of the date hungary opened its borders to east germans and allowed them to leave to the west - a development that created an extremely positive new dimension in west germany 's ties with the then-eastern bloc nation .
earlier this year , former german president johannes rau spoke of the importance of that development during a visit to budapest .
" we owe an awful lot to hungary ...
if hungary had n't shut off its electrical fence on may 2 , 1989 , which allowed many from the ddr to come to west germany , the developments in prague on sept .
20 would n't have happened and the -lrb- berlin -rrb- wall would n't have fallen on nov .
9 , " rau said .
" in some respects , the hungarians were the intiators of german unity . "
for a long time , the magyars would have been thankful for a few handouts from germany .
but the burdens of german unity and the costs of rebuilding the east german infrastructure left little room for german financial aid to the hungarians .
a visit with new prime minister designate still , relations between the two countries have developed positively .
there are no major sticking points between the countries , and schröder can look forward to a relaxing trip aimed at deepening the countries ' political , economic and scientific cooperation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- right -rrb- , and outgoing hungarian prime minister peter medgyessy schröder will be meeting with outgoing hungarian prime minister peter medgyessy , who announced his resignation in august following a government coalition crisis , as well as his nominated successor , ferenc gyurcsany .
the 43-year-old shooting star of the socialists is expected to be confirmed as prime minister by parliament at the end of the month .
like the political developments between germany and hungary , business ties are also both strong and dynamic .
currently , germany is hungary 's most-important trading partner - a position that could further grow with hungary 's european union membership , which came into effect on may 1 .
germany is also an important foreign investor in hungary .
since 1989 , german companies have invested over € 12 billion -lrb- $ 14.6 billion -rrb- in hungary , representing 55 percent of all foreign investment and creating more than 200,000 jobs .
hungary has an abundance of red tape nevertheless , german companies do n't shy away from the fact that hungary has become less attractive for business .
the country has continually failed in efforts to trim red tape , and there is also a lack of educated workers .
additionally , salaries have risen by 50 percent since 2002 and the exchange of hungary 's currency , the forint , has been a roller coaster ride since june 2003 .
worse yet , contradictory statements about the country 's currency exchange rates and inflation goals and a lax fiscal policy have engendered considerable uncertainty .
but these facts have not been lost on gyurcsany , who has said making hungary more attractive to foreign investors will be a priority .
" in my opinion , it 's important that the country 's economic policy reflect stability and calm so that hungary can continue to be a goal for foreign investors , " he said .
despite some tougher times in recent months , most of the 54 german companies active there are satisfied with hungary as a place for doing business .
indeed , many are planning additional investments - a good basis for deepening economic ties between the two countries .
and on his visit on wednesday , schröder will make that his priority . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : hungary mulls future of nuclear energy hungary has been a proponent of nuclear energy for decades .

it 's not enough to spend more money , the education system needs to be completely re-worked , they said . a day after germany brought home failing grades from the organization for economic cooperation and development for its education system , the nation 's politicians responded like worried parents .
it was the second time in two years that the country , which prides itself on producing some of the world 's leading philosophers and scientists , had received negative marks for government spending , number of hours spent in the classroom and pupil-teacher ratios .
on wednesday , education experts in the government coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens minced no words in calling on germany to prepare itself better for the future .
in addition to increasing much-needed government investment in the education system -lrb- only about 9.7 percent of total spending goes towards schools -rrb- , the politicians called for far-reaching reforms of the nation 's traditional school structure .
school for all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teachers need to spend more time with each pupil in the elementary schools .
krista sager , parliamentary fraction leader for the greens , told the berliner zeitung germany needed to move away from its three-tiered school model and introduce " a school for all , " where pupils would stay together in one system for nine or ten years .
the current division into three different schools , each tailored to specific education abilities and skills , is " more befitting of a medieval feudal system than a modern society , " criticized christoph matschie , head of the spd for the eastern state of thuringia .
a general school for all pupils is better equipped for promoting common education standards than a system that " sorts " children at an early age according to their abilities , explained the former state secretary for the education ministry .
matschie told the paper that the traditional division into college-prep highschool , secondary school and vocational school , was partially to blame for the poor results in the oecd study .
pupils performed better when they learned together , he and sager argued .
schleswig-holstein 's state minister for culture and education was also convinced that the three-tiered education system is no longer beneficial to the country .
ute erdsiek-rave said her party of social democrats would campaign together with the greens during the next state election for a reform that supports a " school for all . "
however , a complete revamping of the school system would take between 10 and 15 years , she admitted .
more financial support needed opposition leader angela merkel dismissed calls to introduce such far-reaching reforms .
the head of the conservative christian democrats union said the oecd in no way implied that germany 's traditional three-tiered school model was to blame for failures in german education .
the international study indicated specifically that germany had done too little to improve standards in kindergartens and elementary schools , she argued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a typical german classroom ?
germany 's problems were largely the result of large classrooms and too little instruction time , she said , both of which could be rectified with more investment .
the pupil-teacher ratio needs to be improved , merkel said , pointing to the statistic that germany had 24 pupils per teacher in elementary schools , the highest number among the 30 industrial countries surveyed .
t with a view to government plans to expand the number of all-day schools , merkel said germany was on the right road to increasing the amount of time children spend in the classroom .
the oecd study showed that german pupils aged seven and eight attend school on average for 626 hours a year , compared with 788 on average in the oecd .
germany needs to invest more in building all-day schools , she said and called for a speedy introduction of tax reforms that would open up more funds for education .
money is not the answer " we must once and for all start investing in the education system , " merkel told rbb information radio on wednesday .
but the head of the german union for teachers and researchers , eva-maria stange , cautioned against thinking only in terms of financial support .
german politicians needed to " do their homework , " she said .
the oecd report clearly showed " german schools need not just more money , but fundamental reforms .

it is to encourage politicians to back a ban to protect hospitality staff and encourage social smokers to give up .

prof markham said health professionals across the uk believed people had the right to breathe clean air .
scotland 's first minister jack mcconnell has said he is actively considering a ban in scotland .
cancer experts in glasgow estimate more than 100 people lose their lives each year because of passive smoking , with a further 2,500 dying from smoking-related illnesses .

the union representing the workers at birmingham heartlands and solihull nhs trust is in talks with their employers , initial hospital services .
unison said contract cleaners and porters get paid less than their in-house counterparts .
it added that talks aimed at addressing the situation were moving too slowly .
' two-tier ' rates figures compiled by unison show contract cleaners working at the two hospitals in east birmingham and solihull currently earn £ 4.65-an-hour , while porters take home £ 4.95 .
cleaners and porters employed directly by the trust earn £ 4.95 and £ 5.20-an-hour respectively with sick pay , pension provision and other benefits .
ray salmon , regional organiser for unison in the west midlands , said although rates are likely to increase slightly in october in line with rises in the minimum wage , there is still a " two-tier " rate of pay .
initial hospital services and the trust have agreed to set up a working party to make a proposal next month .
but mr salmon said his members have told him they believe that is a " delaying tactic " and have asked him to ballot for strike action .
' not militant ' any walkout could involve more than 300 workers , including contract catering staff , whom the union claims are similarly underpaid .
mr salmon said : " if there 's nothing on the table on 15 october then we could be pursuing industrial action by mid-to-late october .
" we have got a promise of movement but a promise of something does n't always materialise .
" people are completely fed up .
they 're not being militant . "
department of health figures published last month showed birmingham heartlands and solihull nhs trust had the seventh worst rate of mrsa infection among general acute hospitals in england over the past three years .
