it 's hoped to scare smokers into quitting . the outgoing european commission this week resorted to drastic measures to curb smoking which , according to the eu executive , accounts for over 650,000 deaths a year in the 25-nation bloc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an example of the eu commission 's latest anti-smoking campaign .
the anti-smoking campaign involves putting graphic images of the health consequences of smoking on cigarette packs .
the series of 42 images includes rotten lungs , decayed teeth , a corpse , a baby with an oxygen mask and gory details of a man with a cancerous tumor on his throat . the collection also includes more subtle allusions to the dangers of smoking - a wrinkled apple accompanies a warning about skin ageing , while a bent cigarette illustrates a warning about impotence . shocking people out of complacency unveiling the campaign in brussels on friday , david byrne , eu commissioner for health and consumer protection , said the aim was to frighten people into kicking the habit .
" people need to be shocked out of their complacency about tobacco , " byrne said .
" i make no apology for some of the pictures we are using . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david byrne , the eu commisioner for consumer and health protection .
he added that part of the idea was to debunk the myth that smoking is cool .
" the true face of smoking is disease , death and horror - not the glamour and sophistication the pushers in the tobacco industry try to portray , " byrne said .
" the eu must hammer home this message to young people via its media campaign and to smokers via their cigarette packs . " the eu said that a study of smoking trends in canada , which introduced picture warnings several years ago , suggests they can help reduce smoking . " smoking kills " the initiative is just the latest in a string of measures the eu has taken in recent years to push smokers , especially teenagers , to kick the habit permanently . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a smoker since 2002 , the eu has tried to reach young smokers via its campaign " feel free to say no " , which involves snazzy video clips and newspaper advertisements featuring well-known musicians and athletes . according to byrne , an increasing number of children , teenagers and women in europe are turning into smokers .
" the number of smokers , particularly teenagers and women , is rising in most countries , " he said .
" that is a very worrying trend for the future . "
experts estimate the annual cost of tobacco-related disease in the eu at € 100 billion a year . since sept .
30 , 2003 , the eu 's tobacco products directive have also made it mandatory for eu member states to print large black and white explicit health warnings such as " smoking kills " and " smoking makes you impotent " on cigarette packs . ireland exemplary on anti-smoking most eu member states have so far introduced anti-smoking measures in some form or the other .
tobacco advertising is limited in most eu nations and is completely banned in a few others . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ross heffernan , a barman at kehoe 's lounge bar in dublin , stacks ashtrays to be put away as the no smoking ban in pubs , restaurants and the work place came into effect in ireland in march , 2004 .
in march , ireland became the first country to ban smoking in restaurants , bars and pubs .
norway and malta have since instituted similar prohibitions and sweden is on the way . the european commission on friday also called on member states to implement long-term measures , such as effective regulators , to tackle smoking levels .
it said that ireland and belgium had already shown interest in passing national laws to implement the graphic picture warnings next year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a grisly example of the eu 's anti-smoking campaign the latest pictorial health warnings are not binding on member states .
individual countries can decide on whether they want to implement them . on friday , germany , which was sharply rebuked earlier this month for its weak implementation of anti-smoking measures in a europe-wide study carried out the european network for smoking prevention , said it will examine whether to introduce the pictorial health warnings . federal drugs commissioner marion caspers-merk at the same time pointed out that government efforts to curb smoking among younger people were working . caspers-merk told news agency dpa that the smoking rate among people up to the age of 18 had fallen to 23 percent from 27 percent within three years . " simple warning " sufficient ? critics of the pictorial warning campaign say it singles out smokers and is offensive .
" smokers are well aware of the health risks of smoking . there 's no need to rub their noses in it , " simon clark , director of british smokers ' lobby group forest told reuters .
" all that is needed is a simple written warning . " he added : " what about fatty foods , dairy products or alcohol ?
if they 're going to target tobacco , there should be written and graphic health warnings on other products as well .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 23.10.2004 russia ratifies kyoto protocol großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's ratification is the first step to reducing carbon dioxide gases russia 's parliament ratified the un climate accord friday in a historic vote that virtually guarantees the treaty to limit greenhouse gas emissions will finally enter into force seven years after its creation . the state duma lower house of parliament approved the treaty by a vote of 334 to 73 , with two abstentions , paving the way for endorsement by the upper chamber and signature by president vladimir putin , who has already signaled his support for the protocol .
since the united states withdrew from the treaty , russia held the key to whether the landmark 1997 draft agreement would cross the threshold to becoming a working international accord .
for environmental groups , the ratification by moscow marks a significant step on the road to reducing greenhouse gases .
" we will look back on today as the moment in history when humanity faced up to its responsibility , " greenpeace said in a statement friday .
" we 'll toast the duma with vodka tonight , but on monday morning we need to roll up our sleeves and get down to the real work , " said the environmental group 's climate policy advisor , steve sawyer .
positive turnaround bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmental experts say an increase in carbon dioxide emissions lead to global warming friday 's vote resuscitated the pact that until recently was considered all but dead after president george w. bush announced in 2001 that the united states , the world 's largest polluter , wanted no further part in it .
russia , which accounts for 17 percent of the world 's carbon dioxide emissions , had gone back and forth on endorsing the treaty ever since it was first drafted .
but finally a month ago , moscow government officials and putin recommended approval .
russia 's ratification was necessary for kyoto to go into force because the treaty stipulated that not only a majority of countries approve it , but that the signatory nations constitute 55 percent of the world 's emissions .
in their discussions ahead of the vote , russian officials hailed the financial opportunities the pact offered moscow - a turnaround from last year , when government leaders , including putin had derided the protocol as too costly .
" this protocol gives russia financial possibilities , " said valery zubov , a deputy with the main pro-kremlin united russia party in the discussion before friday 's vote .
" we have a chance to have a cleaner future . "
financial benefits russia hopes to make a short-term profit through the treaty by being able to sell off some of its quotas for greenhouse gas emissions to other industrialized signatories .
the idea is that under the treaty , countries who have not exhausted their limit for emissions will be able to sell off credit - essentially the right to pollute - to countries needing to increase their emissions quotas .
under the pressure of the market and with an eye for profit , nations will be inclined to produce fewer emissions in order to sell more .
point carbon , a norway-based consulting firm , has estimated that russia could earn $ 10 billion -lrb- € 8 billion -rrb- with the treaty 's help by 2012 .
russian deputy prime minister zhukov said russia would likely approach its kyoto quotas by 2010 if the nation 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- grew by 9 to 10 percent a year .
pressure to ratify bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow 's new arbat street is barely visible through thick smoke in the russian capital .
others have said russia was pressured by the international community into ratifying the pact .
" rusia was under unprecedented pressure , " said natalya narochinitskaya of the nationalist rodina -lrb- motherland -rrb- party .
" it 's ratification was presented as a stamp of a civilized country " and not based on scientific data , she said ahead of the vote .
it is widely believed that russia agreed to sign the protocol in return for the european union - one of the treaty 's major backers - supporting moscow 's bid to enter the world trade organization .
" it 's a very happy day for europe and for me , " said margot wallström , the swedish eu environment commissioner after the duma vote .
" it sends a very forceful signal to the rest of the world . "
" it is also very much a victory for the european union , " she said , in reference to the tug-of-war between brussels and washington over the pact .
despite being isolated in its opposition to the protocol , the united states has refused to endorse the treaty .

" many people were happy this summer when they caught large crayfish in their traps .
but the fact that there were so few small ones means that stocks could be threatened come next year , " lennart edsman , a crayfish researcher at the national board of fisheries , told afp . researchers have for the past five years been worried about the spread of the fungal disease , which has been present in swedish waters to varying extents for almost a century . but their fears are now growing as people illegally implant an imported variety of crayfish , called signal crayfish which carry the plague , into lakes that are home to sweden 's domestic variety , called noble crayfish . in the past , fisheries authorities restricted fishing and imposed minimum size requirements , but all restrictions were lifted in 1994 , to the regret of some . " people are beginning to suggest that maybe we should introduce restrictions again , " edsman said . a gastronomic feast crayfish mature in late summer , making an annual return to the table which is widely celebrated with a crayfish party , or " kraeftskiva " . swedes eat more crayfish than anybody else in the world - some four million kilos per year , or about a half kilo -lrb- one pound -rrb- per inhabitant , most of which is consumed in august during the crayfish party season .
" no other country comes even close when it comes to the amount eaten , " edsman said . boiled in a decoction of dill and then served cold on a heaping platter placed in the middle of the table within everyone 's reach , crayfish are eaten with bread , a matured hard cheese and plenty of schnapps .
raucous drinking songs , funny hats with crayfish designs and paper lanterns are de rigueur . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swedish princess victoria , left , shares a light moment with us chemistry nobel laureate william s. knowles from the united states , during a banquet measuring about 10 to 12 centimeters -lrb- four to five inches -rrb- , crayfish are finger food : no matter how distinguished the dinner guests , they delight in sucking the juices from the underside of the crayfish before breaking off the claws and tail and sucking out the meat , unmindful of the juices dripping down their chin and wrists . crayfish imports sound death knell the swedish tradition of eating crayfish dates back to the 1500s , when german chefs working for the royal family are believed to have introduced the delicacy . but the dish only spread to the broader public in the late 1800s , when it became so popular that over fishing threatened the stocks and authorities limited the period when they could be fished to a few weeks in august . in 1907 , crayfish imported from finland for a party but which were not eaten because they had spoiled were thrown into stockholm 's lake maelaren , infecting sweden with the crayfish plague for the first time .
over the years it killed off a large share of the noble crayfish . in 1969 , north american signal crayfish were transplanted into swedish waters to replace the decimated stocks .
signal crayfish were chosen because their taste is similar to that of the noble crayfish and because they were believed to be resistant to the plague . but that turned out to be incorrect .
in fact , all signal crayfish are carriers of the disease , and they can die of it too , a fact unknown even to many swedes .
as a result , people continue to implant signal crayfish into lakes with noble crayfish in the hopes of increasing their catches - and in some cases unwittingly contaminate the waters . costly delicacy under threat the result is disastrous : once a lake is infected , it wipes out all the noble crayfish .
and as long as there are signal crayfish in the water the lake will remain contaminated .
" many people think the signal crayfish population is doing really well , but it 's not , " edsman stressed . already a costly delicacy , any threat to stocks could send prices soaring further : come august , fresh noble crayfish sell for about 600 to 800 kronor a kilo -lrb- $ 82-111 , € 66-88 -rrb- , compared to around 250 kronor for signal crayfish and as little 40 kronor for those imported from china , spain and turkey . afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german fish industry moves east an increasing number of german fishing companies are moving production to low wage countries .

since the united states withdrew from the treaty , russia held the key to whether the landmark 1997 draft agreement would cross the threshold to becoming a working international accord .
for environmental groups , the ratification by moscow marks a significant step on the road to reducing greenhouse gases .
" we will look back on today as the moment in history when humanity faced up to its responsibility , " greenpeace said in a statement friday .
" we 'll toast the duma with vodka tonight , but on monday morning we need to roll up our sleeves and get down to the real work , " said the environmental group 's climate policy advisor , steve sawyer .
positive turnaround bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmental experts say an increase in carbon dioxide emissions lead to global warming friday 's vote resuscitated the pact that until recently was considered all but dead after president george w. bush announced in 2001 that the united states , the world 's largest polluter , wanted no further part in it .
russia , which accounts for 17 percent of the world 's carbon dioxide emissions , had gone back and forth on endorsing the treaty ever since it was first drafted .
but finally a month ago , moscow government officials and putin recommended approval .
russia 's ratification was necessary for kyoto to go into force because the treaty stipulated that not only a majority of countries approve it , but that the signatory nations constitute 55 percent of the world 's emissions .
in their discussions ahead of the vote , russian officials hailed the financial opportunities the pact offered moscow - a turnaround from last year , when government leaders , including putin had derided the protocol as too costly .
" this protocol gives russia financial possibilities , " said valery zubov , a deputy with the main pro-kremlin united russia party in the discussion before friday 's vote .
" we have a chance to have a cleaner future . "
financial benefits russia hopes to make a short-term profit through the treaty by being able to sell off some of its quotas for greenhouse gas emissions to other industrialized signatories .
the idea is that under the treaty , countries who have not exhausted their limit for emissions will be able to sell off credit - essentially the right to pollute - to countries needing to increase their emissions quotas .
under the pressure of the market and with an eye for profit , nations will be inclined to produce fewer emissions in order to sell more .
point carbon , a norway-based consulting firm , has estimated that russia could earn $ 10 billion -lrb- € 8 billion -rrb- with the treaty 's help by 2012 .
russian deputy prime minister zhukov said russia would likely approach its kyoto quotas by 2010 if the nation 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- grew by 9 to 10 percent a year .
pressure to ratify bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow 's new arbat street is barely visible through thick smoke in the russian capital .
others have said russia was pressured by the international community into ratifying the pact .
" rusia was under unprecedented pressure , " said natalya narochinitskaya of the nationalist rodina -lrb- motherland -rrb- party .
" it 's ratification was presented as a stamp of a civilized country " and not based on scientific data , she said ahead of the vote .
it is widely believed that russia agreed to sign the protocol in return for the european union - one of the treaty 's major backers - supporting moscow 's bid to enter the world trade organization .
" it 's a very happy day for europe and for me , " said margot wallström , the swedish eu environment commissioner after the duma vote .
" it sends a very forceful signal to the rest of the world . "
" it is also very much a victory for the european union , " she said , in reference to the tug-of-war between brussels and washington over the pact .
despite being isolated in its opposition to the protocol , the united states has refused to endorse the treaty .

" the european proposal is an excessive demand that is contrary to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- and unacceptable , " alaeddin brujerdi , the influential head of parliament 's national security and foreign policy committee , told the conservative newspaper ressalat . britain , france and germany presented iran with a deal thursday aimed at avoiding possible sanctions under which tehran would receive valuable nuclear technology if it indefinitely suspended all uranium enrichment activities , according to a document prepared by the europeans . but brujerdi also raised the possibility that the conservative-controlled parliament could pass a bill forcing iran to halt its suspension of uranium enrichment in defiance of the un nuclear watchdog , the international atomic energy agency . " the european offer is a denial of the iranian nation 's legal rights bestowed under the npt , " brujerdi said .
" the islamic republic of iran will not accept a -lrb- western -rrb- monopoly on nuclear technology and will pursue its activities with determination . " thursday 's meeting was to give iran a last chance to disclose its complete nuclear program before the iaea decides on november 25 whether iran is cooperating with it on tehran 's nuclear activities .
the united states wants the iaea , which since february 2003 has been investigating us claims that iran has a covert nuclear weapons program , to refer tehran to the un security council , which could impose sanctions . only for electricity ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tehran has long insisted it is seeking only to generate electricity and on its right to uranium enrichment , which makes fuel for civilian reactors but can also manufacture the explosive material for atomic bombs .
under the european deal , iran would receive technology including a light-water reactor which would produce less fissionable material than the heavy-water reactor tehran is planning to build with russian help in bushehr . " the enrichment of uranium is a question of national dignity and no-one can force the leaders of the country to renounce it , said hamid reza hadji-babaie , an mp and member of the speaker 's office .
" the negotiations were positive but the europeans must take account of our red lines , that is iran 's refusal to renounce the nuclear fuel cycle . " the official state news agency irna quoted an anonymous diplomat in vienna saying that the next round of talks between iran and the european three would start wednesday .
a report published this week by the international institute for strategic studies , a military and defense think tank , said that assuming iran lifts the suspension on its enrichment program , " it is still probably a few years away from full scale production of enough enriched uranium for a small nuclear arsenal . " forcing the reformers on october 5 , the parliamentary committee headed by brujerdi approved a bill that would force the reformist government of president mohammad khatami to resume uranium enrichment in defiance of the iaea .
if eventually passed in the majlis -lrb- parliament -rrb- and approved by legislative watchdogs , it would almost certainly prompt the iaea to refer iran 's case to the security council . " the plan to oblige the government to resume enrichment has the support of 238 deputies " out of a total 290 , brujerdi said saturday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali akbar salehi iran 's former representative to the iaea , ali-akbar salehi , said the european proposals contained both positive and negative points , and urged the country 's leaders to examine them without hesitation .
" i believe the two sides do not want to reach a deadlock .
so the europeans must move some way towards our position , " salehi told the afp news agency . but another conservative mp dismissed the european offer .
" a light-water reactor is useable only for medical and agricultural needs but a heavy-water reactor can also produce plutonium for use in nuclear power plants , " another mp heshmatollah falahat-pisheh said , quoted by the conservative kayhan newspaper . us secretary of state colin powell said on saturday that washington had seen no sign that iran would comply with international demands on its nuclear program and would push next month for the matter to be sent to the un security council unless tehran reversed its course . afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us skeptical of iran-eu nuke talks iran 's decision thursday to pursue talks with europe 's three major powers over its nuclear ambitions prompted a suspicious response from the united states which favors direct compliance with united nations regulations .

it 's hoped to scare smokers into quitting . the outgoing european commission this week resorted to drastic measures to curb smoking which , according to the eu executive , accounts for over 650,000 deaths a year in the 25-nation bloc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an example of the eu commission 's latest anti-smoking campaign .
the anti-smoking campaign involves putting graphic images of the health consequences of smoking on cigarette packs .
the series of 42 images includes rotten lungs , decayed teeth , a corpse , a baby with an oxygen mask and gory details of a man with a cancerous tumor on his throat . the collection also includes more subtle allusions to the dangers of smoking - a wrinkled apple accompanies a warning about skin ageing , while a bent cigarette illustrates a warning about impotence . shocking people out of complacency unveiling the campaign in brussels on friday , david byrne , eu commissioner for health and consumer protection , said the aim was to frighten people into kicking the habit .
" people need to be shocked out of their complacency about tobacco , " byrne said .
" i make no apology for some of the pictures we are using . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david byrne , the eu commisioner for consumer and health protection .
he added that part of the idea was to debunk the myth that smoking is cool .
" the true face of smoking is disease , death and horror - not the glamour and sophistication the pushers in the tobacco industry try to portray , " byrne said .
" the eu must hammer home this message to young people via its media campaign and to smokers via their cigarette packs . " the eu said that a study of smoking trends in canada , which introduced picture warnings several years ago , suggests they can help reduce smoking . " smoking kills " the initiative is just the latest in a string of measures the eu has taken in recent years to push smokers , especially teenagers , to kick the habit permanently . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a smoker since 2002 , the eu has tried to reach young smokers via its campaign " feel free to say no " , which involves snazzy video clips and newspaper advertisements featuring well-known musicians and athletes . according to byrne , an increasing number of children , teenagers and women in europe are turning into smokers .
" the number of smokers , particularly teenagers and women , is rising in most countries , " he said .
" that is a very worrying trend for the future . "
experts estimate the annual cost of tobacco-related disease in the eu at € 100 billion a year . since sept .
30 , 2003 , the eu 's tobacco products directive have also made it mandatory for eu member states to print large black and white explicit health warnings such as " smoking kills " and " smoking makes you impotent " on cigarette packs . ireland exemplary on anti-smoking most eu member states have so far introduced anti-smoking measures in some form or the other .
tobacco advertising is limited in most eu nations and is completely banned in a few others . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ross heffernan , a barman at kehoe 's lounge bar in dublin , stacks ashtrays to be put away as the no smoking ban in pubs , restaurants and the work place came into effect in ireland in march , 2004 .
in march , ireland became the first country to ban smoking in restaurants , bars and pubs .
norway and malta have since instituted similar prohibitions and sweden is on the way . the european commission on friday also called on member states to implement long-term measures , such as effective regulators , to tackle smoking levels .
it said that ireland and belgium had already shown interest in passing national laws to implement the graphic picture warnings next year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a grisly example of the eu 's anti-smoking campaign the latest pictorial health warnings are not binding on member states .
individual countries can decide on whether they want to implement them . on friday , germany , which was sharply rebuked earlier this month for its weak implementation of anti-smoking measures in a europe-wide study carried out the european network for smoking prevention , said it will examine whether to introduce the pictorial health warnings . federal drugs commissioner marion caspers-merk at the same time pointed out that government efforts to curb smoking among younger people were working . caspers-merk told news agency dpa that the smoking rate among people up to the age of 18 had fallen to 23 percent from 27 percent within three years . " simple warning " sufficient ? critics of the pictorial warning campaign say it singles out smokers and is offensive .
" smokers are well aware of the health risks of smoking . there 's no need to rub their noses in it , " simon clark , director of british smokers ' lobby group forest told reuters .
" all that is needed is a simple written warning . " he added : " what about fatty foods , dairy products or alcohol ?

" the european proposal is an excessive demand that is contrary to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- and unacceptable , " alaeddin brujerdi , the influential head of parliament 's national security and foreign policy committee , told the conservative newspaper ressalat . britain , france and germany presented iran with a deal thursday aimed at avoiding possible sanctions under which tehran would receive valuable nuclear technology if it indefinitely suspended all uranium enrichment activities , according to a document prepared by the europeans . but brujerdi also raised the possibility that the conservative-controlled parliament could pass a bill forcing iran to halt its suspension of uranium enrichment in defiance of the un nuclear watchdog , the international atomic energy agency . " the european offer is a denial of the iranian nation 's legal rights bestowed under the npt , " brujerdi said .
" the islamic republic of iran will not accept a -lrb- western -rrb- monopoly on nuclear technology and will pursue its activities with determination . " thursday 's meeting was to give iran a last chance to disclose its complete nuclear program before the iaea decides on november 25 whether iran is cooperating with it on tehran 's nuclear activities .
the united states wants the iaea , which since february 2003 has been investigating us claims that iran has a covert nuclear weapons program , to refer tehran to the un security council , which could impose sanctions . only for electricity ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tehran has long insisted it is seeking only to generate electricity and on its right to uranium enrichment , which makes fuel for civilian reactors but can also manufacture the explosive material for atomic bombs .
under the european deal , iran would receive technology including a light-water reactor which would produce less fissionable material than the heavy-water reactor tehran is planning to build with russian help in bushehr . " the enrichment of uranium is a question of national dignity and no-one can force the leaders of the country to renounce it , said hamid reza hadji-babaie , an mp and member of the speaker 's office .
" the negotiations were positive but the europeans must take account of our red lines , that is iran 's refusal to renounce the nuclear fuel cycle . " the official state news agency irna quoted an anonymous diplomat in vienna saying that the next round of talks between iran and the european three would start wednesday .
a report published this week by the international institute for strategic studies , a military and defense think tank , said that assuming iran lifts the suspension on its enrichment program , " it is still probably a few years away from full scale production of enough enriched uranium for a small nuclear arsenal . " forcing the reformers on october 5 , the parliamentary committee headed by brujerdi approved a bill that would force the reformist government of president mohammad khatami to resume uranium enrichment in defiance of the iaea .
if eventually passed in the majlis -lrb- parliament -rrb- and approved by legislative watchdogs , it would almost certainly prompt the iaea to refer iran 's case to the security council . " the plan to oblige the government to resume enrichment has the support of 238 deputies " out of a total 290 , brujerdi said saturday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali akbar salehi iran 's former representative to the iaea , ali-akbar salehi , said the european proposals contained both positive and negative points , and urged the country 's leaders to examine them without hesitation .
" i believe the two sides do not want to reach a deadlock .
so the europeans must move some way towards our position , " salehi told the afp news agency . but another conservative mp dismissed the european offer .
" a light-water reactor is useable only for medical and agricultural needs but a heavy-water reactor can also produce plutonium for use in nuclear power plants , " another mp heshmatollah falahat-pisheh said , quoted by the conservative kayhan newspaper . us secretary of state colin powell said on saturday that washington had seen no sign that iran would comply with international demands on its nuclear program and would push next month for the matter to be sent to the un security council unless tehran reversed its course . afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us skeptical of iran-eu nuke talks iran 's decision thursday to pursue talks with europe 's three major powers over its nuclear ambitions prompted a suspicious response from the united states which favors direct compliance with united nations regulations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 23.10.2004 ethnic boycott mars kosovo election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a poster encourages the people of kosovo to vote renewed ethnic tensions and uncertainty over final status talks overshadowed kosovo 's general election saturday , the second in the province since the 1998-99 war between serbian forces and ethnic albanian separatists . the vote for the 120-seat assembly is seen as a test of the international community 's efforts to build a multi-ethnic democracy in the southern serbian province , administered by the united nations since nato bombing forced belgrade troops to withdraw in june 1999 . but it has been marred by calls for ethnic serbs to boycott the vote over security fears after 19 people died when mobs from the ethnic albanian majority rioted through serb villages in march , the worst violence here since the war . some 2,000 extra nato peacekeepers have been deployed to kosovo to secure the election .
the kosovo force -lrb- kfor -rrb- is already the north-atlantic alliance 's biggest mission with some 19,000 troops in the field .
kosovo police spokesman refki morina said police were also out in force , with all 6,000 local officers on duty " to ensure security and safety " . un officials said no incidents had been reported in the first hours of voting and turnout was just over five percent of 1.3 million registered voters .
kosovo 's chief un administrator , soren jessen-petersen , said the election marked a " turning point " and would set the stage for a un review of democracy standards early next year and possible talks on final status . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.n-the head of the united nations mission in kosovo soren jessen petersen .
he urged the province 's ethnic serb minority to participate and vowed to make their safety a top priority .
" kosovo 's serbs need legitimately elected leaders who can engage with the challenges ahead , " he wrote saturday in the international herald tribune .
" since ethnic albanians rioted against minority serbs in march , the damage has begun to be repaired and kosovo has moved forward , " jessen-petersen said . serbs stay home but in the northern , mainly serb town of zvecan a lone voter had cast his ballot 90 minutes after the polls opened .
kosovo serb leaders gathered in a nearby orthodox church to light candles a symbol of hope . " we have n't noticed that elections are being held today , " said milan ivanovic , a prominent kosovo serb .
however another serb politician , oliver ivanovic , said he would encourage his supporters to vote .
" it is obvious that there is no other solution , that only with our energy and powers we can take up responsibilities for our future , " he said . ethnic albanians demand complete independence from serbia but ethnic serbs and the government in belgrade insist that the territory is an inalienable part of the former yugoslav republic .
analysts believe a boycott will deprive the serbs of legitimate leaders to participate in any future talks on the province 's status and the future of the un protectorate . kosovo president ibrahim rugova , an ethnic albanian , said the vote was " a great and important date for the independence of kosovo .
i believe that all citizens will vote as these elections are important for the formal recognition of independence , " he said after casting his ballot . more than 33 political groups and 30 independent candidates are taking part in the election .
the latest surveys show that no party will win enough votes to control the parliament and form a government by itself .
some 12,000 local and international observers are on hand to look for irregularities .

it 's hoped to scare smokers into quitting . the outgoing european commission this week resorted to drastic measures to curb smoking which , according to the eu executive , accounts for over 650,000 deaths a year in the 25-nation bloc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an example of the eu commission 's latest anti-smoking campaign .
the anti-smoking campaign involves putting graphic images of the health consequences of smoking on cigarette packs .
the series of 42 images includes rotten lungs , decayed teeth , a corpse , a baby with an oxygen mask and gory details of a man with a cancerous tumor on his throat . the collection also includes more subtle allusions to the dangers of smoking - a wrinkled apple accompanies a warning about skin ageing , while a bent cigarette illustrates a warning about impotence . shocking people out of complacency unveiling the campaign in brussels on friday , david byrne , eu commissioner for health and consumer protection , said the aim was to frighten people into kicking the habit .
" people need to be shocked out of their complacency about tobacco , " byrne said .
" i make no apology for some of the pictures we are using . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david byrne , the eu commisioner for consumer and health protection .
he added that part of the idea was to debunk the myth that smoking is cool .
" the true face of smoking is disease , death and horror - not the glamour and sophistication the pushers in the tobacco industry try to portray , " byrne said .
" the eu must hammer home this message to young people via its media campaign and to smokers via their cigarette packs . " the eu said that a study of smoking trends in canada , which introduced picture warnings several years ago , suggests they can help reduce smoking . " smoking kills " the initiative is just the latest in a string of measures the eu has taken in recent years to push smokers , especially teenagers , to kick the habit permanently . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a smoker since 2002 , the eu has tried to reach young smokers via its campaign " feel free to say no " , which involves snazzy video clips and newspaper advertisements featuring well-known musicians and athletes . according to byrne , an increasing number of children , teenagers and women in europe are turning into smokers .
" the number of smokers , particularly teenagers and women , is rising in most countries , " he said .
" that is a very worrying trend for the future . "
experts estimate the annual cost of tobacco-related disease in the eu at € 100 billion a year . since sept .
30 , 2003 , the eu 's tobacco products directive have also made it mandatory for eu member states to print large black and white explicit health warnings such as " smoking kills " and " smoking makes you impotent " on cigarette packs . ireland exemplary on anti-smoking most eu member states have so far introduced anti-smoking measures in some form or the other .
tobacco advertising is limited in most eu nations and is completely banned in a few others . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ross heffernan , a barman at kehoe 's lounge bar in dublin , stacks ashtrays to be put away as the no smoking ban in pubs , restaurants and the work place came into effect in ireland in march , 2004 .
in march , ireland became the first country to ban smoking in restaurants , bars and pubs .
norway and malta have since instituted similar prohibitions and sweden is on the way . the european commission on friday also called on member states to implement long-term measures , such as effective regulators , to tackle smoking levels .
it said that ireland and belgium had already shown interest in passing national laws to implement the graphic picture warnings next year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a grisly example of the eu 's anti-smoking campaign the latest pictorial health warnings are not binding on member states .
individual countries can decide on whether they want to implement them . on friday , germany , which was sharply rebuked earlier this month for its weak implementation of anti-smoking measures in a europe-wide study carried out the european network for smoking prevention , said it will examine whether to introduce the pictorial health warnings . federal drugs commissioner marion caspers-merk at the same time pointed out that government efforts to curb smoking among younger people were working . caspers-merk told news agency dpa that the smoking rate among people up to the age of 18 had fallen to 23 percent from 27 percent within three years . " simple warning " sufficient ? critics of the pictorial warning campaign say it singles out smokers and is offensive .
" smokers are well aware of the health risks of smoking . there 's no need to rub their noses in it , " simon clark , director of british smokers ' lobby group forest told reuters .
" all that is needed is a simple written warning . " he added : " what about fatty foods , dairy products or alcohol ?
if they 're going to target tobacco , there should be written and graphic health warnings on other products as well .

the united states wants the iaea , which since february 2003 has been investigating us claims that iran has a covert nuclear weapons program , to refer tehran to the un security council , which could impose sanctions . only for electricity ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tehran has long insisted it is seeking only to generate electricity and on its right to uranium enrichment , which makes fuel for civilian reactors but can also manufacture the explosive material for atomic bombs .
under the european deal , iran would receive technology including a light-water reactor which would produce less fissionable material than the heavy-water reactor tehran is planning to build with russian help in bushehr . " the enrichment of uranium is a question of national dignity and no-one can force the leaders of the country to renounce it , said hamid reza hadji-babaie , an mp and member of the speaker 's office .
" the negotiations were positive but the europeans must take account of our red lines , that is iran 's refusal to renounce the nuclear fuel cycle . " the official state news agency irna quoted an anonymous diplomat in vienna saying that the next round of talks between iran and the european three would start wednesday .
a report published this week by the international institute for strategic studies , a military and defense think tank , said that assuming iran lifts the suspension on its enrichment program , " it is still probably a few years away from full scale production of enough enriched uranium for a small nuclear arsenal . " forcing the reformers on october 5 , the parliamentary committee headed by brujerdi approved a bill that would force the reformist government of president mohammad khatami to resume uranium enrichment in defiance of the iaea .
if eventually passed in the majlis -lrb- parliament -rrb- and approved by legislative watchdogs , it would almost certainly prompt the iaea to refer iran 's case to the security council . " the plan to oblige the government to resume enrichment has the support of 238 deputies " out of a total 290 , brujerdi said saturday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali akbar salehi iran 's former representative to the iaea , ali-akbar salehi , said the european proposals contained both positive and negative points , and urged the country 's leaders to examine them without hesitation .
" i believe the two sides do not want to reach a deadlock .
so the europeans must move some way towards our position , " salehi told the afp news agency . but another conservative mp dismissed the european offer .
" a light-water reactor is useable only for medical and agricultural needs but a heavy-water reactor can also produce plutonium for use in nuclear power plants , " another mp heshmatollah falahat-pisheh said , quoted by the conservative kayhan newspaper . us secretary of state colin powell said on saturday that washington had seen no sign that iran would comply with international demands on its nuclear program and would push next month for the matter to be sent to the un security council unless tehran reversed its course . afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us skeptical of iran-eu nuke talks iran 's decision thursday to pursue talks with europe 's three major powers over its nuclear ambitions prompted a suspicious response from the united states which favors direct compliance with united nations regulations .

the kosovo force -lrb- kfor -rrb- is already the north-atlantic alliance 's biggest mission with some 19,000 troops in the field .
kosovo police spokesman refki morina said police were also out in force , with all 6,000 local officers on duty " to ensure security and safety " . un officials said no incidents had been reported in the first hours of voting and turnout was just over five percent of 1.3 million registered voters .
kosovo 's chief un administrator , soren jessen-petersen , said the election marked a " turning point " and would set the stage for a un review of democracy standards early next year and possible talks on final status . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.n-the head of the united nations mission in kosovo soren jessen petersen .
he urged the province 's ethnic serb minority to participate and vowed to make their safety a top priority .
" kosovo 's serbs need legitimately elected leaders who can engage with the challenges ahead , " he wrote saturday in the international herald tribune .
" since ethnic albanians rioted against minority serbs in march , the damage has begun to be repaired and kosovo has moved forward , " jessen-petersen said . serbs stay home but in the northern , mainly serb town of zvecan a lone voter had cast his ballot 90 minutes after the polls opened .
kosovo serb leaders gathered in a nearby orthodox church to light candles a symbol of hope . " we have n't noticed that elections are being held today , " said milan ivanovic , a prominent kosovo serb .
however another serb politician , oliver ivanovic , said he would encourage his supporters to vote .
" it is obvious that there is no other solution , that only with our energy and powers we can take up responsibilities for our future , " he said . ethnic albanians demand complete independence from serbia but ethnic serbs and the government in belgrade insist that the territory is an inalienable part of the former yugoslav republic .
analysts believe a boycott will deprive the serbs of legitimate leaders to participate in any future talks on the province 's status and the future of the un protectorate . kosovo president ibrahim rugova , an ethnic albanian , said the vote was " a great and important date for the independence of kosovo .
i believe that all citizens will vote as these elections are important for the formal recognition of independence , " he said after casting his ballot . more than 33 political groups and 30 independent candidates are taking part in the election .
the latest surveys show that no party will win enough votes to control the parliament and form a government by itself .

russia , which accounts for 17 percent of the world 's carbon dioxide emissions , had gone back and forth on endorsing the treaty ever since it was first drafted .
but finally a month ago , moscow government officials and putin recommended approval .
russia 's ratification was necessary for kyoto to go into force because the treaty stipulated that not only a majority of countries approve it , but that the signatory nations constitute 55 percent of the world 's emissions .
in their discussions ahead of the vote , russian officials hailed the financial opportunities the pact offered moscow - a turnaround from last year , when government leaders , including putin had derided the protocol as too costly .
" this protocol gives russia financial possibilities , " said valery zubov , a deputy with the main pro-kremlin united russia party in the discussion before friday 's vote .
" we have a chance to have a cleaner future . "
financial benefits russia hopes to make a short-term profit through the treaty by being able to sell off some of its quotas for greenhouse gas emissions to other industrialized signatories .
the idea is that under the treaty , countries who have not exhausted their limit for emissions will be able to sell off credit - essentially the right to pollute - to countries needing to increase their emissions quotas .
under the pressure of the market and with an eye for profit , nations will be inclined to produce fewer emissions in order to sell more .
point carbon , a norway-based consulting firm , has estimated that russia could earn $ 10 billion -lrb- € 8 billion -rrb- with the treaty 's help by 2012 .

" it 's ratification was presented as a stamp of a civilized country " and not based on scientific data , she said ahead of the vote .
it is widely believed that russia agreed to sign the protocol in return for the european union - one of the treaty 's major backers - supporting moscow 's bid to enter the world trade organization .

it 's hoped to scare smokers into quitting . the outgoing european commission this week resorted to drastic measures to curb smoking which , according to the eu executive , accounts for over 650,000 deaths a year in the 25-nation bloc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an example of the eu commission 's latest anti-smoking campaign .
the anti-smoking campaign involves putting graphic images of the health consequences of smoking on cigarette packs .
the series of 42 images includes rotten lungs , decayed teeth , a corpse , a baby with an oxygen mask and gory details of a man with a cancerous tumor on his throat . the collection also includes more subtle allusions to the dangers of smoking - a wrinkled apple accompanies a warning about skin ageing , while a bent cigarette illustrates a warning about impotence . shocking people out of complacency unveiling the campaign in brussels on friday , david byrne , eu commissioner for health and consumer protection , said the aim was to frighten people into kicking the habit .
" people need to be shocked out of their complacency about tobacco , " byrne said .
" i make no apology for some of the pictures we are using . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david byrne , the eu commisioner for consumer and health protection .
he added that part of the idea was to debunk the myth that smoking is cool .
" the true face of smoking is disease , death and horror - not the glamour and sophistication the pushers in the tobacco industry try to portray , " byrne said .
" the eu must hammer home this message to young people via its media campaign and to smokers via their cigarette packs . " the eu said that a study of smoking trends in canada , which introduced picture warnings several years ago , suggests they can help reduce smoking . " smoking kills " the initiative is just the latest in a string of measures the eu has taken in recent years to push smokers , especially teenagers , to kick the habit permanently . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a smoker since 2002 , the eu has tried to reach young smokers via its campaign " feel free to say no " , which involves snazzy video clips and newspaper advertisements featuring well-known musicians and athletes . according to byrne , an increasing number of children , teenagers and women in europe are turning into smokers .
" the number of smokers , particularly teenagers and women , is rising in most countries , " he said .
" that is a very worrying trend for the future . "
experts estimate the annual cost of tobacco-related disease in the eu at € 100 billion a year . since sept .
30 , 2003 , the eu 's tobacco products directive have also made it mandatory for eu member states to print large black and white explicit health warnings such as " smoking kills " and " smoking makes you impotent " on cigarette packs . ireland exemplary on anti-smoking most eu member states have so far introduced anti-smoking measures in some form or the other .
tobacco advertising is limited in most eu nations and is completely banned in a few others . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ross heffernan , a barman at kehoe 's lounge bar in dublin , stacks ashtrays to be put away as the no smoking ban in pubs , restaurants and the work place came into effect in ireland in march , 2004 .
in march , ireland became the first country to ban smoking in restaurants , bars and pubs .
norway and malta have since instituted similar prohibitions and sweden is on the way . the european commission on friday also called on member states to implement long-term measures , such as effective regulators , to tackle smoking levels .
it said that ireland and belgium had already shown interest in passing national laws to implement the graphic picture warnings next year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a grisly example of the eu 's anti-smoking campaign the latest pictorial health warnings are not binding on member states .
individual countries can decide on whether they want to implement them . on friday , germany , which was sharply rebuked earlier this month for its weak implementation of anti-smoking measures in a europe-wide study carried out the european network for smoking prevention , said it will examine whether to introduce the pictorial health warnings . federal drugs commissioner marion caspers-merk at the same time pointed out that government efforts to curb smoking among younger people were working . caspers-merk told news agency dpa that the smoking rate among people up to the age of 18 had fallen to 23 percent from 27 percent within three years . " simple warning " sufficient ? critics of the pictorial warning campaign say it singles out smokers and is offensive .
" smokers are well aware of the health risks of smoking . there 's no need to rub their noses in it , " simon clark , director of british smokers ' lobby group forest told reuters .
" all that is needed is a simple written warning . " he added : " what about fatty foods , dairy products or alcohol ?

" it sends a very forceful signal to the rest of the world . "
" it is also very much a victory for the european union , " she said , in reference to the tug-of-war between brussels and washington over the pact .

" many people were happy this summer when they caught large crayfish in their traps .
but the fact that there were so few small ones means that stocks could be threatened come next year , " lennart edsman , a crayfish researcher at the national board of fisheries , told afp . researchers have for the past five years been worried about the spread of the fungal disease , which has been present in swedish waters to varying extents for almost a century . but their fears are now growing as people illegally implant an imported variety of crayfish , called signal crayfish which carry the plague , into lakes that are home to sweden 's domestic variety , called noble crayfish . in the past , fisheries authorities restricted fishing and imposed minimum size requirements , but all restrictions were lifted in 1994 , to the regret of some . " people are beginning to suggest that maybe we should introduce restrictions again , " edsman said . a gastronomic feast crayfish mature in late summer , making an annual return to the table which is widely celebrated with a crayfish party , or " kraeftskiva " . swedes eat more crayfish than anybody else in the world - some four million kilos per year , or about a half kilo -lrb- one pound -rrb- per inhabitant , most of which is consumed in august during the crayfish party season .
" no other country comes even close when it comes to the amount eaten , " edsman said . boiled in a decoction of dill and then served cold on a heaping platter placed in the middle of the table within everyone 's reach , crayfish are eaten with bread , a matured hard cheese and plenty of schnapps .
raucous drinking songs , funny hats with crayfish designs and paper lanterns are de rigueur . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swedish princess victoria , left , shares a light moment with us chemistry nobel laureate william s. knowles from the united states , during a banquet measuring about 10 to 12 centimeters -lrb- four to five inches -rrb- , crayfish are finger food : no matter how distinguished the dinner guests , they delight in sucking the juices from the underside of the crayfish before breaking off the claws and tail and sucking out the meat , unmindful of the juices dripping down their chin and wrists . crayfish imports sound death knell the swedish tradition of eating crayfish dates back to the 1500s , when german chefs working for the royal family are believed to have introduced the delicacy . but the dish only spread to the broader public in the late 1800s , when it became so popular that over fishing threatened the stocks and authorities limited the period when they could be fished to a few weeks in august . in 1907 , crayfish imported from finland for a party but which were not eaten because they had spoiled were thrown into stockholm 's lake maelaren , infecting sweden with the crayfish plague for the first time .
over the years it killed off a large share of the noble crayfish . in 1969 , north american signal crayfish were transplanted into swedish waters to replace the decimated stocks .
signal crayfish were chosen because their taste is similar to that of the noble crayfish and because they were believed to be resistant to the plague . but that turned out to be incorrect .
in fact , all signal crayfish are carriers of the disease , and they can die of it too , a fact unknown even to many swedes .
as a result , people continue to implant signal crayfish into lakes with noble crayfish in the hopes of increasing their catches - and in some cases unwittingly contaminate the waters . costly delicacy under threat the result is disastrous : once a lake is infected , it wipes out all the noble crayfish .
and as long as there are signal crayfish in the water the lake will remain contaminated .
" many people think the signal crayfish population is doing really well , but it 's not , " edsman stressed . already a costly delicacy , any threat to stocks could send prices soaring further : come august , fresh noble crayfish sell for about 600 to 800 kronor a kilo -lrb- $ 82-111 , € 66-88 -rrb- , compared to around 250 kronor for signal crayfish and as little 40 kronor for those imported from china , spain and turkey . afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german fish industry moves east an increasing number of german fishing companies are moving production to low wage countries .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 23.10.2004 eu deploys shock tactics to curb smoking großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you might need to avert your eyes next time you light up the eu has unveiled a new anti-smoking campaign that calls on governments to print hard-hitting images on cigarette packs to show the damage smoking can do to people 's health .
it 's hoped to scare smokers into quitting . the outgoing european commission this week resorted to drastic measures to curb smoking which , according to the eu executive , accounts for over 650,000 deaths a year in the 25-nation bloc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an example of the eu commission 's latest anti-smoking campaign .
the anti-smoking campaign involves putting graphic images of the health consequences of smoking on cigarette packs .
the series of 42 images includes rotten lungs , decayed teeth , a corpse , a baby with an oxygen mask and gory details of a man with a cancerous tumor on his throat . the collection also includes more subtle allusions to the dangers of smoking - a wrinkled apple accompanies a warning about skin ageing , while a bent cigarette illustrates a warning about impotence . shocking people out of complacency unveiling the campaign in brussels on friday , david byrne , eu commissioner for health and consumer protection , said the aim was to frighten people into kicking the habit .
" people need to be shocked out of their complacency about tobacco , " byrne said .
" i make no apology for some of the pictures we are using . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david byrne , the eu commisioner for consumer and health protection .
he added that part of the idea was to debunk the myth that smoking is cool .
" the true face of smoking is disease , death and horror - not the glamour and sophistication the pushers in the tobacco industry try to portray , " byrne said .
" the eu must hammer home this message to young people via its media campaign and to smokers via their cigarette packs . " the eu said that a study of smoking trends in canada , which introduced picture warnings several years ago , suggests they can help reduce smoking . " smoking kills " the initiative is just the latest in a string of measures the eu has taken in recent years to push smokers , especially teenagers , to kick the habit permanently . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a smoker since 2002 , the eu has tried to reach young smokers via its campaign " feel free to say no " , which involves snazzy video clips and newspaper advertisements featuring well-known musicians and athletes . according to byrne , an increasing number of children , teenagers and women in europe are turning into smokers .
" the number of smokers , particularly teenagers and women , is rising in most countries , " he said .
" that is a very worrying trend for the future . "
experts estimate the annual cost of tobacco-related disease in the eu at € 100 billion a year . since sept .
30 , 2003 , the eu 's tobacco products directive have also made it mandatory for eu member states to print large black and white explicit health warnings such as " smoking kills " and " smoking makes you impotent " on cigarette packs . ireland exemplary on anti-smoking most eu member states have so far introduced anti-smoking measures in some form or the other .
tobacco advertising is limited in most eu nations and is completely banned in a few others . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ross heffernan , a barman at kehoe 's lounge bar in dublin , stacks ashtrays to be put away as the no smoking ban in pubs , restaurants and the work place came into effect in ireland in march , 2004 .
in march , ireland became the first country to ban smoking in restaurants , bars and pubs .
norway and malta have since instituted similar prohibitions and sweden is on the way . the european commission on friday also called on member states to implement long-term measures , such as effective regulators , to tackle smoking levels .
it said that ireland and belgium had already shown interest in passing national laws to implement the graphic picture warnings next year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a grisly example of the eu 's anti-smoking campaign the latest pictorial health warnings are not binding on member states .
individual countries can decide on whether they want to implement them . on friday , germany , which was sharply rebuked earlier this month for its weak implementation of anti-smoking measures in a europe-wide study carried out the european network for smoking prevention , said it will examine whether to introduce the pictorial health warnings . federal drugs commissioner marion caspers-merk at the same time pointed out that government efforts to curb smoking among younger people were working . caspers-merk told news agency dpa that the smoking rate among people up to the age of 18 had fallen to 23 percent from 27 percent within three years . " simple warning " sufficient ? critics of the pictorial warning campaign say it singles out smokers and is offensive .
" smokers are well aware of the health risks of smoking . there 's no need to rub their noses in it , " simon clark , director of british smokers ' lobby group forest told reuters .
" all that is needed is a simple written warning . " he added : " what about fatty foods , dairy products or alcohol ?
if they 're going to target tobacco , there should be written and graphic health warnings on other products as well .

the kosovo force -lrb- kfor -rrb- is already the north-atlantic alliance 's biggest mission with some 19,000 troops in the field .
kosovo police spokesman refki morina said police were also out in force , with all 6,000 local officers on duty " to ensure security and safety " . un officials said no incidents had been reported in the first hours of voting and turnout was just over five percent of 1.3 million registered voters .
kosovo 's chief un administrator , soren jessen-petersen , said the election marked a " turning point " and would set the stage for a un review of democracy standards early next year and possible talks on final status . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.n-the head of the united nations mission in kosovo soren jessen petersen .
he urged the province 's ethnic serb minority to participate and vowed to make their safety a top priority .
" kosovo 's serbs need legitimately elected leaders who can engage with the challenges ahead , " he wrote saturday in the international herald tribune .
" since ethnic albanians rioted against minority serbs in march , the damage has begun to be repaired and kosovo has moved forward , " jessen-petersen said . serbs stay home but in the northern , mainly serb town of zvecan a lone voter had cast his ballot 90 minutes after the polls opened .
kosovo serb leaders gathered in a nearby orthodox church to light candles a symbol of hope . " we have n't noticed that elections are being held today , " said milan ivanovic , a prominent kosovo serb .
however another serb politician , oliver ivanovic , said he would encourage his supporters to vote .
" it is obvious that there is no other solution , that only with our energy and powers we can take up responsibilities for our future , " he said . ethnic albanians demand complete independence from serbia but ethnic serbs and the government in belgrade insist that the territory is an inalienable part of the former yugoslav republic .
analysts believe a boycott will deprive the serbs of legitimate leaders to participate in any future talks on the province 's status and the future of the un protectorate . kosovo president ibrahim rugova , an ethnic albanian , said the vote was " a great and important date for the independence of kosovo .
i believe that all citizens will vote as these elections are important for the formal recognition of independence , " he said after casting his ballot . more than 33 political groups and 30 independent candidates are taking part in the election .

" the european proposal is an excessive demand that is contrary to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- and unacceptable , " alaeddin brujerdi , the influential head of parliament 's national security and foreign policy committee , told the conservative newspaper ressalat . britain , france and germany presented iran with a deal thursday aimed at avoiding possible sanctions under which tehran would receive valuable nuclear technology if it indefinitely suspended all uranium enrichment activities , according to a document prepared by the europeans . but brujerdi also raised the possibility that the conservative-controlled parliament could pass a bill forcing iran to halt its suspension of uranium enrichment in defiance of the un nuclear watchdog , the international atomic energy agency . " the european offer is a denial of the iranian nation 's legal rights bestowed under the npt , " brujerdi said .
" the islamic republic of iran will not accept a -lrb- western -rrb- monopoly on nuclear technology and will pursue its activities with determination . " thursday 's meeting was to give iran a last chance to disclose its complete nuclear program before the iaea decides on november 25 whether iran is cooperating with it on tehran 's nuclear activities .
the united states wants the iaea , which since february 2003 has been investigating us claims that iran has a covert nuclear weapons program , to refer tehran to the un security council , which could impose sanctions . only for electricity ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tehran has long insisted it is seeking only to generate electricity and on its right to uranium enrichment , which makes fuel for civilian reactors but can also manufacture the explosive material for atomic bombs .
under the european deal , iran would receive technology including a light-water reactor which would produce less fissionable material than the heavy-water reactor tehran is planning to build with russian help in bushehr . " the enrichment of uranium is a question of national dignity and no-one can force the leaders of the country to renounce it , said hamid reza hadji-babaie , an mp and member of the speaker 's office .
" the negotiations were positive but the europeans must take account of our red lines , that is iran 's refusal to renounce the nuclear fuel cycle . " the official state news agency irna quoted an anonymous diplomat in vienna saying that the next round of talks between iran and the european three would start wednesday .
a report published this week by the international institute for strategic studies , a military and defense think tank , said that assuming iran lifts the suspension on its enrichment program , " it is still probably a few years away from full scale production of enough enriched uranium for a small nuclear arsenal . " forcing the reformers on october 5 , the parliamentary committee headed by brujerdi approved a bill that would force the reformist government of president mohammad khatami to resume uranium enrichment in defiance of the iaea .
if eventually passed in the majlis -lrb- parliament -rrb- and approved by legislative watchdogs , it would almost certainly prompt the iaea to refer iran 's case to the security council . " the plan to oblige the government to resume enrichment has the support of 238 deputies " out of a total 290 , brujerdi said saturday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali akbar salehi iran 's former representative to the iaea , ali-akbar salehi , said the european proposals contained both positive and negative points , and urged the country 's leaders to examine them without hesitation .
" i believe the two sides do not want to reach a deadlock .
so the europeans must move some way towards our position , " salehi told the afp news agency . but another conservative mp dismissed the european offer .
" a light-water reactor is useable only for medical and agricultural needs but a heavy-water reactor can also produce plutonium for use in nuclear power plants , " another mp heshmatollah falahat-pisheh said , quoted by the conservative kayhan newspaper . us secretary of state colin powell said on saturday that washington had seen no sign that iran would comply with international demands on its nuclear program and would push next month for the matter to be sent to the un security council unless tehran reversed its course . afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us skeptical of iran-eu nuke talks iran 's decision thursday to pursue talks with europe 's three major powers over its nuclear ambitions prompted a suspicious response from the united states which favors direct compliance with united nations regulations .

since the united states withdrew from the treaty , russia held the key to whether the landmark 1997 draft agreement would cross the threshold to becoming a working international accord .
for environmental groups , the ratification by moscow marks a significant step on the road to reducing greenhouse gases .
" we will look back on today as the moment in history when humanity faced up to its responsibility , " greenpeace said in a statement friday .
" we 'll toast the duma with vodka tonight , but on monday morning we need to roll up our sleeves and get down to the real work , " said the environmental group 's climate policy advisor , steve sawyer .
positive turnaround bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmental experts say an increase in carbon dioxide emissions lead to global warming friday 's vote resuscitated the pact that until recently was considered all but dead after president george w. bush announced in 2001 that the united states , the world 's largest polluter , wanted no further part in it .
russia , which accounts for 17 percent of the world 's carbon dioxide emissions , had gone back and forth on endorsing the treaty ever since it was first drafted .
but finally a month ago , moscow government officials and putin recommended approval .
russia 's ratification was necessary for kyoto to go into force because the treaty stipulated that not only a majority of countries approve it , but that the signatory nations constitute 55 percent of the world 's emissions .
in their discussions ahead of the vote , russian officials hailed the financial opportunities the pact offered moscow - a turnaround from last year , when government leaders , including putin had derided the protocol as too costly .
" this protocol gives russia financial possibilities , " said valery zubov , a deputy with the main pro-kremlin united russia party in the discussion before friday 's vote .
" we have a chance to have a cleaner future . "
financial benefits russia hopes to make a short-term profit through the treaty by being able to sell off some of its quotas for greenhouse gas emissions to other industrialized signatories .
the idea is that under the treaty , countries who have not exhausted their limit for emissions will be able to sell off credit - essentially the right to pollute - to countries needing to increase their emissions quotas .
under the pressure of the market and with an eye for profit , nations will be inclined to produce fewer emissions in order to sell more .
point carbon , a norway-based consulting firm , has estimated that russia could earn $ 10 billion -lrb- € 8 billion -rrb- with the treaty 's help by 2012 .
russian deputy prime minister zhukov said russia would likely approach its kyoto quotas by 2010 if the nation 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- grew by 9 to 10 percent a year .
pressure to ratify bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow 's new arbat street is barely visible through thick smoke in the russian capital .
others have said russia was pressured by the international community into ratifying the pact .
" rusia was under unprecedented pressure , " said natalya narochinitskaya of the nationalist rodina -lrb- motherland -rrb- party .
" it 's ratification was presented as a stamp of a civilized country " and not based on scientific data , she said ahead of the vote .
it is widely believed that russia agreed to sign the protocol in return for the european union - one of the treaty 's major backers - supporting moscow 's bid to enter the world trade organization .
" it 's a very happy day for europe and for me , " said margot wallström , the swedish eu environment commissioner after the duma vote .
" it sends a very forceful signal to the rest of the world . "
" it is also very much a victory for the european union , " she said , in reference to the tug-of-war between brussels and washington over the pact .
despite being isolated in its opposition to the protocol , the united states has refused to endorse the treaty .

" many people were happy this summer when they caught large crayfish in their traps .
but the fact that there were so few small ones means that stocks could be threatened come next year , " lennart edsman , a crayfish researcher at the national board of fisheries , told afp . researchers have for the past five years been worried about the spread of the fungal disease , which has been present in swedish waters to varying extents for almost a century . but their fears are now growing as people illegally implant an imported variety of crayfish , called signal crayfish which carry the plague , into lakes that are home to sweden 's domestic variety , called noble crayfish . in the past , fisheries authorities restricted fishing and imposed minimum size requirements , but all restrictions were lifted in 1994 , to the regret of some . " people are beginning to suggest that maybe we should introduce restrictions again , " edsman said . a gastronomic feast crayfish mature in late summer , making an annual return to the table which is widely celebrated with a crayfish party , or " kraeftskiva " . swedes eat more crayfish than anybody else in the world - some four million kilos per year , or about a half kilo -lrb- one pound -rrb- per inhabitant , most of which is consumed in august during the crayfish party season .
" no other country comes even close when it comes to the amount eaten , " edsman said . boiled in a decoction of dill and then served cold on a heaping platter placed in the middle of the table within everyone 's reach , crayfish are eaten with bread , a matured hard cheese and plenty of schnapps .
raucous drinking songs , funny hats with crayfish designs and paper lanterns are de rigueur . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swedish princess victoria , left , shares a light moment with us chemistry nobel laureate william s. knowles from the united states , during a banquet measuring about 10 to 12 centimeters -lrb- four to five inches -rrb- , crayfish are finger food : no matter how distinguished the dinner guests , they delight in sucking the juices from the underside of the crayfish before breaking off the claws and tail and sucking out the meat , unmindful of the juices dripping down their chin and wrists . crayfish imports sound death knell the swedish tradition of eating crayfish dates back to the 1500s , when german chefs working for the royal family are believed to have introduced the delicacy . but the dish only spread to the broader public in the late 1800s , when it became so popular that over fishing threatened the stocks and authorities limited the period when they could be fished to a few weeks in august . in 1907 , crayfish imported from finland for a party but which were not eaten because they had spoiled were thrown into stockholm 's lake maelaren , infecting sweden with the crayfish plague for the first time .
over the years it killed off a large share of the noble crayfish . in 1969 , north american signal crayfish were transplanted into swedish waters to replace the decimated stocks .
signal crayfish were chosen because their taste is similar to that of the noble crayfish and because they were believed to be resistant to the plague . but that turned out to be incorrect .
in fact , all signal crayfish are carriers of the disease , and they can die of it too , a fact unknown even to many swedes .
as a result , people continue to implant signal crayfish into lakes with noble crayfish in the hopes of increasing their catches - and in some cases unwittingly contaminate the waters . costly delicacy under threat the result is disastrous : once a lake is infected , it wipes out all the noble crayfish .
and as long as there are signal crayfish in the water the lake will remain contaminated .
" many people think the signal crayfish population is doing really well , but it 's not , " edsman stressed . already a costly delicacy , any threat to stocks could send prices soaring further : come august , fresh noble crayfish sell for about 600 to 800 kronor a kilo -lrb- $ 82-111 , € 66-88 -rrb- , compared to around 250 kronor for signal crayfish and as little 40 kronor for those imported from china , spain and turkey . afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german fish industry moves east an increasing number of german fishing companies are moving production to low wage countries .

raucous drinking songs , funny hats with crayfish designs and paper lanterns are de rigueur . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swedish princess victoria , left , shares a light moment with us chemistry nobel laureate william s. knowles from the united states , during a banquet measuring about 10 to 12 centimeters -lrb- four to five inches -rrb- , crayfish are finger food : no matter how distinguished the dinner guests , they delight in sucking the juices from the underside of the crayfish before breaking off the claws and tail and sucking out the meat , unmindful of the juices dripping down their chin and wrists . crayfish imports sound death knell the swedish tradition of eating crayfish dates back to the 1500s , when german chefs working for the royal family are believed to have introduced the delicacy . but the dish only spread to the broader public in the late 1800s , when it became so popular that over fishing threatened the stocks and authorities limited the period when they could be fished to a few weeks in august . in 1907 , crayfish imported from finland for a party but which were not eaten because they had spoiled were thrown into stockholm 's lake maelaren , infecting sweden with the crayfish plague for the first time .
over the years it killed off a large share of the noble crayfish . in 1969 , north american signal crayfish were transplanted into swedish waters to replace the decimated stocks .
signal crayfish were chosen because their taste is similar to that of the noble crayfish and because they were believed to be resistant to the plague . but that turned out to be incorrect .
in fact , all signal crayfish are carriers of the disease , and they can die of it too , a fact unknown even to many swedes .
as a result , people continue to implant signal crayfish into lakes with noble crayfish in the hopes of increasing their catches - and in some cases unwittingly contaminate the waters . costly delicacy under threat the result is disastrous : once a lake is infected , it wipes out all the noble crayfish .
and as long as there are signal crayfish in the water the lake will remain contaminated .
" many people think the signal crayfish population is doing really well , but it 's not , " edsman stressed . already a costly delicacy , any threat to stocks could send prices soaring further : come august , fresh noble crayfish sell for about 600 to 800 kronor a kilo -lrb- $ 82-111 , € 66-88 -rrb- , compared to around 250 kronor for signal crayfish and as little 40 kronor for those imported from china , spain and turkey . afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german fish industry moves east an increasing number of german fishing companies are moving production to low wage countries .

it 's hoped to scare smokers into quitting . the outgoing european commission this week resorted to drastic measures to curb smoking which , according to the eu executive , accounts for over 650,000 deaths a year in the 25-nation bloc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an example of the eu commission 's latest anti-smoking campaign .
the anti-smoking campaign involves putting graphic images of the health consequences of smoking on cigarette packs .
the series of 42 images includes rotten lungs , decayed teeth , a corpse , a baby with an oxygen mask and gory details of a man with a cancerous tumor on his throat . the collection also includes more subtle allusions to the dangers of smoking - a wrinkled apple accompanies a warning about skin ageing , while a bent cigarette illustrates a warning about impotence . shocking people out of complacency unveiling the campaign in brussels on friday , david byrne , eu commissioner for health and consumer protection , said the aim was to frighten people into kicking the habit .
" people need to be shocked out of their complacency about tobacco , " byrne said .
" i make no apology for some of the pictures we are using . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david byrne , the eu commisioner for consumer and health protection .
he added that part of the idea was to debunk the myth that smoking is cool .
" the true face of smoking is disease , death and horror - not the glamour and sophistication the pushers in the tobacco industry try to portray , " byrne said .
" the eu must hammer home this message to young people via its media campaign and to smokers via their cigarette packs . " the eu said that a study of smoking trends in canada , which introduced picture warnings several years ago , suggests they can help reduce smoking . " smoking kills " the initiative is just the latest in a string of measures the eu has taken in recent years to push smokers , especially teenagers , to kick the habit permanently . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a smoker since 2002 , the eu has tried to reach young smokers via its campaign " feel free to say no " , which involves snazzy video clips and newspaper advertisements featuring well-known musicians and athletes . according to byrne , an increasing number of children , teenagers and women in europe are turning into smokers .
" the number of smokers , particularly teenagers and women , is rising in most countries , " he said .
" that is a very worrying trend for the future . "
experts estimate the annual cost of tobacco-related disease in the eu at € 100 billion a year . since sept .
30 , 2003 , the eu 's tobacco products directive have also made it mandatory for eu member states to print large black and white explicit health warnings such as " smoking kills " and " smoking makes you impotent " on cigarette packs . ireland exemplary on anti-smoking most eu member states have so far introduced anti-smoking measures in some form or the other .
tobacco advertising is limited in most eu nations and is completely banned in a few others . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ross heffernan , a barman at kehoe 's lounge bar in dublin , stacks ashtrays to be put away as the no smoking ban in pubs , restaurants and the work place came into effect in ireland in march , 2004 .
in march , ireland became the first country to ban smoking in restaurants , bars and pubs .
norway and malta have since instituted similar prohibitions and sweden is on the way . the european commission on friday also called on member states to implement long-term measures , such as effective regulators , to tackle smoking levels .
it said that ireland and belgium had already shown interest in passing national laws to implement the graphic picture warnings next year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a grisly example of the eu 's anti-smoking campaign the latest pictorial health warnings are not binding on member states .
individual countries can decide on whether they want to implement them . on friday , germany , which was sharply rebuked earlier this month for its weak implementation of anti-smoking measures in a europe-wide study carried out the european network for smoking prevention , said it will examine whether to introduce the pictorial health warnings . federal drugs commissioner marion caspers-merk at the same time pointed out that government efforts to curb smoking among younger people were working . caspers-merk told news agency dpa that the smoking rate among people up to the age of 18 had fallen to 23 percent from 27 percent within three years . " simple warning " sufficient ? critics of the pictorial warning campaign say it singles out smokers and is offensive .
" smokers are well aware of the health risks of smoking . there 's no need to rub their noses in it , " simon clark , director of british smokers ' lobby group forest told reuters .
" all that is needed is a simple written warning . " he added : " what about fatty foods , dairy products or alcohol ?
if they 're going to target tobacco , there should be written and graphic health warnings on other products as well .

since the united states withdrew from the treaty , russia held the key to whether the landmark 1997 draft agreement would cross the threshold to becoming a working international accord .
for environmental groups , the ratification by moscow marks a significant step on the road to reducing greenhouse gases .
" we will look back on today as the moment in history when humanity faced up to its responsibility , " greenpeace said in a statement friday .
" we 'll toast the duma with vodka tonight , but on monday morning we need to roll up our sleeves and get down to the real work , " said the environmental group 's climate policy advisor , steve sawyer .
positive turnaround bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmental experts say an increase in carbon dioxide emissions lead to global warming friday 's vote resuscitated the pact that until recently was considered all but dead after president george w. bush announced in 2001 that the united states , the world 's largest polluter , wanted no further part in it .
russia , which accounts for 17 percent of the world 's carbon dioxide emissions , had gone back and forth on endorsing the treaty ever since it was first drafted .
but finally a month ago , moscow government officials and putin recommended approval .
russia 's ratification was necessary for kyoto to go into force because the treaty stipulated that not only a majority of countries approve it , but that the signatory nations constitute 55 percent of the world 's emissions .
in their discussions ahead of the vote , russian officials hailed the financial opportunities the pact offered moscow - a turnaround from last year , when government leaders , including putin had derided the protocol as too costly .
" this protocol gives russia financial possibilities , " said valery zubov , a deputy with the main pro-kremlin united russia party in the discussion before friday 's vote .
" we have a chance to have a cleaner future . "
financial benefits russia hopes to make a short-term profit through the treaty by being able to sell off some of its quotas for greenhouse gas emissions to other industrialized signatories .
the idea is that under the treaty , countries who have not exhausted their limit for emissions will be able to sell off credit - essentially the right to pollute - to countries needing to increase their emissions quotas .
under the pressure of the market and with an eye for profit , nations will be inclined to produce fewer emissions in order to sell more .
point carbon , a norway-based consulting firm , has estimated that russia could earn $ 10 billion -lrb- € 8 billion -rrb- with the treaty 's help by 2012 .
russian deputy prime minister zhukov said russia would likely approach its kyoto quotas by 2010 if the nation 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- grew by 9 to 10 percent a year .
pressure to ratify bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow 's new arbat street is barely visible through thick smoke in the russian capital .
others have said russia was pressured by the international community into ratifying the pact .
" rusia was under unprecedented pressure , " said natalya narochinitskaya of the nationalist rodina -lrb- motherland -rrb- party .
" it 's ratification was presented as a stamp of a civilized country " and not based on scientific data , she said ahead of the vote .
it is widely believed that russia agreed to sign the protocol in return for the european union - one of the treaty 's major backers - supporting moscow 's bid to enter the world trade organization .
" it 's a very happy day for europe and for me , " said margot wallström , the swedish eu environment commissioner after the duma vote .
" it sends a very forceful signal to the rest of the world . "
" it is also very much a victory for the european union , " she said , in reference to the tug-of-war between brussels and washington over the pact .
despite being isolated in its opposition to the protocol , the united states has refused to endorse the treaty .

" the european proposal is an excessive demand that is contrary to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- and unacceptable , " alaeddin brujerdi , the influential head of parliament 's national security and foreign policy committee , told the conservative newspaper ressalat . britain , france and germany presented iran with a deal thursday aimed at avoiding possible sanctions under which tehran would receive valuable nuclear technology if it indefinitely suspended all uranium enrichment activities , according to a document prepared by the europeans . but brujerdi also raised the possibility that the conservative-controlled parliament could pass a bill forcing iran to halt its suspension of uranium enrichment in defiance of the un nuclear watchdog , the international atomic energy agency . " the european offer is a denial of the iranian nation 's legal rights bestowed under the npt , " brujerdi said .
" the islamic republic of iran will not accept a -lrb- western -rrb- monopoly on nuclear technology and will pursue its activities with determination . " thursday 's meeting was to give iran a last chance to disclose its complete nuclear program before the iaea decides on november 25 whether iran is cooperating with it on tehran 's nuclear activities .
the united states wants the iaea , which since february 2003 has been investigating us claims that iran has a covert nuclear weapons program , to refer tehran to the un security council , which could impose sanctions . only for electricity ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tehran has long insisted it is seeking only to generate electricity and on its right to uranium enrichment , which makes fuel for civilian reactors but can also manufacture the explosive material for atomic bombs .
under the european deal , iran would receive technology including a light-water reactor which would produce less fissionable material than the heavy-water reactor tehran is planning to build with russian help in bushehr . " the enrichment of uranium is a question of national dignity and no-one can force the leaders of the country to renounce it , said hamid reza hadji-babaie , an mp and member of the speaker 's office .
" the negotiations were positive but the europeans must take account of our red lines , that is iran 's refusal to renounce the nuclear fuel cycle . " the official state news agency irna quoted an anonymous diplomat in vienna saying that the next round of talks between iran and the european three would start wednesday .
a report published this week by the international institute for strategic studies , a military and defense think tank , said that assuming iran lifts the suspension on its enrichment program , " it is still probably a few years away from full scale production of enough enriched uranium for a small nuclear arsenal . " forcing the reformers on october 5 , the parliamentary committee headed by brujerdi approved a bill that would force the reformist government of president mohammad khatami to resume uranium enrichment in defiance of the iaea .
if eventually passed in the majlis -lrb- parliament -rrb- and approved by legislative watchdogs , it would almost certainly prompt the iaea to refer iran 's case to the security council . " the plan to oblige the government to resume enrichment has the support of 238 deputies " out of a total 290 , brujerdi said saturday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali akbar salehi iran 's former representative to the iaea , ali-akbar salehi , said the european proposals contained both positive and negative points , and urged the country 's leaders to examine them without hesitation .

for environmental groups , the ratification by moscow marks a significant step on the road to reducing greenhouse gases .
" we will look back on today as the moment in history when humanity faced up to its responsibility , " greenpeace said in a statement friday .
" we 'll toast the duma with vodka tonight , but on monday morning we need to roll up our sleeves and get down to the real work , " said the environmental group 's climate policy advisor , steve sawyer .
positive turnaround bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmental experts say an increase in carbon dioxide emissions lead to global warming friday 's vote resuscitated the pact that until recently was considered all but dead after president george w. bush announced in 2001 that the united states , the world 's largest polluter , wanted no further part in it .
russia , which accounts for 17 percent of the world 's carbon dioxide emissions , had gone back and forth on endorsing the treaty ever since it was first drafted .
but finally a month ago , moscow government officials and putin recommended approval .
russia 's ratification was necessary for kyoto to go into force because the treaty stipulated that not only a majority of countries approve it , but that the signatory nations constitute 55 percent of the world 's emissions .
in their discussions ahead of the vote , russian officials hailed the financial opportunities the pact offered moscow - a turnaround from last year , when government leaders , including putin had derided the protocol as too costly .
" this protocol gives russia financial possibilities , " said valery zubov , a deputy with the main pro-kremlin united russia party in the discussion before friday 's vote .
" we have a chance to have a cleaner future . "
financial benefits russia hopes to make a short-term profit through the treaty by being able to sell off some of its quotas for greenhouse gas emissions to other industrialized signatories .
the idea is that under the treaty , countries who have not exhausted their limit for emissions will be able to sell off credit - essentially the right to pollute - to countries needing to increase their emissions quotas .
under the pressure of the market and with an eye for profit , nations will be inclined to produce fewer emissions in order to sell more .
point carbon , a norway-based consulting firm , has estimated that russia could earn $ 10 billion -lrb- € 8 billion -rrb- with the treaty 's help by 2012 .
russian deputy prime minister zhukov said russia would likely approach its kyoto quotas by 2010 if the nation 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- grew by 9 to 10 percent a year .
pressure to ratify bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow 's new arbat street is barely visible through thick smoke in the russian capital .
others have said russia was pressured by the international community into ratifying the pact .
" rusia was under unprecedented pressure , " said natalya narochinitskaya of the nationalist rodina -lrb- motherland -rrb- party .
" it 's ratification was presented as a stamp of a civilized country " and not based on scientific data , she said ahead of the vote .
it is widely believed that russia agreed to sign the protocol in return for the european union - one of the treaty 's major backers - supporting moscow 's bid to enter the world trade organization .
" it 's a very happy day for europe and for me , " said margot wallström , the swedish eu environment commissioner after the duma vote .
" it sends a very forceful signal to the rest of the world . "
" it is also very much a victory for the european union , " she said , in reference to the tug-of-war between brussels and washington over the pact .
despite being isolated in its opposition to the protocol , the united states has refused to endorse the treaty .

" the european proposal is an excessive demand that is contrary to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- and unacceptable , " alaeddin brujerdi , the influential head of parliament 's national security and foreign policy committee , told the conservative newspaper ressalat . britain , france and germany presented iran with a deal thursday aimed at avoiding possible sanctions under which tehran would receive valuable nuclear technology if it indefinitely suspended all uranium enrichment activities , according to a document prepared by the europeans . but brujerdi also raised the possibility that the conservative-controlled parliament could pass a bill forcing iran to halt its suspension of uranium enrichment in defiance of the un nuclear watchdog , the international atomic energy agency . " the european offer is a denial of the iranian nation 's legal rights bestowed under the npt , " brujerdi said .
" the islamic republic of iran will not accept a -lrb- western -rrb- monopoly on nuclear technology and will pursue its activities with determination . " thursday 's meeting was to give iran a last chance to disclose its complete nuclear program before the iaea decides on november 25 whether iran is cooperating with it on tehran 's nuclear activities .

" the enrichment of uranium is a question of national dignity and no-one can force the leaders of the country to renounce it , said hamid reza hadji-babaie , an mp and member of the speaker 's office .
" the negotiations were positive but the europeans must take account of our red lines , that is iran 's refusal to renounce the nuclear fuel cycle . " the official state news agency irna quoted an anonymous diplomat in vienna saying that the next round of talks between iran and the european three would start wednesday .
a report published this week by the international institute for strategic studies , a military and defense think tank , said that assuming iran lifts the suspension on its enrichment program , " it is still probably a few years away from full scale production of enough enriched uranium for a small nuclear arsenal . " forcing the reformers on october 5 , the parliamentary committee headed by brujerdi approved a bill that would force the reformist government of president mohammad khatami to resume uranium enrichment in defiance of the iaea .
if eventually passed in the majlis -lrb- parliament -rrb- and approved by legislative watchdogs , it would almost certainly prompt the iaea to refer iran 's case to the security council .

" many people were happy this summer when they caught large crayfish in their traps .
but the fact that there were so few small ones means that stocks could be threatened come next year , " lennart edsman , a crayfish researcher at the national board of fisheries , told afp . researchers have for the past five years been worried about the spread of the fungal disease , which has been present in swedish waters to varying extents for almost a century . but their fears are now growing as people illegally implant an imported variety of crayfish , called signal crayfish which carry the plague , into lakes that are home to sweden 's domestic variety , called noble crayfish . in the past , fisheries authorities restricted fishing and imposed minimum size requirements , but all restrictions were lifted in 1994 , to the regret of some . " people are beginning to suggest that maybe we should introduce restrictions again , " edsman said . a gastronomic feast crayfish mature in late summer , making an annual return to the table which is widely celebrated with a crayfish party , or " kraeftskiva " . swedes eat more crayfish than anybody else in the world - some four million kilos per year , or about a half kilo -lrb- one pound -rrb- per inhabitant , most of which is consumed in august during the crayfish party season .
" no other country comes even close when it comes to the amount eaten , " edsman said . boiled in a decoction of dill and then served cold on a heaping platter placed in the middle of the table within everyone 's reach , crayfish are eaten with bread , a matured hard cheese and plenty of schnapps .
raucous drinking songs , funny hats with crayfish designs and paper lanterns are de rigueur . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swedish princess victoria , left , shares a light moment with us chemistry nobel laureate william s. knowles from the united states , during a banquet measuring about 10 to 12 centimeters -lrb- four to five inches -rrb- , crayfish are finger food : no matter how distinguished the dinner guests , they delight in sucking the juices from the underside of the crayfish before breaking off the claws and tail and sucking out the meat , unmindful of the juices dripping down their chin and wrists . crayfish imports sound death knell the swedish tradition of eating crayfish dates back to the 1500s , when german chefs working for the royal family are believed to have introduced the delicacy . but the dish only spread to the broader public in the late 1800s , when it became so popular that over fishing threatened the stocks and authorities limited the period when they could be fished to a few weeks in august . in 1907 , crayfish imported from finland for a party but which were not eaten because they had spoiled were thrown into stockholm 's lake maelaren , infecting sweden with the crayfish plague for the first time .
over the years it killed off a large share of the noble crayfish . in 1969 , north american signal crayfish were transplanted into swedish waters to replace the decimated stocks .
signal crayfish were chosen because their taste is similar to that of the noble crayfish and because they were believed to be resistant to the plague . but that turned out to be incorrect .
in fact , all signal crayfish are carriers of the disease , and they can die of it too , a fact unknown even to many swedes .
as a result , people continue to implant signal crayfish into lakes with noble crayfish in the hopes of increasing their catches - and in some cases unwittingly contaminate the waters . costly delicacy under threat the result is disastrous : once a lake is infected , it wipes out all the noble crayfish .
and as long as there are signal crayfish in the water the lake will remain contaminated .
" many people think the signal crayfish population is doing really well , but it 's not , " edsman stressed . already a costly delicacy , any threat to stocks could send prices soaring further : come august , fresh noble crayfish sell for about 600 to 800 kronor a kilo -lrb- $ 82-111 , € 66-88 -rrb- , compared to around 250 kronor for signal crayfish and as little 40 kronor for those imported from china , spain and turkey . afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german fish industry moves east an increasing number of german fishing companies are moving production to low wage countries .

since the united states withdrew from the treaty , russia held the key to whether the landmark 1997 draft agreement would cross the threshold to becoming a working international accord .
for environmental groups , the ratification by moscow marks a significant step on the road to reducing greenhouse gases .
" we will look back on today as the moment in history when humanity faced up to its responsibility , " greenpeace said in a statement friday .
" we 'll toast the duma with vodka tonight , but on monday morning we need to roll up our sleeves and get down to the real work , " said the environmental group 's climate policy advisor , steve sawyer .
positive turnaround bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmental experts say an increase in carbon dioxide emissions lead to global warming friday 's vote resuscitated the pact that until recently was considered all but dead after president george w. bush announced in 2001 that the united states , the world 's largest polluter , wanted no further part in it .
russia , which accounts for 17 percent of the world 's carbon dioxide emissions , had gone back and forth on endorsing the treaty ever since it was first drafted .
but finally a month ago , moscow government officials and putin recommended approval .
russia 's ratification was necessary for kyoto to go into force because the treaty stipulated that not only a majority of countries approve it , but that the signatory nations constitute 55 percent of the world 's emissions .
in their discussions ahead of the vote , russian officials hailed the financial opportunities the pact offered moscow - a turnaround from last year , when government leaders , including putin had derided the protocol as too costly .
" this protocol gives russia financial possibilities , " said valery zubov , a deputy with the main pro-kremlin united russia party in the discussion before friday 's vote .
" we have a chance to have a cleaner future . "
financial benefits russia hopes to make a short-term profit through the treaty by being able to sell off some of its quotas for greenhouse gas emissions to other industrialized signatories .
the idea is that under the treaty , countries who have not exhausted their limit for emissions will be able to sell off credit - essentially the right to pollute - to countries needing to increase their emissions quotas .
under the pressure of the market and with an eye for profit , nations will be inclined to produce fewer emissions in order to sell more .
point carbon , a norway-based consulting firm , has estimated that russia could earn $ 10 billion -lrb- € 8 billion -rrb- with the treaty 's help by 2012 .
russian deputy prime minister zhukov said russia would likely approach its kyoto quotas by 2010 if the nation 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- grew by 9 to 10 percent a year .
pressure to ratify bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow 's new arbat street is barely visible through thick smoke in the russian capital .
others have said russia was pressured by the international community into ratifying the pact .
" rusia was under unprecedented pressure , " said natalya narochinitskaya of the nationalist rodina -lrb- motherland -rrb- party .
" it 's ratification was presented as a stamp of a civilized country " and not based on scientific data , she said ahead of the vote .
it is widely believed that russia agreed to sign the protocol in return for the european union - one of the treaty 's major backers - supporting moscow 's bid to enter the world trade organization .
" it 's a very happy day for europe and for me , " said margot wallström , the swedish eu environment commissioner after the duma vote .
" it sends a very forceful signal to the rest of the world . "
" it is also very much a victory for the european union , " she said , in reference to the tug-of-war between brussels and washington over the pact .
despite being isolated in its opposition to the protocol , the united states has refused to endorse the treaty .

the kosovo force -lrb- kfor -rrb- is already the north-atlantic alliance 's biggest mission with some 19,000 troops in the field .
kosovo police spokesman refki morina said police were also out in force , with all 6,000 local officers on duty " to ensure security and safety " . un officials said no incidents had been reported in the first hours of voting and turnout was just over five percent of 1.3 million registered voters .
kosovo 's chief un administrator , soren jessen-petersen , said the election marked a " turning point " and would set the stage for a un review of democracy standards early next year and possible talks on final status . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.n-the head of the united nations mission in kosovo soren jessen petersen .

the kosovo force -lrb- kfor -rrb- is already the north-atlantic alliance 's biggest mission with some 19,000 troops in the field .
kosovo police spokesman refki morina said police were also out in force , with all 6,000 local officers on duty " to ensure security and safety " . un officials said no incidents had been reported in the first hours of voting and turnout was just over five percent of 1.3 million registered voters .
kosovo 's chief un administrator , soren jessen-petersen , said the election marked a " turning point " and would set the stage for a un review of democracy standards early next year and possible talks on final status . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.n-the head of the united nations mission in kosovo soren jessen petersen .

" the european proposal is an excessive demand that is contrary to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- and unacceptable , " alaeddin brujerdi , the influential head of parliament 's national security and foreign policy committee , told the conservative newspaper ressalat . britain , france and germany presented iran with a deal thursday aimed at avoiding possible sanctions under which tehran would receive valuable nuclear technology if it indefinitely suspended all uranium enrichment activities , according to a document prepared by the europeans . but brujerdi also raised the possibility that the conservative-controlled parliament could pass a bill forcing iran to halt its suspension of uranium enrichment in defiance of the un nuclear watchdog , the international atomic energy agency . " the european offer is a denial of the iranian nation 's legal rights bestowed under the npt , " brujerdi said .
" the islamic republic of iran will not accept a -lrb- western -rrb- monopoly on nuclear technology and will pursue its activities with determination . " thursday 's meeting was to give iran a last chance to disclose its complete nuclear program before the iaea decides on november 25 whether iran is cooperating with it on tehran 's nuclear activities .
the united states wants the iaea , which since february 2003 has been investigating us claims that iran has a covert nuclear weapons program , to refer tehran to the un security council , which could impose sanctions . only for electricity ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tehran has long insisted it is seeking only to generate electricity and on its right to uranium enrichment , which makes fuel for civilian reactors but can also manufacture the explosive material for atomic bombs .
under the european deal , iran would receive technology including a light-water reactor which would produce less fissionable material than the heavy-water reactor tehran is planning to build with russian help in bushehr . " the enrichment of uranium is a question of national dignity and no-one can force the leaders of the country to renounce it , said hamid reza hadji-babaie , an mp and member of the speaker 's office .
" the negotiations were positive but the europeans must take account of our red lines , that is iran 's refusal to renounce the nuclear fuel cycle . " the official state news agency irna quoted an anonymous diplomat in vienna saying that the next round of talks between iran and the european three would start wednesday .
a report published this week by the international institute for strategic studies , a military and defense think tank , said that assuming iran lifts the suspension on its enrichment program , " it is still probably a few years away from full scale production of enough enriched uranium for a small nuclear arsenal . " forcing the reformers on october 5 , the parliamentary committee headed by brujerdi approved a bill that would force the reformist government of president mohammad khatami to resume uranium enrichment in defiance of the iaea .
if eventually passed in the majlis -lrb- parliament -rrb- and approved by legislative watchdogs , it would almost certainly prompt the iaea to refer iran 's case to the security council . " the plan to oblige the government to resume enrichment has the support of 238 deputies " out of a total 290 , brujerdi said saturday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali akbar salehi iran 's former representative to the iaea , ali-akbar salehi , said the european proposals contained both positive and negative points , and urged the country 's leaders to examine them without hesitation .
" i believe the two sides do not want to reach a deadlock .
so the europeans must move some way towards our position , " salehi told the afp news agency . but another conservative mp dismissed the european offer .
" a light-water reactor is useable only for medical and agricultural needs but a heavy-water reactor can also produce plutonium for use in nuclear power plants , " another mp heshmatollah falahat-pisheh said , quoted by the conservative kayhan newspaper . us secretary of state colin powell said on saturday that washington had seen no sign that iran would comply with international demands on its nuclear program and would push next month for the matter to be sent to the un security council unless tehran reversed its course . afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us skeptical of iran-eu nuke talks iran 's decision thursday to pursue talks with europe 's three major powers over its nuclear ambitions prompted a suspicious response from the united states which favors direct compliance with united nations regulations .

since the united states withdrew from the treaty , russia held the key to whether the landmark 1997 draft agreement would cross the threshold to becoming a working international accord .
for environmental groups , the ratification by moscow marks a significant step on the road to reducing greenhouse gases .
" we will look back on today as the moment in history when humanity faced up to its responsibility , " greenpeace said in a statement friday .
" we 'll toast the duma with vodka tonight , but on monday morning we need to roll up our sleeves and get down to the real work , " said the environmental group 's climate policy advisor , steve sawyer .
positive turnaround bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmental experts say an increase in carbon dioxide emissions lead to global warming friday 's vote resuscitated the pact that until recently was considered all but dead after president george w. bush announced in 2001 that the united states , the world 's largest polluter , wanted no further part in it .
russia , which accounts for 17 percent of the world 's carbon dioxide emissions , had gone back and forth on endorsing the treaty ever since it was first drafted .
but finally a month ago , moscow government officials and putin recommended approval .
russia 's ratification was necessary for kyoto to go into force because the treaty stipulated that not only a majority of countries approve it , but that the signatory nations constitute 55 percent of the world 's emissions .
in their discussions ahead of the vote , russian officials hailed the financial opportunities the pact offered moscow - a turnaround from last year , when government leaders , including putin had derided the protocol as too costly .
" this protocol gives russia financial possibilities , " said valery zubov , a deputy with the main pro-kremlin united russia party in the discussion before friday 's vote .
" we have a chance to have a cleaner future . "
financial benefits russia hopes to make a short-term profit through the treaty by being able to sell off some of its quotas for greenhouse gas emissions to other industrialized signatories .
the idea is that under the treaty , countries who have not exhausted their limit for emissions will be able to sell off credit - essentially the right to pollute - to countries needing to increase their emissions quotas .
under the pressure of the market and with an eye for profit , nations will be inclined to produce fewer emissions in order to sell more .
point carbon , a norway-based consulting firm , has estimated that russia could earn $ 10 billion -lrb- € 8 billion -rrb- with the treaty 's help by 2012 .
russian deputy prime minister zhukov said russia would likely approach its kyoto quotas by 2010 if the nation 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- grew by 9 to 10 percent a year .

others have said russia was pressured by the international community into ratifying the pact .
" rusia was under unprecedented pressure , " said natalya narochinitskaya of the nationalist rodina -lrb- motherland -rrb- party .
" it 's ratification was presented as a stamp of a civilized country " and not based on scientific data , she said ahead of the vote .
it is widely believed that russia agreed to sign the protocol in return for the european union - one of the treaty 's major backers - supporting moscow 's bid to enter the world trade organization .
" it 's a very happy day for europe and for me , " said margot wallström , the swedish eu environment commissioner after the duma vote .
" it sends a very forceful signal to the rest of the world . "

the kosovo force -lrb- kfor -rrb- is already the north-atlantic alliance 's biggest mission with some 19,000 troops in the field .
kosovo police spokesman refki morina said police were also out in force , with all 6,000 local officers on duty " to ensure security and safety " . un officials said no incidents had been reported in the first hours of voting and turnout was just over five percent of 1.3 million registered voters .
kosovo 's chief un administrator , soren jessen-petersen , said the election marked a " turning point " and would set the stage for a un review of democracy standards early next year and possible talks on final status . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.n-the head of the united nations mission in kosovo soren jessen petersen .
he urged the province 's ethnic serb minority to participate and vowed to make their safety a top priority .
" kosovo 's serbs need legitimately elected leaders who can engage with the challenges ahead , " he wrote saturday in the international herald tribune .
" since ethnic albanians rioted against minority serbs in march , the damage has begun to be repaired and kosovo has moved forward , " jessen-petersen said . serbs stay home but in the northern , mainly serb town of zvecan a lone voter had cast his ballot 90 minutes after the polls opened .
kosovo serb leaders gathered in a nearby orthodox church to light candles a symbol of hope . " we have n't noticed that elections are being held today , " said milan ivanovic , a prominent kosovo serb .
however another serb politician , oliver ivanovic , said he would encourage his supporters to vote .
" it is obvious that there is no other solution , that only with our energy and powers we can take up responsibilities for our future , " he said . ethnic albanians demand complete independence from serbia but ethnic serbs and the government in belgrade insist that the territory is an inalienable part of the former yugoslav republic .
analysts believe a boycott will deprive the serbs of legitimate leaders to participate in any future talks on the province 's status and the future of the un protectorate . kosovo president ibrahim rugova , an ethnic albanian , said the vote was " a great and important date for the independence of kosovo .
i believe that all citizens will vote as these elections are important for the formal recognition of independence , " he said after casting his ballot . more than 33 political groups and 30 independent candidates are taking part in the election .
the latest surveys show that no party will win enough votes to control the parliament and form a government by itself .
some 12,000 local and international observers are on hand to look for irregularities .

" the european proposal is an excessive demand that is contrary to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- and unacceptable , " alaeddin brujerdi , the influential head of parliament 's national security and foreign policy committee , told the conservative newspaper ressalat . britain , france and germany presented iran with a deal thursday aimed at avoiding possible sanctions under which tehran would receive valuable nuclear technology if it indefinitely suspended all uranium enrichment activities , according to a document prepared by the europeans . but brujerdi also raised the possibility that the conservative-controlled parliament could pass a bill forcing iran to halt its suspension of uranium enrichment in defiance of the un nuclear watchdog , the international atomic energy agency . " the european offer is a denial of the iranian nation 's legal rights bestowed under the npt , " brujerdi said .
" the islamic republic of iran will not accept a -lrb- western -rrb- monopoly on nuclear technology and will pursue its activities with determination . " thursday 's meeting was to give iran a last chance to disclose its complete nuclear program before the iaea decides on november 25 whether iran is cooperating with it on tehran 's nuclear activities .
the united states wants the iaea , which since february 2003 has been investigating us claims that iran has a covert nuclear weapons program , to refer tehran to the un security council , which could impose sanctions . only for electricity ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tehran has long insisted it is seeking only to generate electricity and on its right to uranium enrichment , which makes fuel for civilian reactors but can also manufacture the explosive material for atomic bombs .
under the european deal , iran would receive technology including a light-water reactor which would produce less fissionable material than the heavy-water reactor tehran is planning to build with russian help in bushehr . " the enrichment of uranium is a question of national dignity and no-one can force the leaders of the country to renounce it , said hamid reza hadji-babaie , an mp and member of the speaker 's office .
" the negotiations were positive but the europeans must take account of our red lines , that is iran 's refusal to renounce the nuclear fuel cycle . " the official state news agency irna quoted an anonymous diplomat in vienna saying that the next round of talks between iran and the european three would start wednesday .
a report published this week by the international institute for strategic studies , a military and defense think tank , said that assuming iran lifts the suspension on its enrichment program , " it is still probably a few years away from full scale production of enough enriched uranium for a small nuclear arsenal . " forcing the reformers on october 5 , the parliamentary committee headed by brujerdi approved a bill that would force the reformist government of president mohammad khatami to resume uranium enrichment in defiance of the iaea .
if eventually passed in the majlis -lrb- parliament -rrb- and approved by legislative watchdogs , it would almost certainly prompt the iaea to refer iran 's case to the security council . " the plan to oblige the government to resume enrichment has the support of 238 deputies " out of a total 290 , brujerdi said saturday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali akbar salehi iran 's former representative to the iaea , ali-akbar salehi , said the european proposals contained both positive and negative points , and urged the country 's leaders to examine them without hesitation .
" i believe the two sides do not want to reach a deadlock .
so the europeans must move some way towards our position , " salehi told the afp news agency . but another conservative mp dismissed the european offer .
" a light-water reactor is useable only for medical and agricultural needs but a heavy-water reactor can also produce plutonium for use in nuclear power plants , " another mp heshmatollah falahat-pisheh said , quoted by the conservative kayhan newspaper . us secretary of state colin powell said on saturday that washington had seen no sign that iran would comply with international demands on its nuclear program and would push next month for the matter to be sent to the un security council unless tehran reversed its course . afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us skeptical of iran-eu nuke talks iran 's decision thursday to pursue talks with europe 's three major powers over its nuclear ambitions prompted a suspicious response from the united states which favors direct compliance with united nations regulations .

" the european proposal is an excessive demand that is contrary to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- and unacceptable , " alaeddin brujerdi , the influential head of parliament 's national security and foreign policy committee , told the conservative newspaper ressalat . britain , france and germany presented iran with a deal thursday aimed at avoiding possible sanctions under which tehran would receive valuable nuclear technology if it indefinitely suspended all uranium enrichment activities , according to a document prepared by the europeans . but brujerdi also raised the possibility that the conservative-controlled parliament could pass a bill forcing iran to halt its suspension of uranium enrichment in defiance of the un nuclear watchdog , the international atomic energy agency . " the european offer is a denial of the iranian nation 's legal rights bestowed under the npt , " brujerdi said .
" the islamic republic of iran will not accept a -lrb- western -rrb- monopoly on nuclear technology and will pursue its activities with determination . " thursday 's meeting was to give iran a last chance to disclose its complete nuclear program before the iaea decides on november 25 whether iran is cooperating with it on tehran 's nuclear activities .
the united states wants the iaea , which since february 2003 has been investigating us claims that iran has a covert nuclear weapons program , to refer tehran to the un security council , which could impose sanctions . only for electricity ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tehran has long insisted it is seeking only to generate electricity and on its right to uranium enrichment , which makes fuel for civilian reactors but can also manufacture the explosive material for atomic bombs .
under the european deal , iran would receive technology including a light-water reactor which would produce less fissionable material than the heavy-water reactor tehran is planning to build with russian help in bushehr . " the enrichment of uranium is a question of national dignity and no-one can force the leaders of the country to renounce it , said hamid reza hadji-babaie , an mp and member of the speaker 's office .
" the negotiations were positive but the europeans must take account of our red lines , that is iran 's refusal to renounce the nuclear fuel cycle . " the official state news agency irna quoted an anonymous diplomat in vienna saying that the next round of talks between iran and the european three would start wednesday .
a report published this week by the international institute for strategic studies , a military and defense think tank , said that assuming iran lifts the suspension on its enrichment program , " it is still probably a few years away from full scale production of enough enriched uranium for a small nuclear arsenal . " forcing the reformers on october 5 , the parliamentary committee headed by brujerdi approved a bill that would force the reformist government of president mohammad khatami to resume uranium enrichment in defiance of the iaea .
if eventually passed in the majlis -lrb- parliament -rrb- and approved by legislative watchdogs , it would almost certainly prompt the iaea to refer iran 's case to the security council . " the plan to oblige the government to resume enrichment has the support of 238 deputies " out of a total 290 , brujerdi said saturday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali akbar salehi iran 's former representative to the iaea , ali-akbar salehi , said the european proposals contained both positive and negative points , and urged the country 's leaders to examine them without hesitation .
" i believe the two sides do not want to reach a deadlock .
so the europeans must move some way towards our position , " salehi told the afp news agency . but another conservative mp dismissed the european offer .
" a light-water reactor is useable only for medical and agricultural needs but a heavy-water reactor can also produce plutonium for use in nuclear power plants , " another mp heshmatollah falahat-pisheh said , quoted by the conservative kayhan newspaper . us secretary of state colin powell said on saturday that washington had seen no sign that iran would comply with international demands on its nuclear program and would push next month for the matter to be sent to the un security council unless tehran reversed its course . afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us skeptical of iran-eu nuke talks iran 's decision thursday to pursue talks with europe 's three major powers over its nuclear ambitions prompted a suspicious response from the united states which favors direct compliance with united nations regulations .

" many people were happy this summer when they caught large crayfish in their traps .
but the fact that there were so few small ones means that stocks could be threatened come next year , " lennart edsman , a crayfish researcher at the national board of fisheries , told afp . researchers have for the past five years been worried about the spread of the fungal disease , which has been present in swedish waters to varying extents for almost a century . but their fears are now growing as people illegally implant an imported variety of crayfish , called signal crayfish which carry the plague , into lakes that are home to sweden 's domestic variety , called noble crayfish . in the past , fisheries authorities restricted fishing and imposed minimum size requirements , but all restrictions were lifted in 1994 , to the regret of some . " people are beginning to suggest that maybe we should introduce restrictions again , " edsman said . a gastronomic feast crayfish mature in late summer , making an annual return to the table which is widely celebrated with a crayfish party , or " kraeftskiva " . swedes eat more crayfish than anybody else in the world - some four million kilos per year , or about a half kilo -lrb- one pound -rrb- per inhabitant , most of which is consumed in august during the crayfish party season .
" no other country comes even close when it comes to the amount eaten , " edsman said . boiled in a decoction of dill and then served cold on a heaping platter placed in the middle of the table within everyone 's reach , crayfish are eaten with bread , a matured hard cheese and plenty of schnapps .
raucous drinking songs , funny hats with crayfish designs and paper lanterns are de rigueur . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swedish princess victoria , left , shares a light moment with us chemistry nobel laureate william s. knowles from the united states , during a banquet measuring about 10 to 12 centimeters -lrb- four to five inches -rrb- , crayfish are finger food : no matter how distinguished the dinner guests , they delight in sucking the juices from the underside of the crayfish before breaking off the claws and tail and sucking out the meat , unmindful of the juices dripping down their chin and wrists . crayfish imports sound death knell the swedish tradition of eating crayfish dates back to the 1500s , when german chefs working for the royal family are believed to have introduced the delicacy . but the dish only spread to the broader public in the late 1800s , when it became so popular that over fishing threatened the stocks and authorities limited the period when they could be fished to a few weeks in august . in 1907 , crayfish imported from finland for a party but which were not eaten because they had spoiled were thrown into stockholm 's lake maelaren , infecting sweden with the crayfish plague for the first time .
over the years it killed off a large share of the noble crayfish . in 1969 , north american signal crayfish were transplanted into swedish waters to replace the decimated stocks .
signal crayfish were chosen because their taste is similar to that of the noble crayfish and because they were believed to be resistant to the plague . but that turned out to be incorrect .
in fact , all signal crayfish are carriers of the disease , and they can die of it too , a fact unknown even to many swedes .
as a result , people continue to implant signal crayfish into lakes with noble crayfish in the hopes of increasing their catches - and in some cases unwittingly contaminate the waters . costly delicacy under threat the result is disastrous : once a lake is infected , it wipes out all the noble crayfish .
and as long as there are signal crayfish in the water the lake will remain contaminated .
" many people think the signal crayfish population is doing really well , but it 's not , " edsman stressed . already a costly delicacy , any threat to stocks could send prices soaring further : come august , fresh noble crayfish sell for about 600 to 800 kronor a kilo -lrb- $ 82-111 , € 66-88 -rrb- , compared to around 250 kronor for signal crayfish and as little 40 kronor for those imported from china , spain and turkey . afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german fish industry moves east an increasing number of german fishing companies are moving production to low wage countries .

signal crayfish were chosen because their taste is similar to that of the noble crayfish and because they were believed to be resistant to the plague . but that turned out to be incorrect .
in fact , all signal crayfish are carriers of the disease , and they can die of it too , a fact unknown even to many swedes .

" many people were happy this summer when they caught large crayfish in their traps .
but the fact that there were so few small ones means that stocks could be threatened come next year , " lennart edsman , a crayfish researcher at the national board of fisheries , told afp . researchers have for the past five years been worried about the spread of the fungal disease , which has been present in swedish waters to varying extents for almost a century . but their fears are now growing as people illegally implant an imported variety of crayfish , called signal crayfish which carry the plague , into lakes that are home to sweden 's domestic variety , called noble crayfish . in the past , fisheries authorities restricted fishing and imposed minimum size requirements , but all restrictions were lifted in 1994 , to the regret of some . " people are beginning to suggest that maybe we should introduce restrictions again , " edsman said . a gastronomic feast crayfish mature in late summer , making an annual return to the table which is widely celebrated with a crayfish party , or " kraeftskiva " . swedes eat more crayfish than anybody else in the world - some four million kilos per year , or about a half kilo -lrb- one pound -rrb- per inhabitant , most of which is consumed in august during the crayfish party season .
" no other country comes even close when it comes to the amount eaten , " edsman said . boiled in a decoction of dill and then served cold on a heaping platter placed in the middle of the table within everyone 's reach , crayfish are eaten with bread , a matured hard cheese and plenty of schnapps .
raucous drinking songs , funny hats with crayfish designs and paper lanterns are de rigueur . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swedish princess victoria , left , shares a light moment with us chemistry nobel laureate william s. knowles from the united states , during a banquet measuring about 10 to 12 centimeters -lrb- four to five inches -rrb- , crayfish are finger food : no matter how distinguished the dinner guests , they delight in sucking the juices from the underside of the crayfish before breaking off the claws and tail and sucking out the meat , unmindful of the juices dripping down their chin and wrists . crayfish imports sound death knell the swedish tradition of eating crayfish dates back to the 1500s , when german chefs working for the royal family are believed to have introduced the delicacy . but the dish only spread to the broader public in the late 1800s , when it became so popular that over fishing threatened the stocks and authorities limited the period when they could be fished to a few weeks in august . in 1907 , crayfish imported from finland for a party but which were not eaten because they had spoiled were thrown into stockholm 's lake maelaren , infecting sweden with the crayfish plague for the first time .
over the years it killed off a large share of the noble crayfish . in 1969 , north american signal crayfish were transplanted into swedish waters to replace the decimated stocks .
signal crayfish were chosen because their taste is similar to that of the noble crayfish and because they were believed to be resistant to the plague . but that turned out to be incorrect .
in fact , all signal crayfish are carriers of the disease , and they can die of it too , a fact unknown even to many swedes .
as a result , people continue to implant signal crayfish into lakes with noble crayfish in the hopes of increasing their catches - and in some cases unwittingly contaminate the waters . costly delicacy under threat the result is disastrous : once a lake is infected , it wipes out all the noble crayfish .
and as long as there are signal crayfish in the water the lake will remain contaminated .
" many people think the signal crayfish population is doing really well , but it 's not , " edsman stressed . already a costly delicacy , any threat to stocks could send prices soaring further : come august , fresh noble crayfish sell for about 600 to 800 kronor a kilo -lrb- $ 82-111 , € 66-88 -rrb- , compared to around 250 kronor for signal crayfish and as little 40 kronor for those imported from china , spain and turkey . afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german fish industry moves east an increasing number of german fishing companies are moving production to low wage countries .

since the united states withdrew from the treaty , russia held the key to whether the landmark 1997 draft agreement would cross the threshold to becoming a working international accord .
for environmental groups , the ratification by moscow marks a significant step on the road to reducing greenhouse gases .
" we will look back on today as the moment in history when humanity faced up to its responsibility , " greenpeace said in a statement friday .
" we 'll toast the duma with vodka tonight , but on monday morning we need to roll up our sleeves and get down to the real work , " said the environmental group 's climate policy advisor , steve sawyer .
positive turnaround bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmental experts say an increase in carbon dioxide emissions lead to global warming friday 's vote resuscitated the pact that until recently was considered all but dead after president george w. bush announced in 2001 that the united states , the world 's largest polluter , wanted no further part in it .
russia , which accounts for 17 percent of the world 's carbon dioxide emissions , had gone back and forth on endorsing the treaty ever since it was first drafted .
but finally a month ago , moscow government officials and putin recommended approval .
russia 's ratification was necessary for kyoto to go into force because the treaty stipulated that not only a majority of countries approve it , but that the signatory nations constitute 55 percent of the world 's emissions .
in their discussions ahead of the vote , russian officials hailed the financial opportunities the pact offered moscow - a turnaround from last year , when government leaders , including putin had derided the protocol as too costly .
" this protocol gives russia financial possibilities , " said valery zubov , a deputy with the main pro-kremlin united russia party in the discussion before friday 's vote .
" we have a chance to have a cleaner future . "
financial benefits russia hopes to make a short-term profit through the treaty by being able to sell off some of its quotas for greenhouse gas emissions to other industrialized signatories .
the idea is that under the treaty , countries who have not exhausted their limit for emissions will be able to sell off credit - essentially the right to pollute - to countries needing to increase their emissions quotas .
under the pressure of the market and with an eye for profit , nations will be inclined to produce fewer emissions in order to sell more .
point carbon , a norway-based consulting firm , has estimated that russia could earn $ 10 billion -lrb- € 8 billion -rrb- with the treaty 's help by 2012 .
russian deputy prime minister zhukov said russia would likely approach its kyoto quotas by 2010 if the nation 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- grew by 9 to 10 percent a year .
pressure to ratify bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow 's new arbat street is barely visible through thick smoke in the russian capital .
others have said russia was pressured by the international community into ratifying the pact .
" rusia was under unprecedented pressure , " said natalya narochinitskaya of the nationalist rodina -lrb- motherland -rrb- party .
" it 's ratification was presented as a stamp of a civilized country " and not based on scientific data , she said ahead of the vote .
it is widely believed that russia agreed to sign the protocol in return for the european union - one of the treaty 's major backers - supporting moscow 's bid to enter the world trade organization .
" it 's a very happy day for europe and for me , " said margot wallström , the swedish eu environment commissioner after the duma vote .
" it sends a very forceful signal to the rest of the world . "
" it is also very much a victory for the european union , " she said , in reference to the tug-of-war between brussels and washington over the pact .

the anti-smoking campaign involves putting graphic images of the health consequences of smoking on cigarette packs .
the series of 42 images includes rotten lungs , decayed teeth , a corpse , a baby with an oxygen mask and gory details of a man with a cancerous tumor on his throat . the collection also includes more subtle allusions to the dangers of smoking - a wrinkled apple accompanies a warning about skin ageing , while a bent cigarette illustrates a warning about impotence . shocking people out of complacency unveiling the campaign in brussels on friday , david byrne , eu commissioner for health and consumer protection , said the aim was to frighten people into kicking the habit .

" the european proposal is an excessive demand that is contrary to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- and unacceptable , " alaeddin brujerdi , the influential head of parliament 's national security and foreign policy committee , told the conservative newspaper ressalat . britain , france and germany presented iran with a deal thursday aimed at avoiding possible sanctions under which tehran would receive valuable nuclear technology if it indefinitely suspended all uranium enrichment activities , according to a document prepared by the europeans . but brujerdi also raised the possibility that the conservative-controlled parliament could pass a bill forcing iran to halt its suspension of uranium enrichment in defiance of the un nuclear watchdog , the international atomic energy agency . " the european offer is a denial of the iranian nation 's legal rights bestowed under the npt , " brujerdi said .
" the islamic republic of iran will not accept a -lrb- western -rrb- monopoly on nuclear technology and will pursue its activities with determination . " thursday 's meeting was to give iran a last chance to disclose its complete nuclear program before the iaea decides on november 25 whether iran is cooperating with it on tehran 's nuclear activities .
the united states wants the iaea , which since february 2003 has been investigating us claims that iran has a covert nuclear weapons program , to refer tehran to the un security council , which could impose sanctions . only for electricity ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tehran has long insisted it is seeking only to generate electricity and on its right to uranium enrichment , which makes fuel for civilian reactors but can also manufacture the explosive material for atomic bombs .
under the european deal , iran would receive technology including a light-water reactor which would produce less fissionable material than the heavy-water reactor tehran is planning to build with russian help in bushehr . " the enrichment of uranium is a question of national dignity and no-one can force the leaders of the country to renounce it , said hamid reza hadji-babaie , an mp and member of the speaker 's office .
" the negotiations were positive but the europeans must take account of our red lines , that is iran 's refusal to renounce the nuclear fuel cycle . " the official state news agency irna quoted an anonymous diplomat in vienna saying that the next round of talks between iran and the european three would start wednesday .
a report published this week by the international institute for strategic studies , a military and defense think tank , said that assuming iran lifts the suspension on its enrichment program , " it is still probably a few years away from full scale production of enough enriched uranium for a small nuclear arsenal . " forcing the reformers on october 5 , the parliamentary committee headed by brujerdi approved a bill that would force the reformist government of president mohammad khatami to resume uranium enrichment in defiance of the iaea .
if eventually passed in the majlis -lrb- parliament -rrb- and approved by legislative watchdogs , it would almost certainly prompt the iaea to refer iran 's case to the security council . " the plan to oblige the government to resume enrichment has the support of 238 deputies " out of a total 290 , brujerdi said saturday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali akbar salehi iran 's former representative to the iaea , ali-akbar salehi , said the european proposals contained both positive and negative points , and urged the country 's leaders to examine them without hesitation .
" i believe the two sides do not want to reach a deadlock .
so the europeans must move some way towards our position , " salehi told the afp news agency . but another conservative mp dismissed the european offer .
" a light-water reactor is useable only for medical and agricultural needs but a heavy-water reactor can also produce plutonium for use in nuclear power plants , " another mp heshmatollah falahat-pisheh said , quoted by the conservative kayhan newspaper . us secretary of state colin powell said on saturday that washington had seen no sign that iran would comply with international demands on its nuclear program and would push next month for the matter to be sent to the un security council unless tehran reversed its course . afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us skeptical of iran-eu nuke talks iran 's decision thursday to pursue talks with europe 's three major powers over its nuclear ambitions prompted a suspicious response from the united states which favors direct compliance with united nations regulations .

the kosovo force -lrb- kfor -rrb- is already the north-atlantic alliance 's biggest mission with some 19,000 troops in the field .
kosovo police spokesman refki morina said police were also out in force , with all 6,000 local officers on duty " to ensure security and safety " . un officials said no incidents had been reported in the first hours of voting and turnout was just over five percent of 1.3 million registered voters .
kosovo 's chief un administrator , soren jessen-petersen , said the election marked a " turning point " and would set the stage for a un review of democracy standards early next year and possible talks on final status . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.n-the head of the united nations mission in kosovo soren jessen petersen .
he urged the province 's ethnic serb minority to participate and vowed to make their safety a top priority .
" kosovo 's serbs need legitimately elected leaders who can engage with the challenges ahead , " he wrote saturday in the international herald tribune .
" since ethnic albanians rioted against minority serbs in march , the damage has begun to be repaired and kosovo has moved forward , " jessen-petersen said . serbs stay home but in the northern , mainly serb town of zvecan a lone voter had cast his ballot 90 minutes after the polls opened .
kosovo serb leaders gathered in a nearby orthodox church to light candles a symbol of hope . " we have n't noticed that elections are being held today , " said milan ivanovic , a prominent kosovo serb .
however another serb politician , oliver ivanovic , said he would encourage his supporters to vote .
" it is obvious that there is no other solution , that only with our energy and powers we can take up responsibilities for our future , " he said . ethnic albanians demand complete independence from serbia but ethnic serbs and the government in belgrade insist that the territory is an inalienable part of the former yugoslav republic .
analysts believe a boycott will deprive the serbs of legitimate leaders to participate in any future talks on the province 's status and the future of the un protectorate . kosovo president ibrahim rugova , an ethnic albanian , said the vote was " a great and important date for the independence of kosovo .
i believe that all citizens will vote as these elections are important for the formal recognition of independence , " he said after casting his ballot . more than 33 political groups and 30 independent candidates are taking part in the election .
the latest surveys show that no party will win enough votes to control the parliament and form a government by itself .
some 12,000 local and international observers are on hand to look for irregularities .

" the european proposal is an excessive demand that is contrary to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- and unacceptable , " alaeddin brujerdi , the influential head of parliament 's national security and foreign policy committee , told the conservative newspaper ressalat . britain , france and germany presented iran with a deal thursday aimed at avoiding possible sanctions under which tehran would receive valuable nuclear technology if it indefinitely suspended all uranium enrichment activities , according to a document prepared by the europeans . but brujerdi also raised the possibility that the conservative-controlled parliament could pass a bill forcing iran to halt its suspension of uranium enrichment in defiance of the un nuclear watchdog , the international atomic energy agency . " the european offer is a denial of the iranian nation 's legal rights bestowed under the npt , " brujerdi said .
" the islamic republic of iran will not accept a -lrb- western -rrb- monopoly on nuclear technology and will pursue its activities with determination . " thursday 's meeting was to give iran a last chance to disclose its complete nuclear program before the iaea decides on november 25 whether iran is cooperating with it on tehran 's nuclear activities .
the united states wants the iaea , which since february 2003 has been investigating us claims that iran has a covert nuclear weapons program , to refer tehran to the un security council , which could impose sanctions . only for electricity ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tehran has long insisted it is seeking only to generate electricity and on its right to uranium enrichment , which makes fuel for civilian reactors but can also manufacture the explosive material for atomic bombs .
under the european deal , iran would receive technology including a light-water reactor which would produce less fissionable material than the heavy-water reactor tehran is planning to build with russian help in bushehr . " the enrichment of uranium is a question of national dignity and no-one can force the leaders of the country to renounce it , said hamid reza hadji-babaie , an mp and member of the speaker 's office .
" the negotiations were positive but the europeans must take account of our red lines , that is iran 's refusal to renounce the nuclear fuel cycle . " the official state news agency irna quoted an anonymous diplomat in vienna saying that the next round of talks between iran and the european three would start wednesday .
a report published this week by the international institute for strategic studies , a military and defense think tank , said that assuming iran lifts the suspension on its enrichment program , " it is still probably a few years away from full scale production of enough enriched uranium for a small nuclear arsenal . " forcing the reformers on october 5 , the parliamentary committee headed by brujerdi approved a bill that would force the reformist government of president mohammad khatami to resume uranium enrichment in defiance of the iaea .
if eventually passed in the majlis -lrb- parliament -rrb- and approved by legislative watchdogs , it would almost certainly prompt the iaea to refer iran 's case to the security council . " the plan to oblige the government to resume enrichment has the support of 238 deputies " out of a total 290 , brujerdi said saturday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali akbar salehi iran 's former representative to the iaea , ali-akbar salehi , said the european proposals contained both positive and negative points , and urged the country 's leaders to examine them without hesitation .
" i believe the two sides do not want to reach a deadlock .
so the europeans must move some way towards our position , " salehi told the afp news agency . but another conservative mp dismissed the european offer .
" a light-water reactor is useable only for medical and agricultural needs but a heavy-water reactor can also produce plutonium for use in nuclear power plants , " another mp heshmatollah falahat-pisheh said , quoted by the conservative kayhan newspaper . us secretary of state colin powell said on saturday that washington had seen no sign that iran would comply with international demands on its nuclear program and would push next month for the matter to be sent to the un security council unless tehran reversed its course . afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us skeptical of iran-eu nuke talks iran 's decision thursday to pursue talks with europe 's three major powers over its nuclear ambitions prompted a suspicious response from the united states which favors direct compliance with united nations regulations .

" the european proposal is an excessive demand that is contrary to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- and unacceptable , " alaeddin brujerdi , the influential head of parliament 's national security and foreign policy committee , told the conservative newspaper ressalat . britain , france and germany presented iran with a deal thursday aimed at avoiding possible sanctions under which tehran would receive valuable nuclear technology if it indefinitely suspended all uranium enrichment activities , according to a document prepared by the europeans . but brujerdi also raised the possibility that the conservative-controlled parliament could pass a bill forcing iran to halt its suspension of uranium enrichment in defiance of the un nuclear watchdog , the international atomic energy agency . " the european offer is a denial of the iranian nation 's legal rights bestowed under the npt , " brujerdi said .
" the islamic republic of iran will not accept a -lrb- western -rrb- monopoly on nuclear technology and will pursue its activities with determination . " thursday 's meeting was to give iran a last chance to disclose its complete nuclear program before the iaea decides on november 25 whether iran is cooperating with it on tehran 's nuclear activities .
the united states wants the iaea , which since february 2003 has been investigating us claims that iran has a covert nuclear weapons program , to refer tehran to the un security council , which could impose sanctions . only for electricity ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tehran has long insisted it is seeking only to generate electricity and on its right to uranium enrichment , which makes fuel for civilian reactors but can also manufacture the explosive material for atomic bombs .
under the european deal , iran would receive technology including a light-water reactor which would produce less fissionable material than the heavy-water reactor tehran is planning to build with russian help in bushehr . " the enrichment of uranium is a question of national dignity and no-one can force the leaders of the country to renounce it , said hamid reza hadji-babaie , an mp and member of the speaker 's office .
" the negotiations were positive but the europeans must take account of our red lines , that is iran 's refusal to renounce the nuclear fuel cycle . " the official state news agency irna quoted an anonymous diplomat in vienna saying that the next round of talks between iran and the european three would start wednesday .
a report published this week by the international institute for strategic studies , a military and defense think tank , said that assuming iran lifts the suspension on its enrichment program , " it is still probably a few years away from full scale production of enough enriched uranium for a small nuclear arsenal . " forcing the reformers on october 5 , the parliamentary committee headed by brujerdi approved a bill that would force the reformist government of president mohammad khatami to resume uranium enrichment in defiance of the iaea .
if eventually passed in the majlis -lrb- parliament -rrb- and approved by legislative watchdogs , it would almost certainly prompt the iaea to refer iran 's case to the security council . " the plan to oblige the government to resume enrichment has the support of 238 deputies " out of a total 290 , brujerdi said saturday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali akbar salehi iran 's former representative to the iaea , ali-akbar salehi , said the european proposals contained both positive and negative points , and urged the country 's leaders to examine them without hesitation .
" i believe the two sides do not want to reach a deadlock .
so the europeans must move some way towards our position , " salehi told the afp news agency . but another conservative mp dismissed the european offer .

the kosovo force -lrb- kfor -rrb- is already the north-atlantic alliance 's biggest mission with some 19,000 troops in the field .
kosovo police spokesman refki morina said police were also out in force , with all 6,000 local officers on duty " to ensure security and safety " . un officials said no incidents had been reported in the first hours of voting and turnout was just over five percent of 1.3 million registered voters .
kosovo 's chief un administrator , soren jessen-petersen , said the election marked a " turning point " and would set the stage for a un review of democracy standards early next year and possible talks on final status . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.n-the head of the united nations mission in kosovo soren jessen petersen .
he urged the province 's ethnic serb minority to participate and vowed to make their safety a top priority .
" kosovo 's serbs need legitimately elected leaders who can engage with the challenges ahead , " he wrote saturday in the international herald tribune .
" since ethnic albanians rioted against minority serbs in march , the damage has begun to be repaired and kosovo has moved forward , " jessen-petersen said . serbs stay home but in the northern , mainly serb town of zvecan a lone voter had cast his ballot 90 minutes after the polls opened .
kosovo serb leaders gathered in a nearby orthodox church to light candles a symbol of hope . " we have n't noticed that elections are being held today , " said milan ivanovic , a prominent kosovo serb .
however another serb politician , oliver ivanovic , said he would encourage his supporters to vote .
" it is obvious that there is no other solution , that only with our energy and powers we can take up responsibilities for our future , " he said . ethnic albanians demand complete independence from serbia but ethnic serbs and the government in belgrade insist that the territory is an inalienable part of the former yugoslav republic .
analysts believe a boycott will deprive the serbs of legitimate leaders to participate in any future talks on the province 's status and the future of the un protectorate . kosovo president ibrahim rugova , an ethnic albanian , said the vote was " a great and important date for the independence of kosovo .
i believe that all citizens will vote as these elections are important for the formal recognition of independence , " he said after casting his ballot . more than 33 political groups and 30 independent candidates are taking part in the election .
the latest surveys show that no party will win enough votes to control the parliament and form a government by itself .

" many people were happy this summer when they caught large crayfish in their traps .
but the fact that there were so few small ones means that stocks could be threatened come next year , " lennart edsman , a crayfish researcher at the national board of fisheries , told afp . researchers have for the past five years been worried about the spread of the fungal disease , which has been present in swedish waters to varying extents for almost a century . but their fears are now growing as people illegally implant an imported variety of crayfish , called signal crayfish which carry the plague , into lakes that are home to sweden 's domestic variety , called noble crayfish . in the past , fisheries authorities restricted fishing and imposed minimum size requirements , but all restrictions were lifted in 1994 , to the regret of some . " people are beginning to suggest that maybe we should introduce restrictions again , " edsman said . a gastronomic feast crayfish mature in late summer , making an annual return to the table which is widely celebrated with a crayfish party , or " kraeftskiva " . swedes eat more crayfish than anybody else in the world - some four million kilos per year , or about a half kilo -lrb- one pound -rrb- per inhabitant , most of which is consumed in august during the crayfish party season .
" no other country comes even close when it comes to the amount eaten , " edsman said . boiled in a decoction of dill and then served cold on a heaping platter placed in the middle of the table within everyone 's reach , crayfish are eaten with bread , a matured hard cheese and plenty of schnapps .
raucous drinking songs , funny hats with crayfish designs and paper lanterns are de rigueur . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swedish princess victoria , left , shares a light moment with us chemistry nobel laureate william s. knowles from the united states , during a banquet measuring about 10 to 12 centimeters -lrb- four to five inches -rrb- , crayfish are finger food : no matter how distinguished the dinner guests , they delight in sucking the juices from the underside of the crayfish before breaking off the claws and tail and sucking out the meat , unmindful of the juices dripping down their chin and wrists . crayfish imports sound death knell the swedish tradition of eating crayfish dates back to the 1500s , when german chefs working for the royal family are believed to have introduced the delicacy . but the dish only spread to the broader public in the late 1800s , when it became so popular that over fishing threatened the stocks and authorities limited the period when they could be fished to a few weeks in august . in 1907 , crayfish imported from finland for a party but which were not eaten because they had spoiled were thrown into stockholm 's lake maelaren , infecting sweden with the crayfish plague for the first time .
over the years it killed off a large share of the noble crayfish . in 1969 , north american signal crayfish were transplanted into swedish waters to replace the decimated stocks .
signal crayfish were chosen because their taste is similar to that of the noble crayfish and because they were believed to be resistant to the plague . but that turned out to be incorrect .
in fact , all signal crayfish are carriers of the disease , and they can die of it too , a fact unknown even to many swedes .
as a result , people continue to implant signal crayfish into lakes with noble crayfish in the hopes of increasing their catches - and in some cases unwittingly contaminate the waters . costly delicacy under threat the result is disastrous : once a lake is infected , it wipes out all the noble crayfish .
and as long as there are signal crayfish in the water the lake will remain contaminated .
" many people think the signal crayfish population is doing really well , but it 's not , " edsman stressed . already a costly delicacy , any threat to stocks could send prices soaring further : come august , fresh noble crayfish sell for about 600 to 800 kronor a kilo -lrb- $ 82-111 , € 66-88 -rrb- , compared to around 250 kronor for signal crayfish and as little 40 kronor for those imported from china , spain and turkey . afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german fish industry moves east an increasing number of german fishing companies are moving production to low wage countries .

since the united states withdrew from the treaty , russia held the key to whether the landmark 1997 draft agreement would cross the threshold to becoming a working international accord .
for environmental groups , the ratification by moscow marks a significant step on the road to reducing greenhouse gases .
" we will look back on today as the moment in history when humanity faced up to its responsibility , " greenpeace said in a statement friday .
" we 'll toast the duma with vodka tonight , but on monday morning we need to roll up our sleeves and get down to the real work , " said the environmental group 's climate policy advisor , steve sawyer .
positive turnaround bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmental experts say an increase in carbon dioxide emissions lead to global warming friday 's vote resuscitated the pact that until recently was considered all but dead after president george w. bush announced in 2001 that the united states , the world 's largest polluter , wanted no further part in it .
russia , which accounts for 17 percent of the world 's carbon dioxide emissions , had gone back and forth on endorsing the treaty ever since it was first drafted .
but finally a month ago , moscow government officials and putin recommended approval .
russia 's ratification was necessary for kyoto to go into force because the treaty stipulated that not only a majority of countries approve it , but that the signatory nations constitute 55 percent of the world 's emissions .
in their discussions ahead of the vote , russian officials hailed the financial opportunities the pact offered moscow - a turnaround from last year , when government leaders , including putin had derided the protocol as too costly .
" this protocol gives russia financial possibilities , " said valery zubov , a deputy with the main pro-kremlin united russia party in the discussion before friday 's vote .
" we have a chance to have a cleaner future . "
financial benefits russia hopes to make a short-term profit through the treaty by being able to sell off some of its quotas for greenhouse gas emissions to other industrialized signatories .
the idea is that under the treaty , countries who have not exhausted their limit for emissions will be able to sell off credit - essentially the right to pollute - to countries needing to increase their emissions quotas .
under the pressure of the market and with an eye for profit , nations will be inclined to produce fewer emissions in order to sell more .
point carbon , a norway-based consulting firm , has estimated that russia could earn $ 10 billion -lrb- € 8 billion -rrb- with the treaty 's help by 2012 .
russian deputy prime minister zhukov said russia would likely approach its kyoto quotas by 2010 if the nation 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- grew by 9 to 10 percent a year .
pressure to ratify bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow 's new arbat street is barely visible through thick smoke in the russian capital .
others have said russia was pressured by the international community into ratifying the pact .
" rusia was under unprecedented pressure , " said natalya narochinitskaya of the nationalist rodina -lrb- motherland -rrb- party .
" it 's ratification was presented as a stamp of a civilized country " and not based on scientific data , she said ahead of the vote .
it is widely believed that russia agreed to sign the protocol in return for the european union - one of the treaty 's major backers - supporting moscow 's bid to enter the world trade organization .
" it 's a very happy day for europe and for me , " said margot wallström , the swedish eu environment commissioner after the duma vote .
" it sends a very forceful signal to the rest of the world . "
" it is also very much a victory for the european union , " she said , in reference to the tug-of-war between brussels and washington over the pact .
despite being isolated in its opposition to the protocol , the united states has refused to endorse the treaty .

since the united states withdrew from the treaty , russia held the key to whether the landmark 1997 draft agreement would cross the threshold to becoming a working international accord .
for environmental groups , the ratification by moscow marks a significant step on the road to reducing greenhouse gases .
" we will look back on today as the moment in history when humanity faced up to its responsibility , " greenpeace said in a statement friday .
" we 'll toast the duma with vodka tonight , but on monday morning we need to roll up our sleeves and get down to the real work , " said the environmental group 's climate policy advisor , steve sawyer .
positive turnaround bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmental experts say an increase in carbon dioxide emissions lead to global warming friday 's vote resuscitated the pact that until recently was considered all but dead after president george w. bush announced in 2001 that the united states , the world 's largest polluter , wanted no further part in it .
russia , which accounts for 17 percent of the world 's carbon dioxide emissions , had gone back and forth on endorsing the treaty ever since it was first drafted .
but finally a month ago , moscow government officials and putin recommended approval .
russia 's ratification was necessary for kyoto to go into force because the treaty stipulated that not only a majority of countries approve it , but that the signatory nations constitute 55 percent of the world 's emissions .
in their discussions ahead of the vote , russian officials hailed the financial opportunities the pact offered moscow - a turnaround from last year , when government leaders , including putin had derided the protocol as too costly .
" this protocol gives russia financial possibilities , " said valery zubov , a deputy with the main pro-kremlin united russia party in the discussion before friday 's vote .
" we have a chance to have a cleaner future . "
financial benefits russia hopes to make a short-term profit through the treaty by being able to sell off some of its quotas for greenhouse gas emissions to other industrialized signatories .
the idea is that under the treaty , countries who have not exhausted their limit for emissions will be able to sell off credit - essentially the right to pollute - to countries needing to increase their emissions quotas .
under the pressure of the market and with an eye for profit , nations will be inclined to produce fewer emissions in order to sell more .
point carbon , a norway-based consulting firm , has estimated that russia could earn $ 10 billion -lrb- € 8 billion -rrb- with the treaty 's help by 2012 .
russian deputy prime minister zhukov said russia would likely approach its kyoto quotas by 2010 if the nation 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- grew by 9 to 10 percent a year .
pressure to ratify bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow 's new arbat street is barely visible through thick smoke in the russian capital .
others have said russia was pressured by the international community into ratifying the pact .
" rusia was under unprecedented pressure , " said natalya narochinitskaya of the nationalist rodina -lrb- motherland -rrb- party .
" it 's ratification was presented as a stamp of a civilized country " and not based on scientific data , she said ahead of the vote .
it is widely believed that russia agreed to sign the protocol in return for the european union - one of the treaty 's major backers - supporting moscow 's bid to enter the world trade organization .
" it 's a very happy day for europe and for me , " said margot wallström , the swedish eu environment commissioner after the duma vote .
" it sends a very forceful signal to the rest of the world . "
" it is also very much a victory for the european union , " she said , in reference to the tug-of-war between brussels and washington over the pact .
despite being isolated in its opposition to the protocol , the united states has refused to endorse the treaty .

" the european proposal is an excessive demand that is contrary to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- and unacceptable , " alaeddin brujerdi , the influential head of parliament 's national security and foreign policy committee , told the conservative newspaper ressalat . britain , france and germany presented iran with a deal thursday aimed at avoiding possible sanctions under which tehran would receive valuable nuclear technology if it indefinitely suspended all uranium enrichment activities , according to a document prepared by the europeans . but brujerdi also raised the possibility that the conservative-controlled parliament could pass a bill forcing iran to halt its suspension of uranium enrichment in defiance of the un nuclear watchdog , the international atomic energy agency . " the european offer is a denial of the iranian nation 's legal rights bestowed under the npt , " brujerdi said .
" the islamic republic of iran will not accept a -lrb- western -rrb- monopoly on nuclear technology and will pursue its activities with determination . " thursday 's meeting was to give iran a last chance to disclose its complete nuclear program before the iaea decides on november 25 whether iran is cooperating with it on tehran 's nuclear activities .
the united states wants the iaea , which since february 2003 has been investigating us claims that iran has a covert nuclear weapons program , to refer tehran to the un security council , which could impose sanctions . only for electricity ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tehran has long insisted it is seeking only to generate electricity and on its right to uranium enrichment , which makes fuel for civilian reactors but can also manufacture the explosive material for atomic bombs .
under the european deal , iran would receive technology including a light-water reactor which would produce less fissionable material than the heavy-water reactor tehran is planning to build with russian help in bushehr . " the enrichment of uranium is a question of national dignity and no-one can force the leaders of the country to renounce it , said hamid reza hadji-babaie , an mp and member of the speaker 's office .
" the negotiations were positive but the europeans must take account of our red lines , that is iran 's refusal to renounce the nuclear fuel cycle . " the official state news agency irna quoted an anonymous diplomat in vienna saying that the next round of talks between iran and the european three would start wednesday .
a report published this week by the international institute for strategic studies , a military and defense think tank , said that assuming iran lifts the suspension on its enrichment program , " it is still probably a few years away from full scale production of enough enriched uranium for a small nuclear arsenal . " forcing the reformers on october 5 , the parliamentary committee headed by brujerdi approved a bill that would force the reformist government of president mohammad khatami to resume uranium enrichment in defiance of the iaea .
if eventually passed in the majlis -lrb- parliament -rrb- and approved by legislative watchdogs , it would almost certainly prompt the iaea to refer iran 's case to the security council . " the plan to oblige the government to resume enrichment has the support of 238 deputies " out of a total 290 , brujerdi said saturday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali akbar salehi iran 's former representative to the iaea , ali-akbar salehi , said the european proposals contained both positive and negative points , and urged the country 's leaders to examine them without hesitation .
" i believe the two sides do not want to reach a deadlock .
so the europeans must move some way towards our position , " salehi told the afp news agency . but another conservative mp dismissed the european offer .
" a light-water reactor is useable only for medical and agricultural needs but a heavy-water reactor can also produce plutonium for use in nuclear power plants , " another mp heshmatollah falahat-pisheh said , quoted by the conservative kayhan newspaper . us secretary of state colin powell said on saturday that washington had seen no sign that iran would comply with international demands on its nuclear program and would push next month for the matter to be sent to the un security council unless tehran reversed its course . afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us skeptical of iran-eu nuke talks iran 's decision thursday to pursue talks with europe 's three major powers over its nuclear ambitions prompted a suspicious response from the united states which favors direct compliance with united nations regulations .

" many people were happy this summer when they caught large crayfish in their traps .
but the fact that there were so few small ones means that stocks could be threatened come next year , " lennart edsman , a crayfish researcher at the national board of fisheries , told afp . researchers have for the past five years been worried about the spread of the fungal disease , which has been present in swedish waters to varying extents for almost a century . but their fears are now growing as people illegally implant an imported variety of crayfish , called signal crayfish which carry the plague , into lakes that are home to sweden 's domestic variety , called noble crayfish . in the past , fisheries authorities restricted fishing and imposed minimum size requirements , but all restrictions were lifted in 1994 , to the regret of some .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 23.10.2004 eu deploys shock tactics to curb smoking großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you might need to avert your eyes next time you light up the eu has unveiled a new anti-smoking campaign that calls on governments to print hard-hitting images on cigarette packs to show the damage smoking can do to people 's health .
it 's hoped to scare smokers into quitting . the outgoing european commission this week resorted to drastic measures to curb smoking which , according to the eu executive , accounts for over 650,000 deaths a year in the 25-nation bloc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an example of the eu commission 's latest anti-smoking campaign .
the anti-smoking campaign involves putting graphic images of the health consequences of smoking on cigarette packs .
the series of 42 images includes rotten lungs , decayed teeth , a corpse , a baby with an oxygen mask and gory details of a man with a cancerous tumor on his throat . the collection also includes more subtle allusions to the dangers of smoking - a wrinkled apple accompanies a warning about skin ageing , while a bent cigarette illustrates a warning about impotence . shocking people out of complacency unveiling the campaign in brussels on friday , david byrne , eu commissioner for health and consumer protection , said the aim was to frighten people into kicking the habit .
" people need to be shocked out of their complacency about tobacco , " byrne said .
" i make no apology for some of the pictures we are using . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david byrne , the eu commisioner for consumer and health protection .
he added that part of the idea was to debunk the myth that smoking is cool .
" the true face of smoking is disease , death and horror - not the glamour and sophistication the pushers in the tobacco industry try to portray , " byrne said .
" the eu must hammer home this message to young people via its media campaign and to smokers via their cigarette packs . " the eu said that a study of smoking trends in canada , which introduced picture warnings several years ago , suggests they can help reduce smoking . " smoking kills " the initiative is just the latest in a string of measures the eu has taken in recent years to push smokers , especially teenagers , to kick the habit permanently . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a smoker since 2002 , the eu has tried to reach young smokers via its campaign " feel free to say no " , which involves snazzy video clips and newspaper advertisements featuring well-known musicians and athletes . according to byrne , an increasing number of children , teenagers and women in europe are turning into smokers .
" the number of smokers , particularly teenagers and women , is rising in most countries , " he said .
" that is a very worrying trend for the future . "
experts estimate the annual cost of tobacco-related disease in the eu at € 100 billion a year . since sept .
30 , 2003 , the eu 's tobacco products directive have also made it mandatory for eu member states to print large black and white explicit health warnings such as " smoking kills " and " smoking makes you impotent " on cigarette packs . ireland exemplary on anti-smoking most eu member states have so far introduced anti-smoking measures in some form or the other .
tobacco advertising is limited in most eu nations and is completely banned in a few others . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ross heffernan , a barman at kehoe 's lounge bar in dublin , stacks ashtrays to be put away as the no smoking ban in pubs , restaurants and the work place came into effect in ireland in march , 2004 .
in march , ireland became the first country to ban smoking in restaurants , bars and pubs .
norway and malta have since instituted similar prohibitions and sweden is on the way . the european commission on friday also called on member states to implement long-term measures , such as effective regulators , to tackle smoking levels .
it said that ireland and belgium had already shown interest in passing national laws to implement the graphic picture warnings next year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a grisly example of the eu 's anti-smoking campaign the latest pictorial health warnings are not binding on member states .
individual countries can decide on whether they want to implement them . on friday , germany , which was sharply rebuked earlier this month for its weak implementation of anti-smoking measures in a europe-wide study carried out the european network for smoking prevention , said it will examine whether to introduce the pictorial health warnings . federal drugs commissioner marion caspers-merk at the same time pointed out that government efforts to curb smoking among younger people were working . caspers-merk told news agency dpa that the smoking rate among people up to the age of 18 had fallen to 23 percent from 27 percent within three years . " simple warning " sufficient ? critics of the pictorial warning campaign say it singles out smokers and is offensive .
" smokers are well aware of the health risks of smoking . there 's no need to rub their noses in it , " simon clark , director of british smokers ' lobby group forest told reuters .
" all that is needed is a simple written warning . " he added : " what about fatty foods , dairy products or alcohol ?
if they 're going to target tobacco , there should be written and graphic health warnings on other products as well .

" many people were happy this summer when they caught large crayfish in their traps .
but the fact that there were so few small ones means that stocks could be threatened come next year , " lennart edsman , a crayfish researcher at the national board of fisheries , told afp . researchers have for the past five years been worried about the spread of the fungal disease , which has been present in swedish waters to varying extents for almost a century . but their fears are now growing as people illegally implant an imported variety of crayfish , called signal crayfish which carry the plague , into lakes that are home to sweden 's domestic variety , called noble crayfish . in the past , fisheries authorities restricted fishing and imposed minimum size requirements , but all restrictions were lifted in 1994 , to the regret of some . " people are beginning to suggest that maybe we should introduce restrictions again , " edsman said . a gastronomic feast crayfish mature in late summer , making an annual return to the table which is widely celebrated with a crayfish party , or " kraeftskiva " . swedes eat more crayfish than anybody else in the world - some four million kilos per year , or about a half kilo -lrb- one pound -rrb- per inhabitant , most of which is consumed in august during the crayfish party season .
" no other country comes even close when it comes to the amount eaten , " edsman said . boiled in a decoction of dill and then served cold on a heaping platter placed in the middle of the table within everyone 's reach , crayfish are eaten with bread , a matured hard cheese and plenty of schnapps .
raucous drinking songs , funny hats with crayfish designs and paper lanterns are de rigueur . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swedish princess victoria , left , shares a light moment with us chemistry nobel laureate william s. knowles from the united states , during a banquet measuring about 10 to 12 centimeters -lrb- four to five inches -rrb- , crayfish are finger food : no matter how distinguished the dinner guests , they delight in sucking the juices from the underside of the crayfish before breaking off the claws and tail and sucking out the meat , unmindful of the juices dripping down their chin and wrists . crayfish imports sound death knell the swedish tradition of eating crayfish dates back to the 1500s , when german chefs working for the royal family are believed to have introduced the delicacy . but the dish only spread to the broader public in the late 1800s , when it became so popular that over fishing threatened the stocks and authorities limited the period when they could be fished to a few weeks in august . in 1907 , crayfish imported from finland for a party but which were not eaten because they had spoiled were thrown into stockholm 's lake maelaren , infecting sweden with the crayfish plague for the first time .
over the years it killed off a large share of the noble crayfish . in 1969 , north american signal crayfish were transplanted into swedish waters to replace the decimated stocks .
signal crayfish were chosen because their taste is similar to that of the noble crayfish and because they were believed to be resistant to the plague . but that turned out to be incorrect .
in fact , all signal crayfish are carriers of the disease , and they can die of it too , a fact unknown even to many swedes .
as a result , people continue to implant signal crayfish into lakes with noble crayfish in the hopes of increasing their catches - and in some cases unwittingly contaminate the waters . costly delicacy under threat the result is disastrous : once a lake is infected , it wipes out all the noble crayfish .
and as long as there are signal crayfish in the water the lake will remain contaminated .
" many people think the signal crayfish population is doing really well , but it 's not , " edsman stressed . already a costly delicacy , any threat to stocks could send prices soaring further : come august , fresh noble crayfish sell for about 600 to 800 kronor a kilo -lrb- $ 82-111 , € 66-88 -rrb- , compared to around 250 kronor for signal crayfish and as little 40 kronor for those imported from china , spain and turkey . afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german fish industry moves east an increasing number of german fishing companies are moving production to low wage countries .

" many people were happy this summer when they caught large crayfish in their traps .
but the fact that there were so few small ones means that stocks could be threatened come next year , " lennart edsman , a crayfish researcher at the national board of fisheries , told afp . researchers have for the past five years been worried about the spread of the fungal disease , which has been present in swedish waters to varying extents for almost a century . but their fears are now growing as people illegally implant an imported variety of crayfish , called signal crayfish which carry the plague , into lakes that are home to sweden 's domestic variety , called noble crayfish . in the past , fisheries authorities restricted fishing and imposed minimum size requirements , but all restrictions were lifted in 1994 , to the regret of some . " people are beginning to suggest that maybe we should introduce restrictions again , " edsman said . a gastronomic feast crayfish mature in late summer , making an annual return to the table which is widely celebrated with a crayfish party , or " kraeftskiva " . swedes eat more crayfish than anybody else in the world - some four million kilos per year , or about a half kilo -lrb- one pound -rrb- per inhabitant , most of which is consumed in august during the crayfish party season .
" no other country comes even close when it comes to the amount eaten , " edsman said . boiled in a decoction of dill and then served cold on a heaping platter placed in the middle of the table within everyone 's reach , crayfish are eaten with bread , a matured hard cheese and plenty of schnapps .
raucous drinking songs , funny hats with crayfish designs and paper lanterns are de rigueur . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swedish princess victoria , left , shares a light moment with us chemistry nobel laureate william s. knowles from the united states , during a banquet measuring about 10 to 12 centimeters -lrb- four to five inches -rrb- , crayfish are finger food : no matter how distinguished the dinner guests , they delight in sucking the juices from the underside of the crayfish before breaking off the claws and tail and sucking out the meat , unmindful of the juices dripping down their chin and wrists . crayfish imports sound death knell the swedish tradition of eating crayfish dates back to the 1500s , when german chefs working for the royal family are believed to have introduced the delicacy . but the dish only spread to the broader public in the late 1800s , when it became so popular that over fishing threatened the stocks and authorities limited the period when they could be fished to a few weeks in august . in 1907 , crayfish imported from finland for a party but which were not eaten because they had spoiled were thrown into stockholm 's lake maelaren , infecting sweden with the crayfish plague for the first time .
over the years it killed off a large share of the noble crayfish . in 1969 , north american signal crayfish were transplanted into swedish waters to replace the decimated stocks .
signal crayfish were chosen because their taste is similar to that of the noble crayfish and because they were believed to be resistant to the plague . but that turned out to be incorrect .
in fact , all signal crayfish are carriers of the disease , and they can die of it too , a fact unknown even to many swedes .
as a result , people continue to implant signal crayfish into lakes with noble crayfish in the hopes of increasing their catches - and in some cases unwittingly contaminate the waters . costly delicacy under threat the result is disastrous : once a lake is infected , it wipes out all the noble crayfish .
and as long as there are signal crayfish in the water the lake will remain contaminated .
" many people think the signal crayfish population is doing really well , but it 's not , " edsman stressed . already a costly delicacy , any threat to stocks could send prices soaring further : come august , fresh noble crayfish sell for about 600 to 800 kronor a kilo -lrb- $ 82-111 , € 66-88 -rrb- , compared to around 250 kronor for signal crayfish and as little 40 kronor for those imported from china , spain and turkey . afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german fish industry moves east an increasing number of german fishing companies are moving production to low wage countries .

the kosovo force -lrb- kfor -rrb- is already the north-atlantic alliance 's biggest mission with some 19,000 troops in the field .
kosovo police spokesman refki morina said police were also out in force , with all 6,000 local officers on duty " to ensure security and safety " . un officials said no incidents had been reported in the first hours of voting and turnout was just over five percent of 1.3 million registered voters .
kosovo 's chief un administrator , soren jessen-petersen , said the election marked a " turning point " and would set the stage for a un review of democracy standards early next year and possible talks on final status . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.n-the head of the united nations mission in kosovo soren jessen petersen .
he urged the province 's ethnic serb minority to participate and vowed to make their safety a top priority .
" kosovo 's serbs need legitimately elected leaders who can engage with the challenges ahead , " he wrote saturday in the international herald tribune .
" since ethnic albanians rioted against minority serbs in march , the damage has begun to be repaired and kosovo has moved forward , " jessen-petersen said . serbs stay home but in the northern , mainly serb town of zvecan a lone voter had cast his ballot 90 minutes after the polls opened .
kosovo serb leaders gathered in a nearby orthodox church to light candles a symbol of hope . " we have n't noticed that elections are being held today , " said milan ivanovic , a prominent kosovo serb .
however another serb politician , oliver ivanovic , said he would encourage his supporters to vote .
" it is obvious that there is no other solution , that only with our energy and powers we can take up responsibilities for our future , " he said . ethnic albanians demand complete independence from serbia but ethnic serbs and the government in belgrade insist that the territory is an inalienable part of the former yugoslav republic .
analysts believe a boycott will deprive the serbs of legitimate leaders to participate in any future talks on the province 's status and the future of the un protectorate . kosovo president ibrahim rugova , an ethnic albanian , said the vote was " a great and important date for the independence of kosovo .
i believe that all citizens will vote as these elections are important for the formal recognition of independence , " he said after casting his ballot . more than 33 political groups and 30 independent candidates are taking part in the election .
the latest surveys show that no party will win enough votes to control the parliament and form a government by itself .
some 12,000 local and international observers are on hand to look for irregularities .
the first unofficial results are expected this weekend . afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german soldiers spurring sex trade ?

" many people were happy this summer when they caught large crayfish in their traps .
but the fact that there were so few small ones means that stocks could be threatened come next year , " lennart edsman , a crayfish researcher at the national board of fisheries , told afp . researchers have for the past five years been worried about the spread of the fungal disease , which has been present in swedish waters to varying extents for almost a century . but their fears are now growing as people illegally implant an imported variety of crayfish , called signal crayfish which carry the plague , into lakes that are home to sweden 's domestic variety , called noble crayfish . in the past , fisheries authorities restricted fishing and imposed minimum size requirements , but all restrictions were lifted in 1994 , to the regret of some . " people are beginning to suggest that maybe we should introduce restrictions again , " edsman said . a gastronomic feast crayfish mature in late summer , making an annual return to the table which is widely celebrated with a crayfish party , or " kraeftskiva " . swedes eat more crayfish than anybody else in the world - some four million kilos per year , or about a half kilo -lrb- one pound -rrb- per inhabitant , most of which is consumed in august during the crayfish party season .
" no other country comes even close when it comes to the amount eaten , " edsman said . boiled in a decoction of dill and then served cold on a heaping platter placed in the middle of the table within everyone 's reach , crayfish are eaten with bread , a matured hard cheese and plenty of schnapps .
raucous drinking songs , funny hats with crayfish designs and paper lanterns are de rigueur . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swedish princess victoria , left , shares a light moment with us chemistry nobel laureate william s. knowles from the united states , during a banquet measuring about 10 to 12 centimeters -lrb- four to five inches -rrb- , crayfish are finger food : no matter how distinguished the dinner guests , they delight in sucking the juices from the underside of the crayfish before breaking off the claws and tail and sucking out the meat , unmindful of the juices dripping down their chin and wrists . crayfish imports sound death knell the swedish tradition of eating crayfish dates back to the 1500s , when german chefs working for the royal family are believed to have introduced the delicacy . but the dish only spread to the broader public in the late 1800s , when it became so popular that over fishing threatened the stocks and authorities limited the period when they could be fished to a few weeks in august . in 1907 , crayfish imported from finland for a party but which were not eaten because they had spoiled were thrown into stockholm 's lake maelaren , infecting sweden with the crayfish plague for the first time .
over the years it killed off a large share of the noble crayfish . in 1969 , north american signal crayfish were transplanted into swedish waters to replace the decimated stocks .
signal crayfish were chosen because their taste is similar to that of the noble crayfish and because they were believed to be resistant to the plague . but that turned out to be incorrect .
in fact , all signal crayfish are carriers of the disease , and they can die of it too , a fact unknown even to many swedes .
as a result , people continue to implant signal crayfish into lakes with noble crayfish in the hopes of increasing their catches - and in some cases unwittingly contaminate the waters . costly delicacy under threat the result is disastrous : once a lake is infected , it wipes out all the noble crayfish .
and as long as there are signal crayfish in the water the lake will remain contaminated .
" many people think the signal crayfish population is doing really well , but it 's not , " edsman stressed . already a costly delicacy , any threat to stocks could send prices soaring further : come august , fresh noble crayfish sell for about 600 to 800 kronor a kilo -lrb- $ 82-111 , € 66-88 -rrb- , compared to around 250 kronor for signal crayfish and as little 40 kronor for those imported from china , spain and turkey . afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german fish industry moves east an increasing number of german fishing companies are moving production to low wage countries .

it 's hoped to scare smokers into quitting . the outgoing european commission this week resorted to drastic measures to curb smoking which , according to the eu executive , accounts for over 650,000 deaths a year in the 25-nation bloc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an example of the eu commission 's latest anti-smoking campaign .
the anti-smoking campaign involves putting graphic images of the health consequences of smoking on cigarette packs .
the series of 42 images includes rotten lungs , decayed teeth , a corpse , a baby with an oxygen mask and gory details of a man with a cancerous tumor on his throat . the collection also includes more subtle allusions to the dangers of smoking - a wrinkled apple accompanies a warning about skin ageing , while a bent cigarette illustrates a warning about impotence . shocking people out of complacency unveiling the campaign in brussels on friday , david byrne , eu commissioner for health and consumer protection , said the aim was to frighten people into kicking the habit .
" people need to be shocked out of their complacency about tobacco , " byrne said .
" i make no apology for some of the pictures we are using . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david byrne , the eu commisioner for consumer and health protection .
he added that part of the idea was to debunk the myth that smoking is cool .
" the true face of smoking is disease , death and horror - not the glamour and sophistication the pushers in the tobacco industry try to portray , " byrne said .
" the eu must hammer home this message to young people via its media campaign and to smokers via their cigarette packs . " the eu said that a study of smoking trends in canada , which introduced picture warnings several years ago , suggests they can help reduce smoking . " smoking kills " the initiative is just the latest in a string of measures the eu has taken in recent years to push smokers , especially teenagers , to kick the habit permanently . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a smoker since 2002 , the eu has tried to reach young smokers via its campaign " feel free to say no " , which involves snazzy video clips and newspaper advertisements featuring well-known musicians and athletes . according to byrne , an increasing number of children , teenagers and women in europe are turning into smokers .
" the number of smokers , particularly teenagers and women , is rising in most countries , " he said .
" that is a very worrying trend for the future . "
experts estimate the annual cost of tobacco-related disease in the eu at € 100 billion a year . since sept .
30 , 2003 , the eu 's tobacco products directive have also made it mandatory for eu member states to print large black and white explicit health warnings such as " smoking kills " and " smoking makes you impotent " on cigarette packs . ireland exemplary on anti-smoking most eu member states have so far introduced anti-smoking measures in some form or the other .
tobacco advertising is limited in most eu nations and is completely banned in a few others . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ross heffernan , a barman at kehoe 's lounge bar in dublin , stacks ashtrays to be put away as the no smoking ban in pubs , restaurants and the work place came into effect in ireland in march , 2004 .
in march , ireland became the first country to ban smoking in restaurants , bars and pubs .
norway and malta have since instituted similar prohibitions and sweden is on the way . the european commission on friday also called on member states to implement long-term measures , such as effective regulators , to tackle smoking levels .

individual countries can decide on whether they want to implement them . on friday , germany , which was sharply rebuked earlier this month for its weak implementation of anti-smoking measures in a europe-wide study carried out the european network for smoking prevention , said it will examine whether to introduce the pictorial health warnings . federal drugs commissioner marion caspers-merk at the same time pointed out that government efforts to curb smoking among younger people were working . caspers-merk told news agency dpa that the smoking rate among people up to the age of 18 had fallen to 23 percent from 27 percent within three years . " simple warning " sufficient ? critics of the pictorial warning campaign say it singles out smokers and is offensive .
" smokers are well aware of the health risks of smoking . there 's no need to rub their noses in it , " simon clark , director of british smokers ' lobby group forest told reuters .

since the united states withdrew from the treaty , russia held the key to whether the landmark 1997 draft agreement would cross the threshold to becoming a working international accord .
for environmental groups , the ratification by moscow marks a significant step on the road to reducing greenhouse gases .
" we will look back on today as the moment in history when humanity faced up to its responsibility , " greenpeace said in a statement friday .
" we 'll toast the duma with vodka tonight , but on monday morning we need to roll up our sleeves and get down to the real work , " said the environmental group 's climate policy advisor , steve sawyer .
positive turnaround bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmental experts say an increase in carbon dioxide emissions lead to global warming friday 's vote resuscitated the pact that until recently was considered all but dead after president george w. bush announced in 2001 that the united states , the world 's largest polluter , wanted no further part in it .
russia , which accounts for 17 percent of the world 's carbon dioxide emissions , had gone back and forth on endorsing the treaty ever since it was first drafted .
but finally a month ago , moscow government officials and putin recommended approval .
russia 's ratification was necessary for kyoto to go into force because the treaty stipulated that not only a majority of countries approve it , but that the signatory nations constitute 55 percent of the world 's emissions .
in their discussions ahead of the vote , russian officials hailed the financial opportunities the pact offered moscow - a turnaround from last year , when government leaders , including putin had derided the protocol as too costly .
" this protocol gives russia financial possibilities , " said valery zubov , a deputy with the main pro-kremlin united russia party in the discussion before friday 's vote .
" we have a chance to have a cleaner future . "
financial benefits russia hopes to make a short-term profit through the treaty by being able to sell off some of its quotas for greenhouse gas emissions to other industrialized signatories .
the idea is that under the treaty , countries who have not exhausted their limit for emissions will be able to sell off credit - essentially the right to pollute - to countries needing to increase their emissions quotas .
under the pressure of the market and with an eye for profit , nations will be inclined to produce fewer emissions in order to sell more .
point carbon , a norway-based consulting firm , has estimated that russia could earn $ 10 billion -lrb- € 8 billion -rrb- with the treaty 's help by 2012 .
russian deputy prime minister zhukov said russia would likely approach its kyoto quotas by 2010 if the nation 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- grew by 9 to 10 percent a year .
pressure to ratify bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow 's new arbat street is barely visible through thick smoke in the russian capital .
others have said russia was pressured by the international community into ratifying the pact .
" rusia was under unprecedented pressure , " said natalya narochinitskaya of the nationalist rodina -lrb- motherland -rrb- party .
" it 's ratification was presented as a stamp of a civilized country " and not based on scientific data , she said ahead of the vote .
it is widely believed that russia agreed to sign the protocol in return for the european union - one of the treaty 's major backers - supporting moscow 's bid to enter the world trade organization .
" it 's a very happy day for europe and for me , " said margot wallström , the swedish eu environment commissioner after the duma vote .
" it sends a very forceful signal to the rest of the world . "
" it is also very much a victory for the european union , " she said , in reference to the tug-of-war between brussels and washington over the pact .

it 's hoped to scare smokers into quitting . the outgoing european commission this week resorted to drastic measures to curb smoking which , according to the eu executive , accounts for over 650,000 deaths a year in the 25-nation bloc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an example of the eu commission 's latest anti-smoking campaign .
the anti-smoking campaign involves putting graphic images of the health consequences of smoking on cigarette packs .
the series of 42 images includes rotten lungs , decayed teeth , a corpse , a baby with an oxygen mask and gory details of a man with a cancerous tumor on his throat . the collection also includes more subtle allusions to the dangers of smoking - a wrinkled apple accompanies a warning about skin ageing , while a bent cigarette illustrates a warning about impotence . shocking people out of complacency unveiling the campaign in brussels on friday , david byrne , eu commissioner for health and consumer protection , said the aim was to frighten people into kicking the habit .

he added that part of the idea was to debunk the myth that smoking is cool .

" the eu must hammer home this message to young people via its media campaign and to smokers via their cigarette packs . " the eu said that a study of smoking trends in canada , which introduced picture warnings several years ago , suggests they can help reduce smoking . " smoking kills " the initiative is just the latest in a string of measures the eu has taken in recent years to push smokers , especially teenagers , to kick the habit permanently . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a smoker since 2002 , the eu has tried to reach young smokers via its campaign " feel free to say no " , which involves snazzy video clips and newspaper advertisements featuring well-known musicians and athletes . according to byrne , an increasing number of children , teenagers and women in europe are turning into smokers .
" the number of smokers , particularly teenagers and women , is rising in most countries , " he said .
" that is a very worrying trend for the future . "
experts estimate the annual cost of tobacco-related disease in the eu at € 100 billion a year . since sept .
30 , 2003 , the eu 's tobacco products directive have also made it mandatory for eu member states to print large black and white explicit health warnings such as " smoking kills " and " smoking makes you impotent " on cigarette packs . ireland exemplary on anti-smoking most eu member states have so far introduced anti-smoking measures in some form or the other .

" the european proposal is an excessive demand that is contrary to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- and unacceptable , " alaeddin brujerdi , the influential head of parliament 's national security and foreign policy committee , told the conservative newspaper ressalat . britain , france and germany presented iran with a deal thursday aimed at avoiding possible sanctions under which tehran would receive valuable nuclear technology if it indefinitely suspended all uranium enrichment activities , according to a document prepared by the europeans . but brujerdi also raised the possibility that the conservative-controlled parliament could pass a bill forcing iran to halt its suspension of uranium enrichment in defiance of the un nuclear watchdog , the international atomic energy agency . " the european offer is a denial of the iranian nation 's legal rights bestowed under the npt , " brujerdi said .
" the islamic republic of iran will not accept a -lrb- western -rrb- monopoly on nuclear technology and will pursue its activities with determination . " thursday 's meeting was to give iran a last chance to disclose its complete nuclear program before the iaea decides on november 25 whether iran is cooperating with it on tehran 's nuclear activities .
the united states wants the iaea , which since february 2003 has been investigating us claims that iran has a covert nuclear weapons program , to refer tehran to the un security council , which could impose sanctions . only for electricity ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tehran has long insisted it is seeking only to generate electricity and on its right to uranium enrichment , which makes fuel for civilian reactors but can also manufacture the explosive material for atomic bombs .
under the european deal , iran would receive technology including a light-water reactor which would produce less fissionable material than the heavy-water reactor tehran is planning to build with russian help in bushehr . " the enrichment of uranium is a question of national dignity and no-one can force the leaders of the country to renounce it , said hamid reza hadji-babaie , an mp and member of the speaker 's office .
" the negotiations were positive but the europeans must take account of our red lines , that is iran 's refusal to renounce the nuclear fuel cycle . " the official state news agency irna quoted an anonymous diplomat in vienna saying that the next round of talks between iran and the european three would start wednesday .
a report published this week by the international institute for strategic studies , a military and defense think tank , said that assuming iran lifts the suspension on its enrichment program , " it is still probably a few years away from full scale production of enough enriched uranium for a small nuclear arsenal . " forcing the reformers on october 5 , the parliamentary committee headed by brujerdi approved a bill that would force the reformist government of president mohammad khatami to resume uranium enrichment in defiance of the iaea .
if eventually passed in the majlis -lrb- parliament -rrb- and approved by legislative watchdogs , it would almost certainly prompt the iaea to refer iran 's case to the security council . " the plan to oblige the government to resume enrichment has the support of 238 deputies " out of a total 290 , brujerdi said saturday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali akbar salehi iran 's former representative to the iaea , ali-akbar salehi , said the european proposals contained both positive and negative points , and urged the country 's leaders to examine them without hesitation .
" i believe the two sides do not want to reach a deadlock .
so the europeans must move some way towards our position , " salehi told the afp news agency . but another conservative mp dismissed the european offer .
" a light-water reactor is useable only for medical and agricultural needs but a heavy-water reactor can also produce plutonium for use in nuclear power plants , " another mp heshmatollah falahat-pisheh said , quoted by the conservative kayhan newspaper . us secretary of state colin powell said on saturday that washington had seen no sign that iran would comply with international demands on its nuclear program and would push next month for the matter to be sent to the un security council unless tehran reversed its course . afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us skeptical of iran-eu nuke talks iran 's decision thursday to pursue talks with europe 's three major powers over its nuclear ambitions prompted a suspicious response from the united states which favors direct compliance with united nations regulations .

the kosovo force -lrb- kfor -rrb- is already the north-atlantic alliance 's biggest mission with some 19,000 troops in the field .
kosovo police spokesman refki morina said police were also out in force , with all 6,000 local officers on duty " to ensure security and safety " . un officials said no incidents had been reported in the first hours of voting and turnout was just over five percent of 1.3 million registered voters .

kosovo serb leaders gathered in a nearby orthodox church to light candles a symbol of hope . " we have n't noticed that elections are being held today , " said milan ivanovic , a prominent kosovo serb .

analysts believe a boycott will deprive the serbs of legitimate leaders to participate in any future talks on the province 's status and the future of the un protectorate . kosovo president ibrahim rugova , an ethnic albanian , said the vote was " a great and important date for the independence of kosovo .

russia , which accounts for 17 percent of the world 's carbon dioxide emissions , had gone back and forth on endorsing the treaty ever since it was first drafted .
but finally a month ago , moscow government officials and putin recommended approval .
russia 's ratification was necessary for kyoto to go into force because the treaty stipulated that not only a majority of countries approve it , but that the signatory nations constitute 55 percent of the world 's emissions .
in their discussions ahead of the vote , russian officials hailed the financial opportunities the pact offered moscow - a turnaround from last year , when government leaders , including putin had derided the protocol as too costly .
" this protocol gives russia financial possibilities , " said valery zubov , a deputy with the main pro-kremlin united russia party in the discussion before friday 's vote .
" we have a chance to have a cleaner future . "
financial benefits russia hopes to make a short-term profit through the treaty by being able to sell off some of its quotas for greenhouse gas emissions to other industrialized signatories .
the idea is that under the treaty , countries who have not exhausted their limit for emissions will be able to sell off credit - essentially the right to pollute - to countries needing to increase their emissions quotas .
under the pressure of the market and with an eye for profit , nations will be inclined to produce fewer emissions in order to sell more .
point carbon , a norway-based consulting firm , has estimated that russia could earn $ 10 billion -lrb- € 8 billion -rrb- with the treaty 's help by 2012 .
russian deputy prime minister zhukov said russia would likely approach its kyoto quotas by 2010 if the nation 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- grew by 9 to 10 percent a year .

since the united states withdrew from the treaty , russia held the key to whether the landmark 1997 draft agreement would cross the threshold to becoming a working international accord .
for environmental groups , the ratification by moscow marks a significant step on the road to reducing greenhouse gases .
" we will look back on today as the moment in history when humanity faced up to its responsibility , " greenpeace said in a statement friday .
" we 'll toast the duma with vodka tonight , but on monday morning we need to roll up our sleeves and get down to the real work , " said the environmental group 's climate policy advisor , steve sawyer .
positive turnaround bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmental experts say an increase in carbon dioxide emissions lead to global warming friday 's vote resuscitated the pact that until recently was considered all but dead after president george w. bush announced in 2001 that the united states , the world 's largest polluter , wanted no further part in it .
russia , which accounts for 17 percent of the world 's carbon dioxide emissions , had gone back and forth on endorsing the treaty ever since it was first drafted .
but finally a month ago , moscow government officials and putin recommended approval .
russia 's ratification was necessary for kyoto to go into force because the treaty stipulated that not only a majority of countries approve it , but that the signatory nations constitute 55 percent of the world 's emissions .
in their discussions ahead of the vote , russian officials hailed the financial opportunities the pact offered moscow - a turnaround from last year , when government leaders , including putin had derided the protocol as too costly .
" this protocol gives russia financial possibilities , " said valery zubov , a deputy with the main pro-kremlin united russia party in the discussion before friday 's vote .
" we have a chance to have a cleaner future . "
financial benefits russia hopes to make a short-term profit through the treaty by being able to sell off some of its quotas for greenhouse gas emissions to other industrialized signatories .
the idea is that under the treaty , countries who have not exhausted their limit for emissions will be able to sell off credit - essentially the right to pollute - to countries needing to increase their emissions quotas .
under the pressure of the market and with an eye for profit , nations will be inclined to produce fewer emissions in order to sell more .
point carbon , a norway-based consulting firm , has estimated that russia could earn $ 10 billion -lrb- € 8 billion -rrb- with the treaty 's help by 2012 .
russian deputy prime minister zhukov said russia would likely approach its kyoto quotas by 2010 if the nation 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- grew by 9 to 10 percent a year .
pressure to ratify bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow 's new arbat street is barely visible through thick smoke in the russian capital .
others have said russia was pressured by the international community into ratifying the pact .
" rusia was under unprecedented pressure , " said natalya narochinitskaya of the nationalist rodina -lrb- motherland -rrb- party .
" it 's ratification was presented as a stamp of a civilized country " and not based on scientific data , she said ahead of the vote .
it is widely believed that russia agreed to sign the protocol in return for the european union - one of the treaty 's major backers - supporting moscow 's bid to enter the world trade organization .
" it 's a very happy day for europe and for me , " said margot wallström , the swedish eu environment commissioner after the duma vote .
" it sends a very forceful signal to the rest of the world . "
" it is also very much a victory for the european union , " she said , in reference to the tug-of-war between brussels and washington over the pact .
despite being isolated in its opposition to the protocol , the united states has refused to endorse the treaty .

" many people were happy this summer when they caught large crayfish in their traps .
but the fact that there were so few small ones means that stocks could be threatened come next year , " lennart edsman , a crayfish researcher at the national board of fisheries , told afp . researchers have for the past five years been worried about the spread of the fungal disease , which has been present in swedish waters to varying extents for almost a century . but their fears are now growing as people illegally implant an imported variety of crayfish , called signal crayfish which carry the plague , into lakes that are home to sweden 's domestic variety , called noble crayfish . in the past , fisheries authorities restricted fishing and imposed minimum size requirements , but all restrictions were lifted in 1994 , to the regret of some .

" many people were happy this summer when they caught large crayfish in their traps .
but the fact that there were so few small ones means that stocks could be threatened come next year , " lennart edsman , a crayfish researcher at the national board of fisheries , told afp . researchers have for the past five years been worried about the spread of the fungal disease , which has been present in swedish waters to varying extents for almost a century . but their fears are now growing as people illegally implant an imported variety of crayfish , called signal crayfish which carry the plague , into lakes that are home to sweden 's domestic variety , called noble crayfish . in the past , fisheries authorities restricted fishing and imposed minimum size requirements , but all restrictions were lifted in 1994 , to the regret of some . " people are beginning to suggest that maybe we should introduce restrictions again , " edsman said . a gastronomic feast crayfish mature in late summer , making an annual return to the table which is widely celebrated with a crayfish party , or " kraeftskiva " . swedes eat more crayfish than anybody else in the world - some four million kilos per year , or about a half kilo -lrb- one pound -rrb- per inhabitant , most of which is consumed in august during the crayfish party season .
" no other country comes even close when it comes to the amount eaten , " edsman said . boiled in a decoction of dill and then served cold on a heaping platter placed in the middle of the table within everyone 's reach , crayfish are eaten with bread , a matured hard cheese and plenty of schnapps .
raucous drinking songs , funny hats with crayfish designs and paper lanterns are de rigueur . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swedish princess victoria , left , shares a light moment with us chemistry nobel laureate william s. knowles from the united states , during a banquet measuring about 10 to 12 centimeters -lrb- four to five inches -rrb- , crayfish are finger food : no matter how distinguished the dinner guests , they delight in sucking the juices from the underside of the crayfish before breaking off the claws and tail and sucking out the meat , unmindful of the juices dripping down their chin and wrists . crayfish imports sound death knell the swedish tradition of eating crayfish dates back to the 1500s , when german chefs working for the royal family are believed to have introduced the delicacy . but the dish only spread to the broader public in the late 1800s , when it became so popular that over fishing threatened the stocks and authorities limited the period when they could be fished to a few weeks in august . in 1907 , crayfish imported from finland for a party but which were not eaten because they had spoiled were thrown into stockholm 's lake maelaren , infecting sweden with the crayfish plague for the first time .
over the years it killed off a large share of the noble crayfish . in 1969 , north american signal crayfish were transplanted into swedish waters to replace the decimated stocks .
signal crayfish were chosen because their taste is similar to that of the noble crayfish and because they were believed to be resistant to the plague . but that turned out to be incorrect .
in fact , all signal crayfish are carriers of the disease , and they can die of it too , a fact unknown even to many swedes .
as a result , people continue to implant signal crayfish into lakes with noble crayfish in the hopes of increasing their catches - and in some cases unwittingly contaminate the waters . costly delicacy under threat the result is disastrous : once a lake is infected , it wipes out all the noble crayfish .
and as long as there are signal crayfish in the water the lake will remain contaminated .
" many people think the signal crayfish population is doing really well , but it 's not , " edsman stressed . already a costly delicacy , any threat to stocks could send prices soaring further : come august , fresh noble crayfish sell for about 600 to 800 kronor a kilo -lrb- $ 82-111 , € 66-88 -rrb- , compared to around 250 kronor for signal crayfish and as little 40 kronor for those imported from china , spain and turkey . afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german fish industry moves east an increasing number of german fishing companies are moving production to low wage countries .

since the united states withdrew from the treaty , russia held the key to whether the landmark 1997 draft agreement would cross the threshold to becoming a working international accord .
for environmental groups , the ratification by moscow marks a significant step on the road to reducing greenhouse gases .
" we will look back on today as the moment in history when humanity faced up to its responsibility , " greenpeace said in a statement friday .
" we 'll toast the duma with vodka tonight , but on monday morning we need to roll up our sleeves and get down to the real work , " said the environmental group 's climate policy advisor , steve sawyer .
positive turnaround bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmental experts say an increase in carbon dioxide emissions lead to global warming friday 's vote resuscitated the pact that until recently was considered all but dead after president george w. bush announced in 2001 that the united states , the world 's largest polluter , wanted no further part in it .
russia , which accounts for 17 percent of the world 's carbon dioxide emissions , had gone back and forth on endorsing the treaty ever since it was first drafted .
but finally a month ago , moscow government officials and putin recommended approval .
russia 's ratification was necessary for kyoto to go into force because the treaty stipulated that not only a majority of countries approve it , but that the signatory nations constitute 55 percent of the world 's emissions .
in their discussions ahead of the vote , russian officials hailed the financial opportunities the pact offered moscow - a turnaround from last year , when government leaders , including putin had derided the protocol as too costly .
" this protocol gives russia financial possibilities , " said valery zubov , a deputy with the main pro-kremlin united russia party in the discussion before friday 's vote .
" we have a chance to have a cleaner future . "
financial benefits russia hopes to make a short-term profit through the treaty by being able to sell off some of its quotas for greenhouse gas emissions to other industrialized signatories .
the idea is that under the treaty , countries who have not exhausted their limit for emissions will be able to sell off credit - essentially the right to pollute - to countries needing to increase their emissions quotas .
under the pressure of the market and with an eye for profit , nations will be inclined to produce fewer emissions in order to sell more .
point carbon , a norway-based consulting firm , has estimated that russia could earn $ 10 billion -lrb- € 8 billion -rrb- with the treaty 's help by 2012 .
russian deputy prime minister zhukov said russia would likely approach its kyoto quotas by 2010 if the nation 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- grew by 9 to 10 percent a year .
pressure to ratify bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow 's new arbat street is barely visible through thick smoke in the russian capital .
others have said russia was pressured by the international community into ratifying the pact .
" rusia was under unprecedented pressure , " said natalya narochinitskaya of the nationalist rodina -lrb- motherland -rrb- party .
" it 's ratification was presented as a stamp of a civilized country " and not based on scientific data , she said ahead of the vote .
it is widely believed that russia agreed to sign the protocol in return for the european union - one of the treaty 's major backers - supporting moscow 's bid to enter the world trade organization .
" it 's a very happy day for europe and for me , " said margot wallström , the swedish eu environment commissioner after the duma vote .
" it sends a very forceful signal to the rest of the world . "
" it is also very much a victory for the european union , " she said , in reference to the tug-of-war between brussels and washington over the pact .
despite being isolated in its opposition to the protocol , the united states has refused to endorse the treaty .

it 's hoped to scare smokers into quitting . the outgoing european commission this week resorted to drastic measures to curb smoking which , according to the eu executive , accounts for over 650,000 deaths a year in the 25-nation bloc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an example of the eu commission 's latest anti-smoking campaign .
the anti-smoking campaign involves putting graphic images of the health consequences of smoking on cigarette packs .
the series of 42 images includes rotten lungs , decayed teeth , a corpse , a baby with an oxygen mask and gory details of a man with a cancerous tumor on his throat . the collection also includes more subtle allusions to the dangers of smoking - a wrinkled apple accompanies a warning about skin ageing , while a bent cigarette illustrates a warning about impotence . shocking people out of complacency unveiling the campaign in brussels on friday , david byrne , eu commissioner for health and consumer protection , said the aim was to frighten people into kicking the habit .
" people need to be shocked out of their complacency about tobacco , " byrne said .
" i make no apology for some of the pictures we are using . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david byrne , the eu commisioner for consumer and health protection .
he added that part of the idea was to debunk the myth that smoking is cool .
" the true face of smoking is disease , death and horror - not the glamour and sophistication the pushers in the tobacco industry try to portray , " byrne said .
" the eu must hammer home this message to young people via its media campaign and to smokers via their cigarette packs . " the eu said that a study of smoking trends in canada , which introduced picture warnings several years ago , suggests they can help reduce smoking . " smoking kills " the initiative is just the latest in a string of measures the eu has taken in recent years to push smokers , especially teenagers , to kick the habit permanently . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a smoker since 2002 , the eu has tried to reach young smokers via its campaign " feel free to say no " , which involves snazzy video clips and newspaper advertisements featuring well-known musicians and athletes . according to byrne , an increasing number of children , teenagers and women in europe are turning into smokers .
" the number of smokers , particularly teenagers and women , is rising in most countries , " he said .
" that is a very worrying trend for the future . "
experts estimate the annual cost of tobacco-related disease in the eu at € 100 billion a year . since sept .
30 , 2003 , the eu 's tobacco products directive have also made it mandatory for eu member states to print large black and white explicit health warnings such as " smoking kills " and " smoking makes you impotent " on cigarette packs . ireland exemplary on anti-smoking most eu member states have so far introduced anti-smoking measures in some form or the other .
tobacco advertising is limited in most eu nations and is completely banned in a few others . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ross heffernan , a barman at kehoe 's lounge bar in dublin , stacks ashtrays to be put away as the no smoking ban in pubs , restaurants and the work place came into effect in ireland in march , 2004 .
in march , ireland became the first country to ban smoking in restaurants , bars and pubs .
norway and malta have since instituted similar prohibitions and sweden is on the way . the european commission on friday also called on member states to implement long-term measures , such as effective regulators , to tackle smoking levels .
it said that ireland and belgium had already shown interest in passing national laws to implement the graphic picture warnings next year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a grisly example of the eu 's anti-smoking campaign the latest pictorial health warnings are not binding on member states .
individual countries can decide on whether they want to implement them . on friday , germany , which was sharply rebuked earlier this month for its weak implementation of anti-smoking measures in a europe-wide study carried out the european network for smoking prevention , said it will examine whether to introduce the pictorial health warnings . federal drugs commissioner marion caspers-merk at the same time pointed out that government efforts to curb smoking among younger people were working . caspers-merk told news agency dpa that the smoking rate among people up to the age of 18 had fallen to 23 percent from 27 percent within three years . " simple warning " sufficient ? critics of the pictorial warning campaign say it singles out smokers and is offensive .
" smokers are well aware of the health risks of smoking . there 's no need to rub their noses in it , " simon clark , director of british smokers ' lobby group forest told reuters .
" all that is needed is a simple written warning . " he added : " what about fatty foods , dairy products or alcohol ?

" the european proposal is an excessive demand that is contrary to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- and unacceptable , " alaeddin brujerdi , the influential head of parliament 's national security and foreign policy committee , told the conservative newspaper ressalat . britain , france and germany presented iran with a deal thursday aimed at avoiding possible sanctions under which tehran would receive valuable nuclear technology if it indefinitely suspended all uranium enrichment activities , according to a document prepared by the europeans . but brujerdi also raised the possibility that the conservative-controlled parliament could pass a bill forcing iran to halt its suspension of uranium enrichment in defiance of the un nuclear watchdog , the international atomic energy agency . " the european offer is a denial of the iranian nation 's legal rights bestowed under the npt , " brujerdi said .
" the islamic republic of iran will not accept a -lrb- western -rrb- monopoly on nuclear technology and will pursue its activities with determination . " thursday 's meeting was to give iran a last chance to disclose its complete nuclear program before the iaea decides on november 25 whether iran is cooperating with it on tehran 's nuclear activities .
the united states wants the iaea , which since february 2003 has been investigating us claims that iran has a covert nuclear weapons program , to refer tehran to the un security council , which could impose sanctions . only for electricity ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tehran has long insisted it is seeking only to generate electricity and on its right to uranium enrichment , which makes fuel for civilian reactors but can also manufacture the explosive material for atomic bombs .
under the european deal , iran would receive technology including a light-water reactor which would produce less fissionable material than the heavy-water reactor tehran is planning to build with russian help in bushehr . " the enrichment of uranium is a question of national dignity and no-one can force the leaders of the country to renounce it , said hamid reza hadji-babaie , an mp and member of the speaker 's office .
" the negotiations were positive but the europeans must take account of our red lines , that is iran 's refusal to renounce the nuclear fuel cycle . " the official state news agency irna quoted an anonymous diplomat in vienna saying that the next round of talks between iran and the european three would start wednesday .
a report published this week by the international institute for strategic studies , a military and defense think tank , said that assuming iran lifts the suspension on its enrichment program , " it is still probably a few years away from full scale production of enough enriched uranium for a small nuclear arsenal . " forcing the reformers on october 5 , the parliamentary committee headed by brujerdi approved a bill that would force the reformist government of president mohammad khatami to resume uranium enrichment in defiance of the iaea .
if eventually passed in the majlis -lrb- parliament -rrb- and approved by legislative watchdogs , it would almost certainly prompt the iaea to refer iran 's case to the security council . " the plan to oblige the government to resume enrichment has the support of 238 deputies " out of a total 290 , brujerdi said saturday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali akbar salehi iran 's former representative to the iaea , ali-akbar salehi , said the european proposals contained both positive and negative points , and urged the country 's leaders to examine them without hesitation .
" i believe the two sides do not want to reach a deadlock .
so the europeans must move some way towards our position , " salehi told the afp news agency . but another conservative mp dismissed the european offer .
" a light-water reactor is useable only for medical and agricultural needs but a heavy-water reactor can also produce plutonium for use in nuclear power plants , " another mp heshmatollah falahat-pisheh said , quoted by the conservative kayhan newspaper . us secretary of state colin powell said on saturday that washington had seen no sign that iran would comply with international demands on its nuclear program and would push next month for the matter to be sent to the un security council unless tehran reversed its course . afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us skeptical of iran-eu nuke talks iran 's decision thursday to pursue talks with europe 's three major powers over its nuclear ambitions prompted a suspicious response from the united states which favors direct compliance with united nations regulations .

" the european proposal is an excessive demand that is contrary to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- and unacceptable , " alaeddin brujerdi , the influential head of parliament 's national security and foreign policy committee , told the conservative newspaper ressalat . britain , france and germany presented iran with a deal thursday aimed at avoiding possible sanctions under which tehran would receive valuable nuclear technology if it indefinitely suspended all uranium enrichment activities , according to a document prepared by the europeans . but brujerdi also raised the possibility that the conservative-controlled parliament could pass a bill forcing iran to halt its suspension of uranium enrichment in defiance of the un nuclear watchdog , the international atomic energy agency . " the european offer is a denial of the iranian nation 's legal rights bestowed under the npt , " brujerdi said .
" the islamic republic of iran will not accept a -lrb- western -rrb- monopoly on nuclear technology and will pursue its activities with determination . " thursday 's meeting was to give iran a last chance to disclose its complete nuclear program before the iaea decides on november 25 whether iran is cooperating with it on tehran 's nuclear activities .
the united states wants the iaea , which since february 2003 has been investigating us claims that iran has a covert nuclear weapons program , to refer tehran to the un security council , which could impose sanctions . only for electricity ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tehran has long insisted it is seeking only to generate electricity and on its right to uranium enrichment , which makes fuel for civilian reactors but can also manufacture the explosive material for atomic bombs .
under the european deal , iran would receive technology including a light-water reactor which would produce less fissionable material than the heavy-water reactor tehran is planning to build with russian help in bushehr . " the enrichment of uranium is a question of national dignity and no-one can force the leaders of the country to renounce it , said hamid reza hadji-babaie , an mp and member of the speaker 's office .
" the negotiations were positive but the europeans must take account of our red lines , that is iran 's refusal to renounce the nuclear fuel cycle . " the official state news agency irna quoted an anonymous diplomat in vienna saying that the next round of talks between iran and the european three would start wednesday .
a report published this week by the international institute for strategic studies , a military and defense think tank , said that assuming iran lifts the suspension on its enrichment program , " it is still probably a few years away from full scale production of enough enriched uranium for a small nuclear arsenal . " forcing the reformers on october 5 , the parliamentary committee headed by brujerdi approved a bill that would force the reformist government of president mohammad khatami to resume uranium enrichment in defiance of the iaea .
if eventually passed in the majlis -lrb- parliament -rrb- and approved by legislative watchdogs , it would almost certainly prompt the iaea to refer iran 's case to the security council . " the plan to oblige the government to resume enrichment has the support of 238 deputies " out of a total 290 , brujerdi said saturday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali akbar salehi iran 's former representative to the iaea , ali-akbar salehi , said the european proposals contained both positive and negative points , and urged the country 's leaders to examine them without hesitation .
" i believe the two sides do not want to reach a deadlock .
so the europeans must move some way towards our position , " salehi told the afp news agency . but another conservative mp dismissed the european offer .
" a light-water reactor is useable only for medical and agricultural needs but a heavy-water reactor can also produce plutonium for use in nuclear power plants , " another mp heshmatollah falahat-pisheh said , quoted by the conservative kayhan newspaper . us secretary of state colin powell said on saturday that washington had seen no sign that iran would comply with international demands on its nuclear program and would push next month for the matter to be sent to the un security council unless tehran reversed its course . afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us skeptical of iran-eu nuke talks iran 's decision thursday to pursue talks with europe 's three major powers over its nuclear ambitions prompted a suspicious response from the united states which favors direct compliance with united nations regulations .

since the united states withdrew from the treaty , russia held the key to whether the landmark 1997 draft agreement would cross the threshold to becoming a working international accord .
for environmental groups , the ratification by moscow marks a significant step on the road to reducing greenhouse gases .
" we will look back on today as the moment in history when humanity faced up to its responsibility , " greenpeace said in a statement friday .
" we 'll toast the duma with vodka tonight , but on monday morning we need to roll up our sleeves and get down to the real work , " said the environmental group 's climate policy advisor , steve sawyer .
positive turnaround bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmental experts say an increase in carbon dioxide emissions lead to global warming friday 's vote resuscitated the pact that until recently was considered all but dead after president george w. bush announced in 2001 that the united states , the world 's largest polluter , wanted no further part in it .
russia , which accounts for 17 percent of the world 's carbon dioxide emissions , had gone back and forth on endorsing the treaty ever since it was first drafted .
but finally a month ago , moscow government officials and putin recommended approval .
russia 's ratification was necessary for kyoto to go into force because the treaty stipulated that not only a majority of countries approve it , but that the signatory nations constitute 55 percent of the world 's emissions .
in their discussions ahead of the vote , russian officials hailed the financial opportunities the pact offered moscow - a turnaround from last year , when government leaders , including putin had derided the protocol as too costly .
" this protocol gives russia financial possibilities , " said valery zubov , a deputy with the main pro-kremlin united russia party in the discussion before friday 's vote .
" we have a chance to have a cleaner future . "
financial benefits russia hopes to make a short-term profit through the treaty by being able to sell off some of its quotas for greenhouse gas emissions to other industrialized signatories .
the idea is that under the treaty , countries who have not exhausted their limit for emissions will be able to sell off credit - essentially the right to pollute - to countries needing to increase their emissions quotas .
under the pressure of the market and with an eye for profit , nations will be inclined to produce fewer emissions in order to sell more .
point carbon , a norway-based consulting firm , has estimated that russia could earn $ 10 billion -lrb- € 8 billion -rrb- with the treaty 's help by 2012 .
russian deputy prime minister zhukov said russia would likely approach its kyoto quotas by 2010 if the nation 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- grew by 9 to 10 percent a year .

" it 's ratification was presented as a stamp of a civilized country " and not based on scientific data , she said ahead of the vote .
it is widely believed that russia agreed to sign the protocol in return for the european union - one of the treaty 's major backers - supporting moscow 's bid to enter the world trade organization .
" it 's a very happy day for europe and for me , " said margot wallström , the swedish eu environment commissioner after the duma vote .
" it sends a very forceful signal to the rest of the world . "
" it is also very much a victory for the european union , " she said , in reference to the tug-of-war between brussels and washington over the pact .

russia , which accounts for 17 percent of the world 's carbon dioxide emissions , had gone back and forth on endorsing the treaty ever since it was first drafted .
but finally a month ago , moscow government officials and putin recommended approval .
russia 's ratification was necessary for kyoto to go into force because the treaty stipulated that not only a majority of countries approve it , but that the signatory nations constitute 55 percent of the world 's emissions .
in their discussions ahead of the vote , russian officials hailed the financial opportunities the pact offered moscow - a turnaround from last year , when government leaders , including putin had derided the protocol as too costly .
" this protocol gives russia financial possibilities , " said valery zubov , a deputy with the main pro-kremlin united russia party in the discussion before friday 's vote .
" we have a chance to have a cleaner future . "
financial benefits russia hopes to make a short-term profit through the treaty by being able to sell off some of its quotas for greenhouse gas emissions to other industrialized signatories .
the idea is that under the treaty , countries who have not exhausted their limit for emissions will be able to sell off credit - essentially the right to pollute - to countries needing to increase their emissions quotas .
under the pressure of the market and with an eye for profit , nations will be inclined to produce fewer emissions in order to sell more .
point carbon , a norway-based consulting firm , has estimated that russia could earn $ 10 billion -lrb- € 8 billion -rrb- with the treaty 's help by 2012 .
russian deputy prime minister zhukov said russia would likely approach its kyoto quotas by 2010 if the nation 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- grew by 9 to 10 percent a year .

others have said russia was pressured by the international community into ratifying the pact .

" it 's ratification was presented as a stamp of a civilized country " and not based on scientific data , she said ahead of the vote .
it is widely believed that russia agreed to sign the protocol in return for the european union - one of the treaty 's major backers - supporting moscow 's bid to enter the world trade organization .
" it 's a very happy day for europe and for me , " said margot wallström , the swedish eu environment commissioner after the duma vote .
" it sends a very forceful signal to the rest of the world . "
" it is also very much a victory for the european union , " she said , in reference to the tug-of-war between brussels and washington over the pact .

positive turnaround bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmental experts say an increase in carbon dioxide emissions lead to global warming friday 's vote resuscitated the pact that until recently was considered all but dead after president george w. bush announced in 2001 that the united states , the world 's largest polluter , wanted no further part in it .
russia , which accounts for 17 percent of the world 's carbon dioxide emissions , had gone back and forth on endorsing the treaty ever since it was first drafted .
but finally a month ago , moscow government officials and putin recommended approval .
russia 's ratification was necessary for kyoto to go into force because the treaty stipulated that not only a majority of countries approve it , but that the signatory nations constitute 55 percent of the world 's emissions .
in their discussions ahead of the vote , russian officials hailed the financial opportunities the pact offered moscow - a turnaround from last year , when government leaders , including putin had derided the protocol as too costly .
" this protocol gives russia financial possibilities , " said valery zubov , a deputy with the main pro-kremlin united russia party in the discussion before friday 's vote .
" we have a chance to have a cleaner future . "
financial benefits russia hopes to make a short-term profit through the treaty by being able to sell off some of its quotas for greenhouse gas emissions to other industrialized signatories .
the idea is that under the treaty , countries who have not exhausted their limit for emissions will be able to sell off credit - essentially the right to pollute - to countries needing to increase their emissions quotas .
under the pressure of the market and with an eye for profit , nations will be inclined to produce fewer emissions in order to sell more .

it 's hoped to scare smokers into quitting . the outgoing european commission this week resorted to drastic measures to curb smoking which , according to the eu executive , accounts for over 650,000 deaths a year in the 25-nation bloc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an example of the eu commission 's latest anti-smoking campaign .
the anti-smoking campaign involves putting graphic images of the health consequences of smoking on cigarette packs .
the series of 42 images includes rotten lungs , decayed teeth , a corpse , a baby with an oxygen mask and gory details of a man with a cancerous tumor on his throat . the collection also includes more subtle allusions to the dangers of smoking - a wrinkled apple accompanies a warning about skin ageing , while a bent cigarette illustrates a warning about impotence . shocking people out of complacency unveiling the campaign in brussels on friday , david byrne , eu commissioner for health and consumer protection , said the aim was to frighten people into kicking the habit .
" people need to be shocked out of their complacency about tobacco , " byrne said .

he added that part of the idea was to debunk the myth that smoking is cool .
" the true face of smoking is disease , death and horror - not the glamour and sophistication the pushers in the tobacco industry try to portray , " byrne said .
" the eu must hammer home this message to young people via its media campaign and to smokers via their cigarette packs . " the eu said that a study of smoking trends in canada , which introduced picture warnings several years ago , suggests they can help reduce smoking . " smoking kills " the initiative is just the latest in a string of measures the eu has taken in recent years to push smokers , especially teenagers , to kick the habit permanently . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a smoker since 2002 , the eu has tried to reach young smokers via its campaign " feel free to say no " , which involves snazzy video clips and newspaper advertisements featuring well-known musicians and athletes . according to byrne , an increasing number of children , teenagers and women in europe are turning into smokers .
" the number of smokers , particularly teenagers and women , is rising in most countries , " he said .
" that is a very worrying trend for the future . "
experts estimate the annual cost of tobacco-related disease in the eu at € 100 billion a year . since sept .
30 , 2003 , the eu 's tobacco products directive have also made it mandatory for eu member states to print large black and white explicit health warnings such as " smoking kills " and " smoking makes you impotent " on cigarette packs . ireland exemplary on anti-smoking most eu member states have so far introduced anti-smoking measures in some form or the other .

in march , ireland became the first country to ban smoking in restaurants , bars and pubs .
norway and malta have since instituted similar prohibitions and sweden is on the way . the european commission on friday also called on member states to implement long-term measures , such as effective regulators , to tackle smoking levels .

individual countries can decide on whether they want to implement them . on friday , germany , which was sharply rebuked earlier this month for its weak implementation of anti-smoking measures in a europe-wide study carried out the european network for smoking prevention , said it will examine whether to introduce the pictorial health warnings . federal drugs commissioner marion caspers-merk at the same time pointed out that government efforts to curb smoking among younger people were working . caspers-merk told news agency dpa that the smoking rate among people up to the age of 18 had fallen to 23 percent from 27 percent within three years . " simple warning " sufficient ? critics of the pictorial warning campaign say it singles out smokers and is offensive .
" smokers are well aware of the health risks of smoking . there 's no need to rub their noses in it , " simon clark , director of british smokers ' lobby group forest told reuters .
" all that is needed is a simple written warning . " he added : " what about fatty foods , dairy products or alcohol ?

" many people were happy this summer when they caught large crayfish in their traps .
but the fact that there were so few small ones means that stocks could be threatened come next year , " lennart edsman , a crayfish researcher at the national board of fisheries , told afp . researchers have for the past five years been worried about the spread of the fungal disease , which has been present in swedish waters to varying extents for almost a century . but their fears are now growing as people illegally implant an imported variety of crayfish , called signal crayfish which carry the plague , into lakes that are home to sweden 's domestic variety , called noble crayfish . in the past , fisheries authorities restricted fishing and imposed minimum size requirements , but all restrictions were lifted in 1994 , to the regret of some .

" people are beginning to suggest that maybe we should introduce restrictions again , " edsman said . a gastronomic feast crayfish mature in late summer , making an annual return to the table which is widely celebrated with a crayfish party , or " kraeftskiva " . swedes eat more crayfish than anybody else in the world - some four million kilos per year , or about a half kilo -lrb- one pound -rrb- per inhabitant , most of which is consumed in august during the crayfish party season .
" no other country comes even close when it comes to the amount eaten , " edsman said . boiled in a decoction of dill and then served cold on a heaping platter placed in the middle of the table within everyone 's reach , crayfish are eaten with bread , a matured hard cheese and plenty of schnapps .
raucous drinking songs , funny hats with crayfish designs and paper lanterns are de rigueur . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swedish princess victoria , left , shares a light moment with us chemistry nobel laureate william s. knowles from the united states , during a banquet measuring about 10 to 12 centimeters -lrb- four to five inches -rrb- , crayfish are finger food : no matter how distinguished the dinner guests , they delight in sucking the juices from the underside of the crayfish before breaking off the claws and tail and sucking out the meat , unmindful of the juices dripping down their chin and wrists . crayfish imports sound death knell the swedish tradition of eating crayfish dates back to the 1500s , when german chefs working for the royal family are believed to have introduced the delicacy . but the dish only spread to the broader public in the late 1800s , when it became so popular that over fishing threatened the stocks and authorities limited the period when they could be fished to a few weeks in august . in 1907 , crayfish imported from finland for a party but which were not eaten because they had spoiled were thrown into stockholm 's lake maelaren , infecting sweden with the crayfish plague for the first time .
over the years it killed off a large share of the noble crayfish . in 1969 , north american signal crayfish were transplanted into swedish waters to replace the decimated stocks .
signal crayfish were chosen because their taste is similar to that of the noble crayfish and because they were believed to be resistant to the plague . but that turned out to be incorrect .
in fact , all signal crayfish are carriers of the disease , and they can die of it too , a fact unknown even to many swedes .
as a result , people continue to implant signal crayfish into lakes with noble crayfish in the hopes of increasing their catches - and in some cases unwittingly contaminate the waters . costly delicacy under threat the result is disastrous : once a lake is infected , it wipes out all the noble crayfish .
and as long as there are signal crayfish in the water the lake will remain contaminated .
" many people think the signal crayfish population is doing really well , but it 's not , " edsman stressed . already a costly delicacy , any threat to stocks could send prices soaring further : come august , fresh noble crayfish sell for about 600 to 800 kronor a kilo -lrb- $ 82-111 , € 66-88 -rrb- , compared to around 250 kronor for signal crayfish and as little 40 kronor for those imported from china , spain and turkey . afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german fish industry moves east an increasing number of german fishing companies are moving production to low wage countries .

the kosovo force -lrb- kfor -rrb- is already the north-atlantic alliance 's biggest mission with some 19,000 troops in the field .
kosovo police spokesman refki morina said police were also out in force , with all 6,000 local officers on duty " to ensure security and safety " . un officials said no incidents had been reported in the first hours of voting and turnout was just over five percent of 1.3 million registered voters .
kosovo 's chief un administrator , soren jessen-petersen , said the election marked a " turning point " and would set the stage for a un review of democracy standards early next year and possible talks on final status . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.n-the head of the united nations mission in kosovo soren jessen petersen .
he urged the province 's ethnic serb minority to participate and vowed to make their safety a top priority .
" kosovo 's serbs need legitimately elected leaders who can engage with the challenges ahead , " he wrote saturday in the international herald tribune .
" since ethnic albanians rioted against minority serbs in march , the damage has begun to be repaired and kosovo has moved forward , " jessen-petersen said . serbs stay home but in the northern , mainly serb town of zvecan a lone voter had cast his ballot 90 minutes after the polls opened .
kosovo serb leaders gathered in a nearby orthodox church to light candles a symbol of hope . " we have n't noticed that elections are being held today , " said milan ivanovic , a prominent kosovo serb .
however another serb politician , oliver ivanovic , said he would encourage his supporters to vote .
" it is obvious that there is no other solution , that only with our energy and powers we can take up responsibilities for our future , " he said . ethnic albanians demand complete independence from serbia but ethnic serbs and the government in belgrade insist that the territory is an inalienable part of the former yugoslav republic .
analysts believe a boycott will deprive the serbs of legitimate leaders to participate in any future talks on the province 's status and the future of the un protectorate . kosovo president ibrahim rugova , an ethnic albanian , said the vote was " a great and important date for the independence of kosovo .
i believe that all citizens will vote as these elections are important for the formal recognition of independence , " he said after casting his ballot . more than 33 political groups and 30 independent candidates are taking part in the election .
the latest surveys show that no party will win enough votes to control the parliament and form a government by itself .
some 12,000 local and international observers are on hand to look for irregularities .
the first unofficial results are expected this weekend . afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german soldiers spurring sex trade ?

" the european proposal is an excessive demand that is contrary to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- and unacceptable , " alaeddin brujerdi , the influential head of parliament 's national security and foreign policy committee , told the conservative newspaper ressalat . britain , france and germany presented iran with a deal thursday aimed at avoiding possible sanctions under which tehran would receive valuable nuclear technology if it indefinitely suspended all uranium enrichment activities , according to a document prepared by the europeans . but brujerdi also raised the possibility that the conservative-controlled parliament could pass a bill forcing iran to halt its suspension of uranium enrichment in defiance of the un nuclear watchdog , the international atomic energy agency . " the european offer is a denial of the iranian nation 's legal rights bestowed under the npt , " brujerdi said .
" the islamic republic of iran will not accept a -lrb- western -rrb- monopoly on nuclear technology and will pursue its activities with determination . " thursday 's meeting was to give iran a last chance to disclose its complete nuclear program before the iaea decides on november 25 whether iran is cooperating with it on tehran 's nuclear activities .
the united states wants the iaea , which since february 2003 has been investigating us claims that iran has a covert nuclear weapons program , to refer tehran to the un security council , which could impose sanctions . only for electricity ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tehran has long insisted it is seeking only to generate electricity and on its right to uranium enrichment , which makes fuel for civilian reactors but can also manufacture the explosive material for atomic bombs .
under the european deal , iran would receive technology including a light-water reactor which would produce less fissionable material than the heavy-water reactor tehran is planning to build with russian help in bushehr . " the enrichment of uranium is a question of national dignity and no-one can force the leaders of the country to renounce it , said hamid reza hadji-babaie , an mp and member of the speaker 's office .
" the negotiations were positive but the europeans must take account of our red lines , that is iran 's refusal to renounce the nuclear fuel cycle . " the official state news agency irna quoted an anonymous diplomat in vienna saying that the next round of talks between iran and the european three would start wednesday .
a report published this week by the international institute for strategic studies , a military and defense think tank , said that assuming iran lifts the suspension on its enrichment program , " it is still probably a few years away from full scale production of enough enriched uranium for a small nuclear arsenal . " forcing the reformers on october 5 , the parliamentary committee headed by brujerdi approved a bill that would force the reformist government of president mohammad khatami to resume uranium enrichment in defiance of the iaea .
if eventually passed in the majlis -lrb- parliament -rrb- and approved by legislative watchdogs , it would almost certainly prompt the iaea to refer iran 's case to the security council . " the plan to oblige the government to resume enrichment has the support of 238 deputies " out of a total 290 , brujerdi said saturday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali akbar salehi iran 's former representative to the iaea , ali-akbar salehi , said the european proposals contained both positive and negative points , and urged the country 's leaders to examine them without hesitation .
" i believe the two sides do not want to reach a deadlock .
so the europeans must move some way towards our position , " salehi told the afp news agency . but another conservative mp dismissed the european offer .
" a light-water reactor is useable only for medical and agricultural needs but a heavy-water reactor can also produce plutonium for use in nuclear power plants , " another mp heshmatollah falahat-pisheh said , quoted by the conservative kayhan newspaper . us secretary of state colin powell said on saturday that washington had seen no sign that iran would comply with international demands on its nuclear program and would push next month for the matter to be sent to the un security council unless tehran reversed its course . afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us skeptical of iran-eu nuke talks iran 's decision thursday to pursue talks with europe 's three major powers over its nuclear ambitions prompted a suspicious response from the united states which favors direct compliance with united nations regulations .

" the european proposal is an excessive demand that is contrary to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- and unacceptable , " alaeddin brujerdi , the influential head of parliament 's national security and foreign policy committee , told the conservative newspaper ressalat . britain , france and germany presented iran with a deal thursday aimed at avoiding possible sanctions under which tehran would receive valuable nuclear technology if it indefinitely suspended all uranium enrichment activities , according to a document prepared by the europeans . but brujerdi also raised the possibility that the conservative-controlled parliament could pass a bill forcing iran to halt its suspension of uranium enrichment in defiance of the un nuclear watchdog , the international atomic energy agency . " the european offer is a denial of the iranian nation 's legal rights bestowed under the npt , " brujerdi said .
" the islamic republic of iran will not accept a -lrb- western -rrb- monopoly on nuclear technology and will pursue its activities with determination . " thursday 's meeting was to give iran a last chance to disclose its complete nuclear program before the iaea decides on november 25 whether iran is cooperating with it on tehran 's nuclear activities .
the united states wants the iaea , which since february 2003 has been investigating us claims that iran has a covert nuclear weapons program , to refer tehran to the un security council , which could impose sanctions . only for electricity ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tehran has long insisted it is seeking only to generate electricity and on its right to uranium enrichment , which makes fuel for civilian reactors but can also manufacture the explosive material for atomic bombs .
under the european deal , iran would receive technology including a light-water reactor which would produce less fissionable material than the heavy-water reactor tehran is planning to build with russian help in bushehr . " the enrichment of uranium is a question of national dignity and no-one can force the leaders of the country to renounce it , said hamid reza hadji-babaie , an mp and member of the speaker 's office .
" the negotiations were positive but the europeans must take account of our red lines , that is iran 's refusal to renounce the nuclear fuel cycle . " the official state news agency irna quoted an anonymous diplomat in vienna saying that the next round of talks between iran and the european three would start wednesday .
a report published this week by the international institute for strategic studies , a military and defense think tank , said that assuming iran lifts the suspension on its enrichment program , " it is still probably a few years away from full scale production of enough enriched uranium for a small nuclear arsenal . " forcing the reformers on october 5 , the parliamentary committee headed by brujerdi approved a bill that would force the reformist government of president mohammad khatami to resume uranium enrichment in defiance of the iaea .

an opposing group of countries want the cloning of human stem cells to be permitted for medical purposes .
the us has been pushing hard for a ban , but the un is unlikely to vote before the 2 november us election , in which the issue has divided the candidates .
the matter is being discussed at the general assembly 's legal committee , which features all 191 un members .
two different resolutions are on the table : one , drawn up by costa rica and backed by the united states and 60 other countries , calls for a treaty to ban all cloning , which it calls unethical and morally reproachable another , drafted by belgium , would ban cloning humans but allow countries to decide for themselves whether they wanted to ban or permit " therapeutic cloning " for research .
political issue costa rica 's foreign affairs and worship minister , roberto tovar , said his country was putting forward an initiative for human dignity .
on friday kenya , nigeria and norway were among the countries on the same side of the argument , the latter citing " respect for the inviolability of life " . "
as an individual and in my personal view , i think i would go for therapeutic cloning " kofi annan however belgian diplomat mark pedsteen said his government 's resolution focused on what united , rather than divided , the members .
sweden and thailand are among its backers .
sweden argued that " freedom of research is essential , and it must always be carried out within ethical boundaries " .
before the meeting , un secretary general kofi annan told reporters it was up to member-states to decide - but personally he would back therapeutic cloning .
last november , the committee narrowly voted to delay considering any treaty for two years but this postponement was subsequently reduced to a year .
it is a high-profile issue in the upcoming us presidential election .
president george w bush opposes all cloning while his democratic challenger , john kerry , backs stem cell research .
south korea has suggested there should be another year 's delay to allow time for a un conference on embryonic stem cell research .

an opposing group of countries want the cloning of human stem cells to be permitted for medical purposes .
the us has been pushing hard for a ban , but the un is unlikely to vote before the 2 november us election , in which the issue has divided the candidates .
the matter is being discussed at the general assembly 's legal committee , which features all 191 un members .
two different resolutions are on the table : one , drawn up by costa rica and backed by the united states and 60 other countries , calls for a treaty to ban all cloning , which it calls unethical and morally reproachable another , drafted by belgium , would ban cloning humans but allow countries to decide for themselves whether they wanted to ban or permit " therapeutic cloning " for research .
political issue costa rica 's foreign affairs and worship minister , roberto tovar , said his country was putting forward an initiative for human dignity .

as an individual and in my personal view , i think i would go for therapeutic cloning kofi annan however belgian diplomat mark pedsteen said his government 's resolution focused on what united , rather than divided , the members .
sweden and thailand are among its backers .
sweden argued that " freedom of research is essential , and it must always be carried out within ethical boundaries " .
before the meeting , un secretary general kofi annan told reporters it was up to member-states to decide - but personally he would back therapeutic cloning .
last november , the committee narrowly voted to delay considering any treaty for two years but this postponement was subsequently reduced to a year .
it is a high-profile issue in the upcoming us presidential election .
president george w bush opposes all cloning while his democratic challenger , john kerry , backs stem cell research .

the game is called cambiemos , the spanish expression for let 's change , which is the main campaign theme promoted by the opposition left wing coalition frente amplio .
" the game itself is a jigsaw puzzle about building a new country , by putting together images of hope " , explained its chief designer gonzalo frasca , who is uruguayan .
mr frasca is a veteran developer of games with a political bent .
last year he was involved in the campaign of the us presidential hopeful howard dean .
" uruguay is a country that has been going through the worst economical crisis in its history , so the focus of this campaign is telling people that we can change , working all together , " he told the bbc programme go digital .
" what we want to do is to draw attention to an alternative way to contacting young people .
" a lot of young people do not trust politicians or are very disconnected with politics , so video games are a way , a language to bridge these two worlds . "
new strategy the growth of gaming as a natural way of expression among the younger generations , means that more and more people who have something to say are using this new media as a communication tool . "
it 's the second time this has happened in the world , as far as i know , the first being the current us election campaign " gonzalo frasca , games developer in the case of cambiemos , it may give the final boost uruguay 's left wing coalition needs to win a closely fought election , according to the latest opinion polls .
frente amplio is fighting for votes with the right-centre partido nacional and the partido colorado .
there are 2.5 millon votes up for grabs and 10 % of these are people voting for the first time " i think the game can also encourage people to learn more about the candidate , " said mr frasca , who is currently at the department of digital aesthetics and communication at the information technology university of copenhagen .
" even though there is actually not a lot of political information in the game itself , it 's on the party 's website , which has a lot of links to the political pages , so young people can discover more information about the candidate " .
according to mr frasca , cambiemos is the first official game commissioned by a political party running for the presidential election in latin america , " it 's the second time this has happened in the world , as far as i know , the first being the current us election campaign , in which so far there has been five or six official games .

captain olimar has to save the day , again it is been a comparatively quiet year for nintendo in terms of big releases - no zelda , no metroid yet , no mario just yet , not even resident evil 4 until early next year .
while animal crossing may be a significant title , it took so long to get to the uk that any accompanying fanfare was muted .
this silence is over , replaced this month by the endearing squeaks of the pikmin and the sound of bongos being thumped .
olimar home in pikmin 2 , the sequel to the acclaimed 2001 title , hero captain olimar has reached home only to find his employer on the verge of bankruptcy .
to save the company he must collect " treasure " from a very familiar planet and pay off the debt .
unlike in the original pikmin , olimar , here with a colleague , louie , does not have a time limit , taking a certain amount of tension out of the proceedings .
up to four sets of bongos can be hooked up for even rowdier sessions .
whether the results are actually musical at all is another matter discuss this story on bbc collective otherwise , it is business fairly much as usual .
it must be said that if pikmin 2 was not so imaginative and loveable , it could come off as decidedly didactic and regimental .
the game is a bizarrely enjoyable combination of strategy , commerce , recycling and teamwork , replete with frank product placement .
much of the game comes across as a non-japanese person 's notion of japanese working practices : the industrious determination , the cooperation , the individual as part of a collective system .
you even have to commute home at the end of the day .
all of which just goes to highlight the game 's poetry ; that it does not feel arduous or overly serious .
party apes donkey konga is a very different experience , but no less quintessential .
as with wario ware inc : mega party games , this is nintendo reclaiming party gaming from the eyetoy .
a rhythm action game , it involves bashing rhythmically along with a series of familiar tunes .
the novel bongo peripheral is equipped with a noise sensor , so you are also required to intersperse the bashing with hand-clapping .
up to four sets of bongos can be hooked up for even rowdier sessions .
whether the results are actually musical at all is another matter .
the only real shame here is the quality of some of the cover versions .

captain olimar has to save the day , again it is been a comparatively quiet year for nintendo in terms of big releases - no zelda , no metroid yet , no mario just yet , not even resident evil 4 until early next year .

this silence is over , replaced this month by the endearing squeaks of the pikmin and the sound of bongos being thumped .
olimar home in pikmin 2 , the sequel to the acclaimed 2001 title , hero captain olimar has reached home only to find his employer on the verge of bankruptcy .
to save the company he must collect " treasure " from a very familiar planet and pay off the debt .

you even have to commute home at the end of the day .
all of which just goes to highlight the game 's poetry ; that it does not feel arduous or overly serious .
party apes donkey konga is a very different experience , but no less quintessential .
