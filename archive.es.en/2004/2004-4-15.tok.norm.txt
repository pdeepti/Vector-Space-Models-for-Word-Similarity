eu leaders on thursday dismissed the offer of a " truce " from terrorist leader osama bin laden , who said his terror network al qaeda might spare europe from attacks . the european union and national governments across europe responded with outrage to an alleged audio tape from terrorist osama bin laden broadcast on thursday by the arab news networks al arabiya and al-jazeera .
in the taped message , bin laden offers to call a truce with europe if it removes troops from the middle east .
" i announce a truce with the european countries that do not attack muslim countries , " the purported bin laden says in the tape .
in a reference to the recent terrorist attacks in madrid and earlier ones in new york and washington , the speaker said : " what happened on sept .
11 and march 11 was your goods delivered back to you . "
political leaders throughout europe agreed that the best response to bin laden 's truce offer would be to ignore it while continuing to ferret out and stop terrorists all over the world .
britain , which said it could not confirm the veracity of the tape , said it nonetheless took the message seriously .
london , however , did n't appear moved by bin laden 's message .
" we ca n't negotiation with al qaeda , " a statement released by the foreign office said .
" their attacks are against the very idea of coexistence .
the right response is to continue to confront terrorism , not give in to its demands . "
the british government accused bin laden of pursuing a " cynical strategy " of trying to divide europe and the united states .
in rome , italian foreign minister franco frattini said " it 's unthinkable that we may open negotiations with bin laden , everybody understands this . "
a spokesman for the german government , meanwhile , said " there can be no discussions with terrorists and criminals like osama bin laden . "
though germany strictly opposed the war in iraq , it has several thousand peacekeeping troops in afghanistan and is currently training civilian police officers in iraq .
and spain 's designated foreign minister , miguel angel moratinos , said bin laden 's message , in which the man speaking justified the march 11 attacks , should be ignored completely .
" those of us who seek peace , democracy and freedom do not need to listen or pay attention to him , " he said .
around 200 people died in madrid after bombs detonated on local commuter trains .
on a trip to china , european commission president romano prodi scoffed at the apparent bin laden message .
" how could you possibly react to this statement ?
there is no possibility for a deal under a terrorist threat .
it is completely impossible , " he told reporters .
cia to review tape officials at the u.s. central intelligence agency said thursday they would review the tape to determine its authenticity .
in the message , which runs just over seven minutes long , the purported bin laden said " the truce will begin when the last soldier leaves our countries . "
the man also states that recent polls have shown that the majority of europeans want to reconcile with the islamic world and calls on european governments to respond to the offer within three months .
the alleged bin laden also pledges retaliation for the recent murder of hamas leader sheik ahmed yassin by the israeli army .
" we vow before god to take revenge for him from america for this , god willing , " the man said .
the israeli armed forces assassinated the founder of the radical palestinian group during a targeted mission on march 22 .
the tape also sharply criticizes washington 's middle east policy , saying it ignores the " real problem , " the " occupation of all of palestine . "
it further lambastes the u.s. for creating a business out of the war in iraq that is generating " billions " for american companies through weapons and reconstruction contracts . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope calls on masses to fight terror in his annual easter mass , pope john paul ii , the head of the catholic church , asked believers to unite and find the courage and strength to fight the " inhuman " and growing terrorism trend .

the eu and the german government warned that both israelis and palestinians must agree to any border changes . european union leaders responded cautiously to u.s. president george w. bush 's announcement that israel could keep arab land it captured in 1967 .
they made clear that they would not accept a unilateral change to middle east borders . " the european union will not recognize any change to the pre-1967 borders other than those arrived at by agreement between the parties , " irish foreign minister brian cowen , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , said in a statement on wednesday , quoting the stance the eu has repeatedly taken . cowen also pointed out that the road map meant to chart the course to a middle east peace plan required that a final agreement ending the israeli-palestinian conflict must also resolve the refugee issue . eu will discuss proposals the so-called middle east quartet , which is made up of the eu , russia and the united nations , along with the united states , will examine the plan agreed on by president bush and israeli prime minister ariel sharon , javier solana , the eu 's top diplomat , said wednesday .
eu ministers will discuss the matter on friday at a meeting in tullamore , ireland , the irish foreign minister announced . cowen tried to put a positive shine on bush and sharon 's talks , despite the fact that the palestinians and some experts on the region say the u.s. policy change has dealt a deadly blow to the peace process .
cowen welcomed bush 's affirmation that the u.s. is committed to the road map and a two state solution . the german government 's statement echoed the eu 's .
germany praised the talks between bush and sharon , which it said got the peace process moving again , as well as israel 's plan to pull out of the gaza strip .
chancellor gerhard schröder will discuss the issues in the coming days in meetings planned with the egyptian president , the lebanese prime minister and the israeli president , government spokesman béla anda said in the statement .

but chancellor schröder 's fellow party member gernot erler , the social democrats ' foreign policy spokesman , called it an " affront to the eu , russia and the united nations " that the united states accepted israel 's settlement policies .
" bush 's policies deepen the rift between the united states and the arab world , " he told dw-tv . after talks with sharon in washington , bush said he endorsed the israeli leader 's plans to pull out of the gaza strip but keep land in the west bank indefinitely .
israeli forces occupied the areas in 1967 .
bush said that " new realities on the ground " should be reflected in a final settlement .
he added that any palestinian refugees who wished to return to their former homes should be accommodated in palestinian territory . " of course , bush did n't say anything particularly surprising , " deutsche welle correspondent peter philip commented .
" nobody seriously expected that history would be turned back to june 5 , 1967 or even further back .

the eu and the german government warned that both israelis and palestinians must agree to any border changes . european union leaders responded cautiously to u.s. president george w. bush 's announcement that israel could keep arab land it captured in 1967 .
they made clear that they would not accept a unilateral change to middle east borders . " the european union will not recognize any change to the pre-1967 borders other than those arrived at by agreement between the parties , " irish foreign minister brian cowen , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , said in a statement on wednesday , quoting the stance the eu has repeatedly taken . cowen also pointed out that the road map meant to chart the course to a middle east peace plan required that a final agreement ending the israeli-palestinian conflict must also resolve the refugee issue . eu will discuss proposals the so-called middle east quartet , which is made up of the eu , russia and the united nations , along with the united states , will examine the plan agreed on by president bush and israeli prime minister ariel sharon , javier solana , the eu 's top diplomat , said wednesday .
eu ministers will discuss the matter on friday at a meeting in tullamore , ireland , the irish foreign minister announced . cowen tried to put a positive shine on bush and sharon 's talks , despite the fact that the palestinians and some experts on the region say the u.s. policy change has dealt a deadly blow to the peace process .
cowen welcomed bush 's affirmation that the u.s. is committed to the road map and a two state solution . the german government 's statement echoed the eu 's .
germany praised the talks between bush and sharon , which it said got the peace process moving again , as well as israel 's plan to pull out of the gaza strip .
chancellor gerhard schröder will discuss the issues in the coming days in meetings planned with the egyptian president , the lebanese prime minister and the israeli president , government spokesman béla anda said in the statement .

many english language films make it to the german screens with their original titles intact .
some , however , are subject to changes that leave many visitors and ex-pats scratching their heads . english speakers living in germany - even those proficient in the native tongue - often squint at the titles of movies advertised in the local press .
sometimes the english title of the film has been retained , making it easy for the ex-pat to identify the film .
others times , however , the movie has been given a mind-boggling new name , creating a minefield of confusion . take the new mike myers film based on the dr. seuss children 's book classic " the cat in the hat " .
from the posters , it is obvious that the film is the same : myers in full cat makeup and a large top hat gives it away .
but the title on poster , " ein kater macht theater " or " a tomcat makes theater " does n't come close to the original . sometimes the titles have their basis in the plot of the film . a good example is " die unbestechlichen " -lrb- the incorruptible -rrb- , the german title for the watergate story " all the president 's men , " where journalists bob woodward and carl bernstein uncover a presidential scandal . the knights of the coconut however , the german film board has also come up with some really bizarre alternatives .
" monty python and the holy grail " may feature several references to coconuts , but not to the extent that would justify the film being called " die ritter der kokosnuss " -lrb- the knights of the coconut -rrb- . the same could be said about " der mann mit der todeskralle " -lrb- the man with the deadly claw -rrb- or , as english viewers know it , " enter the dragon . "
bruce lee , the star of the cult seventies martial arts classic , does indeed prove that his hands are lethal weapons , but there is no actual claw in sight . similarly , the seminal spaghetti western " once upon a time in the west " contains a haunting melody played by charles bronson 's harmonica man , but that hardly justifies naming the film " spiel mir das lied vom tod " -lrb- play me the song of death -rrb- . rebel without a clue ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes the titles have been changed to such an extent that only the extremely knowledgeable would be able to identify the film without seeing the accompanying poster .
take " rebel without a cause " : the iconic image of james dean leaning against a wall , smoking a cigarette and oozing attitude would give it away .
but the german title " ... denn sie wissen nicht , was sie tun -lrb- they do not know what they do -rrb- would render many faces blank . another iconic movie suffered an even more bizarre fate .
marlon brando 's " on the waterfront , " with its boxing storyline , was afforded the strange title , " die faust im nacken " -lrb- the fist in the nape of the neck -rrb- .
and martin scorsese 's kinetic debut feature " mean streets " lost its new york gangster feel with the german title " hexenkessel , " meaning bedlam . however , germany is a long way from being the worst offender .
that dubious honor goes to the hong kong film industry , which has come up with some classics . the big liar and other cantonese oddities oliver stone 's biopic of former u.s. president richard nixon , unimaginatively titled " nixon " by the director , was livened up and renamed " the big liar . "
the coen brothers ' winter wilderness crime story " fargo " was given even more special treatment , entering hong kong cinemas under the title " mysterious murder in snowy cream . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mr. cat poop .
but the best has to be the oscar-winning jack nicholson comedy " as good as it gets " , which got a complete makeover , eventually reflecting the main character 's attitude problem in the name " mr. cat poop .

however , both succeeded in defeating the ethnic albanian candidates gezim ostreni and zudi xhelili to make the shortlist .

ostreni managed 14 percent while xhelili struggled to secure just 8 percent of the vote .

bruce lee , the star of the cult seventies martial arts classic , does indeed prove that his hands are lethal weapons , but there is no actual claw in sight . similarly , the seminal spaghetti western " once upon a time in the west " contains a haunting melody played by charles bronson 's harmonica man , but that hardly justifies naming the film " spiel mir das lied vom tod " -lrb- play me the song of death -rrb- . rebel without a clue ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes the titles have been changed to such an extent that only the extremely knowledgeable would be able to identify the film without seeing the accompanying poster .
take " rebel without a cause " : the iconic image of james dean leaning against a wall , smoking a cigarette and oozing attitude would give it away .
but the german title " ... denn sie wissen nicht , was sie tun -lrb- they do not know what they do -rrb- would render many faces blank . another iconic movie suffered an even more bizarre fate .
marlon brando 's " on the waterfront , " with its boxing storyline , was afforded the strange title , " die faust im nacken " -lrb- the fist in the nape of the neck -rrb- .
and martin scorsese 's kinetic debut feature " mean streets " lost its new york gangster feel with the german title " hexenkessel , " meaning bedlam . however , germany is a long way from being the worst offender .
that dubious honor goes to the hong kong film industry , which has come up with some classics . the big liar and other cantonese oddities oliver stone 's biopic of former u.s. president richard nixon , unimaginatively titled " nixon " by the director , was livened up and renamed " the big liar . "
the coen brothers ' winter wilderness crime story " fargo " was given even more special treatment , entering hong kong cinemas under the title " mysterious murder in snowy cream . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mr. cat poop .
but the best has to be the oscar-winning jack nicholson comedy " as good as it gets " , which got a complete makeover , eventually reflecting the main character 's attitude problem in the name " mr. cat poop .

eu leaders on thursday dismissed the offer of a " truce " from terrorist leader osama bin laden , who said his terror network al qaeda might spare europe from attacks . the european union and national governments across europe responded with outrage to an alleged audio tape from terrorist osama bin laden broadcast on thursday by the arab news networks al arabiya and al-jazeera .
in the taped message , bin laden offers to call a truce with europe if it removes troops from the middle east .
" i announce a truce with the european countries that do not attack muslim countries , " the purported bin laden says in the tape .
in a reference to the recent terrorist attacks in madrid and earlier ones in new york and washington , the speaker said : " what happened on sept .
11 and march 11 was your goods delivered back to you . "
political leaders throughout europe agreed that the best response to bin laden 's truce offer would be to ignore it while continuing to ferret out and stop terrorists all over the world .
britain , which said it could not confirm the veracity of the tape , said it nonetheless took the message seriously .
london , however , did n't appear moved by bin laden 's message .
" we ca n't negotiation with al qaeda , " a statement released by the foreign office said .
" their attacks are against the very idea of coexistence .
the right response is to continue to confront terrorism , not give in to its demands . "
the british government accused bin laden of pursuing a " cynical strategy " of trying to divide europe and the united states .
in rome , italian foreign minister franco frattini said " it 's unthinkable that we may open negotiations with bin laden , everybody understands this . "
a spokesman for the german government , meanwhile , said " there can be no discussions with terrorists and criminals like osama bin laden . "
though germany strictly opposed the war in iraq , it has several thousand peacekeeping troops in afghanistan and is currently training civilian police officers in iraq .
and spain 's designated foreign minister , miguel angel moratinos , said bin laden 's message , in which the man speaking justified the march 11 attacks , should be ignored completely .
" those of us who seek peace , democracy and freedom do not need to listen or pay attention to him , " he said .
around 200 people died in madrid after bombs detonated on local commuter trains .
on a trip to china , european commission president romano prodi scoffed at the apparent bin laden message .
" how could you possibly react to this statement ?
there is no possibility for a deal under a terrorist threat .
it is completely impossible , " he told reporters .
cia to review tape officials at the u.s. central intelligence agency said thursday they would review the tape to determine its authenticity .
in the message , which runs just over seven minutes long , the purported bin laden said " the truce will begin when the last soldier leaves our countries . "
the man also states that recent polls have shown that the majority of europeans want to reconcile with the islamic world and calls on european governments to respond to the offer within three months .
the alleged bin laden also pledges retaliation for the recent murder of hamas leader sheik ahmed yassin by the israeli army .
" we vow before god to take revenge for him from america for this , god willing , " the man said .
the israeli armed forces assassinated the founder of the radical palestinian group during a targeted mission on march 22 .
the tape also sharply criticizes washington 's middle east policy , saying it ignores the " real problem , " the " occupation of all of palestine . "

iraqi militants executed one of four italian hostages , officials in rome confirmed early thursday .
it 's the first known killing of any of the 22 foreigners being held in iraq . the execution could further heighten fears among international aid workers , contractors and journalists , some of whom are already restricting their activities in iraq . earlier wednesday , a french journalist was freed after a four-day hostage ordeal and russia announced it would evacuate its citizens .
reports said two more japanese freelance journalists were kidnapped outside baghdad . the militants who killed the italian hostage demanded the withdrawal of u.s. forces from iraq and threatened to kill the three other hostages , al-jazeera reported . the qatar-based tv network reported that it had video of the killing but said it was too graphic to broadcast .
al-jazeera did show footage of four italian security guards sitting on the ground , holding up their passports and surrounded by armed men . the four italian security guards were abducted monday .
the militants ' videotape was accompanied by a statement from a previously unknown group , the green battalion .
it said it would " kill the three remaining italian hostages one after the other , if their demands are not met , " al-jazeera said . the group demanded the withdrawal of u.s. forces from iraq , an apology from italian leader silvio berlusconi and the release of religious clerics held in iraq . berlusconi unshakeable on withdrawing troops the italian ambassador to qatar watched the video and confirmed the man killed was fabrizio quattrocchi , one of the kidnapped italians , italian foreign minister franco frattini said .
frattini said the government would do " what is possible and impossible " to free the remaining three . three of the italian captives were working for a u.s.-based company while a fourth was employed by a seychelles-based firm , frattini said .
he stressed that the four italian hostages were not members of italian intelligence , and that the abductors were " terrorists and killers " who were " out of control " , not members of any organized resistance . italian prime minister premier silvio berlusconi , who has ruled out pulling out italian troops from iraq , said , " they have cut short a life .
they have not damaged our values and our commitment to peace . " italy is the third-largest coalition partner in the occupation force .
italy did n't send in combat troops during the war .
its forces are based in the southern city of nasiriyah , working on reconstruction . in november of last year , italy suffered tragic losses when a suicide truck bomb attack in nasiriyah , a city in southern iraq , killed 19 italians , italy 's worst single military loss since world war ii . a u.s. spokesman said tuesday that 40 foreigners from 12 countries are being held by kidnappers but an associated press count put the number at 22 , with wednesday 's release of the french journalist and the death of the italian hostage . associated press send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german general : americans losing credibility in iraq with no end in sight to the recent escalation in violence between iraqi insurgents and coalition forces , deutsche welle spoke to german army gen. klaus reinhardt about the prospects for peace in iraq .

eu leaders on thursday dismissed the offer of a " truce " from terrorist leader osama bin laden , who said his terror network al qaeda might spare europe from attacks . the european union and national governments across europe responded with outrage to an alleged audio tape from terrorist osama bin laden broadcast on thursday by the arab news networks al arabiya and al-jazeera .
in the taped message , bin laden offers to call a truce with europe if it removes troops from the middle east .
" i announce a truce with the european countries that do not attack muslim countries , " the purported bin laden says in the tape .
in a reference to the recent terrorist attacks in madrid and earlier ones in new york and washington , the speaker said : " what happened on sept .
11 and march 11 was your goods delivered back to you . "
political leaders throughout europe agreed that the best response to bin laden 's truce offer would be to ignore it while continuing to ferret out and stop terrorists all over the world .
britain , which said it could not confirm the veracity of the tape , said it nonetheless took the message seriously .
london , however , did n't appear moved by bin laden 's message .
" we ca n't negotiation with al qaeda , " a statement released by the foreign office said .
" their attacks are against the very idea of coexistence .
the right response is to continue to confront terrorism , not give in to its demands . "
the british government accused bin laden of pursuing a " cynical strategy " of trying to divide europe and the united states .
in rome , italian foreign minister franco frattini said " it 's unthinkable that we may open negotiations with bin laden , everybody understands this . "
a spokesman for the german government , meanwhile , said " there can be no discussions with terrorists and criminals like osama bin laden . "
though germany strictly opposed the war in iraq , it has several thousand peacekeeping troops in afghanistan and is currently training civilian police officers in iraq .
and spain 's designated foreign minister , miguel angel moratinos , said bin laden 's message , in which the man speaking justified the march 11 attacks , should be ignored completely .
" those of us who seek peace , democracy and freedom do not need to listen or pay attention to him , " he said .
around 200 people died in madrid after bombs detonated on local commuter trains .
on a trip to china , european commission president romano prodi scoffed at the apparent bin laden message .
" how could you possibly react to this statement ?
there is no possibility for a deal under a terrorist threat .
it is completely impossible , " he told reporters .
cia to review tape officials at the u.s. central intelligence agency said thursday they would review the tape to determine its authenticity .
in the message , which runs just over seven minutes long , the purported bin laden said " the truce will begin when the last soldier leaves our countries . "

the european union is expected to make a huge step in its relationship with china this month by ending a 15-year arms embargo .
but human rights group amnesty international has condemned the proposal . the european union has angered human rights organizations by revealing that a 15-year arms embargo with china could be lifted soon .
officials in brussels announced on wednesday that eu governments had discussed an end to the ban several times in recent months and were due to make a final decision on april 26 , according to a statement from eu spokeswoman emma udwin .
eu foreign ministers are due to meet in ireland next weekend , and will hold talks with their chinese counterpart , li zhaoxing , as part of an eu-asia meeting within the proceedings .
irish officials commenting on behalf of the current eu presidency have made it clear that while the arms embargo is not on the official agenda , the ministers from the european union and china will cover " international and regional issues of common concern . "
germany and france promote plan the driving force behind the proposed scrapping of the embargo comes from european powerhouses germany and france .
if the arms ban were to be lifted , it would open up a whole new defense market , particularly for germany with its stealth submarines and france with its mirage fighter jets - two pieces of military hardware much coveted by the chinese defense department .
however , germany and france may face opposition from denmark , sweden and the netherlands , and the eu as a whole faces pressure from the united states , which firmly opposes the lifting .
despite their expected opposition , other eu nations are itching to get involved in what could be a very lucrative market , with defense suppliers keen to supply the fast modernizing chinese military .
however , human rights organization amnesty international reacted to the proposed dropping of arms restrictions by warning the european union to consider the message it was sending to imprisoned human rights activists in china if it lifted the embargo .
embargo began after tiananmen square bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : student demonstrations , tiananmen square , 1989 .
lifting the embargo imposed in 1989 after the tiananmen square killings would be the " wrong message " if there was no " clear and concrete progress in return " on human rights , amnesty spokesman dick oosting told reporters .
amnesty is reiterating its call for an independent inquiry into the events of 1989 when china sent in tanks to break up pro-democracy protests in tiananmen square in central beijing , killing hundreds .
" activists who call for such an enquiry or criticize what happened , even in emails and on web sites , are still being imprisoned to this day , " it said in a statement .
amnesty stated that it had " cautioned the eu to consider what message it will be sending to human rights activists in china , who are still being imprisoned 15 years after tiananmen square , if it lifts the eu arms embargo against china . "
leaders swap platitudes european commission president romano prodi met with chinese leaders in beijing on wednesday in another show of the burgeoning relationship between the eu and the people 's republic .
" china is now our second largest trading partner , " prodi said in his speech .
" on present trends , the eu will very soon occupy a similar place in china 's own trading hierarchy .
not much longer after that , it will probably be china 's first partner . "
prodi added that eu-china relations had never been so good .
he did , however , also mention that more work could be done of the human rights issue in china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese president hu jintao -lrb- photo -rrb- responded in kind by telling the commission president that china is ready to strengthen consultation and coordination with the eu on important international and regional issues .
china is willing to expand mutually beneficial cooperation between itself and the eu , hu said , adding that the two sides should join hands to contribute to world peace , stability and development .
the chinese leader said that his country supported the enlargement and integration of the eu and hoped the bloc would play a bigger role in international affairs . the european union and china set up a strategic partnership last year , an important decision that set a clear direction for the development of relations between them in the new century . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de france and china cozy up chinese president hu jintao is in france this week on a state visit .

the european union is expected to make a huge step in its relationship with china this month by ending a 15-year arms embargo .
but human rights group amnesty international has condemned the proposal . the european union has angered human rights organizations by revealing that a 15-year arms embargo with china could be lifted soon .
officials in brussels announced on wednesday that eu governments had discussed an end to the ban several times in recent months and were due to make a final decision on april 26 , according to a statement from eu spokeswoman emma udwin .
eu foreign ministers are due to meet in ireland next weekend , and will hold talks with their chinese counterpart , li zhaoxing , as part of an eu-asia meeting within the proceedings .
irish officials commenting on behalf of the current eu presidency have made it clear that while the arms embargo is not on the official agenda , the ministers from the european union and china will cover " international and regional issues of common concern . "
germany and france promote plan the driving force behind the proposed scrapping of the embargo comes from european powerhouses germany and france .
if the arms ban were to be lifted , it would open up a whole new defense market , particularly for germany with its stealth submarines and france with its mirage fighter jets - two pieces of military hardware much coveted by the chinese defense department .
however , germany and france may face opposition from denmark , sweden and the netherlands , and the eu as a whole faces pressure from the united states , which firmly opposes the lifting .
despite their expected opposition , other eu nations are itching to get involved in what could be a very lucrative market , with defense suppliers keen to supply the fast modernizing chinese military .
however , human rights organization amnesty international reacted to the proposed dropping of arms restrictions by warning the european union to consider the message it was sending to imprisoned human rights activists in china if it lifted the embargo .
embargo began after tiananmen square bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : student demonstrations , tiananmen square , 1989 .
lifting the embargo imposed in 1989 after the tiananmen square killings would be the " wrong message " if there was no " clear and concrete progress in return " on human rights , amnesty spokesman dick oosting told reporters .
amnesty is reiterating its call for an independent inquiry into the events of 1989 when china sent in tanks to break up pro-democracy protests in tiananmen square in central beijing , killing hundreds .
" activists who call for such an enquiry or criticize what happened , even in emails and on web sites , are still being imprisoned to this day , " it said in a statement .
amnesty stated that it had " cautioned the eu to consider what message it will be sending to human rights activists in china , who are still being imprisoned 15 years after tiananmen square , if it lifts the eu arms embargo against china . "
leaders swap platitudes european commission president romano prodi met with chinese leaders in beijing on wednesday in another show of the burgeoning relationship between the eu and the people 's republic .
" china is now our second largest trading partner , " prodi said in his speech .
" on present trends , the eu will very soon occupy a similar place in china 's own trading hierarchy .
not much longer after that , it will probably be china 's first partner . "
prodi added that eu-china relations had never been so good .
he did , however , also mention that more work could be done of the human rights issue in china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese president hu jintao -lrb- photo -rrb- responded in kind by telling the commission president that china is ready to strengthen consultation and coordination with the eu on important international and regional issues .
china is willing to expand mutually beneficial cooperation between itself and the eu , hu said , adding that the two sides should join hands to contribute to world peace , stability and development .
the chinese leader said that his country supported the enlargement and integration of the eu and hoped the bloc would play a bigger role in international affairs . the european union and china set up a strategic partnership last year , an important decision that set a clear direction for the development of relations between them in the new century . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de france and china cozy up chinese president hu jintao is in france this week on a state visit .

iraqi militants executed one of four italian hostages , officials in rome confirmed early thursday .
it 's the first known killing of any of the 22 foreigners being held in iraq . the execution could further heighten fears among international aid workers , contractors and journalists , some of whom are already restricting their activities in iraq . earlier wednesday , a french journalist was freed after a four-day hostage ordeal and russia announced it would evacuate its citizens .
reports said two more japanese freelance journalists were kidnapped outside baghdad . the militants who killed the italian hostage demanded the withdrawal of u.s. forces from iraq and threatened to kill the three other hostages , al-jazeera reported . the qatar-based tv network reported that it had video of the killing but said it was too graphic to broadcast .
al-jazeera did show footage of four italian security guards sitting on the ground , holding up their passports and surrounded by armed men . the four italian security guards were abducted monday .
the militants ' videotape was accompanied by a statement from a previously unknown group , the green battalion .
it said it would " kill the three remaining italian hostages one after the other , if their demands are not met , " al-jazeera said . the group demanded the withdrawal of u.s. forces from iraq , an apology from italian leader silvio berlusconi and the release of religious clerics held in iraq . berlusconi unshakeable on withdrawing troops the italian ambassador to qatar watched the video and confirmed the man killed was fabrizio quattrocchi , one of the kidnapped italians , italian foreign minister franco frattini said .
frattini said the government would do " what is possible and impossible " to free the remaining three . three of the italian captives were working for a u.s.-based company while a fourth was employed by a seychelles-based firm , frattini said .
he stressed that the four italian hostages were not members of italian intelligence , and that the abductors were " terrorists and killers " who were " out of control " , not members of any organized resistance . italian prime minister premier silvio berlusconi , who has ruled out pulling out italian troops from iraq , said , " they have cut short a life .
they have not damaged our values and our commitment to peace . " italy is the third-largest coalition partner in the occupation force .
italy did n't send in combat troops during the war .
its forces are based in the southern city of nasiriyah , working on reconstruction . in november of last year , italy suffered tragic losses when a suicide truck bomb attack in nasiriyah , a city in southern iraq , killed 19 italians , italy 's worst single military loss since world war ii . a u.s. spokesman said tuesday that 40 foreigners from 12 countries are being held by kidnappers but an associated press count put the number at 22 , with wednesday 's release of the french journalist and the death of the italian hostage . associated press send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german general : americans losing credibility in iraq with no end in sight to the recent escalation in violence between iraqi insurgents and coalition forces , deutsche welle spoke to german army gen. klaus reinhardt about the prospects for peace in iraq .

many english language films make it to the german screens with their original titles intact .
some , however , are subject to changes that leave many visitors and ex-pats scratching their heads . english speakers living in germany - even those proficient in the native tongue - often squint at the titles of movies advertised in the local press .
sometimes the english title of the film has been retained , making it easy for the ex-pat to identify the film .
others times , however , the movie has been given a mind-boggling new name , creating a minefield of confusion . take the new mike myers film based on the dr. seuss children 's book classic " the cat in the hat " .
from the posters , it is obvious that the film is the same : myers in full cat makeup and a large top hat gives it away .
but the title on poster , " ein kater macht theater " or " a tomcat makes theater " does n't come close to the original . sometimes the titles have their basis in the plot of the film . a good example is " die unbestechlichen " -lrb- the incorruptible -rrb- , the german title for the watergate story " all the president 's men , " where journalists bob woodward and carl bernstein uncover a presidential scandal . the knights of the coconut however , the german film board has also come up with some really bizarre alternatives .
" monty python and the holy grail " may feature several references to coconuts , but not to the extent that would justify the film being called " die ritter der kokosnuss " -lrb- the knights of the coconut -rrb- . the same could be said about " der mann mit der todeskralle " -lrb- the man with the deadly claw -rrb- or , as english viewers know it , " enter the dragon . "
bruce lee , the star of the cult seventies martial arts classic , does indeed prove that his hands are lethal weapons , but there is no actual claw in sight . similarly , the seminal spaghetti western " once upon a time in the west " contains a haunting melody played by charles bronson 's harmonica man , but that hardly justifies naming the film " spiel mir das lied vom tod " -lrb- play me the song of death -rrb- . rebel without a clue ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes the titles have been changed to such an extent that only the extremely knowledgeable would be able to identify the film without seeing the accompanying poster .
take " rebel without a cause " : the iconic image of james dean leaning against a wall , smoking a cigarette and oozing attitude would give it away .
but the german title " ... denn sie wissen nicht , was sie tun -lrb- they do not know what they do -rrb- would render many faces blank . another iconic movie suffered an even more bizarre fate .
marlon brando 's " on the waterfront , " with its boxing storyline , was afforded the strange title , " die faust im nacken " -lrb- the fist in the nape of the neck -rrb- .
and martin scorsese 's kinetic debut feature " mean streets " lost its new york gangster feel with the german title " hexenkessel , " meaning bedlam . however , germany is a long way from being the worst offender .
that dubious honor goes to the hong kong film industry , which has come up with some classics . the big liar and other cantonese oddities oliver stone 's biopic of former u.s. president richard nixon , unimaginatively titled " nixon " by the director , was livened up and renamed " the big liar . "
the coen brothers ' winter wilderness crime story " fargo " was given even more special treatment , entering hong kong cinemas under the title " mysterious murder in snowy cream . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mr. cat poop .
but the best has to be the oscar-winning jack nicholson comedy " as good as it gets " , which got a complete makeover , eventually reflecting the main character 's attitude problem in the name " mr. cat poop .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.04.2004 europe outraged by alleged bin laden tape großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new tape thought to be from osama bin laden surfaced this week .
eu leaders on thursday dismissed the offer of a " truce " from terrorist leader osama bin laden , who said his terror network al qaeda might spare europe from attacks . the european union and national governments across europe responded with outrage to an alleged audio tape from terrorist osama bin laden broadcast on thursday by the arab news networks al arabiya and al-jazeera .
in the taped message , bin laden offers to call a truce with europe if it removes troops from the middle east .
" i announce a truce with the european countries that do not attack muslim countries , " the purported bin laden says in the tape .
in a reference to the recent terrorist attacks in madrid and earlier ones in new york and washington , the speaker said : " what happened on sept .
11 and march 11 was your goods delivered back to you . "
political leaders throughout europe agreed that the best response to bin laden 's truce offer would be to ignore it while continuing to ferret out and stop terrorists all over the world .
britain , which said it could not confirm the veracity of the tape , said it nonetheless took the message seriously .
london , however , did n't appear moved by bin laden 's message .
" we ca n't negotiation with al qaeda , " a statement released by the foreign office said .
" their attacks are against the very idea of coexistence .
the right response is to continue to confront terrorism , not give in to its demands . "
the british government accused bin laden of pursuing a " cynical strategy " of trying to divide europe and the united states .
in rome , italian foreign minister franco frattini said " it 's unthinkable that we may open negotiations with bin laden , everybody understands this . "
a spokesman for the german government , meanwhile , said " there can be no discussions with terrorists and criminals like osama bin laden . "
though germany strictly opposed the war in iraq , it has several thousand peacekeeping troops in afghanistan and is currently training civilian police officers in iraq .
and spain 's designated foreign minister , miguel angel moratinos , said bin laden 's message , in which the man speaking justified the march 11 attacks , should be ignored completely .
" those of us who seek peace , democracy and freedom do not need to listen or pay attention to him , " he said .
around 200 people died in madrid after bombs detonated on local commuter trains .
on a trip to china , european commission president romano prodi scoffed at the apparent bin laden message .
" how could you possibly react to this statement ?
there is no possibility for a deal under a terrorist threat .
it is completely impossible , " he told reporters .
cia to review tape officials at the u.s. central intelligence agency said thursday they would review the tape to determine its authenticity .
in the message , which runs just over seven minutes long , the purported bin laden said " the truce will begin when the last soldier leaves our countries . "
the man also states that recent polls have shown that the majority of europeans want to reconcile with the islamic world and calls on european governments to respond to the offer within three months .
the alleged bin laden also pledges retaliation for the recent murder of hamas leader sheik ahmed yassin by the israeli army .
" we vow before god to take revenge for him from america for this , god willing , " the man said .
the israeli armed forces assassinated the founder of the radical palestinian group during a targeted mission on march 22 .
the tape also sharply criticizes washington 's middle east policy , saying it ignores the " real problem , " the " occupation of all of palestine . "
it further lambastes the u.s. for creating a business out of the war in iraq that is generating " billions " for american companies through weapons and reconstruction contracts . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope calls on masses to fight terror in his annual easter mass , pope john paul ii , the head of the catholic church , asked believers to unite and find the courage and strength to fight the " inhuman " and growing terrorism trend .

cowen welcomed bush 's affirmation that the u.s. is committed to the road map and a two state solution . the german government 's statement echoed the eu 's .

the eu and the german government warned that both israelis and palestinians must agree to any border changes . european union leaders responded cautiously to u.s. president george w. bush 's announcement that israel could keep arab land it captured in 1967 .
they made clear that they would not accept a unilateral change to middle east borders . " the european union will not recognize any change to the pre-1967 borders other than those arrived at by agreement between the parties , " irish foreign minister brian cowen , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , said in a statement on wednesday , quoting the stance the eu has repeatedly taken . cowen also pointed out that the road map meant to chart the course to a middle east peace plan required that a final agreement ending the israeli-palestinian conflict must also resolve the refugee issue . eu will discuss proposals the so-called middle east quartet , which is made up of the eu , russia and the united nations , along with the united states , will examine the plan agreed on by president bush and israeli prime minister ariel sharon , javier solana , the eu 's top diplomat , said wednesday .

eu leaders on thursday dismissed the offer of a " truce " from terrorist leader osama bin laden , who said his terror network al qaeda might spare europe from attacks . the european union and national governments across europe responded with outrage to an alleged audio tape from terrorist osama bin laden broadcast on thursday by the arab news networks al arabiya and al-jazeera .
in the taped message , bin laden offers to call a truce with europe if it removes troops from the middle east .
" i announce a truce with the european countries that do not attack muslim countries , " the purported bin laden says in the tape .
in a reference to the recent terrorist attacks in madrid and earlier ones in new york and washington , the speaker said : " what happened on sept .
11 and march 11 was your goods delivered back to you . "
political leaders throughout europe agreed that the best response to bin laden 's truce offer would be to ignore it while continuing to ferret out and stop terrorists all over the world .
britain , which said it could not confirm the veracity of the tape , said it nonetheless took the message seriously .
london , however , did n't appear moved by bin laden 's message .
" we ca n't negotiation with al qaeda , " a statement released by the foreign office said .
" their attacks are against the very idea of coexistence .
the right response is to continue to confront terrorism , not give in to its demands . "
the british government accused bin laden of pursuing a " cynical strategy " of trying to divide europe and the united states .
in rome , italian foreign minister franco frattini said " it 's unthinkable that we may open negotiations with bin laden , everybody understands this . "
a spokesman for the german government , meanwhile , said " there can be no discussions with terrorists and criminals like osama bin laden . "
though germany strictly opposed the war in iraq , it has several thousand peacekeeping troops in afghanistan and is currently training civilian police officers in iraq .
and spain 's designated foreign minister , miguel angel moratinos , said bin laden 's message , in which the man speaking justified the march 11 attacks , should be ignored completely .
" those of us who seek peace , democracy and freedom do not need to listen or pay attention to him , " he said .
around 200 people died in madrid after bombs detonated on local commuter trains .
on a trip to china , european commission president romano prodi scoffed at the apparent bin laden message .
" how could you possibly react to this statement ?
there is no possibility for a deal under a terrorist threat .
it is completely impossible , " he told reporters .
cia to review tape officials at the u.s. central intelligence agency said thursday they would review the tape to determine its authenticity .
in the message , which runs just over seven minutes long , the purported bin laden said " the truce will begin when the last soldier leaves our countries . "
the man also states that recent polls have shown that the majority of europeans want to reconcile with the islamic world and calls on european governments to respond to the offer within three months .
the alleged bin laden also pledges retaliation for the recent murder of hamas leader sheik ahmed yassin by the israeli army .
" we vow before god to take revenge for him from america for this , god willing , " the man said .
the israeli armed forces assassinated the founder of the radical palestinian group during a targeted mission on march 22 .
the tape also sharply criticizes washington 's middle east policy , saying it ignores the " real problem , " the " occupation of all of palestine . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.04.2004 eu proposes end to china arms embargo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the modern chinese military could soon be benefiting from european arms exports .
the european union is expected to make a huge step in its relationship with china this month by ending a 15-year arms embargo .
but human rights group amnesty international has condemned the proposal . the european union has angered human rights organizations by revealing that a 15-year arms embargo with china could be lifted soon .
officials in brussels announced on wednesday that eu governments had discussed an end to the ban several times in recent months and were due to make a final decision on april 26 , according to a statement from eu spokeswoman emma udwin .
eu foreign ministers are due to meet in ireland next weekend , and will hold talks with their chinese counterpart , li zhaoxing , as part of an eu-asia meeting within the proceedings .
irish officials commenting on behalf of the current eu presidency have made it clear that while the arms embargo is not on the official agenda , the ministers from the european union and china will cover " international and regional issues of common concern . "
germany and france promote plan the driving force behind the proposed scrapping of the embargo comes from european powerhouses germany and france .
if the arms ban were to be lifted , it would open up a whole new defense market , particularly for germany with its stealth submarines and france with its mirage fighter jets - two pieces of military hardware much coveted by the chinese defense department .
however , germany and france may face opposition from denmark , sweden and the netherlands , and the eu as a whole faces pressure from the united states , which firmly opposes the lifting .
despite their expected opposition , other eu nations are itching to get involved in what could be a very lucrative market , with defense suppliers keen to supply the fast modernizing chinese military .
however , human rights organization amnesty international reacted to the proposed dropping of arms restrictions by warning the european union to consider the message it was sending to imprisoned human rights activists in china if it lifted the embargo .
embargo began after tiananmen square bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : student demonstrations , tiananmen square , 1989 .
lifting the embargo imposed in 1989 after the tiananmen square killings would be the " wrong message " if there was no " clear and concrete progress in return " on human rights , amnesty spokesman dick oosting told reporters .
amnesty is reiterating its call for an independent inquiry into the events of 1989 when china sent in tanks to break up pro-democracy protests in tiananmen square in central beijing , killing hundreds .
" activists who call for such an enquiry or criticize what happened , even in emails and on web sites , are still being imprisoned to this day , " it said in a statement .
amnesty stated that it had " cautioned the eu to consider what message it will be sending to human rights activists in china , who are still being imprisoned 15 years after tiananmen square , if it lifts the eu arms embargo against china . "
leaders swap platitudes european commission president romano prodi met with chinese leaders in beijing on wednesday in another show of the burgeoning relationship between the eu and the people 's republic .
" china is now our second largest trading partner , " prodi said in his speech .
" on present trends , the eu will very soon occupy a similar place in china 's own trading hierarchy .
not much longer after that , it will probably be china 's first partner . "
prodi added that eu-china relations had never been so good .

the european union is expected to make a huge step in its relationship with china this month by ending a 15-year arms embargo .
but human rights group amnesty international has condemned the proposal . the european union has angered human rights organizations by revealing that a 15-year arms embargo with china could be lifted soon .
officials in brussels announced on wednesday that eu governments had discussed an end to the ban several times in recent months and were due to make a final decision on april 26 , according to a statement from eu spokeswoman emma udwin .
eu foreign ministers are due to meet in ireland next weekend , and will hold talks with their chinese counterpart , li zhaoxing , as part of an eu-asia meeting within the proceedings .
irish officials commenting on behalf of the current eu presidency have made it clear that while the arms embargo is not on the official agenda , the ministers from the european union and china will cover " international and regional issues of common concern . "
germany and france promote plan the driving force behind the proposed scrapping of the embargo comes from european powerhouses germany and france .
if the arms ban were to be lifted , it would open up a whole new defense market , particularly for germany with its stealth submarines and france with its mirage fighter jets - two pieces of military hardware much coveted by the chinese defense department .
however , germany and france may face opposition from denmark , sweden and the netherlands , and the eu as a whole faces pressure from the united states , which firmly opposes the lifting .
despite their expected opposition , other eu nations are itching to get involved in what could be a very lucrative market , with defense suppliers keen to supply the fast modernizing chinese military .
however , human rights organization amnesty international reacted to the proposed dropping of arms restrictions by warning the european union to consider the message it was sending to imprisoned human rights activists in china if it lifted the embargo .
embargo began after tiananmen square bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : student demonstrations , tiananmen square , 1989 .
lifting the embargo imposed in 1989 after the tiananmen square killings would be the " wrong message " if there was no " clear and concrete progress in return " on human rights , amnesty spokesman dick oosting told reporters .
amnesty is reiterating its call for an independent inquiry into the events of 1989 when china sent in tanks to break up pro-democracy protests in tiananmen square in central beijing , killing hundreds .
" activists who call for such an enquiry or criticize what happened , even in emails and on web sites , are still being imprisoned to this day , " it said in a statement .
amnesty stated that it had " cautioned the eu to consider what message it will be sending to human rights activists in china , who are still being imprisoned 15 years after tiananmen square , if it lifts the eu arms embargo against china . "
leaders swap platitudes european commission president romano prodi met with chinese leaders in beijing on wednesday in another show of the burgeoning relationship between the eu and the people 's republic .
" china is now our second largest trading partner , " prodi said in his speech .
" on present trends , the eu will very soon occupy a similar place in china 's own trading hierarchy .
not much longer after that , it will probably be china 's first partner . "
prodi added that eu-china relations had never been so good .
he did , however , also mention that more work could be done of the human rights issue in china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese president hu jintao -lrb- photo -rrb- responded in kind by telling the commission president that china is ready to strengthen consultation and coordination with the eu on important international and regional issues .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.04.2004 europe outraged by alleged bin laden tape großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new tape thought to be from osama bin laden surfaced this week .
eu leaders on thursday dismissed the offer of a " truce " from terrorist leader osama bin laden , who said his terror network al qaeda might spare europe from attacks . the european union and national governments across europe responded with outrage to an alleged audio tape from terrorist osama bin laden broadcast on thursday by the arab news networks al arabiya and al-jazeera .
in the taped message , bin laden offers to call a truce with europe if it removes troops from the middle east .
" i announce a truce with the european countries that do not attack muslim countries , " the purported bin laden says in the tape .
in a reference to the recent terrorist attacks in madrid and earlier ones in new york and washington , the speaker said : " what happened on sept .
11 and march 11 was your goods delivered back to you . "
political leaders throughout europe agreed that the best response to bin laden 's truce offer would be to ignore it while continuing to ferret out and stop terrorists all over the world .
britain , which said it could not confirm the veracity of the tape , said it nonetheless took the message seriously .
london , however , did n't appear moved by bin laden 's message .
" we ca n't negotiation with al qaeda , " a statement released by the foreign office said .
" their attacks are against the very idea of coexistence .
the right response is to continue to confront terrorism , not give in to its demands . "
the british government accused bin laden of pursuing a " cynical strategy " of trying to divide europe and the united states .
in rome , italian foreign minister franco frattini said " it 's unthinkable that we may open negotiations with bin laden , everybody understands this . "
a spokesman for the german government , meanwhile , said " there can be no discussions with terrorists and criminals like osama bin laden . "
though germany strictly opposed the war in iraq , it has several thousand peacekeeping troops in afghanistan and is currently training civilian police officers in iraq .
and spain 's designated foreign minister , miguel angel moratinos , said bin laden 's message , in which the man speaking justified the march 11 attacks , should be ignored completely .
" those of us who seek peace , democracy and freedom do not need to listen or pay attention to him , " he said .
around 200 people died in madrid after bombs detonated on local commuter trains .
on a trip to china , european commission president romano prodi scoffed at the apparent bin laden message .
" how could you possibly react to this statement ?
there is no possibility for a deal under a terrorist threat .
it is completely impossible , " he told reporters .
cia to review tape officials at the u.s. central intelligence agency said thursday they would review the tape to determine its authenticity .
in the message , which runs just over seven minutes long , the purported bin laden said " the truce will begin when the last soldier leaves our countries . "
the man also states that recent polls have shown that the majority of europeans want to reconcile with the islamic world and calls on european governments to respond to the offer within three months .
the alleged bin laden also pledges retaliation for the recent murder of hamas leader sheik ahmed yassin by the israeli army .
" we vow before god to take revenge for him from america for this , god willing , " the man said .
the israeli armed forces assassinated the founder of the radical palestinian group during a targeted mission on march 22 .
the tape also sharply criticizes washington 's middle east policy , saying it ignores the " real problem , " the " occupation of all of palestine . "
it further lambastes the u.s. for creating a business out of the war in iraq that is generating " billions " for american companies through weapons and reconstruction contracts . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope calls on masses to fight terror in his annual easter mass , pope john paul ii , the head of the catholic church , asked believers to unite and find the courage and strength to fight the " inhuman " and growing terrorism trend .

political leaders throughout europe agreed that the best response to bin laden 's truce offer would be to ignore it while continuing to ferret out and stop terrorists all over the world .
britain , which said it could not confirm the veracity of the tape , said it nonetheless took the message seriously .
london , however , did n't appear moved by bin laden 's message .
" we ca n't negotiation with al qaeda , " a statement released by the foreign office said .
" their attacks are against the very idea of coexistence .
the right response is to continue to confront terrorism , not give in to its demands . "
the british government accused bin laden of pursuing a " cynical strategy " of trying to divide europe and the united states .
in rome , italian foreign minister franco frattini said " it 's unthinkable that we may open negotiations with bin laden , everybody understands this . "
a spokesman for the german government , meanwhile , said " there can be no discussions with terrorists and criminals like osama bin laden . "
though germany strictly opposed the war in iraq , it has several thousand peacekeeping troops in afghanistan and is currently training civilian police officers in iraq .
and spain 's designated foreign minister , miguel angel moratinos , said bin laden 's message , in which the man speaking justified the march 11 attacks , should be ignored completely .
" those of us who seek peace , democracy and freedom do not need to listen or pay attention to him , " he said .
around 200 people died in madrid after bombs detonated on local commuter trains .
on a trip to china , european commission president romano prodi scoffed at the apparent bin laden message .
" how could you possibly react to this statement ?
there is no possibility for a deal under a terrorist threat .
it is completely impossible , " he told reporters .
cia to review tape officials at the u.s. central intelligence agency said thursday they would review the tape to determine its authenticity .
in the message , which runs just over seven minutes long , the purported bin laden said " the truce will begin when the last soldier leaves our countries . "
the man also states that recent polls have shown that the majority of europeans want to reconcile with the islamic world and calls on european governments to respond to the offer within three months .
the alleged bin laden also pledges retaliation for the recent murder of hamas leader sheik ahmed yassin by the israeli army .
" we vow before god to take revenge for him from america for this , god willing , " the man said .
the israeli armed forces assassinated the founder of the radical palestinian group during a targeted mission on march 22 .
the tape also sharply criticizes washington 's middle east policy , saying it ignores the " real problem , " the " occupation of all of palestine . "
it further lambastes the u.s. for creating a business out of the war in iraq that is generating " billions " for american companies through weapons and reconstruction contracts . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope calls on masses to fight terror in his annual easter mass , pope john paul ii , the head of the catholic church , asked believers to unite and find the courage and strength to fight the " inhuman " and growing terrorism trend .

eu leaders on thursday dismissed the offer of a " truce " from terrorist leader osama bin laden , who said his terror network al qaeda might spare europe from attacks . the european union and national governments across europe responded with outrage to an alleged audio tape from terrorist osama bin laden broadcast on thursday by the arab news networks al arabiya and al-jazeera .
in the taped message , bin laden offers to call a truce with europe if it removes troops from the middle east .

from the posters , it is obvious that the film is the same : myers in full cat makeup and a large top hat gives it away .

bruce lee , the star of the cult seventies martial arts classic , does indeed prove that his hands are lethal weapons , but there is no actual claw in sight . similarly , the seminal spaghetti western " once upon a time in the west " contains a haunting melody played by charles bronson 's harmonica man , but that hardly justifies naming the film " spiel mir das lied vom tod " -lrb- play me the song of death -rrb- . rebel without a clue ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes the titles have been changed to such an extent that only the extremely knowledgeable would be able to identify the film without seeing the accompanying poster .

the european union is expected to make a huge step in its relationship with china this month by ending a 15-year arms embargo .
but human rights group amnesty international has condemned the proposal . the european union has angered human rights organizations by revealing that a 15-year arms embargo with china could be lifted soon .
officials in brussels announced on wednesday that eu governments had discussed an end to the ban several times in recent months and were due to make a final decision on april 26 , according to a statement from eu spokeswoman emma udwin .
eu foreign ministers are due to meet in ireland next weekend , and will hold talks with their chinese counterpart , li zhaoxing , as part of an eu-asia meeting within the proceedings .
irish officials commenting on behalf of the current eu presidency have made it clear that while the arms embargo is not on the official agenda , the ministers from the european union and china will cover " international and regional issues of common concern . "
germany and france promote plan the driving force behind the proposed scrapping of the embargo comes from european powerhouses germany and france .
if the arms ban were to be lifted , it would open up a whole new defense market , particularly for germany with its stealth submarines and france with its mirage fighter jets - two pieces of military hardware much coveted by the chinese defense department .
however , germany and france may face opposition from denmark , sweden and the netherlands , and the eu as a whole faces pressure from the united states , which firmly opposes the lifting .
despite their expected opposition , other eu nations are itching to get involved in what could be a very lucrative market , with defense suppliers keen to supply the fast modernizing chinese military .
however , human rights organization amnesty international reacted to the proposed dropping of arms restrictions by warning the european union to consider the message it was sending to imprisoned human rights activists in china if it lifted the embargo .
embargo began after tiananmen square bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : student demonstrations , tiananmen square , 1989 .
lifting the embargo imposed in 1989 after the tiananmen square killings would be the " wrong message " if there was no " clear and concrete progress in return " on human rights , amnesty spokesman dick oosting told reporters .
amnesty is reiterating its call for an independent inquiry into the events of 1989 when china sent in tanks to break up pro-democracy protests in tiananmen square in central beijing , killing hundreds .
" activists who call for such an enquiry or criticize what happened , even in emails and on web sites , are still being imprisoned to this day , " it said in a statement .
amnesty stated that it had " cautioned the eu to consider what message it will be sending to human rights activists in china , who are still being imprisoned 15 years after tiananmen square , if it lifts the eu arms embargo against china . "
leaders swap platitudes european commission president romano prodi met with chinese leaders in beijing on wednesday in another show of the burgeoning relationship between the eu and the people 's republic .
" china is now our second largest trading partner , " prodi said in his speech .
" on present trends , the eu will very soon occupy a similar place in china 's own trading hierarchy .
not much longer after that , it will probably be china 's first partner . "
prodi added that eu-china relations had never been so good .
he did , however , also mention that more work could be done of the human rights issue in china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese president hu jintao -lrb- photo -rrb- responded in kind by telling the commission president that china is ready to strengthen consultation and coordination with the eu on important international and regional issues .
china is willing to expand mutually beneficial cooperation between itself and the eu , hu said , adding that the two sides should join hands to contribute to world peace , stability and development .
the chinese leader said that his country supported the enlargement and integration of the eu and hoped the bloc would play a bigger role in international affairs . the european union and china set up a strategic partnership last year , an important decision that set a clear direction for the development of relations between them in the new century . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de france and china cozy up chinese president hu jintao is in france this week on a state visit .

the european union is expected to make a huge step in its relationship with china this month by ending a 15-year arms embargo .
but human rights group amnesty international has condemned the proposal . the european union has angered human rights organizations by revealing that a 15-year arms embargo with china could be lifted soon .
officials in brussels announced on wednesday that eu governments had discussed an end to the ban several times in recent months and were due to make a final decision on april 26 , according to a statement from eu spokeswoman emma udwin .
eu foreign ministers are due to meet in ireland next weekend , and will hold talks with their chinese counterpart , li zhaoxing , as part of an eu-asia meeting within the proceedings .
irish officials commenting on behalf of the current eu presidency have made it clear that while the arms embargo is not on the official agenda , the ministers from the european union and china will cover " international and regional issues of common concern . "
germany and france promote plan the driving force behind the proposed scrapping of the embargo comes from european powerhouses germany and france .
if the arms ban were to be lifted , it would open up a whole new defense market , particularly for germany with its stealth submarines and france with its mirage fighter jets - two pieces of military hardware much coveted by the chinese defense department .
however , germany and france may face opposition from denmark , sweden and the netherlands , and the eu as a whole faces pressure from the united states , which firmly opposes the lifting .
despite their expected opposition , other eu nations are itching to get involved in what could be a very lucrative market , with defense suppliers keen to supply the fast modernizing chinese military .
however , human rights organization amnesty international reacted to the proposed dropping of arms restrictions by warning the european union to consider the message it was sending to imprisoned human rights activists in china if it lifted the embargo .
embargo began after tiananmen square bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : student demonstrations , tiananmen square , 1989 .
lifting the embargo imposed in 1989 after the tiananmen square killings would be the " wrong message " if there was no " clear and concrete progress in return " on human rights , amnesty spokesman dick oosting told reporters .
amnesty is reiterating its call for an independent inquiry into the events of 1989 when china sent in tanks to break up pro-democracy protests in tiananmen square in central beijing , killing hundreds .
" activists who call for such an enquiry or criticize what happened , even in emails and on web sites , are still being imprisoned to this day , " it said in a statement .
amnesty stated that it had " cautioned the eu to consider what message it will be sending to human rights activists in china , who are still being imprisoned 15 years after tiananmen square , if it lifts the eu arms embargo against china . "
leaders swap platitudes european commission president romano prodi met with chinese leaders in beijing on wednesday in another show of the burgeoning relationship between the eu and the people 's republic .
" china is now our second largest trading partner , " prodi said in his speech .
" on present trends , the eu will very soon occupy a similar place in china 's own trading hierarchy .
not much longer after that , it will probably be china 's first partner . "
prodi added that eu-china relations had never been so good .
he did , however , also mention that more work could be done of the human rights issue in china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese president hu jintao -lrb- photo -rrb- responded in kind by telling the commission president that china is ready to strengthen consultation and coordination with the eu on important international and regional issues .
china is willing to expand mutually beneficial cooperation between itself and the eu , hu said , adding that the two sides should join hands to contribute to world peace , stability and development .
the chinese leader said that his country supported the enlargement and integration of the eu and hoped the bloc would play a bigger role in international affairs . the european union and china set up a strategic partnership last year , an important decision that set a clear direction for the development of relations between them in the new century . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de france and china cozy up chinese president hu jintao is in france this week on a state visit .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.04.2004 eu proposes end to china arms embargo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the modern chinese military could soon be benefiting from european arms exports .
the european union is expected to make a huge step in its relationship with china this month by ending a 15-year arms embargo .
but human rights group amnesty international has condemned the proposal . the european union has angered human rights organizations by revealing that a 15-year arms embargo with china could be lifted soon .
officials in brussels announced on wednesday that eu governments had discussed an end to the ban several times in recent months and were due to make a final decision on april 26 , according to a statement from eu spokeswoman emma udwin .
eu foreign ministers are due to meet in ireland next weekend , and will hold talks with their chinese counterpart , li zhaoxing , as part of an eu-asia meeting within the proceedings .
irish officials commenting on behalf of the current eu presidency have made it clear that while the arms embargo is not on the official agenda , the ministers from the european union and china will cover " international and regional issues of common concern . "
germany and france promote plan the driving force behind the proposed scrapping of the embargo comes from european powerhouses germany and france .
if the arms ban were to be lifted , it would open up a whole new defense market , particularly for germany with its stealth submarines and france with its mirage fighter jets - two pieces of military hardware much coveted by the chinese defense department .
however , germany and france may face opposition from denmark , sweden and the netherlands , and the eu as a whole faces pressure from the united states , which firmly opposes the lifting .
despite their expected opposition , other eu nations are itching to get involved in what could be a very lucrative market , with defense suppliers keen to supply the fast modernizing chinese military .
however , human rights organization amnesty international reacted to the proposed dropping of arms restrictions by warning the european union to consider the message it was sending to imprisoned human rights activists in china if it lifted the embargo .
embargo began after tiananmen square bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : student demonstrations , tiananmen square , 1989 .
lifting the embargo imposed in 1989 after the tiananmen square killings would be the " wrong message " if there was no " clear and concrete progress in return " on human rights , amnesty spokesman dick oosting told reporters .
amnesty is reiterating its call for an independent inquiry into the events of 1989 when china sent in tanks to break up pro-democracy protests in tiananmen square in central beijing , killing hundreds .
" activists who call for such an enquiry or criticize what happened , even in emails and on web sites , are still being imprisoned to this day , " it said in a statement .
amnesty stated that it had " cautioned the eu to consider what message it will be sending to human rights activists in china , who are still being imprisoned 15 years after tiananmen square , if it lifts the eu arms embargo against china . "
leaders swap platitudes european commission president romano prodi met with chinese leaders in beijing on wednesday in another show of the burgeoning relationship between the eu and the people 's republic .
" china is now our second largest trading partner , " prodi said in his speech .
" on present trends , the eu will very soon occupy a similar place in china 's own trading hierarchy .
not much longer after that , it will probably be china 's first partner . "
prodi added that eu-china relations had never been so good .
he did , however , also mention that more work could be done of the human rights issue in china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese president hu jintao -lrb- photo -rrb- responded in kind by telling the commission president that china is ready to strengthen consultation and coordination with the eu on important international and regional issues .
china is willing to expand mutually beneficial cooperation between itself and the eu , hu said , adding that the two sides should join hands to contribute to world peace , stability and development .
the chinese leader said that his country supported the enlargement and integration of the eu and hoped the bloc would play a bigger role in international affairs . the european union and china set up a strategic partnership last year , an important decision that set a clear direction for the development of relations between them in the new century . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de france and china cozy up chinese president hu jintao is in france this week on a state visit .

the european union is expected to make a huge step in its relationship with china this month by ending a 15-year arms embargo .
but human rights group amnesty international has condemned the proposal . the european union has angered human rights organizations by revealing that a 15-year arms embargo with china could be lifted soon .
officials in brussels announced on wednesday that eu governments had discussed an end to the ban several times in recent months and were due to make a final decision on april 26 , according to a statement from eu spokeswoman emma udwin .
eu foreign ministers are due to meet in ireland next weekend , and will hold talks with their chinese counterpart , li zhaoxing , as part of an eu-asia meeting within the proceedings .
irish officials commenting on behalf of the current eu presidency have made it clear that while the arms embargo is not on the official agenda , the ministers from the european union and china will cover " international and regional issues of common concern . "
germany and france promote plan the driving force behind the proposed scrapping of the embargo comes from european powerhouses germany and france .
if the arms ban were to be lifted , it would open up a whole new defense market , particularly for germany with its stealth submarines and france with its mirage fighter jets - two pieces of military hardware much coveted by the chinese defense department .
however , germany and france may face opposition from denmark , sweden and the netherlands , and the eu as a whole faces pressure from the united states , which firmly opposes the lifting .
despite their expected opposition , other eu nations are itching to get involved in what could be a very lucrative market , with defense suppliers keen to supply the fast modernizing chinese military .
however , human rights organization amnesty international reacted to the proposed dropping of arms restrictions by warning the european union to consider the message it was sending to imprisoned human rights activists in china if it lifted the embargo .
embargo began after tiananmen square bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : student demonstrations , tiananmen square , 1989 .
lifting the embargo imposed in 1989 after the tiananmen square killings would be the " wrong message " if there was no " clear and concrete progress in return " on human rights , amnesty spokesman dick oosting told reporters .
amnesty is reiterating its call for an independent inquiry into the events of 1989 when china sent in tanks to break up pro-democracy protests in tiananmen square in central beijing , killing hundreds .
" activists who call for such an enquiry or criticize what happened , even in emails and on web sites , are still being imprisoned to this day , " it said in a statement .
amnesty stated that it had " cautioned the eu to consider what message it will be sending to human rights activists in china , who are still being imprisoned 15 years after tiananmen square , if it lifts the eu arms embargo against china . "
leaders swap platitudes european commission president romano prodi met with chinese leaders in beijing on wednesday in another show of the burgeoning relationship between the eu and the people 's republic .
" china is now our second largest trading partner , " prodi said in his speech .
" on present trends , the eu will very soon occupy a similar place in china 's own trading hierarchy .
not much longer after that , it will probably be china 's first partner . "
prodi added that eu-china relations had never been so good .
he did , however , also mention that more work could be done of the human rights issue in china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese president hu jintao -lrb- photo -rrb- responded in kind by telling the commission president that china is ready to strengthen consultation and coordination with the eu on important international and regional issues .

the eu and the german government warned that both israelis and palestinians must agree to any border changes . european union leaders responded cautiously to u.s. president george w. bush 's announcement that israel could keep arab land it captured in 1967 .
they made clear that they would not accept a unilateral change to middle east borders . " the european union will not recognize any change to the pre-1967 borders other than those arrived at by agreement between the parties , " irish foreign minister brian cowen , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , said in a statement on wednesday , quoting the stance the eu has repeatedly taken . cowen also pointed out that the road map meant to chart the course to a middle east peace plan required that a final agreement ending the israeli-palestinian conflict must also resolve the refugee issue . eu will discuss proposals the so-called middle east quartet , which is made up of the eu , russia and the united nations , along with the united states , will examine the plan agreed on by president bush and israeli prime minister ariel sharon , javier solana , the eu 's top diplomat , said wednesday .

bush said that " new realities on the ground " should be reflected in a final settlement .
he added that any palestinian refugees who wished to return to their former homes should be accommodated in palestinian territory . " of course , bush did n't say anything particularly surprising , " deutsche welle correspondent peter philip commented .
" nobody seriously expected that history would be turned back to june 5 , 1967 or even further back .

they made clear that they would not accept a unilateral change to middle east borders . " the european union will not recognize any change to the pre-1967 borders other than those arrived at by agreement between the parties , " irish foreign minister brian cowen , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , said in a statement on wednesday , quoting the stance the eu has repeatedly taken . cowen also pointed out that the road map meant to chart the course to a middle east peace plan required that a final agreement ending the israeli-palestinian conflict must also resolve the refugee issue . eu will discuss proposals the so-called middle east quartet , which is made up of the eu , russia and the united nations , along with the united states , will examine the plan agreed on by president bush and israeli prime minister ariel sharon , javier solana , the eu 's top diplomat , said wednesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.04.2004 europe outraged by alleged bin laden tape großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new tape thought to be from osama bin laden surfaced this week .
eu leaders on thursday dismissed the offer of a " truce " from terrorist leader osama bin laden , who said his terror network al qaeda might spare europe from attacks . the european union and national governments across europe responded with outrage to an alleged audio tape from terrorist osama bin laden broadcast on thursday by the arab news networks al arabiya and al-jazeera .
in the taped message , bin laden offers to call a truce with europe if it removes troops from the middle east .
" i announce a truce with the european countries that do not attack muslim countries , " the purported bin laden says in the tape .
in a reference to the recent terrorist attacks in madrid and earlier ones in new york and washington , the speaker said : " what happened on sept .
11 and march 11 was your goods delivered back to you . "
political leaders throughout europe agreed that the best response to bin laden 's truce offer would be to ignore it while continuing to ferret out and stop terrorists all over the world .
britain , which said it could not confirm the veracity of the tape , said it nonetheless took the message seriously .
london , however , did n't appear moved by bin laden 's message .
" we ca n't negotiation with al qaeda , " a statement released by the foreign office said .
" their attacks are against the very idea of coexistence .
the right response is to continue to confront terrorism , not give in to its demands . "
the british government accused bin laden of pursuing a " cynical strategy " of trying to divide europe and the united states .
in rome , italian foreign minister franco frattini said " it 's unthinkable that we may open negotiations with bin laden , everybody understands this . "
a spokesman for the german government , meanwhile , said " there can be no discussions with terrorists and criminals like osama bin laden . "
though germany strictly opposed the war in iraq , it has several thousand peacekeeping troops in afghanistan and is currently training civilian police officers in iraq .
and spain 's designated foreign minister , miguel angel moratinos , said bin laden 's message , in which the man speaking justified the march 11 attacks , should be ignored completely .
" those of us who seek peace , democracy and freedom do not need to listen or pay attention to him , " he said .
around 200 people died in madrid after bombs detonated on local commuter trains .
on a trip to china , european commission president romano prodi scoffed at the apparent bin laden message .
" how could you possibly react to this statement ?
there is no possibility for a deal under a terrorist threat .
it is completely impossible , " he told reporters .
cia to review tape officials at the u.s. central intelligence agency said thursday they would review the tape to determine its authenticity .

eu leaders on thursday dismissed the offer of a " truce " from terrorist leader osama bin laden , who said his terror network al qaeda might spare europe from attacks . the european union and national governments across europe responded with outrage to an alleged audio tape from terrorist osama bin laden broadcast on thursday by the arab news networks al arabiya and al-jazeera .
in the taped message , bin laden offers to call a truce with europe if it removes troops from the middle east .
" i announce a truce with the european countries that do not attack muslim countries , " the purported bin laden says in the tape .
in a reference to the recent terrorist attacks in madrid and earlier ones in new york and washington , the speaker said : " what happened on sept .
11 and march 11 was your goods delivered back to you . "
political leaders throughout europe agreed that the best response to bin laden 's truce offer would be to ignore it while continuing to ferret out and stop terrorists all over the world .
britain , which said it could not confirm the veracity of the tape , said it nonetheless took the message seriously .
london , however , did n't appear moved by bin laden 's message .
" we ca n't negotiation with al qaeda , " a statement released by the foreign office said .
" their attacks are against the very idea of coexistence .
the right response is to continue to confront terrorism , not give in to its demands . "
the british government accused bin laden of pursuing a " cynical strategy " of trying to divide europe and the united states .
in rome , italian foreign minister franco frattini said " it 's unthinkable that we may open negotiations with bin laden , everybody understands this . "
a spokesman for the german government , meanwhile , said " there can be no discussions with terrorists and criminals like osama bin laden . "
though germany strictly opposed the war in iraq , it has several thousand peacekeeping troops in afghanistan and is currently training civilian police officers in iraq .
and spain 's designated foreign minister , miguel angel moratinos , said bin laden 's message , in which the man speaking justified the march 11 attacks , should be ignored completely .
" those of us who seek peace , democracy and freedom do not need to listen or pay attention to him , " he said .
around 200 people died in madrid after bombs detonated on local commuter trains .
on a trip to china , european commission president romano prodi scoffed at the apparent bin laden message .
" how could you possibly react to this statement ?
there is no possibility for a deal under a terrorist threat .
it is completely impossible , " he told reporters .
cia to review tape officials at the u.s. central intelligence agency said thursday they would review the tape to determine its authenticity .

the killing of an italian hostage by iraqi militants thursday and two german security workers last week has heightened security fears for europeans and other foreigners working in iraq . the crumbling security conditions in iraq took a turn for the worse on thursday after officials in rome confirmed the execution of an italian hostage by iraqi militants .
it 's the first known killing of the some 22 foreigners being held captive by insurgents in iraq . the victim , identified as fabrizio quattrocchi , was among a group of four italian security guards seized by a previously unknown iraqi group , the green battalion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian troops in iraq the group , which demanded a withdrawal of u.s. troops from iraq , an apology by italian prime minister silvio berlusconi and the release of iraqi religious clerics , released a video of the execution .
qatar-based arabic television channel al-jazeera said it had the video , but that its contents were too graphic to broadcast . italy is the third-largest coalition partner in the occupation force , with 3,000 soldiers on the ground in iraq .
italian prime minister premier silvio berlusconi , who has ruled out pulling out italian troops from iraq , said , " they have cut short a life .
they have not damaged our values and our commitment to peace . " french journalist freed another french television journalist , alexandre jordanov , 40 , was released unharmed at a mosque on wednesday after a four-day hostage ordeal . jordanov , who works for capa television in paris , was kidnapped sunday while videotaping a u.s.military convoy under attack .
jordanov said his abductors switched his location eight times , passing him from one armed group to another .
" it was : ' we 're going to cut your throat ' to ' you 're part of the mossad , " ' jordanov said , referring to the israeli secret service . opposition accuses berlin of irresponsibility the volatile situation in iraq also dominated debate in berlin on thursday as the conservative opposition accused the german government of acting irresponsibly for using a dangerous roadway passage through iraq 's most dangerous territory to exchange security personnel .
last week , two germans were killed as the diplomatic convoy they were traveling with was ambushed . wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of the christian democrat union 's parliamentary group , told the kölner stadt-anzeiger newspaper he wanted to know why a land route had been selected for the two slain germans belonging to the elite gsg-9 unit , and whether there had been alternatives . another cdu member of parliament , michael fuchs told daily bild that such an assignment was undoubtedly a job for the military , and added that it was a " suicide mission " to send two men on such a deployment . security convoy attacked by iraqis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the missing germans the two germans , both part of the elite gsg-9 unit of germany 's federal border guard assigned to protect the german embassy in baghdad , went missing a week ago after their security convoy was attacked by iraqi insurgents as it traveled through iraq on its way from amman , jordan .
the security convoy was accompanying a group of german diplomats and members of the german federal intelligence agency . the two germans , tobias ritrath , 25 , and thomas haffenker , 38 , are believed to have been killed by the insurgents and were , according to eyewitness reports , buried by some iraqis close to the place of attack . no alternative to land route but the german government on thursday said there was no alternative to the land route to jordan . rainer lingenthal , an interior ministry spokesman , said the selected land route from the jordanian capital of amman to baghdad had been used about 25 times in the past without incident and that the exchange had been conducted using reliable security information . a german foreign ministry spokeswoman said using american air capabilities for german embassy personnel was out of question , because it was the exclusive prerogative of the coalition forces .
however , she said the inability of german diplomats to travel by air was not viewed by berlin as punishment for germany 's opposition to the war .
additionally , she said , german security personnel are also not allowed to carry weapons , she explained . lingenthal also announced that german interior minister otto schily had already initiated an investigation of the attacks and said the results would be presented to the german parliament 's domestic affairs committee . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de missing germans believed dead the latest violence in iraq is thought to have claimed the lives of two germans , the foreign ministry said .

the european union is expected to make a huge step in its relationship with china this month by ending a 15-year arms embargo .
but human rights group amnesty international has condemned the proposal . the european union has angered human rights organizations by revealing that a 15-year arms embargo with china could be lifted soon .
officials in brussels announced on wednesday that eu governments had discussed an end to the ban several times in recent months and were due to make a final decision on april 26 , according to a statement from eu spokeswoman emma udwin .
eu foreign ministers are due to meet in ireland next weekend , and will hold talks with their chinese counterpart , li zhaoxing , as part of an eu-asia meeting within the proceedings .
irish officials commenting on behalf of the current eu presidency have made it clear that while the arms embargo is not on the official agenda , the ministers from the european union and china will cover " international and regional issues of common concern . "
germany and france promote plan the driving force behind the proposed scrapping of the embargo comes from european powerhouses germany and france .
if the arms ban were to be lifted , it would open up a whole new defense market , particularly for germany with its stealth submarines and france with its mirage fighter jets - two pieces of military hardware much coveted by the chinese defense department .
however , germany and france may face opposition from denmark , sweden and the netherlands , and the eu as a whole faces pressure from the united states , which firmly opposes the lifting .
despite their expected opposition , other eu nations are itching to get involved in what could be a very lucrative market , with defense suppliers keen to supply the fast modernizing chinese military .
however , human rights organization amnesty international reacted to the proposed dropping of arms restrictions by warning the european union to consider the message it was sending to imprisoned human rights activists in china if it lifted the embargo .
embargo began after tiananmen square bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : student demonstrations , tiananmen square , 1989 .
lifting the embargo imposed in 1989 after the tiananmen square killings would be the " wrong message " if there was no " clear and concrete progress in return " on human rights , amnesty spokesman dick oosting told reporters .
amnesty is reiterating its call for an independent inquiry into the events of 1989 when china sent in tanks to break up pro-democracy protests in tiananmen square in central beijing , killing hundreds .
" activists who call for such an enquiry or criticize what happened , even in emails and on web sites , are still being imprisoned to this day , " it said in a statement .
amnesty stated that it had " cautioned the eu to consider what message it will be sending to human rights activists in china , who are still being imprisoned 15 years after tiananmen square , if it lifts the eu arms embargo against china . "
leaders swap platitudes european commission president romano prodi met with chinese leaders in beijing on wednesday in another show of the burgeoning relationship between the eu and the people 's republic .
" china is now our second largest trading partner , " prodi said in his speech .
" on present trends , the eu will very soon occupy a similar place in china 's own trading hierarchy .
not much longer after that , it will probably be china 's first partner . "
prodi added that eu-china relations had never been so good .
he did , however , also mention that more work could be done of the human rights issue in china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese president hu jintao -lrb- photo -rrb- responded in kind by telling the commission president that china is ready to strengthen consultation and coordination with the eu on important international and regional issues .
china is willing to expand mutually beneficial cooperation between itself and the eu , hu said , adding that the two sides should join hands to contribute to world peace , stability and development .
the chinese leader said that his country supported the enlargement and integration of the eu and hoped the bloc would play a bigger role in international affairs . the european union and china set up a strategic partnership last year , an important decision that set a clear direction for the development of relations between them in the new century . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de france and china cozy up chinese president hu jintao is in france this week on a state visit .

eu leaders on thursday dismissed the offer of a " truce " from terrorist leader osama bin laden , who said his terror network al qaeda might spare europe from attacks . the european union and national governments across europe responded with outrage to an alleged audio tape from terrorist osama bin laden broadcast on thursday by the arab news networks al arabiya and al-jazeera .
in the taped message , bin laden offers to call a truce with europe if it removes troops from the middle east .
" i announce a truce with the european countries that do not attack muslim countries , " the purported bin laden says in the tape .
in a reference to the recent terrorist attacks in madrid and earlier ones in new york and washington , the speaker said : " what happened on sept .
11 and march 11 was your goods delivered back to you . "
political leaders throughout europe agreed that the best response to bin laden 's truce offer would be to ignore it while continuing to ferret out and stop terrorists all over the world .
britain , which said it could not confirm the veracity of the tape , said it nonetheless took the message seriously .
london , however , did n't appear moved by bin laden 's message .
" we ca n't negotiation with al qaeda , " a statement released by the foreign office said .
" their attacks are against the very idea of coexistence .
the right response is to continue to confront terrorism , not give in to its demands . "
the british government accused bin laden of pursuing a " cynical strategy " of trying to divide europe and the united states .
in rome , italian foreign minister franco frattini said " it 's unthinkable that we may open negotiations with bin laden , everybody understands this . "
a spokesman for the german government , meanwhile , said " there can be no discussions with terrorists and criminals like osama bin laden . "
though germany strictly opposed the war in iraq , it has several thousand peacekeeping troops in afghanistan and is currently training civilian police officers in iraq .
and spain 's designated foreign minister , miguel angel moratinos , said bin laden 's message , in which the man speaking justified the march 11 attacks , should be ignored completely .
" those of us who seek peace , democracy and freedom do not need to listen or pay attention to him , " he said .
around 200 people died in madrid after bombs detonated on local commuter trains .
on a trip to china , european commission president romano prodi scoffed at the apparent bin laden message .
" how could you possibly react to this statement ?
there is no possibility for a deal under a terrorist threat .
it is completely impossible , " he told reporters .
cia to review tape officials at the u.s. central intelligence agency said thursday they would review the tape to determine its authenticity .
in the message , which runs just over seven minutes long , the purported bin laden said " the truce will begin when the last soldier leaves our countries . "
the man also states that recent polls have shown that the majority of europeans want to reconcile with the islamic world and calls on european governments to respond to the offer within three months .
the alleged bin laden also pledges retaliation for the recent murder of hamas leader sheik ahmed yassin by the israeli army .
" we vow before god to take revenge for him from america for this , god willing , " the man said .

iraqi militants executed one of four italian hostages , officials in rome confirmed early thursday .
it 's the first known killing of any of the 22 foreigners being held in iraq . the execution could further heighten fears among international aid workers , contractors and journalists , some of whom are already restricting their activities in iraq . earlier wednesday , a french journalist was freed after a four-day hostage ordeal and russia announced it would evacuate its citizens .
reports said two more japanese freelance journalists were kidnapped outside baghdad . the militants who killed the italian hostage demanded the withdrawal of u.s. forces from iraq and threatened to kill the three other hostages , al-jazeera reported . the qatar-based tv network reported that it had video of the killing but said it was too graphic to broadcast .
al-jazeera did show footage of four italian security guards sitting on the ground , holding up their passports and surrounded by armed men . the four italian security guards were abducted monday .
the militants ' videotape was accompanied by a statement from a previously unknown group , the green battalion .
it said it would " kill the three remaining italian hostages one after the other , if their demands are not met , " al-jazeera said . the group demanded the withdrawal of u.s. forces from iraq , an apology from italian leader silvio berlusconi and the release of religious clerics held in iraq . berlusconi unshakeable on withdrawing troops the italian ambassador to qatar watched the video and confirmed the man killed was fabrizio quattrocchi , one of the kidnapped italians , italian foreign minister franco frattini said .
frattini said the government would do " what is possible and impossible " to free the remaining three . three of the italian captives were working for a u.s.-based company while a fourth was employed by a seychelles-based firm , frattini said .
he stressed that the four italian hostages were not members of italian intelligence , and that the abductors were " terrorists and killers " who were " out of control " , not members of any organized resistance . italian prime minister premier silvio berlusconi , who has ruled out pulling out italian troops from iraq , said , " they have cut short a life .
they have not damaged our values and our commitment to peace . " italy is the third-largest coalition partner in the occupation force .
italy did n't send in combat troops during the war .
its forces are based in the southern city of nasiriyah , working on reconstruction . in november of last year , italy suffered tragic losses when a suicide truck bomb attack in nasiriyah , a city in southern iraq , killed 19 italians , italy 's worst single military loss since world war ii . a u.s. spokesman said tuesday that 40 foreigners from 12 countries are being held by kidnappers but an associated press count put the number at 22 , with wednesday 's release of the french journalist and the death of the italian hostage . associated press send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german general : americans losing credibility in iraq with no end in sight to the recent escalation in violence between iraqi insurgents and coalition forces , deutsche welle spoke to german army gen. klaus reinhardt about the prospects for peace in iraq .

many english language films make it to the german screens with their original titles intact .
some , however , are subject to changes that leave many visitors and ex-pats scratching their heads . english speakers living in germany - even those proficient in the native tongue - often squint at the titles of movies advertised in the local press .
sometimes the english title of the film has been retained , making it easy for the ex-pat to identify the film .

from the posters , it is obvious that the film is the same : myers in full cat makeup and a large top hat gives it away .

the eu and the german government warned that both israelis and palestinians must agree to any border changes . european union leaders responded cautiously to u.s. president george w. bush 's announcement that israel could keep arab land it captured in 1967 .
they made clear that they would not accept a unilateral change to middle east borders . " the european union will not recognize any change to the pre-1967 borders other than those arrived at by agreement between the parties , " irish foreign minister brian cowen , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , said in a statement on wednesday , quoting the stance the eu has repeatedly taken . cowen also pointed out that the road map meant to chart the course to a middle east peace plan required that a final agreement ending the israeli-palestinian conflict must also resolve the refugee issue . eu will discuss proposals the so-called middle east quartet , which is made up of the eu , russia and the united nations , along with the united states , will examine the plan agreed on by president bush and israeli prime minister ariel sharon , javier solana , the eu 's top diplomat , said wednesday .
eu ministers will discuss the matter on friday at a meeting in tullamore , ireland , the irish foreign minister announced . cowen tried to put a positive shine on bush and sharon 's talks , despite the fact that the palestinians and some experts on the region say the u.s. policy change has dealt a deadly blow to the peace process .
cowen welcomed bush 's affirmation that the u.s. is committed to the road map and a two state solution . the german government 's statement echoed the eu 's .
germany praised the talks between bush and sharon , which it said got the peace process moving again , as well as israel 's plan to pull out of the gaza strip .
chancellor gerhard schröder will discuss the issues in the coming days in meetings planned with the egyptian president , the lebanese prime minister and the israeli president , government spokesman béla anda said in the statement .

but chancellor schröder 's fellow party member gernot erler , the social democrats ' foreign policy spokesman , called it an " affront to the eu , russia and the united nations " that the united states accepted israel 's settlement policies .
" bush 's policies deepen the rift between the united states and the arab world , " he told dw-tv . after talks with sharon in washington , bush said he endorsed the israeli leader 's plans to pull out of the gaza strip but keep land in the west bank indefinitely .
israeli forces occupied the areas in 1967 .
bush said that " new realities on the ground " should be reflected in a final settlement .
he added that any palestinian refugees who wished to return to their former homes should be accommodated in palestinian territory . " of course , bush did n't say anything particularly surprising , " deutsche welle correspondent peter philip commented .
" nobody seriously expected that history would be turned back to june 5 , 1967 or even further back .

the eu and the german government warned that both israelis and palestinians must agree to any border changes . european union leaders responded cautiously to u.s. president george w. bush 's announcement that israel could keep arab land it captured in 1967 .
they made clear that they would not accept a unilateral change to middle east borders . " the european union will not recognize any change to the pre-1967 borders other than those arrived at by agreement between the parties , " irish foreign minister brian cowen , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , said in a statement on wednesday , quoting the stance the eu has repeatedly taken . cowen also pointed out that the road map meant to chart the course to a middle east peace plan required that a final agreement ending the israeli-palestinian conflict must also resolve the refugee issue . eu will discuss proposals the so-called middle east quartet , which is made up of the eu , russia and the united nations , along with the united states , will examine the plan agreed on by president bush and israeli prime minister ariel sharon , javier solana , the eu 's top diplomat , said wednesday .
eu ministers will discuss the matter on friday at a meeting in tullamore , ireland , the irish foreign minister announced . cowen tried to put a positive shine on bush and sharon 's talks , despite the fact that the palestinians and some experts on the region say the u.s. policy change has dealt a deadly blow to the peace process .
cowen welcomed bush 's affirmation that the u.s. is committed to the road map and a two state solution . the german government 's statement echoed the eu 's .
germany praised the talks between bush and sharon , which it said got the peace process moving again , as well as israel 's plan to pull out of the gaza strip .

eu leaders on thursday dismissed the offer of a " truce " from terrorist leader osama bin laden , who said his terror network al qaeda might spare europe from attacks . the european union and national governments across europe responded with outrage to an alleged audio tape from terrorist osama bin laden broadcast on thursday by the arab news networks al arabiya and al-jazeera .
in the taped message , bin laden offers to call a truce with europe if it removes troops from the middle east .
" i announce a truce with the european countries that do not attack muslim countries , " the purported bin laden says in the tape .
in a reference to the recent terrorist attacks in madrid and earlier ones in new york and washington , the speaker said : " what happened on sept .
11 and march 11 was your goods delivered back to you . "
political leaders throughout europe agreed that the best response to bin laden 's truce offer would be to ignore it while continuing to ferret out and stop terrorists all over the world .
britain , which said it could not confirm the veracity of the tape , said it nonetheless took the message seriously .
london , however , did n't appear moved by bin laden 's message .
" we ca n't negotiation with al qaeda , " a statement released by the foreign office said .
" their attacks are against the very idea of coexistence .
the right response is to continue to confront terrorism , not give in to its demands . "
the british government accused bin laden of pursuing a " cynical strategy " of trying to divide europe and the united states .
in rome , italian foreign minister franco frattini said " it 's unthinkable that we may open negotiations with bin laden , everybody understands this . "
a spokesman for the german government , meanwhile , said " there can be no discussions with terrorists and criminals like osama bin laden . "
though germany strictly opposed the war in iraq , it has several thousand peacekeeping troops in afghanistan and is currently training civilian police officers in iraq .
and spain 's designated foreign minister , miguel angel moratinos , said bin laden 's message , in which the man speaking justified the march 11 attacks , should be ignored completely .
" those of us who seek peace , democracy and freedom do not need to listen or pay attention to him , " he said .
around 200 people died in madrid after bombs detonated on local commuter trains .
on a trip to china , european commission president romano prodi scoffed at the apparent bin laden message .
" how could you possibly react to this statement ?
there is no possibility for a deal under a terrorist threat .
it is completely impossible , " he told reporters .
cia to review tape officials at the u.s. central intelligence agency said thursday they would review the tape to determine its authenticity .
in the message , which runs just over seven minutes long , the purported bin laden said " the truce will begin when the last soldier leaves our countries . "
the man also states that recent polls have shown that the majority of europeans want to reconcile with the islamic world and calls on european governments to respond to the offer within three months .
the alleged bin laden also pledges retaliation for the recent murder of hamas leader sheik ahmed yassin by the israeli army .
" we vow before god to take revenge for him from america for this , god willing , " the man said .
the israeli armed forces assassinated the founder of the radical palestinian group during a targeted mission on march 22 .
the tape also sharply criticizes washington 's middle east policy , saying it ignores the " real problem , " the " occupation of all of palestine . "
it further lambastes the u.s. for creating a business out of the war in iraq that is generating " billions " for american companies through weapons and reconstruction contracts . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope calls on masses to fight terror in his annual easter mass , pope john paul ii , the head of the catholic church , asked believers to unite and find the courage and strength to fight the " inhuman " and growing terrorism trend .

eu leaders on thursday dismissed the offer of a " truce " from terrorist leader osama bin laden , who said his terror network al qaeda might spare europe from attacks . the european union and national governments across europe responded with outrage to an alleged audio tape from terrorist osama bin laden broadcast on thursday by the arab news networks al arabiya and al-jazeera .
in the taped message , bin laden offers to call a truce with europe if it removes troops from the middle east .
" i announce a truce with the european countries that do not attack muslim countries , " the purported bin laden says in the tape .
in a reference to the recent terrorist attacks in madrid and earlier ones in new york and washington , the speaker said : " what happened on sept .
11 and march 11 was your goods delivered back to you . "
political leaders throughout europe agreed that the best response to bin laden 's truce offer would be to ignore it while continuing to ferret out and stop terrorists all over the world .
britain , which said it could not confirm the veracity of the tape , said it nonetheless took the message seriously .
london , however , did n't appear moved by bin laden 's message .
" we ca n't negotiation with al qaeda , " a statement released by the foreign office said .
" their attacks are against the very idea of coexistence .
the right response is to continue to confront terrorism , not give in to its demands . "
the british government accused bin laden of pursuing a " cynical strategy " of trying to divide europe and the united states .
in rome , italian foreign minister franco frattini said " it 's unthinkable that we may open negotiations with bin laden , everybody understands this . "
a spokesman for the german government , meanwhile , said " there can be no discussions with terrorists and criminals like osama bin laden . "
though germany strictly opposed the war in iraq , it has several thousand peacekeeping troops in afghanistan and is currently training civilian police officers in iraq .
and spain 's designated foreign minister , miguel angel moratinos , said bin laden 's message , in which the man speaking justified the march 11 attacks , should be ignored completely .
" those of us who seek peace , democracy and freedom do not need to listen or pay attention to him , " he said .
around 200 people died in madrid after bombs detonated on local commuter trains .
on a trip to china , european commission president romano prodi scoffed at the apparent bin laden message .
" how could you possibly react to this statement ?
there is no possibility for a deal under a terrorist threat .
it is completely impossible , " he told reporters .
cia to review tape officials at the u.s. central intelligence agency said thursday they would review the tape to determine its authenticity .
in the message , which runs just over seven minutes long , the purported bin laden said " the truce will begin when the last soldier leaves our countries . "
the man also states that recent polls have shown that the majority of europeans want to reconcile with the islamic world and calls on european governments to respond to the offer within three months .
the alleged bin laden also pledges retaliation for the recent murder of hamas leader sheik ahmed yassin by the israeli army .
" we vow before god to take revenge for him from america for this , god willing , " the man said .
the israeli armed forces assassinated the founder of the radical palestinian group during a targeted mission on march 22 .
the tape also sharply criticizes washington 's middle east policy , saying it ignores the " real problem , " the " occupation of all of palestine . "
it further lambastes the u.s. for creating a business out of the war in iraq that is generating " billions " for american companies through weapons and reconstruction contracts . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope calls on masses to fight terror in his annual easter mass , pope john paul ii , the head of the catholic church , asked believers to unite and find the courage and strength to fight the " inhuman " and growing terrorism trend .

the european union is expected to make a huge step in its relationship with china this month by ending a 15-year arms embargo .
but human rights group amnesty international has condemned the proposal . the european union has angered human rights organizations by revealing that a 15-year arms embargo with china could be lifted soon .
officials in brussels announced on wednesday that eu governments had discussed an end to the ban several times in recent months and were due to make a final decision on april 26 , according to a statement from eu spokeswoman emma udwin .
eu foreign ministers are due to meet in ireland next weekend , and will hold talks with their chinese counterpart , li zhaoxing , as part of an eu-asia meeting within the proceedings .
irish officials commenting on behalf of the current eu presidency have made it clear that while the arms embargo is not on the official agenda , the ministers from the european union and china will cover " international and regional issues of common concern . "
germany and france promote plan the driving force behind the proposed scrapping of the embargo comes from european powerhouses germany and france .
if the arms ban were to be lifted , it would open up a whole new defense market , particularly for germany with its stealth submarines and france with its mirage fighter jets - two pieces of military hardware much coveted by the chinese defense department .
however , germany and france may face opposition from denmark , sweden and the netherlands , and the eu as a whole faces pressure from the united states , which firmly opposes the lifting .
despite their expected opposition , other eu nations are itching to get involved in what could be a very lucrative market , with defense suppliers keen to supply the fast modernizing chinese military .
however , human rights organization amnesty international reacted to the proposed dropping of arms restrictions by warning the european union to consider the message it was sending to imprisoned human rights activists in china if it lifted the embargo .
embargo began after tiananmen square bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : student demonstrations , tiananmen square , 1989 .
lifting the embargo imposed in 1989 after the tiananmen square killings would be the " wrong message " if there was no " clear and concrete progress in return " on human rights , amnesty spokesman dick oosting told reporters .
amnesty is reiterating its call for an independent inquiry into the events of 1989 when china sent in tanks to break up pro-democracy protests in tiananmen square in central beijing , killing hundreds .
" activists who call for such an enquiry or criticize what happened , even in emails and on web sites , are still being imprisoned to this day , " it said in a statement .
amnesty stated that it had " cautioned the eu to consider what message it will be sending to human rights activists in china , who are still being imprisoned 15 years after tiananmen square , if it lifts the eu arms embargo against china . "
leaders swap platitudes european commission president romano prodi met with chinese leaders in beijing on wednesday in another show of the burgeoning relationship between the eu and the people 's republic .
" china is now our second largest trading partner , " prodi said in his speech .
" on present trends , the eu will very soon occupy a similar place in china 's own trading hierarchy .
not much longer after that , it will probably be china 's first partner . "
prodi added that eu-china relations had never been so good .
he did , however , also mention that more work could be done of the human rights issue in china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese president hu jintao -lrb- photo -rrb- responded in kind by telling the commission president that china is ready to strengthen consultation and coordination with the eu on important international and regional issues .
china is willing to expand mutually beneficial cooperation between itself and the eu , hu said , adding that the two sides should join hands to contribute to world peace , stability and development .
the chinese leader said that his country supported the enlargement and integration of the eu and hoped the bloc would play a bigger role in international affairs . the european union and china set up a strategic partnership last year , an important decision that set a clear direction for the development of relations between them in the new century . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de france and china cozy up chinese president hu jintao is in france this week on a state visit .

lifting the embargo imposed in 1989 after the tiananmen square killings would be the " wrong message " if there was no " clear and concrete progress in return " on human rights , amnesty spokesman dick oosting told reporters .

" activists who call for such an enquiry or criticize what happened , even in emails and on web sites , are still being imprisoned to this day , " it said in a statement .
amnesty stated that it had " cautioned the eu to consider what message it will be sending to human rights activists in china , who are still being imprisoned 15 years after tiananmen square , if it lifts the eu arms embargo against china . "

the european union is expected to make a huge step in its relationship with china this month by ending a 15-year arms embargo .
but human rights group amnesty international has condemned the proposal . the european union has angered human rights organizations by revealing that a 15-year arms embargo with china could be lifted soon .
officials in brussels announced on wednesday that eu governments had discussed an end to the ban several times in recent months and were due to make a final decision on april 26 , according to a statement from eu spokeswoman emma udwin .
eu foreign ministers are due to meet in ireland next weekend , and will hold talks with their chinese counterpart , li zhaoxing , as part of an eu-asia meeting within the proceedings .
irish officials commenting on behalf of the current eu presidency have made it clear that while the arms embargo is not on the official agenda , the ministers from the european union and china will cover " international and regional issues of common concern . "
germany and france promote plan the driving force behind the proposed scrapping of the embargo comes from european powerhouses germany and france .
if the arms ban were to be lifted , it would open up a whole new defense market , particularly for germany with its stealth submarines and france with its mirage fighter jets - two pieces of military hardware much coveted by the chinese defense department .
however , germany and france may face opposition from denmark , sweden and the netherlands , and the eu as a whole faces pressure from the united states , which firmly opposes the lifting .
despite their expected opposition , other eu nations are itching to get involved in what could be a very lucrative market , with defense suppliers keen to supply the fast modernizing chinese military .
however , human rights organization amnesty international reacted to the proposed dropping of arms restrictions by warning the european union to consider the message it was sending to imprisoned human rights activists in china if it lifted the embargo .

eu leaders on thursday dismissed the offer of a " truce " from terrorist leader osama bin laden , who said his terror network al qaeda might spare europe from attacks . the european union and national governments across europe responded with outrage to an alleged audio tape from terrorist osama bin laden broadcast on thursday by the arab news networks al arabiya and al-jazeera .
in the taped message , bin laden offers to call a truce with europe if it removes troops from the middle east .
" i announce a truce with the european countries that do not attack muslim countries , " the purported bin laden says in the tape .
in a reference to the recent terrorist attacks in madrid and earlier ones in new york and washington , the speaker said : " what happened on sept .
11 and march 11 was your goods delivered back to you . "
political leaders throughout europe agreed that the best response to bin laden 's truce offer would be to ignore it while continuing to ferret out and stop terrorists all over the world .
britain , which said it could not confirm the veracity of the tape , said it nonetheless took the message seriously .
london , however , did n't appear moved by bin laden 's message .
" we ca n't negotiation with al qaeda , " a statement released by the foreign office said .
" their attacks are against the very idea of coexistence .
the right response is to continue to confront terrorism , not give in to its demands . "
the british government accused bin laden of pursuing a " cynical strategy " of trying to divide europe and the united states .
in rome , italian foreign minister franco frattini said " it 's unthinkable that we may open negotiations with bin laden , everybody understands this . "
a spokesman for the german government , meanwhile , said " there can be no discussions with terrorists and criminals like osama bin laden . "
though germany strictly opposed the war in iraq , it has several thousand peacekeeping troops in afghanistan and is currently training civilian police officers in iraq .
and spain 's designated foreign minister , miguel angel moratinos , said bin laden 's message , in which the man speaking justified the march 11 attacks , should be ignored completely .
" those of us who seek peace , democracy and freedom do not need to listen or pay attention to him , " he said .
around 200 people died in madrid after bombs detonated on local commuter trains .
on a trip to china , european commission president romano prodi scoffed at the apparent bin laden message .
" how could you possibly react to this statement ?
there is no possibility for a deal under a terrorist threat .
it is completely impossible , " he told reporters .
cia to review tape officials at the u.s. central intelligence agency said thursday they would review the tape to determine its authenticity .
in the message , which runs just over seven minutes long , the purported bin laden said " the truce will begin when the last soldier leaves our countries . "
the man also states that recent polls have shown that the majority of europeans want to reconcile with the islamic world and calls on european governments to respond to the offer within three months .
the alleged bin laden also pledges retaliation for the recent murder of hamas leader sheik ahmed yassin by the israeli army .
" we vow before god to take revenge for him from america for this , god willing , " the man said .
the israeli armed forces assassinated the founder of the radical palestinian group during a targeted mission on march 22 .
the tape also sharply criticizes washington 's middle east policy , saying it ignores the " real problem , " the " occupation of all of palestine . "
it further lambastes the u.s. for creating a business out of the war in iraq that is generating " billions " for american companies through weapons and reconstruction contracts . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope calls on masses to fight terror in his annual easter mass , pope john paul ii , the head of the catholic church , asked believers to unite and find the courage and strength to fight the " inhuman " and growing terrorism trend .

many english language films make it to the german screens with their original titles intact .
some , however , are subject to changes that leave many visitors and ex-pats scratching their heads . english speakers living in germany - even those proficient in the native tongue - often squint at the titles of movies advertised in the local press .
sometimes the english title of the film has been retained , making it easy for the ex-pat to identify the film .

from the posters , it is obvious that the film is the same : myers in full cat makeup and a large top hat gives it away .
but the title on poster , " ein kater macht theater " or " a tomcat makes theater " does n't come close to the original . sometimes the titles have their basis in the plot of the film . a good example is " die unbestechlichen " -lrb- the incorruptible -rrb- , the german title for the watergate story " all the president 's men , " where journalists bob woodward and carl bernstein uncover a presidential scandal . the knights of the coconut however , the german film board has also come up with some really bizarre alternatives .

"
bruce lee , the star of the cult seventies martial arts classic , does indeed prove that his hands are lethal weapons , but there is no actual claw in sight . similarly , the seminal spaghetti western " once upon a time in the west " contains a haunting melody played by charles bronson 's harmonica man , but that hardly justifies naming the film " spiel mir das lied vom tod " -lrb- play me the song of death -rrb- . rebel without a clue ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes the titles have been changed to such an extent that only the extremely knowledgeable would be able to identify the film without seeing the accompanying poster .

the killing of an italian hostage by iraqi militants thursday and two german security workers last week has heightened security fears for europeans and other foreigners working in iraq . the crumbling security conditions in iraq took a turn for the worse on thursday after officials in rome confirmed the execution of an italian hostage by iraqi militants .
it 's the first known killing of the some 22 foreigners being held captive by insurgents in iraq . the victim , identified as fabrizio quattrocchi , was among a group of four italian security guards seized by a previously unknown iraqi group , the green battalion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian troops in iraq the group , which demanded a withdrawal of u.s. troops from iraq , an apology by italian prime minister silvio berlusconi and the release of iraqi religious clerics , released a video of the execution .
qatar-based arabic television channel al-jazeera said it had the video , but that its contents were too graphic to broadcast . italy is the third-largest coalition partner in the occupation force , with 3,000 soldiers on the ground in iraq .
italian prime minister premier silvio berlusconi , who has ruled out pulling out italian troops from iraq , said , " they have cut short a life .
they have not damaged our values and our commitment to peace . " french journalist freed another french television journalist , alexandre jordanov , 40 , was released unharmed at a mosque on wednesday after a four-day hostage ordeal . jordanov , who works for capa television in paris , was kidnapped sunday while videotaping a u.s.military convoy under attack .
jordanov said his abductors switched his location eight times , passing him from one armed group to another .
" it was : ' we 're going to cut your throat ' to ' you 're part of the mossad , " ' jordanov said , referring to the israeli secret service . opposition accuses berlin of irresponsibility the volatile situation in iraq also dominated debate in berlin on thursday as the conservative opposition accused the german government of acting irresponsibly for using a dangerous roadway passage through iraq 's most dangerous territory to exchange security personnel .
last week , two germans were killed as the diplomatic convoy they were traveling with was ambushed . wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of the christian democrat union 's parliamentary group , told the kölner stadt-anzeiger newspaper he wanted to know why a land route had been selected for the two slain germans belonging to the elite gsg-9 unit , and whether there had been alternatives . another cdu member of parliament , michael fuchs told daily bild that such an assignment was undoubtedly a job for the military , and added that it was a " suicide mission " to send two men on such a deployment . security convoy attacked by iraqis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the missing germans the two germans , both part of the elite gsg-9 unit of germany 's federal border guard assigned to protect the german embassy in baghdad , went missing a week ago after their security convoy was attacked by iraqi insurgents as it traveled through iraq on its way from amman , jordan .
the security convoy was accompanying a group of german diplomats and members of the german federal intelligence agency . the two germans , tobias ritrath , 25 , and thomas haffenker , 38 , are believed to have been killed by the insurgents and were , according to eyewitness reports , buried by some iraqis close to the place of attack . no alternative to land route but the german government on thursday said there was no alternative to the land route to jordan . rainer lingenthal , an interior ministry spokesman , said the selected land route from the jordanian capital of amman to baghdad had been used about 25 times in the past without incident and that the exchange had been conducted using reliable security information . a german foreign ministry spokeswoman said using american air capabilities for german embassy personnel was out of question , because it was the exclusive prerogative of the coalition forces .
however , she said the inability of german diplomats to travel by air was not viewed by berlin as punishment for germany 's opposition to the war .
additionally , she said , german security personnel are also not allowed to carry weapons , she explained . lingenthal also announced that german interior minister otto schily had already initiated an investigation of the attacks and said the results would be presented to the german parliament 's domestic affairs committee . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de missing germans believed dead the latest violence in iraq is thought to have claimed the lives of two germans , the foreign ministry said .

iraqi militants executed one of four italian hostages , officials in rome confirmed early thursday .
it 's the first known killing of any of the 22 foreigners being held in iraq . the execution could further heighten fears among international aid workers , contractors and journalists , some of whom are already restricting their activities in iraq . earlier wednesday , a french journalist was freed after a four-day hostage ordeal and russia announced it would evacuate its citizens .
reports said two more japanese freelance journalists were kidnapped outside baghdad . the militants who killed the italian hostage demanded the withdrawal of u.s. forces from iraq and threatened to kill the three other hostages , al-jazeera reported . the qatar-based tv network reported that it had video of the killing but said it was too graphic to broadcast .
al-jazeera did show footage of four italian security guards sitting on the ground , holding up their passports and surrounded by armed men . the four italian security guards were abducted monday .
the militants ' videotape was accompanied by a statement from a previously unknown group , the green battalion .
it said it would " kill the three remaining italian hostages one after the other , if their demands are not met , " al-jazeera said . the group demanded the withdrawal of u.s. forces from iraq , an apology from italian leader silvio berlusconi and the release of religious clerics held in iraq . berlusconi unshakeable on withdrawing troops the italian ambassador to qatar watched the video and confirmed the man killed was fabrizio quattrocchi , one of the kidnapped italians , italian foreign minister franco frattini said .
frattini said the government would do " what is possible and impossible " to free the remaining three . three of the italian captives were working for a u.s.-based company while a fourth was employed by a seychelles-based firm , frattini said .
he stressed that the four italian hostages were not members of italian intelligence , and that the abductors were " terrorists and killers " who were " out of control " , not members of any organized resistance . italian prime minister premier silvio berlusconi , who has ruled out pulling out italian troops from iraq , said , " they have cut short a life .
they have not damaged our values and our commitment to peace . " italy is the third-largest coalition partner in the occupation force .
italy did n't send in combat troops during the war .
its forces are based in the southern city of nasiriyah , working on reconstruction . in november of last year , italy suffered tragic losses when a suicide truck bomb attack in nasiriyah , a city in southern iraq , killed 19 italians , italy 's worst single military loss since world war ii . a u.s. spokesman said tuesday that 40 foreigners from 12 countries are being held by kidnappers but an associated press count put the number at 22 , with wednesday 's release of the french journalist and the death of the italian hostage . associated press send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german general : americans losing credibility in iraq with no end in sight to the recent escalation in violence between iraqi insurgents and coalition forces , deutsche welle spoke to german army gen. klaus reinhardt about the prospects for peace in iraq .

this despite the fact that germany 's cash-strapped government has slashed the budget for the rail and road projects in cities such as munich and hamburg to € 350 million from € 500 million .
" we are not worried at all and we expect all the transport projects to be ready for the finals , " said local organising committee spokesman gerd graus .
however , handelsblatt quoted karl-geert kuchenbecker , a coordinator for world cup transport issues and an adviser to soccer 's governing body fifa , as saying , " we are still on the way , but the time situation is gradually becoming dramatic . "
some of the projects were started too late and there is a danger they will not be completed on time , he added .

commissioned by germany 's armed forces and conducted by the bundeswehr 's social scientific institute , the study found that 44 percent of the people surveyed said they felt apprehensive , up by 14 percent compared to last year .
what 's more , 59 percent said they perceived the increasingly shaky pensions system as a threat , 57 percent felt threatened by international terrorism , and 54 percent said they were scared because they would n't get enough benefits if they lost their job .
the study also concluded that most participants were in favor of a stronger role for the bundeswehr within the country , both in times of catastrophe and to combat terrorism .
only 46 percent said they supported the role of the bundeswehr in stabilizing afghanistan and 47 percent thought the foreign deployment of the army to combat international terrorism was useful . more briefs 15.04.2004 -pipe- schröder superstar 15.04.2004 -pipe- german defense minister plans to close army hospitals 13.04.2004 -pipe- germans favor smoking ban 13.04.2004 -pipe- environmental group praises new eu labels on gm food 13.04.2004 -pipe- greens calls for tax hike on gas , energy 09.04.2004 -pipe- peace movement starts easter marches 09.04.2004 -pipe- government denies cabinet reshuffle plans 08.04.2004 -pipe- german sept .

they made clear that they would not accept a unilateral change to middle east borders .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 15.04.2004 lost in translation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tomcat makes theater ... apparently .
many english language films make it to the german screens with their original titles intact .
some , however , are subject to changes that leave many visitors and ex-pats scratching their heads . english speakers living in germany - even those proficient in the native tongue - often squint at the titles of movies advertised in the local press .
sometimes the english title of the film has been retained , making it easy for the ex-pat to identify the film .
others times , however , the movie has been given a mind-boggling new name , creating a minefield of confusion . take the new mike myers film based on the dr. seuss children 's book classic " the cat in the hat " .
from the posters , it is obvious that the film is the same : myers in full cat makeup and a large top hat gives it away .
but the title on poster , " ein kater macht theater " or " a tomcat makes theater " does n't come close to the original . sometimes the titles have their basis in the plot of the film . a good example is " die unbestechlichen " -lrb- the incorruptible -rrb- , the german title for the watergate story " all the president 's men , " where journalists bob woodward and carl bernstein uncover a presidential scandal . the knights of the coconut however , the german film board has also come up with some really bizarre alternatives .

eu leaders on thursday dismissed the offer of a " truce " from terrorist leader osama bin laden , who said his terror network al qaeda might spare europe from attacks . the european union and national governments across europe responded with outrage to an alleged audio tape from terrorist osama bin laden broadcast on thursday by the arab news networks al arabiya and al-jazeera .
in the taped message , bin laden offers to call a truce with europe if it removes troops from the middle east .
" i announce a truce with the european countries that do not attack muslim countries , " the purported bin laden says in the tape .
in a reference to the recent terrorist attacks in madrid and earlier ones in new york and washington , the speaker said : " what happened on sept .
11 and march 11 was your goods delivered back to you . "
political leaders throughout europe agreed that the best response to bin laden 's truce offer would be to ignore it while continuing to ferret out and stop terrorists all over the world .
britain , which said it could not confirm the veracity of the tape , said it nonetheless took the message seriously .
london , however , did n't appear moved by bin laden 's message .
" we ca n't negotiation with al qaeda , " a statement released by the foreign office said .
" their attacks are against the very idea of coexistence .
the right response is to continue to confront terrorism , not give in to its demands . "
the british government accused bin laden of pursuing a " cynical strategy " of trying to divide europe and the united states .
in rome , italian foreign minister franco frattini said " it 's unthinkable that we may open negotiations with bin laden , everybody understands this . "
a spokesman for the german government , meanwhile , said " there can be no discussions with terrorists and criminals like osama bin laden . "
though germany strictly opposed the war in iraq , it has several thousand peacekeeping troops in afghanistan and is currently training civilian police officers in iraq .
and spain 's designated foreign minister , miguel angel moratinos , said bin laden 's message , in which the man speaking justified the march 11 attacks , should be ignored completely .
" those of us who seek peace , democracy and freedom do not need to listen or pay attention to him , " he said .
around 200 people died in madrid after bombs detonated on local commuter trains .
on a trip to china , european commission president romano prodi scoffed at the apparent bin laden message .
" how could you possibly react to this statement ?
there is no possibility for a deal under a terrorist threat .
it is completely impossible , " he told reporters .
cia to review tape officials at the u.s. central intelligence agency said thursday they would review the tape to determine its authenticity .
in the message , which runs just over seven minutes long , the purported bin laden said " the truce will begin when the last soldier leaves our countries . "
the man also states that recent polls have shown that the majority of europeans want to reconcile with the islamic world and calls on european governments to respond to the offer within three months .
the alleged bin laden also pledges retaliation for the recent murder of hamas leader sheik ahmed yassin by the israeli army .
" we vow before god to take revenge for him from america for this , god willing , " the man said .
the israeli armed forces assassinated the founder of the radical palestinian group during a targeted mission on march 22 .
the tape also sharply criticizes washington 's middle east policy , saying it ignores the " real problem , " the " occupation of all of palestine . "
it further lambastes the u.s. for creating a business out of the war in iraq that is generating " billions " for american companies through weapons and reconstruction contracts . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope calls on masses to fight terror in his annual easter mass , pope john paul ii , the head of the catholic church , asked believers to unite and find the courage and strength to fight the " inhuman " and growing terrorism trend .

eu leaders on thursday dismissed the offer of a " truce " from terrorist leader osama bin laden , who said his terror network al qaeda might spare europe from attacks . the european union and national governments across europe responded with outrage to an alleged audio tape from terrorist osama bin laden broadcast on thursday by the arab news networks al arabiya and al-jazeera .
in the taped message , bin laden offers to call a truce with europe if it removes troops from the middle east .
" i announce a truce with the european countries that do not attack muslim countries , " the purported bin laden says in the tape .
in a reference to the recent terrorist attacks in madrid and earlier ones in new york and washington , the speaker said : " what happened on sept .
11 and march 11 was your goods delivered back to you . "
political leaders throughout europe agreed that the best response to bin laden 's truce offer would be to ignore it while continuing to ferret out and stop terrorists all over the world .
britain , which said it could not confirm the veracity of the tape , said it nonetheless took the message seriously .
london , however , did n't appear moved by bin laden 's message .
" we ca n't negotiation with al qaeda , " a statement released by the foreign office said .
" their attacks are against the very idea of coexistence .
the right response is to continue to confront terrorism , not give in to its demands . "
the british government accused bin laden of pursuing a " cynical strategy " of trying to divide europe and the united states .
in rome , italian foreign minister franco frattini said " it 's unthinkable that we may open negotiations with bin laden , everybody understands this . "
a spokesman for the german government , meanwhile , said " there can be no discussions with terrorists and criminals like osama bin laden . "
though germany strictly opposed the war in iraq , it has several thousand peacekeeping troops in afghanistan and is currently training civilian police officers in iraq .
and spain 's designated foreign minister , miguel angel moratinos , said bin laden 's message , in which the man speaking justified the march 11 attacks , should be ignored completely .

political leaders throughout europe agreed that the best response to bin laden 's truce offer would be to ignore it while continuing to ferret out and stop terrorists all over the world .
britain , which said it could not confirm the veracity of the tape , said it nonetheless took the message seriously .
london , however , did n't appear moved by bin laden 's message .
" we ca n't negotiation with al qaeda , " a statement released by the foreign office said .
" their attacks are against the very idea of coexistence .
the right response is to continue to confront terrorism , not give in to its demands . "

the european union is expected to make a huge step in its relationship with china this month by ending a 15-year arms embargo .
but human rights group amnesty international has condemned the proposal . the european union has angered human rights organizations by revealing that a 15-year arms embargo with china could be lifted soon .
officials in brussels announced on wednesday that eu governments had discussed an end to the ban several times in recent months and were due to make a final decision on april 26 , according to a statement from eu spokeswoman emma udwin .
eu foreign ministers are due to meet in ireland next weekend , and will hold talks with their chinese counterpart , li zhaoxing , as part of an eu-asia meeting within the proceedings .
irish officials commenting on behalf of the current eu presidency have made it clear that while the arms embargo is not on the official agenda , the ministers from the european union and china will cover " international and regional issues of common concern . "
germany and france promote plan the driving force behind the proposed scrapping of the embargo comes from european powerhouses germany and france .
if the arms ban were to be lifted , it would open up a whole new defense market , particularly for germany with its stealth submarines and france with its mirage fighter jets - two pieces of military hardware much coveted by the chinese defense department .
however , germany and france may face opposition from denmark , sweden and the netherlands , and the eu as a whole faces pressure from the united states , which firmly opposes the lifting .
despite their expected opposition , other eu nations are itching to get involved in what could be a very lucrative market , with defense suppliers keen to supply the fast modernizing chinese military .
however , human rights organization amnesty international reacted to the proposed dropping of arms restrictions by warning the european union to consider the message it was sending to imprisoned human rights activists in china if it lifted the embargo .
embargo began after tiananmen square bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : student demonstrations , tiananmen square , 1989 .
lifting the embargo imposed in 1989 after the tiananmen square killings would be the " wrong message " if there was no " clear and concrete progress in return " on human rights , amnesty spokesman dick oosting told reporters .
amnesty is reiterating its call for an independent inquiry into the events of 1989 when china sent in tanks to break up pro-democracy protests in tiananmen square in central beijing , killing hundreds .
" activists who call for such an enquiry or criticize what happened , even in emails and on web sites , are still being imprisoned to this day , " it said in a statement .
amnesty stated that it had " cautioned the eu to consider what message it will be sending to human rights activists in china , who are still being imprisoned 15 years after tiananmen square , if it lifts the eu arms embargo against china . "
leaders swap platitudes european commission president romano prodi met with chinese leaders in beijing on wednesday in another show of the burgeoning relationship between the eu and the people 's republic .
" china is now our second largest trading partner , " prodi said in his speech .
" on present trends , the eu will very soon occupy a similar place in china 's own trading hierarchy .
not much longer after that , it will probably be china 's first partner . "
prodi added that eu-china relations had never been so good .
he did , however , also mention that more work could be done of the human rights issue in china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese president hu jintao -lrb- photo -rrb- responded in kind by telling the commission president that china is ready to strengthen consultation and coordination with the eu on important international and regional issues .
china is willing to expand mutually beneficial cooperation between itself and the eu , hu said , adding that the two sides should join hands to contribute to world peace , stability and development .
the chinese leader said that his country supported the enlargement and integration of the eu and hoped the bloc would play a bigger role in international affairs . the european union and china set up a strategic partnership last year , an important decision that set a clear direction for the development of relations between them in the new century . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de france and china cozy up chinese president hu jintao is in france this week on a state visit .

the european union is expected to make a huge step in its relationship with china this month by ending a 15-year arms embargo .
but human rights group amnesty international has condemned the proposal . the european union has angered human rights organizations by revealing that a 15-year arms embargo with china could be lifted soon .
officials in brussels announced on wednesday that eu governments had discussed an end to the ban several times in recent months and were due to make a final decision on april 26 , according to a statement from eu spokeswoman emma udwin .
eu foreign ministers are due to meet in ireland next weekend , and will hold talks with their chinese counterpart , li zhaoxing , as part of an eu-asia meeting within the proceedings .
irish officials commenting on behalf of the current eu presidency have made it clear that while the arms embargo is not on the official agenda , the ministers from the european union and china will cover " international and regional issues of common concern . "
germany and france promote plan the driving force behind the proposed scrapping of the embargo comes from european powerhouses germany and france .
if the arms ban were to be lifted , it would open up a whole new defense market , particularly for germany with its stealth submarines and france with its mirage fighter jets - two pieces of military hardware much coveted by the chinese defense department .
however , germany and france may face opposition from denmark , sweden and the netherlands , and the eu as a whole faces pressure from the united states , which firmly opposes the lifting .
despite their expected opposition , other eu nations are itching to get involved in what could be a very lucrative market , with defense suppliers keen to supply the fast modernizing chinese military .
however , human rights organization amnesty international reacted to the proposed dropping of arms restrictions by warning the european union to consider the message it was sending to imprisoned human rights activists in china if it lifted the embargo .
embargo began after tiananmen square bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : student demonstrations , tiananmen square , 1989 .
lifting the embargo imposed in 1989 after the tiananmen square killings would be the " wrong message " if there was no " clear and concrete progress in return " on human rights , amnesty spokesman dick oosting told reporters .
amnesty is reiterating its call for an independent inquiry into the events of 1989 when china sent in tanks to break up pro-democracy protests in tiananmen square in central beijing , killing hundreds .
" activists who call for such an enquiry or criticize what happened , even in emails and on web sites , are still being imprisoned to this day , " it said in a statement .
amnesty stated that it had " cautioned the eu to consider what message it will be sending to human rights activists in china , who are still being imprisoned 15 years after tiananmen square , if it lifts the eu arms embargo against china . "
leaders swap platitudes european commission president romano prodi met with chinese leaders in beijing on wednesday in another show of the burgeoning relationship between the eu and the people 's republic .
" china is now our second largest trading partner , " prodi said in his speech .
" on present trends , the eu will very soon occupy a similar place in china 's own trading hierarchy .
not much longer after that , it will probably be china 's first partner . "
prodi added that eu-china relations had never been so good .
he did , however , also mention that more work could be done of the human rights issue in china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese president hu jintao -lrb- photo -rrb- responded in kind by telling the commission president that china is ready to strengthen consultation and coordination with the eu on important international and regional issues .
china is willing to expand mutually beneficial cooperation between itself and the eu , hu said , adding that the two sides should join hands to contribute to world peace , stability and development .
the chinese leader said that his country supported the enlargement and integration of the eu and hoped the bloc would play a bigger role in international affairs . the european union and china set up a strategic partnership last year , an important decision that set a clear direction for the development of relations between them in the new century . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de france and china cozy up chinese president hu jintao is in france this week on a state visit .

the european union is expected to make a huge step in its relationship with china this month by ending a 15-year arms embargo .
but human rights group amnesty international has condemned the proposal . the european union has angered human rights organizations by revealing that a 15-year arms embargo with china could be lifted soon .
officials in brussels announced on wednesday that eu governments had discussed an end to the ban several times in recent months and were due to make a final decision on april 26 , according to a statement from eu spokeswoman emma udwin .
eu foreign ministers are due to meet in ireland next weekend , and will hold talks with their chinese counterpart , li zhaoxing , as part of an eu-asia meeting within the proceedings .
irish officials commenting on behalf of the current eu presidency have made it clear that while the arms embargo is not on the official agenda , the ministers from the european union and china will cover " international and regional issues of common concern . "
germany and france promote plan the driving force behind the proposed scrapping of the embargo comes from european powerhouses germany and france .
if the arms ban were to be lifted , it would open up a whole new defense market , particularly for germany with its stealth submarines and france with its mirage fighter jets - two pieces of military hardware much coveted by the chinese defense department .
however , germany and france may face opposition from denmark , sweden and the netherlands , and the eu as a whole faces pressure from the united states , which firmly opposes the lifting .
despite their expected opposition , other eu nations are itching to get involved in what could be a very lucrative market , with defense suppliers keen to supply the fast modernizing chinese military .
however , human rights organization amnesty international reacted to the proposed dropping of arms restrictions by warning the european union to consider the message it was sending to imprisoned human rights activists in china if it lifted the embargo .
embargo began after tiananmen square bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : student demonstrations , tiananmen square , 1989 .
lifting the embargo imposed in 1989 after the tiananmen square killings would be the " wrong message " if there was no " clear and concrete progress in return " on human rights , amnesty spokesman dick oosting told reporters .
amnesty is reiterating its call for an independent inquiry into the events of 1989 when china sent in tanks to break up pro-democracy protests in tiananmen square in central beijing , killing hundreds .
" activists who call for such an enquiry or criticize what happened , even in emails and on web sites , are still being imprisoned to this day , " it said in a statement .
amnesty stated that it had " cautioned the eu to consider what message it will be sending to human rights activists in china , who are still being imprisoned 15 years after tiananmen square , if it lifts the eu arms embargo against china . "
leaders swap platitudes european commission president romano prodi met with chinese leaders in beijing on wednesday in another show of the burgeoning relationship between the eu and the people 's republic .
" china is now our second largest trading partner , " prodi said in his speech .
" on present trends , the eu will very soon occupy a similar place in china 's own trading hierarchy .
not much longer after that , it will probably be china 's first partner . "
prodi added that eu-china relations had never been so good .

it 's the first known killing of the some 22 foreigners being held captive by insurgents in iraq . the victim , identified as fabrizio quattrocchi , was among a group of four italian security guards seized by a previously unknown iraqi group , the green battalion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian troops in iraq the group , which demanded a withdrawal of u.s. troops from iraq , an apology by italian prime minister silvio berlusconi and the release of iraqi religious clerics , released a video of the execution .
qatar-based arabic television channel al-jazeera said it had the video , but that its contents were too graphic to broadcast . italy is the third-largest coalition partner in the occupation force , with 3,000 soldiers on the ground in iraq .
italian prime minister premier silvio berlusconi , who has ruled out pulling out italian troops from iraq , said , " they have cut short a life .
they have not damaged our values and our commitment to peace . " french journalist freed another french television journalist , alexandre jordanov , 40 , was released unharmed at a mosque on wednesday after a four-day hostage ordeal . jordanov , who works for capa television in paris , was kidnapped sunday while videotaping a u.s.military convoy under attack .
jordanov said his abductors switched his location eight times , passing him from one armed group to another .
" it was : ' we 're going to cut your throat ' to ' you 're part of the mossad , " ' jordanov said , referring to the israeli secret service . opposition accuses berlin of irresponsibility the volatile situation in iraq also dominated debate in berlin on thursday as the conservative opposition accused the german government of acting irresponsibly for using a dangerous roadway passage through iraq 's most dangerous territory to exchange security personnel .
last week , two germans were killed as the diplomatic convoy they were traveling with was ambushed . wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of the christian democrat union 's parliamentary group , told the kölner stadt-anzeiger newspaper he wanted to know why a land route had been selected for the two slain germans belonging to the elite gsg-9 unit , and whether there had been alternatives . another cdu member of parliament , michael fuchs told daily bild that such an assignment was undoubtedly a job for the military , and added that it was a " suicide mission " to send two men on such a deployment . security convoy attacked by iraqis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the missing germans the two germans , both part of the elite gsg-9 unit of germany 's federal border guard assigned to protect the german embassy in baghdad , went missing a week ago after their security convoy was attacked by iraqi insurgents as it traveled through iraq on its way from amman , jordan .
the security convoy was accompanying a group of german diplomats and members of the german federal intelligence agency . the two germans , tobias ritrath , 25 , and thomas haffenker , 38 , are believed to have been killed by the insurgents and were , according to eyewitness reports , buried by some iraqis close to the place of attack . no alternative to land route but the german government on thursday said there was no alternative to the land route to jordan . rainer lingenthal , an interior ministry spokesman , said the selected land route from the jordanian capital of amman to baghdad had been used about 25 times in the past without incident and that the exchange had been conducted using reliable security information . a german foreign ministry spokeswoman said using american air capabilities for german embassy personnel was out of question , because it was the exclusive prerogative of the coalition forces .
however , she said the inability of german diplomats to travel by air was not viewed by berlin as punishment for germany 's opposition to the war .
additionally , she said , german security personnel are also not allowed to carry weapons , she explained . lingenthal also announced that german interior minister otto schily had already initiated an investigation of the attacks and said the results would be presented to the german parliament 's domestic affairs committee . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de missing germans believed dead the latest violence in iraq is thought to have claimed the lives of two germans , the foreign ministry said .

many english language films make it to the german screens with their original titles intact .

others times , however , the movie has been given a mind-boggling new name , creating a minefield of confusion . take the new mike myers film based on the dr. seuss children 's book classic " the cat in the hat " .
from the posters , it is obvious that the film is the same : myers in full cat makeup and a large top hat gives it away .
but the title on poster , " ein kater macht theater " or " a tomcat makes theater " does n't come close to the original . sometimes the titles have their basis in the plot of the film . a good example is " die unbestechlichen " -lrb- the incorruptible -rrb- , the german title for the watergate story " all the president 's men , " where journalists bob woodward and carl bernstein uncover a presidential scandal . the knights of the coconut however , the german film board has also come up with some really bizarre alternatives .
" monty python and the holy grail " may feature several references to coconuts , but not to the extent that would justify the film being called " die ritter der kokosnuss " -lrb- the knights of the coconut -rrb- . the same could be said about " der mann mit der todeskralle " -lrb- the man with the deadly claw -rrb- or , as english viewers know it , " enter the dragon . "
bruce lee , the star of the cult seventies martial arts classic , does indeed prove that his hands are lethal weapons , but there is no actual claw in sight . similarly , the seminal spaghetti western " once upon a time in the west " contains a haunting melody played by charles bronson 's harmonica man , but that hardly justifies naming the film " spiel mir das lied vom tod " -lrb- play me the song of death -rrb- . rebel without a clue ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes the titles have been changed to such an extent that only the extremely knowledgeable would be able to identify the film without seeing the accompanying poster .
take " rebel without a cause " : the iconic image of james dean leaning against a wall , smoking a cigarette and oozing attitude would give it away .
but the german title " ... denn sie wissen nicht , was sie tun -lrb- they do not know what they do -rrb- would render many faces blank . another iconic movie suffered an even more bizarre fate .
marlon brando 's " on the waterfront , " with its boxing storyline , was afforded the strange title , " die faust im nacken " -lrb- the fist in the nape of the neck -rrb- .
and martin scorsese 's kinetic debut feature " mean streets " lost its new york gangster feel with the german title " hexenkessel , " meaning bedlam . however , germany is a long way from being the worst offender .
that dubious honor goes to the hong kong film industry , which has come up with some classics . the big liar and other cantonese oddities oliver stone 's biopic of former u.s. president richard nixon , unimaginatively titled " nixon " by the director , was livened up and renamed " the big liar . "
the coen brothers ' winter wilderness crime story " fargo " was given even more special treatment , entering hong kong cinemas under the title " mysterious murder in snowy cream . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mr. cat poop .
but the best has to be the oscar-winning jack nicholson comedy " as good as it gets " , which got a complete makeover , eventually reflecting the main character 's attitude problem in the name " mr. cat poop .

eu leaders on thursday dismissed the offer of a " truce " from terrorist leader osama bin laden , who said his terror network al qaeda might spare europe from attacks . the european union and national governments across europe responded with outrage to an alleged audio tape from terrorist osama bin laden broadcast on thursday by the arab news networks al arabiya and al-jazeera .
in the taped message , bin laden offers to call a truce with europe if it removes troops from the middle east .
" i announce a truce with the european countries that do not attack muslim countries , " the purported bin laden says in the tape .
in a reference to the recent terrorist attacks in madrid and earlier ones in new york and washington , the speaker said : " what happened on sept .
11 and march 11 was your goods delivered back to you . "
political leaders throughout europe agreed that the best response to bin laden 's truce offer would be to ignore it while continuing to ferret out and stop terrorists all over the world .
britain , which said it could not confirm the veracity of the tape , said it nonetheless took the message seriously .
london , however , did n't appear moved by bin laden 's message .
" we ca n't negotiation with al qaeda , " a statement released by the foreign office said .
" their attacks are against the very idea of coexistence .
the right response is to continue to confront terrorism , not give in to its demands . "
the british government accused bin laden of pursuing a " cynical strategy " of trying to divide europe and the united states .
in rome , italian foreign minister franco frattini said " it 's unthinkable that we may open negotiations with bin laden , everybody understands this . "
a spokesman for the german government , meanwhile , said " there can be no discussions with terrorists and criminals like osama bin laden . "
though germany strictly opposed the war in iraq , it has several thousand peacekeeping troops in afghanistan and is currently training civilian police officers in iraq .
and spain 's designated foreign minister , miguel angel moratinos , said bin laden 's message , in which the man speaking justified the march 11 attacks , should be ignored completely .
" those of us who seek peace , democracy and freedom do not need to listen or pay attention to him , " he said .
around 200 people died in madrid after bombs detonated on local commuter trains .
on a trip to china , european commission president romano prodi scoffed at the apparent bin laden message .
" how could you possibly react to this statement ?
there is no possibility for a deal under a terrorist threat .
it is completely impossible , " he told reporters .
cia to review tape officials at the u.s. central intelligence agency said thursday they would review the tape to determine its authenticity .
in the message , which runs just over seven minutes long , the purported bin laden said " the truce will begin when the last soldier leaves our countries . "
the man also states that recent polls have shown that the majority of europeans want to reconcile with the islamic world and calls on european governments to respond to the offer within three months .
the alleged bin laden also pledges retaliation for the recent murder of hamas leader sheik ahmed yassin by the israeli army .
" we vow before god to take revenge for him from america for this , god willing , " the man said .
the israeli armed forces assassinated the founder of the radical palestinian group during a targeted mission on march 22 .
the tape also sharply criticizes washington 's middle east policy , saying it ignores the " real problem , " the " occupation of all of palestine . "
it further lambastes the u.s. for creating a business out of the war in iraq that is generating " billions " for american companies through weapons and reconstruction contracts . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope calls on masses to fight terror in his annual easter mass , pope john paul ii , the head of the catholic church , asked believers to unite and find the courage and strength to fight the " inhuman " and growing terrorism trend .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.04.2004 europe outraged by alleged bin laden tape großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new tape thought to be from osama bin laden surfaced this week .
eu leaders on thursday dismissed the offer of a " truce " from terrorist leader osama bin laden , who said his terror network al qaeda might spare europe from attacks . the european union and national governments across europe responded with outrage to an alleged audio tape from terrorist osama bin laden broadcast on thursday by the arab news networks al arabiya and al-jazeera .
in the taped message , bin laden offers to call a truce with europe if it removes troops from the middle east .
" i announce a truce with the european countries that do not attack muslim countries , " the purported bin laden says in the tape .
in a reference to the recent terrorist attacks in madrid and earlier ones in new york and washington , the speaker said : " what happened on sept .
11 and march 11 was your goods delivered back to you . "
political leaders throughout europe agreed that the best response to bin laden 's truce offer would be to ignore it while continuing to ferret out and stop terrorists all over the world .
britain , which said it could not confirm the veracity of the tape , said it nonetheless took the message seriously .
london , however , did n't appear moved by bin laden 's message .
" we ca n't negotiation with al qaeda , " a statement released by the foreign office said .
" their attacks are against the very idea of coexistence .
the right response is to continue to confront terrorism , not give in to its demands . "
the british government accused bin laden of pursuing a " cynical strategy " of trying to divide europe and the united states .
in rome , italian foreign minister franco frattini said " it 's unthinkable that we may open negotiations with bin laden , everybody understands this . "
a spokesman for the german government , meanwhile , said " there can be no discussions with terrorists and criminals like osama bin laden . "
though germany strictly opposed the war in iraq , it has several thousand peacekeeping troops in afghanistan and is currently training civilian police officers in iraq .
and spain 's designated foreign minister , miguel angel moratinos , said bin laden 's message , in which the man speaking justified the march 11 attacks , should be ignored completely .
" those of us who seek peace , democracy and freedom do not need to listen or pay attention to him , " he said .
around 200 people died in madrid after bombs detonated on local commuter trains .
on a trip to china , european commission president romano prodi scoffed at the apparent bin laden message .
" how could you possibly react to this statement ?
there is no possibility for a deal under a terrorist threat .
it is completely impossible , " he told reporters .
cia to review tape officials at the u.s. central intelligence agency said thursday they would review the tape to determine its authenticity .
in the message , which runs just over seven minutes long , the purported bin laden said " the truce will begin when the last soldier leaves our countries . "
the man also states that recent polls have shown that the majority of europeans want to reconcile with the islamic world and calls on european governments to respond to the offer within three months .
the alleged bin laden also pledges retaliation for the recent murder of hamas leader sheik ahmed yassin by the israeli army .
" we vow before god to take revenge for him from america for this , god willing , " the man said .
the israeli armed forces assassinated the founder of the radical palestinian group during a targeted mission on march 22 .
the tape also sharply criticizes washington 's middle east policy , saying it ignores the " real problem , " the " occupation of all of palestine . "
it further lambastes the u.s. for creating a business out of the war in iraq that is generating " billions " for american companies through weapons and reconstruction contracts . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope calls on masses to fight terror in his annual easter mass , pope john paul ii , the head of the catholic church , asked believers to unite and find the courage and strength to fight the " inhuman " and growing terrorism trend .

the european union is expected to make a huge step in its relationship with china this month by ending a 15-year arms embargo .
but human rights group amnesty international has condemned the proposal . the european union has angered human rights organizations by revealing that a 15-year arms embargo with china could be lifted soon .
officials in brussels announced on wednesday that eu governments had discussed an end to the ban several times in recent months and were due to make a final decision on april 26 , according to a statement from eu spokeswoman emma udwin .
eu foreign ministers are due to meet in ireland next weekend , and will hold talks with their chinese counterpart , li zhaoxing , as part of an eu-asia meeting within the proceedings .
irish officials commenting on behalf of the current eu presidency have made it clear that while the arms embargo is not on the official agenda , the ministers from the european union and china will cover " international and regional issues of common concern . "
germany and france promote plan the driving force behind the proposed scrapping of the embargo comes from european powerhouses germany and france .
if the arms ban were to be lifted , it would open up a whole new defense market , particularly for germany with its stealth submarines and france with its mirage fighter jets - two pieces of military hardware much coveted by the chinese defense department .
however , germany and france may face opposition from denmark , sweden and the netherlands , and the eu as a whole faces pressure from the united states , which firmly opposes the lifting .
despite their expected opposition , other eu nations are itching to get involved in what could be a very lucrative market , with defense suppliers keen to supply the fast modernizing chinese military .
however , human rights organization amnesty international reacted to the proposed dropping of arms restrictions by warning the european union to consider the message it was sending to imprisoned human rights activists in china if it lifted the embargo .
embargo began after tiananmen square bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : student demonstrations , tiananmen square , 1989 .
lifting the embargo imposed in 1989 after the tiananmen square killings would be the " wrong message " if there was no " clear and concrete progress in return " on human rights , amnesty spokesman dick oosting told reporters .
amnesty is reiterating its call for an independent inquiry into the events of 1989 when china sent in tanks to break up pro-democracy protests in tiananmen square in central beijing , killing hundreds .
" activists who call for such an enquiry or criticize what happened , even in emails and on web sites , are still being imprisoned to this day , " it said in a statement .
amnesty stated that it had " cautioned the eu to consider what message it will be sending to human rights activists in china , who are still being imprisoned 15 years after tiananmen square , if it lifts the eu arms embargo against china . "
leaders swap platitudes european commission president romano prodi met with chinese leaders in beijing on wednesday in another show of the burgeoning relationship between the eu and the people 's republic .
" china is now our second largest trading partner , " prodi said in his speech .
" on present trends , the eu will very soon occupy a similar place in china 's own trading hierarchy .
not much longer after that , it will probably be china 's first partner . "
prodi added that eu-china relations had never been so good .
he did , however , also mention that more work could be done of the human rights issue in china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese president hu jintao -lrb- photo -rrb- responded in kind by telling the commission president that china is ready to strengthen consultation and coordination with the eu on important international and regional issues .
china is willing to expand mutually beneficial cooperation between itself and the eu , hu said , adding that the two sides should join hands to contribute to world peace , stability and development .
the chinese leader said that his country supported the enlargement and integration of the eu and hoped the bloc would play a bigger role in international affairs . the european union and china set up a strategic partnership last year , an important decision that set a clear direction for the development of relations between them in the new century . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de france and china cozy up chinese president hu jintao is in france this week on a state visit .

the european union is expected to make a huge step in its relationship with china this month by ending a 15-year arms embargo .
but human rights group amnesty international has condemned the proposal . the european union has angered human rights organizations by revealing that a 15-year arms embargo with china could be lifted soon .
officials in brussels announced on wednesday that eu governments had discussed an end to the ban several times in recent months and were due to make a final decision on april 26 , according to a statement from eu spokeswoman emma udwin .
eu foreign ministers are due to meet in ireland next weekend , and will hold talks with their chinese counterpart , li zhaoxing , as part of an eu-asia meeting within the proceedings .
irish officials commenting on behalf of the current eu presidency have made it clear that while the arms embargo is not on the official agenda , the ministers from the european union and china will cover " international and regional issues of common concern . "
germany and france promote plan the driving force behind the proposed scrapping of the embargo comes from european powerhouses germany and france .
if the arms ban were to be lifted , it would open up a whole new defense market , particularly for germany with its stealth submarines and france with its mirage fighter jets - two pieces of military hardware much coveted by the chinese defense department .
however , germany and france may face opposition from denmark , sweden and the netherlands , and the eu as a whole faces pressure from the united states , which firmly opposes the lifting .
despite their expected opposition , other eu nations are itching to get involved in what could be a very lucrative market , with defense suppliers keen to supply the fast modernizing chinese military .
however , human rights organization amnesty international reacted to the proposed dropping of arms restrictions by warning the european union to consider the message it was sending to imprisoned human rights activists in china if it lifted the embargo .
embargo began after tiananmen square bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : student demonstrations , tiananmen square , 1989 .
lifting the embargo imposed in 1989 after the tiananmen square killings would be the " wrong message " if there was no " clear and concrete progress in return " on human rights , amnesty spokesman dick oosting told reporters .
amnesty is reiterating its call for an independent inquiry into the events of 1989 when china sent in tanks to break up pro-democracy protests in tiananmen square in central beijing , killing hundreds .
" activists who call for such an enquiry or criticize what happened , even in emails and on web sites , are still being imprisoned to this day , " it said in a statement .
amnesty stated that it had " cautioned the eu to consider what message it will be sending to human rights activists in china , who are still being imprisoned 15 years after tiananmen square , if it lifts the eu arms embargo against china . "
leaders swap platitudes european commission president romano prodi met with chinese leaders in beijing on wednesday in another show of the burgeoning relationship between the eu and the people 's republic .
" china is now our second largest trading partner , " prodi said in his speech .
" on present trends , the eu will very soon occupy a similar place in china 's own trading hierarchy .
not much longer after that , it will probably be china 's first partner . "
prodi added that eu-china relations had never been so good .
he did , however , also mention that more work could be done of the human rights issue in china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese president hu jintao -lrb- photo -rrb- responded in kind by telling the commission president that china is ready to strengthen consultation and coordination with the eu on important international and regional issues .

the killing of an italian hostage by iraqi militants thursday and two german security workers last week has heightened security fears for europeans and other foreigners working in iraq . the crumbling security conditions in iraq took a turn for the worse on thursday after officials in rome confirmed the execution of an italian hostage by iraqi militants .

however , she said the inability of german diplomats to travel by air was not viewed by berlin as punishment for germany 's opposition to the war .

the eu and the german government warned that both israelis and palestinians must agree to any border changes . european union leaders responded cautiously to u.s. president george w. bush 's announcement that israel could keep arab land it captured in 1967 .
they made clear that they would not accept a unilateral change to middle east borders . " the european union will not recognize any change to the pre-1967 borders other than those arrived at by agreement between the parties , " irish foreign minister brian cowen , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , said in a statement on wednesday , quoting the stance the eu has repeatedly taken . cowen also pointed out that the road map meant to chart the course to a middle east peace plan required that a final agreement ending the israeli-palestinian conflict must also resolve the refugee issue . eu will discuss proposals the so-called middle east quartet , which is made up of the eu , russia and the united nations , along with the united states , will examine the plan agreed on by president bush and israeli prime minister ariel sharon , javier solana , the eu 's top diplomat , said wednesday .

cowen welcomed bush 's affirmation that the u.s. is committed to the road map and a two state solution . the german government 's statement echoed the eu 's .

israeli forces occupied the areas in 1967 .
bush said that " new realities on the ground " should be reflected in a final settlement .
he added that any palestinian refugees who wished to return to their former homes should be accommodated in palestinian territory . " of course , bush did n't say anything particularly surprising , " deutsche welle correspondent peter philip commented .
" nobody seriously expected that history would be turned back to june 5 , 1967 or even further back .

gross domestic product was up 9.7 % year on year in the first three months of 2004 , while investment in fixed assets soared by 43 % .
while such figures look nothing but positive , economists worry that unchecked growth could topple over into a slump , impacting the rest of asia .

in particular , it has sought to calm runaway bank lending - the source of much speculative financing , especially in the property sector .

but joan zheng , chief economist at jp morgan in hong kong , said the chinese government had not done enough to cool the economy .
" simply relying on monetary policy is not going to be enough .

persistently high levels of investment , which at least partly reflect spending on housing and other construction , are seen as a cause for especial concern .
no slowing down it had been expected that the latest batch of economic data would show some slowing , as a sluggish global economy bites into demand for china 's exports .

inflation , a key indicator of overheating , remains modest : the consumer-price index was up just 2.8 % year on year in the first quarter .
at some point , however , rampant investment are likely to cause supply bottlenecks , particularly in markets for raw materials such as fuel , metals and building supplies .

bob mansfield said he could no longer tolerate divisions over strategy , as telstra scrambles for ways to offset weak growth in its core markets .
the departure is seen as a blow for chief executive ziggy switkowski , a key ally of mr mansfield 's .
australian prime minister john howard has already said that mr switkowski has his full support .
radical departure tensions in telstra 's boardroom have been high since the company announced radical departures from its core telecoms business .
telstra 's core businesses are performing sluggishly two months ago , mr mansfield and mr switkowski reportedly propsed making an offer for media group john fairfax holdings .
the plan is believed to have been vetoed by other board members .
the company has also spent 1bn australian dollars -lrb- us $ 735m ; £ 410m -rrb- on classified advertising group trading post and technology services company kaz group .
mr switkowski is determined to diversify telstra 's sources of revenue : as a state-owned company , it is obliged to provide vital but unprofitable telecoms services to rural australia , something it insists is a drag on its performance .
' less risky ' investors were cheered by the departure , hoping that a new chairman would pursue a more cautious approach .
" i think the market is speculating on the increasing probability that the company will revert more to utility-type behaviour , which would increase the cash flow to shareholders and make it appear less risky , " said invesco australia analyst luke sinclair .
the departure was announced after the market closed on wednesday , and its shares closed 3.3 % higher on thursday .

by clare matheson bbc news online business reporter will prospective buyers see prices slump this year ?
earlier this month the bank of england said it was delaying a rate rise - even though it believed prices in the housing market are unsustainable .
the bank 's bearish stance contrasts sharply with a number of surveys which have confounded claims that the bubble is about to burst .
figures from leading mortgage lenders show prices surged early this year after stalling towards the end of 2003 .
but some experts have been flagging up an impending market crash for months .
on tuesday , london fund manager tony dye lived up to his nickname of " dr doom " by forecasting that the present property boom would " end in tears " .
dour predictions mr dye earned the gloomy epithet for his pessimistic predictions - including forecasting the technology market crash , albeit some years before it happened .
now he has turned a similarly jaundiced eye towards the housing market .
" there are signs of a huge boom going on and basically these things always revert to more rational price levels , " he says .
" it 's part of the eternal cycle . "
london prices , he says , are likely to sink by 30 % over the next five years - while a " national decline of the same order " would present little surprise .
he is not the first to tout a drop of such magnitude : city firm durlacher warned in february that buy-to-let investors were crowding first time buyers out of the market .
price rises early this year have taken us all by surprise , but we still maintain the market is overvalued ed stansfield , capital economics its report , bubble trouble , ominously suggested a market crash would be " very messy " .
" we expect transactions to drop sharply , mortgage lending to decrease by 55 % and widespread mis-selling allegations , " the report says , forecasting that the price drop would kick off in the second half of 2004 .
on the face of it , recent government figures appear to back up mr dye 's beliefs .
the latest figures from the office of the deputy prime minister actually showed that prices fell by 1 % in february .
however , many experts discount the odpm data since it is not seasonally adjusted .
nor does it include cash purchases , which make up 25 % of the market .
gradual slowdown ?
capital economics is also taking a pessimistic line , although it has tempered its forecasts somewhat .
late last year , it was predicting a slump for 2004 .
but the group 's ed stansfield says " price rises early this year have taken us all by surprise , but we still maintain the market is overvalued " .
a lack of housing stock has helped push up prices , experts say he adds the prices still need to fall by 20 % , but the market will not show any signs of cooling until november or december , but " more likely 2005 " .
mortgage lenders , in contrast , tend to predict a slow correction in the market , rather than a lurch towards falling prices .
the woolwich says it expects a slowdown - if the bank of england raises rates in the near future , as expected .
the group warns that historically , rates rises have taken time to bite - but once they do , they slow the market down .
andy gray , head of mortgages for the woolwich and barclays , says the slowdown would be underpinned by interest rates .
but other factors would also play their part : house prices are now way ahead of average income , and household accounts would also be stretched by higher council tax bills as well as by the higher mortgages caused by rising interest rates .
" these factors combined will almost certainly dampen housing market activity , " mr gray says .
prices to build martin ellis , chief economist at halifax , agrees that prices are heading for a " gentle slowdown " during the remainder of the year .
but , he adds , pressures which have pushed prices up - such as housing shortages , high employment and historically low interest rates - would remain and so prevent a crash .
" although interest rates are expected to rise they will remain historically low , " he says .
therefore , he says , as a percentage of earnings mortgage repayments will remain on the same level .
but this brand of caution was not for nationwide .
just two weeks ago the uk 's largest building society revised up its forecasts for house price growth in 2004 , to 15 % from an original 9 % .
the upward revision came just days after property website hometrack doubled its 2004 forecast for price rises in england and wales from 4 % to 8 % .
" despite a rise in interest rates , there is little chance of a significant economic downturn this year , " according to group economist alex bannister .
price rises may start to slow toward the end of the year , he says .
but a slump " remains unlikely " .

by clare matheson bbc news online business reporter will prospective buyers see prices slump this year ?
earlier this month the bank of england said it was delaying a rate rise - even though it believed prices in the housing market are unsustainable .
the bank 's bearish stance contrasts sharply with a number of surveys which have confounded claims that the bubble is about to burst .
figures from leading mortgage lenders show prices surged early this year after stalling towards the end of 2003 .
but some experts have been flagging up an impending market crash for months .
on tuesday , london fund manager tony dye lived up to his nickname of " dr doom " by forecasting that the present property boom would " end in tears " .
dour predictions mr dye earned the gloomy epithet for his pessimistic predictions - including forecasting the technology market crash , albeit some years before it happened .
now he has turned a similarly jaundiced eye towards the housing market .
" there are signs of a huge boom going on and basically these things always revert to more rational price levels , " he says .
" it 's part of the eternal cycle . "
london prices , he says , are likely to sink by 30 % over the next five years - while a " national decline of the same order " would present little surprise .
he is not the first to tout a drop of such magnitude : city firm durlacher warned in february that buy-to-let investors were crowding first time buyers out of the market .
price rises early this year have taken us all by surprise , but we still maintain the market is overvalued ed stansfield , capital economics its report , bubble trouble , ominously suggested a market crash would be " very messy " .
" we expect transactions to drop sharply , mortgage lending to decrease by 55 % and widespread mis-selling allegations , " the report says , forecasting that the price drop would kick off in the second half of 2004 .
on the face of it , recent government figures appear to back up mr dye 's beliefs .
the latest figures from the office of the deputy prime minister actually showed that prices fell by 1 % in february .
however , many experts discount the odpm data since it is not seasonally adjusted .
nor does it include cash purchases , which make up 25 % of the market .
gradual slowdown ?
capital economics is also taking a pessimistic line , although it has tempered its forecasts somewhat .

the edition , printed in 1611 , had been expected to fetch up to $ 2m -lrb- £ 1.09m -rrb- .
printed during the writer 's lifetime , it is the earliest available version held by a private collector and was for sale as part of an auction of the estate of mary , viscountess eccles .
" we might have been optimistic , " said francis wahlgren , heads of christie 's book department .
lady eccles , who died in 2003 , assembled her collection over 60 years at her four oaks farm in new jersey .
christie 's described it as " one of the most exceptional private collections of the past century " .
along with first husband david f hyde , she began collecting 17th century books before expanding the collection to include the 18th century .
her extensive samuel johnson collection is now at the houghton library at harvard university .
the world record for both a shakespeare and 17th century book was set in 2001 , when a first edition hamlet sold for £ 3.4m.
christie 's found buyers for 98 % of the books and manuscripts from her estate , which included 10 other shakespeare quartos .
" the bidding actually was excellent - all but on one lot , " wahlgren said .
the third quarto - the final edition published during the bard 's lifetime - has been described as the " gold standard " of shakespearean texts by michael boyd , artistic director of the royal shakespeare company .
