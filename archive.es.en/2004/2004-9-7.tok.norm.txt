" i do n't know what 's going to happen when the film reaches the public , " the 63-year-old swiss actor told the bild am sonntag newspaper .

" if i only hate hitler , then i ca n't open things up for myself .
that only happens with affection , " ganz said .

" " i have been crying for so many days , and i came here to feel that we are actually together , " 57-year-old pensioner vera danilina told the associated press . the demonstration , which was advertised on state-controlled television , was organized by a pro-government trade union and had the kremlin 's approval .
president vladimir putin has called for unity across russia 's sprawling and multi-ethnic landscape .
before the demonstrations , russian tv broadcast well-known actors calling on citizens to attend the demonstration and express their outrage at the siege . there was some criticism of the moscow gathering .
the gazeta.ru web site said participants were " expressing solidarity not with the victims of terrorist acts … but with president vladimir putin " .
public anger has been rising over the authorities ' handling of the siege , which has so far claimed some 335 lives .
some have accused putin of using the rallies to deflect the public outcry . in southern russia , thousands of people took to the streets of vladikavkaz , the north ossetian regional capital about 18 miles to the north of beslan .
there , angry crowds gathered in the central square and called on local leaders to resign for failing to prevent the tragedy . " today we will bury our children and tomorrow we will come here and throw those devils out of their seats , from the lowest director up to ministers and the president , " said one of the speakers , who refused to identify himself to reporters . putin responds in an interview with foreign journalists late on monday , putin denied a link between the beslan hostage crisis and russia 's policies in the southern region of chechnya .
he strongly rejected western calls to enter into negotiations with representatives of chechen rebels . " why do n't you meet with osama bin laden , invite him to brussels or to the white house , engage in talks , ask him what he wants and give it to him so he leaves you in peace ? " the british newspaper the guardian quoted him as saying .
" no one has a moral right to tell us to talk to child killers . " putin also told reporters that the chechen cause is aimed at destabilizing all of southern russia and other predominately muslim regions in the country .
he said the fact that the hostage takers shot children in the back should put an end to foreigners ' questions about russia 's policy in chechnya . at the same time , putin announced that the kremlin would hold an investigation , but it would be internal to prevent a " political show . " the siege in beslan , which ended in explosions , a fire and a gun battle , took at least 335 lives .

" " i have been crying for so many days , and i came here to feel that we are actually together , " 57-year-old pensioner vera danilina told the associated press . the demonstration , which was advertised on state-controlled television , was organized by a pro-government trade union and had the kremlin 's approval .
president vladimir putin has called for unity across russia 's sprawling and multi-ethnic landscape .
before the demonstrations , russian tv broadcast well-known actors calling on citizens to attend the demonstration and express their outrage at the siege . there was some criticism of the moscow gathering .
the gazeta.ru web site said participants were " expressing solidarity not with the victims of terrorist acts … but with president vladimir putin " .
public anger has been rising over the authorities ' handling of the siege , which has so far claimed some 335 lives .
some have accused putin of using the rallies to deflect the public outcry . in southern russia , thousands of people took to the streets of vladikavkaz , the north ossetian regional capital about 18 miles to the north of beslan .
there , angry crowds gathered in the central square and called on local leaders to resign for failing to prevent the tragedy . " today we will bury our children and tomorrow we will come here and throw those devils out of their seats , from the lowest director up to ministers and the president , " said one of the speakers , who refused to identify himself to reporters . putin responds in an interview with foreign journalists late on monday , putin denied a link between the beslan hostage crisis and russia 's policies in the southern region of chechnya .
he strongly rejected western calls to enter into negotiations with representatives of chechen rebels . " why do n't you meet with osama bin laden , invite him to brussels or to the white house , engage in talks , ask him what he wants and give it to him so he leaves you in peace ? " the british newspaper the guardian quoted him as saying .
" no one has a moral right to tell us to talk to child killers . " putin also told reporters that the chechen cause is aimed at destabilizing all of southern russia and other predominately muslim regions in the country .
he said the fact that the hostage takers shot children in the back should put an end to foreigners ' questions about russia 's policy in chechnya . at the same time , putin announced that the kremlin would hold an investigation , but it would be internal to prevent a " political show . " the siege in beslan , which ended in explosions , a fire and a gun battle , took at least 335 lives .
according to the regional health ministry , 156 of those killed were children . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russia mourns beslan tragedy coffins large and small continue to be carried to their final resting places in beslan as the grief emanating from the small caucasian town spreads across russia , prompting fear and anger and raising difficult questions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 07.09.2004 opinion : russia needs international solidarity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : images from the school siege have shocked russia and the world official versions of the hostage drama in north ossetia and the true events on the ground are widely divergent .
yet despite the kremlin 's restrictive policies , russia needs solidarity from the international community . on monday , hundreds of people said goodbye to the victims of the three-day school siege in the town of beslan , while in local hospitals many others continued to fight for their lives .
family members of the victims and survivors of the bloodbath in north ossetia are in despair - all of russia finds itself in mourning - and the world looks on in horror as the full magnitude of the tragedy is slowly revealed .
the hostage numbers are continually being revised upwards and the origin of the hostage takers is still uncertain .
the versions of the events at the violent end the siege are conflicting . there were mistakes on the part of the russian special bildunterschrift : forces , as president putin admitted in a speech .
eyewitnesses report serious failures during the storming of the school .
again , russian journalists are being prevented from providing a comprehensive account of what happened in beslan to the public .
a political debate in the country 's media over the background and consequences of the three-day siege is not taking place . only later did vladimir putin go to the site of these dramatic events , visiting the injured in the hospital and for good reason avoiding any meeting with residents of beslan .
instead , he turned to the russian people in a speech .
but on doing this , president putin , who so loves to present himself as the " man of action , " appeared to be at a loss and even downright petrified . he continues to avoid addressing the real causes of this tragedy - the war in chechnya that has been raging for years , and which is at least partly to blame for the growth of terror tactics and the deaths of many innocent people .
as much as putin would like russians to believe , these are not external conflicts that have been imported into the region .
it is a very russian problem - the independence fight for a small republic in the caucasus - that has fuelled this conflict . the radicals , and especially the determined terrorists in beslan , have only been able to gain ground after the long years of war and bloody conflict in the region have created an army of desperate people .
these are people who have lost everything , whose family members have been tortured and murdered and whose young people know nothing but violence .
these are people who have had to experience unbelievable barbarity from both russians and chechens and now want only one thing : revenge .
at the same time , there is no greater desire among the civilian population than to simply live in peace . beslan is a horrible symbol for a conflict that has long since expanded beyond the borders of chechnya and now threatens to set the entire caucasus region ablaze .
putin must now try to break this vicious circle , with international assistance if necessary .
and the west should be ready to provide it because in the war against terror , russian needs solidarity . cornelia rabitz -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de death toll above 320 in russian school attack while estimates of the number of people killed in the hostage-taking drama in a russian school rose ever higher on saturday , many questions remained unanswered the day after a siege put an end to the crisis .

" our economy has turned the corner .
all forecasts indicate we will reach growth of between 1.5 and 2 percent this year , " he told the assembled members of the bundestag . the finance minister revealed proposals for € 22 billion of new debt to finance expected new investments of € 22.8 billion .
eichel also stated that total government spending would reach € 258 billion in 2005 , about € 1 billion higher than in the current year .
however , his budget draft contained projected privatization proceeds of some € 15 billion next year , which the government hopes will help reign in the budget deficit to back below the eu stability and growth pact 's ceiling of three percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- . cdu calls for eichel to step down germany ’ s conservative opposition criticized eichels figures as wild guesses and accused him of disregarding a number of risks and pitfalls .
the cdu ’ s budget spokesman dietrich austerman spoke of a huge question mark behind predictions of revenues from a controversial highway toll system for trucks , which is to be introduced next year . he also pointed out that the government ’ s labor market reform would run up a bill of at least € 5 billion more than what was planned in the budget .
austerman called on the government to withdraw the budget plan and asked the finance minister to step down . " the budget 2005 epitomizes the failure of red-green budget policy , he says .
it is in violation of the constitution and the eu stability pact because it makes no attempt at consolidation .
it is entirely based on false figures and totally insufficient to boost the economy .
there are incalculable risks that should prompt the government to redo their budget and start all over again . " last week , eichel raised the forecast for this year 's budget deficit , saying declining tax income and increased spending on the unemployed would push the shortfall further beyond european union limits for a third straight year , reaching an estimated 3.7 percent of gdp in 2004 compared with a previous forecast of 3.25 percent published half a year ago . deficit reduction target gets helping hand the ultimate objective of getting the german budget deficit to below eu levels may also get a helping hand from the european commission and its proposed watering down of the hard-line pact .
brussels announced plans last week to make the pact less rigid including paying greater attention to economic developments when setting deadlines for budget cuts , taking account of whether a country 's debts are sustainable , and making greater allowances for the state of the economy . eichel welcomed the proposals drawn up by the european commission , saying the changes would help boost economic growth in europe .
" i can only welcome the proposals put forward by brussels , they 're what i 've been calling for all along , " he said . bundesbank lashes out at commission however , as eichel was addressing the bundestag on tuesday , the bundesbank was lashing out at the european commission 's proposals , arguing that the changes would weaken the stability and growth pact and lead to a worsening of monetary policy conditions in the euro area . " the bundesbank is of the opinion that the proposed changes will not strengthen but weaken the stability pact , " the german central bank said in a statement .
" that would lead to a deterioration of the conditions for monetary policy in the single currency area , " it added , indicating that if governments pursued a policy of loose purse strings in europe , the european central bank might be compelled to react by raising its key interest rates .
" healthy state finances are an important pre-condition for the ecb to guarantee price stability in the long term via relatively low interest rates , " the bundesbank said . the proposed changes " will reduce the incentive for euro zone countries to pursue solid budget policies and , at the same time , send a wrong signal to those countries that have not yet adopted the single currency " , the bank complained .

" our economy has turned the corner .
all forecasts indicate we will reach growth of between 1.5 and 2 percent this year , " he told the assembled members of the bundestag . the finance minister revealed proposals for € 22 billion of new debt to finance expected new investments of € 22.8 billion .
eichel also stated that total government spending would reach € 258 billion in 2005 , about € 1 billion higher than in the current year .
however , his budget draft contained projected privatization proceeds of some € 15 billion next year , which the government hopes will help reign in the budget deficit to back below the eu stability and growth pact 's ceiling of three percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- . cdu calls for eichel to step down germany ’ s conservative opposition criticized eichels figures as wild guesses and accused him of disregarding a number of risks and pitfalls .
the cdu ’ s budget spokesman dietrich austerman spoke of a huge question mark behind predictions of revenues from a controversial highway toll system for trucks , which is to be introduced next year . he also pointed out that the government ’ s labor market reform would run up a bill of at least € 5 billion more than what was planned in the budget .
austerman called on the government to withdraw the budget plan and asked the finance minister to step down . " the budget 2005 epitomizes the failure of red-green budget policy , he says .
it is in violation of the constitution and the eu stability pact because it makes no attempt at consolidation .
it is entirely based on false figures and totally insufficient to boost the economy .
there are incalculable risks that should prompt the government to redo their budget and start all over again . " last week , eichel raised the forecast for this year 's budget deficit , saying declining tax income and increased spending on the unemployed would push the shortfall further beyond european union limits for a third straight year , reaching an estimated 3.7 percent of gdp in 2004 compared with a previous forecast of 3.25 percent published half a year ago . deficit reduction target gets helping hand the ultimate objective of getting the german budget deficit to below eu levels may also get a helping hand from the european commission and its proposed watering down of the hard-line pact .
brussels announced plans last week to make the pact less rigid including paying greater attention to economic developments when setting deadlines for budget cuts , taking account of whether a country 's debts are sustainable , and making greater allowances for the state of the economy . eichel welcomed the proposals drawn up by the european commission , saying the changes would help boost economic growth in europe .
" i can only welcome the proposals put forward by brussels , they 're what i 've been calling for all along , " he said . bundesbank lashes out at commission however , as eichel was addressing the bundestag on tuesday , the bundesbank was lashing out at the european commission 's proposals , arguing that the changes would weaken the stability and growth pact and lead to a worsening of monetary policy conditions in the euro area . " the bundesbank is of the opinion that the proposed changes will not strengthen but weaken the stability pact , " the german central bank said in a statement .
" that would lead to a deterioration of the conditions for monetary policy in the single currency area , " it added , indicating that if governments pursued a policy of loose purse strings in europe , the european central bank might be compelled to react by raising its key interest rates .
" healthy state finances are an important pre-condition for the ecb to guarantee price stability in the long term via relatively low interest rates , " the bundesbank said . the proposed changes " will reduce the incentive for euro zone countries to pursue solid budget policies and , at the same time , send a wrong signal to those countries that have not yet adopted the single currency " , the bank complained .
furthermore , many of the proposals would " make the rules more complicated and complex , thereby impairing its -lrb- the pact 's -rrb- ability to be implemented , " it argued . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european commission to loosen stability pact the european commission on friday unveiled a plan to introduce more flexibility in the stability and growth pact , saying it was vital to restore the credibility of its much-flouted budget discipline rules .

however , his budget draft contained projected privatization proceeds of some € 15 billion next year , which the government hopes will help reign in the budget deficit to back below the eu stability and growth pact 's ceiling of three percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- . cdu calls for eichel to step down germany ’ s conservative opposition criticized eichels figures as wild guesses and accused him of disregarding a number of risks and pitfalls .
the cdu ’ s budget spokesman dietrich austerman spoke of a huge question mark behind predictions of revenues from a controversial highway toll system for trucks , which is to be introduced next year . he also pointed out that the government ’ s labor market reform would run up a bill of at least € 5 billion more than what was planned in the budget .
austerman called on the government to withdraw the budget plan and asked the finance minister to step down . " the budget 2005 epitomizes the failure of red-green budget policy , he says .
it is in violation of the constitution and the eu stability pact because it makes no attempt at consolidation .
it is entirely based on false figures and totally insufficient to boost the economy .
there are incalculable risks that should prompt the government to redo their budget and start all over again . " last week , eichel raised the forecast for this year 's budget deficit , saying declining tax income and increased spending on the unemployed would push the shortfall further beyond european union limits for a third straight year , reaching an estimated 3.7 percent of gdp in 2004 compared with a previous forecast of 3.25 percent published half a year ago . deficit reduction target gets helping hand the ultimate objective of getting the german budget deficit to below eu levels may also get a helping hand from the european commission and its proposed watering down of the hard-line pact .
brussels announced plans last week to make the pact less rigid including paying greater attention to economic developments when setting deadlines for budget cuts , taking account of whether a country 's debts are sustainable , and making greater allowances for the state of the economy . eichel welcomed the proposals drawn up by the european commission , saying the changes would help boost economic growth in europe .
" i can only welcome the proposals put forward by brussels , they 're what i 've been calling for all along , " he said . bundesbank lashes out at commission however , as eichel was addressing the bundestag on tuesday , the bundesbank was lashing out at the european commission 's proposals , arguing that the changes would weaken the stability and growth pact and lead to a worsening of monetary policy conditions in the euro area .

" that would lead to a deterioration of the conditions for monetary policy in the single currency area , " it added , indicating that if governments pursued a policy of loose purse strings in europe , the european central bank might be compelled to react by raising its key interest rates .
" healthy state finances are an important pre-condition for the ecb to guarantee price stability in the long term via relatively low interest rates , " the bundesbank said . the proposed changes " will reduce the incentive for euro zone countries to pursue solid budget policies and , at the same time , send a wrong signal to those countries that have not yet adopted the single currency " , the bank complained .

the eu has been calling on tehran to cooperate more closely with the un . details of the deal between teheran and the un 's international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- were not clear , but diplomats close to the talks have said they would include the production , testing and assembly of centrifuges . centrifuges are used to enrich uranium for power stations and can be enriched further to produce material for atomic bombs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director general of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- mohamed elbaradei talks between iran and the iaea , headed by mohamed el baradei -lrb- photo -rrb- , took place over the weekend .
envoys from the eu 's " big three , " germany , france and britain , followed the discussions closely . " iran said this weekend that they would come back to the suspension .
el baradei is trying to work out the details with the iranians , " a western diplomat told the reuters news agency . iran 's nuclear program has been a cause of concern among western politicians .
the united state has accused teheran of wanting to developing its uranium enrichment program to make material nuclear weapons and wants the un security council to impose sanctions on the country for failing to meet its commitments to the iaea . iran insists that its nuclear program is purely for energy generation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's top nuclear negotiator , hasan rowhani , who heads the supreme national security council , speaks with media during his press conference in tehran , iran , saturday , june 19 , 2004 .
" iran has never pursued nuclear arms but we are serious about having peaceful nuclear technology , " the head of iran 's supreme national security council hassan rowhani told iran 's state television . last year , eu foreign ministers from france , germany and britain convinced iran to suspend its uranium enrichment activities , but in june , teheran reneged on the pledge and resumed the production and testing of nuclear centrifuges .
just last week , it said it intended on processing 37 tons of raw uranium into uranium hexafluoride , the feed material for centrifuges . the possible deal agreed after this weekend 's talks could ease improve the diplomatic situation ahead of the iaea meeting on sept .

the us has preferred to take a hard line with teheran while the europeans have chosen a strategy of diplomatic engagement .
but teheran 's activities have had them worried . " we can not accept of course the development of weapon-grade uranium , " said dutch foreign minister bernard bot , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency .
" that signal should be very strong and should be unanimously given over by the 25 " eu member states . the dutch made the call in a statement late monday night after a visit by iran 's rowhani in amsterdam , where he met with bot and dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende .
the dutch also raised a number of other concerns , including human rights , terrorism and iran 's position towards israel . german foreign minister joschka fischer has also turned up the pressure on iran , saying a nuclear-capable iran " can become a subject for the -lrb- un -rrb- security council . " eu foreign ministers who met over the weekend said they were discussing whether or not to take iran to the un security council to ensure it is not secretly trying to develop atomic weapons .
britain , germany and france are preparing a draft resolution to be presented to the iaea board of governors when it meets next week . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe mum over next step on iran the us says it 's working with europe on a " tough set of resolutions " demanding iran 's compliance on the nuclear issue , but it 's not clear whether europe will abandon its engagement with iran to follow the us position .

eu officials are therefore touring the country to foster a more positive profile . at a series of seminars with the media in the southern cities of bangalore and hyderabad in the past week , held at glitzy locations linked to the country 's booming film industry , eu representatives have pitched for a greater understanding of what the eu does internally , on the global stage and in india itself .
they have had to start with basics by explaining the role taken by the executive european commission in initiating and policing eu legislation and the commission 's often troublesome interplay with the member states .
the distinction is important as in some areas of vital interest to india , notably trade ; the commission is the eu 's voice in international negotiations .
yet in others , such as foreign policy , the commission is powerless with the member states making the running . journalists drawn from southern india confessed to finding the details sometimes baffling and said the eu still has much work to do to establish its relevance to india beyond the trade front .
ordinary indians should be the target audience " the eu needs to do much more to raise public awareness among ordinary indians , by publicizing their important aid work and holding cultural events , " k.n. tilak kumar , chairman of the regional deccan herald newspaper group , told afp .
delegates at the seminars said eu-organized film events showcasing the best of contemporary european cinema had been big hits with indian audiences more used to a solid diet of bollywood fantasy interspersed with hollywood blockbusters .
" if they want the eu to be known here , they have to make news in india , " kumar added .
in-fighting creates a bad image the eu has been making headlines in the indian press , but for all the wrong reasons .
well-publicized rows among member states , such as over iraq , have undermined attempts by the bloc to portray itself as a big player on the world stage .
" you have to have a policy on iraq , the most important foreign policy issue of the day .
having a policy on some things and a non-policy on others is no way of carrying on , " said kumar .
caught at the sharp end are the under-resourced diplomats tasked with flying the eu 's blue starred flag abroad .
drawn from the commission 's external relations department , their work is largely confined to trade negotiations and overseeing aid projects .
for the staff of the new delhi embassy , that work is hugely important given india 's pivotal role as a leader of developing nations at the world trade organization and its status as a sizeable recipient of eu development funds .
they are also keen to promote the eu 's experience in conflict settlement , no small concern here given india 's intractable dispute with pakistan over kashmir . eu funding has made visible differences the € 100 million -lrb- $ 120 million -rrb- of eu grant aid spent annually in india is spread far and wide .
in the slums of mysore near bangalore , an eu-funded project has brought schooling , immunization and basic sanitation to communities where literacy was just 10 percent five years ago and easily preventable diseases were rife , according to the non-governmental organization overseeing the work .
but as eu officials freely admit , such work does not get much publicity in the local press , hence the seminars .
" the eu has an obligation still to explain that it is more than a fortress , the horrifying force behind the wto wanting to take over india .
we need to counter that with an alternative viewpoint , " said robert aarsse , first secretary at the dutch embassy in delhi , whose country holds the bloc 's rotating presidency .
" one thing we stress is that we are multilateral , whereas the us is unilateral .
we want to show india that we are a partner to work with , " he added .
proposed strategic partnership to be discussed at the highest levels of government , the two sides are already well engaged .
ministerial meetings are held regularly , and next month will see the fifth annual eu-india summit , in the dutch capital the hague .
in preparation for the summit , the european commission in june unveiled a new set of proposals designed to entrench a fledgling " strategic partnership " with india .
but for rajendra jain , professor of european studies at delhi 's jawaharlal nehru university , india still prefers to deal one-to-one with the big eu nations such as britain and france , and is " obsessed " by its relations with the united states .
" the indian elite thinks the eu is just not credible as a foreign policy actor , so the eu is not taken seriously , " jain said .
" and in india , the leading eu nations like britain often have their own agendas to promote , so they 're disinclined to give the eu a profile of its own . "
still , if nothing else the eu has covered itself in a sprinkling of glamour by organizing the seminars at a bangalore resort hotel owned by bollywood star sanjay khan and at southern india 's largest film studios outside hyderabad .

eu officials are therefore touring the country to foster a more positive profile . at a series of seminars with the media in the southern cities of bangalore and hyderabad in the past week , held at glitzy locations linked to the country 's booming film industry , eu representatives have pitched for a greater understanding of what the eu does internally , on the global stage and in india itself .
they have had to start with basics by explaining the role taken by the executive european commission in initiating and policing eu legislation and the commission 's often troublesome interplay with the member states .
the distinction is important as in some areas of vital interest to india , notably trade ; the commission is the eu 's voice in international negotiations .
yet in others , such as foreign policy , the commission is powerless with the member states making the running . journalists drawn from southern india confessed to finding the details sometimes baffling and said the eu still has much work to do to establish its relevance to india beyond the trade front .
ordinary indians should be the target audience " the eu needs to do much more to raise public awareness among ordinary indians , by publicizing their important aid work and holding cultural events , " k.n. tilak kumar , chairman of the regional deccan herald newspaper group , told afp .
delegates at the seminars said eu-organized film events showcasing the best of contemporary european cinema had been big hits with indian audiences more used to a solid diet of bollywood fantasy interspersed with hollywood blockbusters .
" if they want the eu to be known here , they have to make news in india , " kumar added .
in-fighting creates a bad image the eu has been making headlines in the indian press , but for all the wrong reasons .
well-publicized rows among member states , such as over iraq , have undermined attempts by the bloc to portray itself as a big player on the world stage .
" you have to have a policy on iraq , the most important foreign policy issue of the day .
having a policy on some things and a non-policy on others is no way of carrying on , " said kumar .
caught at the sharp end are the under-resourced diplomats tasked with flying the eu 's blue starred flag abroad .
drawn from the commission 's external relations department , their work is largely confined to trade negotiations and overseeing aid projects .
for the staff of the new delhi embassy , that work is hugely important given india 's pivotal role as a leader of developing nations at the world trade organization and its status as a sizeable recipient of eu development funds .
they are also keen to promote the eu 's experience in conflict settlement , no small concern here given india 's intractable dispute with pakistan over kashmir . eu funding has made visible differences the € 100 million -lrb- $ 120 million -rrb- of eu grant aid spent annually in india is spread far and wide .
in the slums of mysore near bangalore , an eu-funded project has brought schooling , immunization and basic sanitation to communities where literacy was just 10 percent five years ago and easily preventable diseases were rife , according to the non-governmental organization overseeing the work .
but as eu officials freely admit , such work does not get much publicity in the local press , hence the seminars .
" the eu has an obligation still to explain that it is more than a fortress , the horrifying force behind the wto wanting to take over india .
we need to counter that with an alternative viewpoint , " said robert aarsse , first secretary at the dutch embassy in delhi , whose country holds the bloc 's rotating presidency .
" one thing we stress is that we are multilateral , whereas the us is unilateral .
we want to show india that we are a partner to work with , " he added .
proposed strategic partnership to be discussed at the highest levels of government , the two sides are already well engaged .
ministerial meetings are held regularly , and next month will see the fifth annual eu-india summit , in the dutch capital the hague .
in preparation for the summit , the european commission in june unveiled a new set of proposals designed to entrench a fledgling " strategic partnership " with india .
but for rajendra jain , professor of european studies at delhi 's jawaharlal nehru university , india still prefers to deal one-to-one with the big eu nations such as britain and france , and is " obsessed " by its relations with the united states .
" the indian elite thinks the eu is just not credible as a foreign policy actor , so the eu is not taken seriously , " jain said .
" and in india , the leading eu nations like britain often have their own agendas to promote , so they 're disinclined to give the eu a profile of its own . "
still , if nothing else the eu has covered itself in a sprinkling of glamour by organizing the seminars at a bangalore resort hotel owned by bollywood star sanjay khan and at southern india 's largest film studios outside hyderabad .

yet despite the kremlin 's restrictive policies , russia needs solidarity from the international community . on monday , hundreds of people said goodbye to the victims of the three-day school siege in the town of beslan , while in local hospitals many others continued to fight for their lives .
family members of the victims and survivors of the bloodbath in north ossetia are in despair - all of russia finds itself in mourning - and the world looks on in horror as the full magnitude of the tragedy is slowly revealed .
the hostage numbers are continually being revised upwards and the origin of the hostage takers is still uncertain .
the versions of the events at the violent end the siege are conflicting . there were mistakes on the part of the russian special bildunterschrift : forces , as president putin admitted in a speech .
eyewitnesses report serious failures during the storming of the school .
again , russian journalists are being prevented from providing a comprehensive account of what happened in beslan to the public .
a political debate in the country 's media over the background and consequences of the three-day siege is not taking place . only later did vladimir putin go to the site of these dramatic events , visiting the injured in the hospital and for good reason avoiding any meeting with residents of beslan .
instead , he turned to the russian people in a speech .
but on doing this , president putin , who so loves to present himself as the " man of action , " appeared to be at a loss and even downright petrified . he continues to avoid addressing the real causes of this tragedy - the war in chechnya that has been raging for years , and which is at least partly to blame for the growth of terror tactics and the deaths of many innocent people .
as much as putin would like russians to believe , these are not external conflicts that have been imported into the region .
it is a very russian problem - the independence fight for a small republic in the caucasus - that has fuelled this conflict . the radicals , and especially the determined terrorists in beslan , have only been able to gain ground after the long years of war and bloody conflict in the region have created an army of desperate people .
these are people who have lost everything , whose family members have been tortured and murdered and whose young people know nothing but violence .
these are people who have had to experience unbelievable barbarity from both russians and chechens and now want only one thing : revenge .
at the same time , there is no greater desire among the civilian population than to simply live in peace . beslan is a horrible symbol for a conflict that has long since expanded beyond the borders of chechnya and now threatens to set the entire caucasus region ablaze .
putin must now try to break this vicious circle , with international assistance if necessary .

yet despite the kremlin 's restrictive policies , russia needs solidarity from the international community . on monday , hundreds of people said goodbye to the victims of the three-day school siege in the town of beslan , while in local hospitals many others continued to fight for their lives .
family members of the victims and survivors of the bloodbath in north ossetia are in despair - all of russia finds itself in mourning - and the world looks on in horror as the full magnitude of the tragedy is slowly revealed .
the hostage numbers are continually being revised upwards and the origin of the hostage takers is still uncertain .
the versions of the events at the violent end the siege are conflicting . there were mistakes on the part of the russian special bildunterschrift : forces , as president putin admitted in a speech .
eyewitnesses report serious failures during the storming of the school .
again , russian journalists are being prevented from providing a comprehensive account of what happened in beslan to the public .
a political debate in the country 's media over the background and consequences of the three-day siege is not taking place . only later did vladimir putin go to the site of these dramatic events , visiting the injured in the hospital and for good reason avoiding any meeting with residents of beslan .
instead , he turned to the russian people in a speech .
but on doing this , president putin , who so loves to present himself as the " man of action , " appeared to be at a loss and even downright petrified . he continues to avoid addressing the real causes of this tragedy - the war in chechnya that has been raging for years , and which is at least partly to blame for the growth of terror tactics and the deaths of many innocent people .
as much as putin would like russians to believe , these are not external conflicts that have been imported into the region .
it is a very russian problem - the independence fight for a small republic in the caucasus - that has fuelled this conflict . the radicals , and especially the determined terrorists in beslan , have only been able to gain ground after the long years of war and bloody conflict in the region have created an army of desperate people .
these are people who have lost everything , whose family members have been tortured and murdered and whose young people know nothing but violence .
these are people who have had to experience unbelievable barbarity from both russians and chechens and now want only one thing : revenge .
at the same time , there is no greater desire among the civilian population than to simply live in peace . beslan is a horrible symbol for a conflict that has long since expanded beyond the borders of chechnya and now threatens to set the entire caucasus region ablaze .
putin must now try to break this vicious circle , with international assistance if necessary .

sometimes actors play such powerful roles or infamous characters they get typecast for the rest of their careers .
bruno ganz is worried about falling into that trap after playing the ultimate bad guy - adolf hitler . " the downfall - hitler and the end of the third reich " tells the story of the dictator as a tragic human being , not just a monster , and ganz 's exceptional acting ability has him concerned how he 'll be seen after the film , which portrays the last 12 day of hitler 's life in a berlin bunker , opens on sept .
16 .
" i do n't know what 's going to happen when the film reaches the public , " the 63-year-old swiss actor told the bild am sonntag newspaper .
" there could be some mistaken or disturbed people who confuse me with hitler . "
if critics are to be believed , he may have something to worry about .
while many wonder if the time is right , or could ever be right , for a film showing hitler as a human being , commentators agree ganz 's portrayal is right on target .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ganz as hitler " ganz is hitler , " said historian joachim fest , whose biography of the nazi leader the film drew on .
ganz needed a long time before deciding to take the role , and his son was nearly successful in dissuading him when he said it would n't be healthy " to enter a sick person 's mind for so long . "
but upon seeing himself made up as hitler , complete with his famous moustache , ganz was convinced him to take his first leading role in a german movie in 16 years .
but hairpieces and uniforms were n't enough to allow ganz to convincingly portray the austrian-born " führer , " he also had to get into the mass murderer 's head .
" if i only hate hitler , then i ca n't open things up for myself .
that only happens with affection , " ganz said .
" i was forced to develop an understanding for the man .
i 'm not ashamed of the fact that i was able to feel sympathy for him during fleeting seconds . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from " the downfall " moments of understanding are okay , according to the producer of " the downfall , " bernd eichinger .
but if viewers walk away after the movie 's more that two hours feeling general sympathy for hitler , then " the film has failed in its intention . "
after the € 13.5 million -lrb- $ 16.3 million -rrb- film ends it run in theaters , ganz wants to put the typecast theory to the test .
he said for his next project he 'd like a part in a comedy . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de film portrays hitler in human light adolf hitler spent his last days in an underground bunker in berlin amid a combination of fear and unreality .

eu officials are therefore touring the country to foster a more positive profile . at a series of seminars with the media in the southern cities of bangalore and hyderabad in the past week , held at glitzy locations linked to the country 's booming film industry , eu representatives have pitched for a greater understanding of what the eu does internally , on the global stage and in india itself .
they have had to start with basics by explaining the role taken by the executive european commission in initiating and policing eu legislation and the commission 's often troublesome interplay with the member states .
the distinction is important as in some areas of vital interest to india , notably trade ; the commission is the eu 's voice in international negotiations .
yet in others , such as foreign policy , the commission is powerless with the member states making the running . journalists drawn from southern india confessed to finding the details sometimes baffling and said the eu still has much work to do to establish its relevance to india beyond the trade front .
ordinary indians should be the target audience " the eu needs to do much more to raise public awareness among ordinary indians , by publicizing their important aid work and holding cultural events , " k.n. tilak kumar , chairman of the regional deccan herald newspaper group , told afp .
delegates at the seminars said eu-organized film events showcasing the best of contemporary european cinema had been big hits with indian audiences more used to a solid diet of bollywood fantasy interspersed with hollywood blockbusters .
" if they want the eu to be known here , they have to make news in india , " kumar added .
in-fighting creates a bad image the eu has been making headlines in the indian press , but for all the wrong reasons .
well-publicized rows among member states , such as over iraq , have undermined attempts by the bloc to portray itself as a big player on the world stage .
" you have to have a policy on iraq , the most important foreign policy issue of the day .
having a policy on some things and a non-policy on others is no way of carrying on , " said kumar .
caught at the sharp end are the under-resourced diplomats tasked with flying the eu 's blue starred flag abroad .
drawn from the commission 's external relations department , their work is largely confined to trade negotiations and overseeing aid projects .
for the staff of the new delhi embassy , that work is hugely important given india 's pivotal role as a leader of developing nations at the world trade organization and its status as a sizeable recipient of eu development funds .
they are also keen to promote the eu 's experience in conflict settlement , no small concern here given india 's intractable dispute with pakistan over kashmir . eu funding has made visible differences the € 100 million -lrb- $ 120 million -rrb- of eu grant aid spent annually in india is spread far and wide .
in the slums of mysore near bangalore , an eu-funded project has brought schooling , immunization and basic sanitation to communities where literacy was just 10 percent five years ago and easily preventable diseases were rife , according to the non-governmental organization overseeing the work .
but as eu officials freely admit , such work does not get much publicity in the local press , hence the seminars .
" the eu has an obligation still to explain that it is more than a fortress , the horrifying force behind the wto wanting to take over india .
we need to counter that with an alternative viewpoint , " said robert aarsse , first secretary at the dutch embassy in delhi , whose country holds the bloc 's rotating presidency .
" one thing we stress is that we are multilateral , whereas the us is unilateral .
we want to show india that we are a partner to work with , " he added .
proposed strategic partnership to be discussed at the highest levels of government , the two sides are already well engaged .
ministerial meetings are held regularly , and next month will see the fifth annual eu-india summit , in the dutch capital the hague .
in preparation for the summit , the european commission in june unveiled a new set of proposals designed to entrench a fledgling " strategic partnership " with india .
but for rajendra jain , professor of european studies at delhi 's jawaharlal nehru university , india still prefers to deal one-to-one with the big eu nations such as britain and france , and is " obsessed " by its relations with the united states .
" the indian elite thinks the eu is just not credible as a foreign policy actor , so the eu is not taken seriously , " jain said .
" and in india , the leading eu nations like britain often have their own agendas to promote , so they 're disinclined to give the eu a profile of its own . "
still , if nothing else the eu has covered itself in a sprinkling of glamour by organizing the seminars at a bangalore resort hotel owned by bollywood star sanjay khan and at southern india 's largest film studios outside hyderabad .
it must now hope the stardust translates into more upbeat press coverage . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer finds few backers for un seat german foreign minister joschka fischer wrapped up his 10-day trip to asia on friday .

" the downfall - hitler and the end of the third reich " tells the story of the dictator as a tragic human being , not just a monster , and ganz 's exceptional acting ability has him concerned how he 'll be seen after the film , which portrays the last 12 day of hitler 's life in a berlin bunker , opens on sept .
16 .

eu officials are therefore touring the country to foster a more positive profile . at a series of seminars with the media in the southern cities of bangalore and hyderabad in the past week , held at glitzy locations linked to the country 's booming film industry , eu representatives have pitched for a greater understanding of what the eu does internally , on the global stage and in india itself .
they have had to start with basics by explaining the role taken by the executive european commission in initiating and policing eu legislation and the commission 's often troublesome interplay with the member states .
the distinction is important as in some areas of vital interest to india , notably trade ; the commission is the eu 's voice in international negotiations .
yet in others , such as foreign policy , the commission is powerless with the member states making the running . journalists drawn from southern india confessed to finding the details sometimes baffling and said the eu still has much work to do to establish its relevance to india beyond the trade front .
ordinary indians should be the target audience " the eu needs to do much more to raise public awareness among ordinary indians , by publicizing their important aid work and holding cultural events , " k.n. tilak kumar , chairman of the regional deccan herald newspaper group , told afp .
delegates at the seminars said eu-organized film events showcasing the best of contemporary european cinema had been big hits with indian audiences more used to a solid diet of bollywood fantasy interspersed with hollywood blockbusters .
" if they want the eu to be known here , they have to make news in india , " kumar added .
in-fighting creates a bad image the eu has been making headlines in the indian press , but for all the wrong reasons .
well-publicized rows among member states , such as over iraq , have undermined attempts by the bloc to portray itself as a big player on the world stage .
" you have to have a policy on iraq , the most important foreign policy issue of the day .
having a policy on some things and a non-policy on others is no way of carrying on , " said kumar .
caught at the sharp end are the under-resourced diplomats tasked with flying the eu 's blue starred flag abroad .
drawn from the commission 's external relations department , their work is largely confined to trade negotiations and overseeing aid projects .
for the staff of the new delhi embassy , that work is hugely important given india 's pivotal role as a leader of developing nations at the world trade organization and its status as a sizeable recipient of eu development funds .
they are also keen to promote the eu 's experience in conflict settlement , no small concern here given india 's intractable dispute with pakistan over kashmir . eu funding has made visible differences the € 100 million -lrb- $ 120 million -rrb- of eu grant aid spent annually in india is spread far and wide .
in the slums of mysore near bangalore , an eu-funded project has brought schooling , immunization and basic sanitation to communities where literacy was just 10 percent five years ago and easily preventable diseases were rife , according to the non-governmental organization overseeing the work .
but as eu officials freely admit , such work does not get much publicity in the local press , hence the seminars .
" the eu has an obligation still to explain that it is more than a fortress , the horrifying force behind the wto wanting to take over india .
we need to counter that with an alternative viewpoint , " said robert aarsse , first secretary at the dutch embassy in delhi , whose country holds the bloc 's rotating presidency .
" one thing we stress is that we are multilateral , whereas the us is unilateral .
we want to show india that we are a partner to work with , " he added .
proposed strategic partnership to be discussed at the highest levels of government , the two sides are already well engaged .
ministerial meetings are held regularly , and next month will see the fifth annual eu-india summit , in the dutch capital the hague .
in preparation for the summit , the european commission in june unveiled a new set of proposals designed to entrench a fledgling " strategic partnership " with india .
but for rajendra jain , professor of european studies at delhi 's jawaharlal nehru university , india still prefers to deal one-to-one with the big eu nations such as britain and france , and is " obsessed " by its relations with the united states .
" the indian elite thinks the eu is just not credible as a foreign policy actor , so the eu is not taken seriously , " jain said .
" and in india , the leading eu nations like britain often have their own agendas to promote , so they 're disinclined to give the eu a profile of its own . "
still , if nothing else the eu has covered itself in a sprinkling of glamour by organizing the seminars at a bangalore resort hotel owned by bollywood star sanjay khan and at southern india 's largest film studios outside hyderabad .

in the slums of mysore near bangalore , an eu-funded project has brought schooling , immunization and basic sanitation to communities where literacy was just 10 percent five years ago and easily preventable diseases were rife , according to the non-governmental organization overseeing the work .
but as eu officials freely admit , such work does not get much publicity in the local press , hence the seminars .
" the eu has an obligation still to explain that it is more than a fortress , the horrifying force behind the wto wanting to take over india .
we need to counter that with an alternative viewpoint , " said robert aarsse , first secretary at the dutch embassy in delhi , whose country holds the bloc 's rotating presidency .
" one thing we stress is that we are multilateral , whereas the us is unilateral .
we want to show india that we are a partner to work with , " he added .
proposed strategic partnership to be discussed at the highest levels of government , the two sides are already well engaged .
ministerial meetings are held regularly , and next month will see the fifth annual eu-india summit , in the dutch capital the hague .
in preparation for the summit , the european commission in june unveiled a new set of proposals designed to entrench a fledgling " strategic partnership " with india .
but for rajendra jain , professor of european studies at delhi 's jawaharlal nehru university , india still prefers to deal one-to-one with the big eu nations such as britain and france , and is " obsessed " by its relations with the united states .
" the indian elite thinks the eu is just not credible as a foreign policy actor , so the eu is not taken seriously , " jain said .
" and in india , the leading eu nations like britain often have their own agendas to promote , so they 're disinclined to give the eu a profile of its own . "
still , if nothing else the eu has covered itself in a sprinkling of glamour by organizing the seminars at a bangalore resort hotel owned by bollywood star sanjay khan and at southern india 's largest film studios outside hyderabad .

sometimes actors play such powerful roles or infamous characters they get typecast for the rest of their careers .
bruno ganz is worried about falling into that trap after playing the ultimate bad guy - adolf hitler . " the downfall - hitler and the end of the third reich " tells the story of the dictator as a tragic human being , not just a monster , and ganz 's exceptional acting ability has him concerned how he 'll be seen after the film , which portrays the last 12 day of hitler 's life in a berlin bunker , opens on sept .
16 .
" i do n't know what 's going to happen when the film reaches the public , " the 63-year-old swiss actor told the bild am sonntag newspaper .
" there could be some mistaken or disturbed people who confuse me with hitler . "
if critics are to be believed , he may have something to worry about .
while many wonder if the time is right , or could ever be right , for a film showing hitler as a human being , commentators agree ganz 's portrayal is right on target .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ganz as hitler " ganz is hitler , " said historian joachim fest , whose biography of the nazi leader the film drew on .
ganz needed a long time before deciding to take the role , and his son was nearly successful in dissuading him when he said it would n't be healthy " to enter a sick person 's mind for so long . "
but upon seeing himself made up as hitler , complete with his famous moustache , ganz was convinced him to take his first leading role in a german movie in 16 years .
but hairpieces and uniforms were n't enough to allow ganz to convincingly portray the austrian-born " führer , " he also had to get into the mass murderer 's head .
" if i only hate hitler , then i ca n't open things up for myself .
that only happens with affection , " ganz said .
" i was forced to develop an understanding for the man .
i 'm not ashamed of the fact that i was able to feel sympathy for him during fleeting seconds . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from " the downfall " moments of understanding are okay , according to the producer of " the downfall , " bernd eichinger .
but if viewers walk away after the movie 's more that two hours feeling general sympathy for hitler , then " the film has failed in its intention . "
after the € 13.5 million -lrb- $ 16.3 million -rrb- film ends it run in theaters , ganz wants to put the typecast theory to the test .
he said for his next project he 'd like a part in a comedy . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de film portrays hitler in human light adolf hitler spent his last days in an underground bunker in berlin amid a combination of fear and unreality .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 07.09.2004 how to say ' fast food ' in polish großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they may not have polska kielbasa , but milk bars offer good eating though they 've become less prosperous since the fall of the iron curtain , many in poland would rather have a cheap healthy meal at a local milk bar than a big mac . today when polish got out to eat they can be overwhelmed by a blitz of possibilities ranging from michelin-starred restaurants to chinese take-aways to western fast food chains .
but this culinary diversity is something that only emerged after the iron curtain fell in 1989 .
before that , when poles did n't feel like slaving behind the stove , they did n't hop in the car and head for the nearest golden arches - instead they hopped on over to their local government-subsidized milk bars -lrb- bar mleczny -rrb- for a quick repast and a night on the town .
mcstate subsidized subsidized by the government , the milk bars served as an important social outlet under poland 's communist government .
the socialist idea behind the bars was to provide each worker and citizen with the possibility of an affordable warm meal .
people from all walks of life frequented the milk bars - and many still do .
and though the name may evoke images of bovine creations , the milk bars did n't just sell milk or ice cream .
you could also get a balanced , square meal .
but the meals did tend to rely heavily on dairy products for their inspiration .
during the peak of communism , self-service restaurants like milk bars could be found throughout the eastern bloc .
in the former east germany , for example , they could be found in most cities .
but today they have vanished from most countries except poland .
competition for the burger industry with the onslaught of western fast food and diminishing government subsidies , poland 's tradition of milk bars has struggled in recent years , with many going out of business .
but in the country 's metropolises , like warsaw or gdansk , milk bars are still trendy hangouts .
and though they now have to compete with fast food and kebab stands , the polish government wants to keep them in business and backs them to the tune of several million euros in subsidies each year .
with their low prices , the milk bars are attracting a growing number of students and pensioners .
with meals costing as little as € 1 to € 4 , the prices are attractive .
still , the hunt for a bargain is n't the only thing that draws people to the milk bars .
patrick szymanski , a 23-year-old student , eats in a milk bar every day and he loves warsaw 's milk bars , because he does n't have to do any cooking or clean-up .
" in former times there were as many milk bars as there are coffee shops now .
but now there are almost only kebab shops and asian takeaways , " recalled a guy named janusz , a 66-year-old warsaw native who was eating lunch with his friend bogdan at bar studencki , a traditional milk bar at the university of warsaw .
janusz said he 'd rather dig into a milk bar 's traditional fare of soup and potato-filled piroshkis than go to a fast food chain .
" it tastes almost as good as my wife 's cooking , " asserts the 59-year-old bodgan .
" i like the polish kitchen .
unlike fast food , it 's actually healthy , " said a friend of bodgan 's .
a cult following for many polish youngsters , who have long forgotten the days of long queing lines and food rations under communism , milk bars have gained cult status .
for some old enough to remember communism , it 's one of the friendlier reminders of poland 's socialist past .
but others , like janusz and bogdan have a simpler reason for hanging out at the milk bars .

but this culinary diversity is something that only emerged after the iron curtain fell in 1989 .
before that , when poles did n't feel like slaving behind the stove , they did n't hop in the car and head for the nearest golden arches - instead they hopped on over to their local government-subsidized milk bars -lrb- bar mleczny -rrb- for a quick repast and a night on the town .
mcstate subsidized subsidized by the government , the milk bars served as an important social outlet under poland 's communist government .
the socialist idea behind the bars was to provide each worker and citizen with the possibility of an affordable warm meal .
people from all walks of life frequented the milk bars - and many still do .
and though the name may evoke images of bovine creations , the milk bars did n't just sell milk or ice cream .
you could also get a balanced , square meal .
but the meals did tend to rely heavily on dairy products for their inspiration .
during the peak of communism , self-service restaurants like milk bars could be found throughout the eastern bloc .
in the former east germany , for example , they could be found in most cities .
but today they have vanished from most countries except poland .
competition for the burger industry with the onslaught of western fast food and diminishing government subsidies , poland 's tradition of milk bars has struggled in recent years , with many going out of business .
but in the country 's metropolises , like warsaw or gdansk , milk bars are still trendy hangouts .
and though they now have to compete with fast food and kebab stands , the polish government wants to keep them in business and backs them to the tune of several million euros in subsidies each year .
with their low prices , the milk bars are attracting a growing number of students and pensioners .
with meals costing as little as € 1 to € 4 , the prices are attractive .
still , the hunt for a bargain is n't the only thing that draws people to the milk bars .
patrick szymanski , a 23-year-old student , eats in a milk bar every day and he loves warsaw 's milk bars , because he does n't have to do any cooking or clean-up .
" in former times there were as many milk bars as there are coffee shops now .
but now there are almost only kebab shops and asian takeaways , " recalled a guy named janusz , a 66-year-old warsaw native who was eating lunch with his friend bogdan at bar studencki , a traditional milk bar at the university of warsaw .
janusz said he 'd rather dig into a milk bar 's traditional fare of soup and potato-filled piroshkis than go to a fast food chain .
" it tastes almost as good as my wife 's cooking , " asserts the 59-year-old bodgan .
" i like the polish kitchen .
unlike fast food , it 's actually healthy , " said a friend of bodgan 's .
a cult following for many polish youngsters , who have long forgotten the days of long queing lines and food rations under communism , milk bars have gained cult status .
for some old enough to remember communism , it 's one of the friendlier reminders of poland 's socialist past .
but others , like janusz and bogdan have a simpler reason for hanging out at the milk bars .

just do n't expect any fancy stuff - not from the germans anyway . world champions brazil take on germany in a friendly game in berlin on wednesday .
the prestigious match carries little importance to the home side other than it represents a chance to exact revenge on the samba stars who ruined their improbable world cup dream two years ago by beating them 2-0 in yokohama in the 2002 final . germany as hosts for the 2006 world cup are automatically installed in the tournament while recent rule changes dictate that reigning world champions brazil have to qualify for the right to defend their crown .
brazil will arrive in germany after beating bolivia 3-1 in a world cup qualifier in sao paulo and will view the match as a chance to keep the team ’ s momentum ahead of more demanding and important clashes in the south american qualifying group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn prays for the yokohama pitch to open up in the world cup final 2002 .
for germany , however , it will be the first opportunity since the world cup final to regain their pride against ronaldo and co .
after progressing against the odds to the showpiece finale in japan , the germans felt aggrieved that they did not take the chance to claim a famous victory and a fourth world cup . but for those expecting a german fairytale ending on wednesday , the recent words of team captain michael ballack may already have dampened the spirits of fans hoping for an exhibition display from the home side . ballack forgoes beauty for success midfielder ballack told the german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung on sunday that germany do not need to play a " beautiful game " to succeed and should focus instead on developing a winning mentality .
" one does n't have to play beautiful football .
success is what counts . " someone may want to remind ballack that the current germany team has lacked both beauty and success of late .
germany have not beaten a major soccer power in their last nine matches and were dumped out of the recent european championships after the first round .
the last time the germans beat a top-level side was october 7 , 2000 when they secured a 1-0 victory over england .
after that , they lost 1-0 to france , 5-1 to england and 1-0 to argentina in the run-up to the 2002 world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack scores past south korean goalkeeper lee woon jae during the 2002 world cup semi-final .
then in japan / korea , germany beat paraguay , the united states and south korea before losing in the final .
since then , they have gone down 3-1 to the netherlands , 3-1 to spain , 1-0 to italy and 3-0 to france .
they then drew 1-1 against the netherlands at euro 2004 .
a victory over brazil may not be impossible but the statistics suggest a win would be unlikely , an attractive one even less so . brazil buzzing with invention in contrast , the brazilians arrive in berlin this week on the back of a splendid display of inspirational soccer against bolivia and bring with them a restored reputation as the harlem globetrotters of the international game . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronaldo real madrid striker and germany ’ s world cup final nemesis ronaldo had promised fans a gala in sao paulo .
and brazil did not fail to deliver .
ronaldo himself opened the scoring with a blistering volley before the game was even a minute old .
the game then turned into an exhibition of art-soccer when ronaldinho fired a 12th minute penalty into the lower left corner for a 2-0 lead .
and just before half-time , copa america hero adriano leaped above the bolivian backline to head in a cross from ronaldinho to make it 3-0 . " it was a good result and an excellent performance , " said ronaldo at the post-match press conference .
" we have every reason to be happy .
it was marvelous .
we played excellent soccer and we 're the leaders of the group . "
the win puts brazil ahead of argentina in the group and their world cup campaign in motion . despite the feel-good factor running through the brazilian team after sunday ’ s win , there will be a cloud hanging over the samba stars when they arrive in germany . club restrictions lead to player ban bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucio .
some of brazil 's most exciting and established players will not be on view in berlin on wednesday .
the five players who did not play in brazil 's friendly international in haiti on the august 18 were left out of the bolivia game and will also be excluded for the germany clash .
ac milan players cafu , kaka and dida , along with bayer leverkusen 's lucio -lrb- photo -rrb- and ze roberto have been punished by the brazilian football federation -lrb- cbf -rrb- for not appearing in brazil 's 6-0 victory at port-au-prince .
the stars were absent after not being released by their clubs for the haiti game .
ronaldo has been quoted as supporting the decision , saying that the cbf wanted to preserve the honor of those who wear brazil 's green and yellow colors .
however , ronaldo 's team mate in the spanish capital , fellow galactico roberto carlos , was not of the same opinion , saying : " the federations and the clubs have to work together . "
the brazil captain added the five excluded players would have loved to be playing for brazil .
there is a feeling that the situation may stoke the fires of a simmering club-versus-country row with the affected players unhappy at their own clubs insistence that they remain with the domestic squad when brazil has issued call-ups . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de club versus country row mars brazil 's visit germany 's next game in its world cup preparations will be a friendly against brazil on wednesday .

just do n't expect any fancy stuff - not from the germans anyway . world champions brazil take on germany in a friendly game in berlin on wednesday .
the prestigious match carries little importance to the home side other than it represents a chance to exact revenge on the samba stars who ruined their improbable world cup dream two years ago by beating them 2-0 in yokohama in the 2002 final . germany as hosts for the 2006 world cup are automatically installed in the tournament while recent rule changes dictate that reigning world champions brazil have to qualify for the right to defend their crown .
brazil will arrive in germany after beating bolivia 3-1 in a world cup qualifier in sao paulo and will view the match as a chance to keep the team ’ s momentum ahead of more demanding and important clashes in the south american qualifying group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn prays for the yokohama pitch to open up in the world cup final 2002 .
for germany , however , it will be the first opportunity since the world cup final to regain their pride against ronaldo and co .
after progressing against the odds to the showpiece finale in japan , the germans felt aggrieved that they did not take the chance to claim a famous victory and a fourth world cup . but for those expecting a german fairytale ending on wednesday , the recent words of team captain michael ballack may already have dampened the spirits of fans hoping for an exhibition display from the home side . ballack forgoes beauty for success midfielder ballack told the german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung on sunday that germany do not need to play a " beautiful game " to succeed and should focus instead on developing a winning mentality .
" one does n't have to play beautiful football .
success is what counts . " someone may want to remind ballack that the current germany team has lacked both beauty and success of late .
germany have not beaten a major soccer power in their last nine matches and were dumped out of the recent european championships after the first round .
the last time the germans beat a top-level side was october 7 , 2000 when they secured a 1-0 victory over england .
after that , they lost 1-0 to france , 5-1 to england and 1-0 to argentina in the run-up to the 2002 world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack scores past south korean goalkeeper lee woon jae during the 2002 world cup semi-final .

but this culinary diversity is something that only emerged after the iron curtain fell in 1989 .
before that , when poles did n't feel like slaving behind the stove , they did n't hop in the car and head for the nearest golden arches - instead they hopped on over to their local government-subsidized milk bars -lrb- bar mleczny -rrb- for a quick repast and a night on the town .
mcstate subsidized subsidized by the government , the milk bars served as an important social outlet under poland 's communist government .
the socialist idea behind the bars was to provide each worker and citizen with the possibility of an affordable warm meal .
people from all walks of life frequented the milk bars - and many still do .
and though the name may evoke images of bovine creations , the milk bars did n't just sell milk or ice cream .
you could also get a balanced , square meal .
but the meals did tend to rely heavily on dairy products for their inspiration .
during the peak of communism , self-service restaurants like milk bars could be found throughout the eastern bloc .
in the former east germany , for example , they could be found in most cities .
but today they have vanished from most countries except poland .
competition for the burger industry with the onslaught of western fast food and diminishing government subsidies , poland 's tradition of milk bars has struggled in recent years , with many going out of business .
but in the country 's metropolises , like warsaw or gdansk , milk bars are still trendy hangouts .
and though they now have to compete with fast food and kebab stands , the polish government wants to keep them in business and backs them to the tune of several million euros in subsidies each year .
with their low prices , the milk bars are attracting a growing number of students and pensioners .
with meals costing as little as € 1 to € 4 , the prices are attractive .
still , the hunt for a bargain is n't the only thing that draws people to the milk bars .
patrick szymanski , a 23-year-old student , eats in a milk bar every day and he loves warsaw 's milk bars , because he does n't have to do any cooking or clean-up .
" in former times there were as many milk bars as there are coffee shops now .
but now there are almost only kebab shops and asian takeaways , " recalled a guy named janusz , a 66-year-old warsaw native who was eating lunch with his friend bogdan at bar studencki , a traditional milk bar at the university of warsaw .
janusz said he 'd rather dig into a milk bar 's traditional fare of soup and potato-filled piroshkis than go to a fast food chain .
" it tastes almost as good as my wife 's cooking , " asserts the 59-year-old bodgan .
" i like the polish kitchen .
unlike fast food , it 's actually healthy , " said a friend of bodgan 's .
a cult following for many polish youngsters , who have long forgotten the days of long queing lines and food rations under communism , milk bars have gained cult status .
for some old enough to remember communism , it 's one of the friendlier reminders of poland 's socialist past .
but others , like janusz and bogdan have a simpler reason for hanging out at the milk bars .

but this culinary diversity is something that only emerged after the iron curtain fell in 1989 .
before that , when poles did n't feel like slaving behind the stove , they did n't hop in the car and head for the nearest golden arches - instead they hopped on over to their local government-subsidized milk bars -lrb- bar mleczny -rrb- for a quick repast and a night on the town .
mcstate subsidized subsidized by the government , the milk bars served as an important social outlet under poland 's communist government .
the socialist idea behind the bars was to provide each worker and citizen with the possibility of an affordable warm meal .
people from all walks of life frequented the milk bars - and many still do .
and though the name may evoke images of bovine creations , the milk bars did n't just sell milk or ice cream .
you could also get a balanced , square meal .
but the meals did tend to rely heavily on dairy products for their inspiration .
during the peak of communism , self-service restaurants like milk bars could be found throughout the eastern bloc .
in the former east germany , for example , they could be found in most cities .
but today they have vanished from most countries except poland .
competition for the burger industry with the onslaught of western fast food and diminishing government subsidies , poland 's tradition of milk bars has struggled in recent years , with many going out of business .
but in the country 's metropolises , like warsaw or gdansk , milk bars are still trendy hangouts .
and though they now have to compete with fast food and kebab stands , the polish government wants to keep them in business and backs them to the tune of several million euros in subsidies each year .
with their low prices , the milk bars are attracting a growing number of students and pensioners .
with meals costing as little as € 1 to € 4 , the prices are attractive .
still , the hunt for a bargain is n't the only thing that draws people to the milk bars .
patrick szymanski , a 23-year-old student , eats in a milk bar every day and he loves warsaw 's milk bars , because he does n't have to do any cooking or clean-up .
" in former times there were as many milk bars as there are coffee shops now .
but now there are almost only kebab shops and asian takeaways , " recalled a guy named janusz , a 66-year-old warsaw native who was eating lunch with his friend bogdan at bar studencki , a traditional milk bar at the university of warsaw .
janusz said he 'd rather dig into a milk bar 's traditional fare of soup and potato-filled piroshkis than go to a fast food chain .
" it tastes almost as good as my wife 's cooking , " asserts the 59-year-old bodgan .
" i like the polish kitchen .
unlike fast food , it 's actually healthy , " said a friend of bodgan 's .
a cult following for many polish youngsters , who have long forgotten the days of long queing lines and food rations under communism , milk bars have gained cult status .
for some old enough to remember communism , it 's one of the friendlier reminders of poland 's socialist past .
but others , like janusz and bogdan have a simpler reason for hanging out at the milk bars .

just do n't expect any fancy stuff - not from the germans anyway . world champions brazil take on germany in a friendly game in berlin on wednesday .
the prestigious match carries little importance to the home side other than it represents a chance to exact revenge on the samba stars who ruined their improbable world cup dream two years ago by beating them 2-0 in yokohama in the 2002 final . germany as hosts for the 2006 world cup are automatically installed in the tournament while recent rule changes dictate that reigning world champions brazil have to qualify for the right to defend their crown .
brazil will arrive in germany after beating bolivia 3-1 in a world cup qualifier in sao paulo and will view the match as a chance to keep the team ’ s momentum ahead of more demanding and important clashes in the south american qualifying group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn prays for the yokohama pitch to open up in the world cup final 2002 .
for germany , however , it will be the first opportunity since the world cup final to regain their pride against ronaldo and co .
after progressing against the odds to the showpiece finale in japan , the germans felt aggrieved that they did not take the chance to claim a famous victory and a fourth world cup . but for those expecting a german fairytale ending on wednesday , the recent words of team captain michael ballack may already have dampened the spirits of fans hoping for an exhibition display from the home side . ballack forgoes beauty for success midfielder ballack told the german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung on sunday that germany do not need to play a " beautiful game " to succeed and should focus instead on developing a winning mentality .
" one does n't have to play beautiful football .
success is what counts . " someone may want to remind ballack that the current germany team has lacked both beauty and success of late .
germany have not beaten a major soccer power in their last nine matches and were dumped out of the recent european championships after the first round .
the last time the germans beat a top-level side was october 7 , 2000 when they secured a 1-0 victory over england .
after that , they lost 1-0 to france , 5-1 to england and 1-0 to argentina in the run-up to the 2002 world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack scores past south korean goalkeeper lee woon jae during the 2002 world cup semi-final .
then in japan / korea , germany beat paraguay , the united states and south korea before losing in the final .
since then , they have gone down 3-1 to the netherlands , 3-1 to spain , 1-0 to italy and 3-0 to france .
they then drew 1-1 against the netherlands at euro 2004 .
a victory over brazil may not be impossible but the statistics suggest a win would be unlikely , an attractive one even less so . brazil buzzing with invention in contrast , the brazilians arrive in berlin this week on the back of a splendid display of inspirational soccer against bolivia and bring with them a restored reputation as the harlem globetrotters of the international game . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronaldo real madrid striker and germany ’ s world cup final nemesis ronaldo had promised fans a gala in sao paulo .
and brazil did not fail to deliver .
ronaldo himself opened the scoring with a blistering volley before the game was even a minute old .
the game then turned into an exhibition of art-soccer when ronaldinho fired a 12th minute penalty into the lower left corner for a 2-0 lead .
and just before half-time , copa america hero adriano leaped above the bolivian backline to head in a cross from ronaldinho to make it 3-0 . " it was a good result and an excellent performance , " said ronaldo at the post-match press conference .
" we have every reason to be happy .
it was marvelous .
we played excellent soccer and we 're the leaders of the group . "
the win puts brazil ahead of argentina in the group and their world cup campaign in motion . despite the feel-good factor running through the brazilian team after sunday ’ s win , there will be a cloud hanging over the samba stars when they arrive in germany . club restrictions lead to player ban bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucio .
some of brazil 's most exciting and established players will not be on view in berlin on wednesday .
the five players who did not play in brazil 's friendly international in haiti on the august 18 were left out of the bolivia game and will also be excluded for the germany clash .
ac milan players cafu , kaka and dida , along with bayer leverkusen 's lucio -lrb- photo -rrb- and ze roberto have been punished by the brazilian football federation -lrb- cbf -rrb- for not appearing in brazil 's 6-0 victory at port-au-prince .
the stars were absent after not being released by their clubs for the haiti game .
ronaldo has been quoted as supporting the decision , saying that the cbf wanted to preserve the honor of those who wear brazil 's green and yellow colors .
however , ronaldo 's team mate in the spanish capital , fellow galactico roberto carlos , was not of the same opinion , saying : " the federations and the clubs have to work together . "
the brazil captain added the five excluded players would have loved to be playing for brazil .

just do n't expect any fancy stuff - not from the germans anyway . world champions brazil take on germany in a friendly game in berlin on wednesday .
the prestigious match carries little importance to the home side other than it represents a chance to exact revenge on the samba stars who ruined their improbable world cup dream two years ago by beating them 2-0 in yokohama in the 2002 final . germany as hosts for the 2006 world cup are automatically installed in the tournament while recent rule changes dictate that reigning world champions brazil have to qualify for the right to defend their crown .
brazil will arrive in germany after beating bolivia 3-1 in a world cup qualifier in sao paulo and will view the match as a chance to keep the team ’ s momentum ahead of more demanding and important clashes in the south american qualifying group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn prays for the yokohama pitch to open up in the world cup final 2002 .
for germany , however , it will be the first opportunity since the world cup final to regain their pride against ronaldo and co .
after progressing against the odds to the showpiece finale in japan , the germans felt aggrieved that they did not take the chance to claim a famous victory and a fourth world cup . but for those expecting a german fairytale ending on wednesday , the recent words of team captain michael ballack may already have dampened the spirits of fans hoping for an exhibition display from the home side . ballack forgoes beauty for success midfielder ballack told the german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung on sunday that germany do not need to play a " beautiful game " to succeed and should focus instead on developing a winning mentality .
" one does n't have to play beautiful football .
success is what counts . " someone may want to remind ballack that the current germany team has lacked both beauty and success of late .
germany have not beaten a major soccer power in their last nine matches and were dumped out of the recent european championships after the first round .
the last time the germans beat a top-level side was october 7 , 2000 when they secured a 1-0 victory over england .
after that , they lost 1-0 to france , 5-1 to england and 1-0 to argentina in the run-up to the 2002 world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack scores past south korean goalkeeper lee woon jae during the 2002 world cup semi-final .
then in japan / korea , germany beat paraguay , the united states and south korea before losing in the final .
since then , they have gone down 3-1 to the netherlands , 3-1 to spain , 1-0 to italy and 3-0 to france .
they then drew 1-1 against the netherlands at euro 2004 .
a victory over brazil may not be impossible but the statistics suggest a win would be unlikely , an attractive one even less so . brazil buzzing with invention in contrast , the brazilians arrive in berlin this week on the back of a splendid display of inspirational soccer against bolivia and bring with them a restored reputation as the harlem globetrotters of the international game . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronaldo real madrid striker and germany ’ s world cup final nemesis ronaldo had promised fans a gala in sao paulo .
and brazil did not fail to deliver .
ronaldo himself opened the scoring with a blistering volley before the game was even a minute old .
the game then turned into an exhibition of art-soccer when ronaldinho fired a 12th minute penalty into the lower left corner for a 2-0 lead .
and just before half-time , copa america hero adriano leaped above the bolivian backline to head in a cross from ronaldinho to make it 3-0 . " it was a good result and an excellent performance , " said ronaldo at the post-match press conference .
" we have every reason to be happy .
it was marvelous .
we played excellent soccer and we 're the leaders of the group . "
the win puts brazil ahead of argentina in the group and their world cup campaign in motion . despite the feel-good factor running through the brazilian team after sunday ’ s win , there will be a cloud hanging over the samba stars when they arrive in germany . club restrictions lead to player ban bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucio .
some of brazil 's most exciting and established players will not be on view in berlin on wednesday .
the five players who did not play in brazil 's friendly international in haiti on the august 18 were left out of the bolivia game and will also be excluded for the germany clash .
ac milan players cafu , kaka and dida , along with bayer leverkusen 's lucio -lrb- photo -rrb- and ze roberto have been punished by the brazilian football federation -lrb- cbf -rrb- for not appearing in brazil 's 6-0 victory at port-au-prince .
the stars were absent after not being released by their clubs for the haiti game .
ronaldo has been quoted as supporting the decision , saying that the cbf wanted to preserve the honor of those who wear brazil 's green and yellow colors .
however , ronaldo 's team mate in the spanish capital , fellow galactico roberto carlos , was not of the same opinion , saying : " the federations and the clubs have to work together . "
the brazil captain added the five excluded players would have loved to be playing for brazil .

but this culinary diversity is something that only emerged after the iron curtain fell in 1989 .
before that , when poles did n't feel like slaving behind the stove , they did n't hop in the car and head for the nearest golden arches - instead they hopped on over to their local government-subsidized milk bars -lrb- bar mleczny -rrb- for a quick repast and a night on the town .
mcstate subsidized subsidized by the government , the milk bars served as an important social outlet under poland 's communist government .
the socialist idea behind the bars was to provide each worker and citizen with the possibility of an affordable warm meal .
people from all walks of life frequented the milk bars - and many still do .
and though the name may evoke images of bovine creations , the milk bars did n't just sell milk or ice cream .
you could also get a balanced , square meal .
but the meals did tend to rely heavily on dairy products for their inspiration .
during the peak of communism , self-service restaurants like milk bars could be found throughout the eastern bloc .
in the former east germany , for example , they could be found in most cities .
but today they have vanished from most countries except poland .
competition for the burger industry with the onslaught of western fast food and diminishing government subsidies , poland 's tradition of milk bars has struggled in recent years , with many going out of business .
but in the country 's metropolises , like warsaw or gdansk , milk bars are still trendy hangouts .
and though they now have to compete with fast food and kebab stands , the polish government wants to keep them in business and backs them to the tune of several million euros in subsidies each year .
with their low prices , the milk bars are attracting a growing number of students and pensioners .
with meals costing as little as € 1 to € 4 , the prices are attractive .
still , the hunt for a bargain is n't the only thing that draws people to the milk bars .
patrick szymanski , a 23-year-old student , eats in a milk bar every day and he loves warsaw 's milk bars , because he does n't have to do any cooking or clean-up .
" in former times there were as many milk bars as there are coffee shops now .
but now there are almost only kebab shops and asian takeaways , " recalled a guy named janusz , a 66-year-old warsaw native who was eating lunch with his friend bogdan at bar studencki , a traditional milk bar at the university of warsaw .
janusz said he 'd rather dig into a milk bar 's traditional fare of soup and potato-filled piroshkis than go to a fast food chain .
" it tastes almost as good as my wife 's cooking , " asserts the 59-year-old bodgan .
" i like the polish kitchen .
unlike fast food , it 's actually healthy , " said a friend of bodgan 's .
a cult following for many polish youngsters , who have long forgotten the days of long queing lines and food rations under communism , milk bars have gained cult status .
for some old enough to remember communism , it 's one of the friendlier reminders of poland 's socialist past .
but others , like janusz and bogdan have a simpler reason for hanging out at the milk bars .

but this culinary diversity is something that only emerged after the iron curtain fell in 1989 .
before that , when poles did n't feel like slaving behind the stove , they did n't hop in the car and head for the nearest golden arches - instead they hopped on over to their local government-subsidized milk bars -lrb- bar mleczny -rrb- for a quick repast and a night on the town .
mcstate subsidized subsidized by the government , the milk bars served as an important social outlet under poland 's communist government .
the socialist idea behind the bars was to provide each worker and citizen with the possibility of an affordable warm meal .
people from all walks of life frequented the milk bars - and many still do .
and though the name may evoke images of bovine creations , the milk bars did n't just sell milk or ice cream .
you could also get a balanced , square meal .
but the meals did tend to rely heavily on dairy products for their inspiration .
during the peak of communism , self-service restaurants like milk bars could be found throughout the eastern bloc .
in the former east germany , for example , they could be found in most cities .
but today they have vanished from most countries except poland .
competition for the burger industry with the onslaught of western fast food and diminishing government subsidies , poland 's tradition of milk bars has struggled in recent years , with many going out of business .
but in the country 's metropolises , like warsaw or gdansk , milk bars are still trendy hangouts .
and though they now have to compete with fast food and kebab stands , the polish government wants to keep them in business and backs them to the tune of several million euros in subsidies each year .
with their low prices , the milk bars are attracting a growing number of students and pensioners .
with meals costing as little as € 1 to € 4 , the prices are attractive .
still , the hunt for a bargain is n't the only thing that draws people to the milk bars .
patrick szymanski , a 23-year-old student , eats in a milk bar every day and he loves warsaw 's milk bars , because he does n't have to do any cooking or clean-up .
" in former times there were as many milk bars as there are coffee shops now .
but now there are almost only kebab shops and asian takeaways , " recalled a guy named janusz , a 66-year-old warsaw native who was eating lunch with his friend bogdan at bar studencki , a traditional milk bar at the university of warsaw .
janusz said he 'd rather dig into a milk bar 's traditional fare of soup and potato-filled piroshkis than go to a fast food chain .
" it tastes almost as good as my wife 's cooking , " asserts the 59-year-old bodgan .
" i like the polish kitchen .
unlike fast food , it 's actually healthy , " said a friend of bodgan 's .
a cult following for many polish youngsters , who have long forgotten the days of long queing lines and food rations under communism , milk bars have gained cult status .
for some old enough to remember communism , it 's one of the friendlier reminders of poland 's socialist past .
but others , like janusz and bogdan have a simpler reason for hanging out at the milk bars .

sometimes actors play such powerful roles or infamous characters they get typecast for the rest of their careers .
bruno ganz is worried about falling into that trap after playing the ultimate bad guy - adolf hitler . " the downfall - hitler and the end of the third reich " tells the story of the dictator as a tragic human being , not just a monster , and ganz 's exceptional acting ability has him concerned how he 'll be seen after the film , which portrays the last 12 day of hitler 's life in a berlin bunker , opens on sept .
16 .
" i do n't know what 's going to happen when the film reaches the public , " the 63-year-old swiss actor told the bild am sonntag newspaper .
" there could be some mistaken or disturbed people who confuse me with hitler . "
if critics are to be believed , he may have something to worry about .
while many wonder if the time is right , or could ever be right , for a film showing hitler as a human being , commentators agree ganz 's portrayal is right on target .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ganz as hitler " ganz is hitler , " said historian joachim fest , whose biography of the nazi leader the film drew on .
ganz needed a long time before deciding to take the role , and his son was nearly successful in dissuading him when he said it would n't be healthy " to enter a sick person 's mind for so long . "
but upon seeing himself made up as hitler , complete with his famous moustache , ganz was convinced him to take his first leading role in a german movie in 16 years .
but hairpieces and uniforms were n't enough to allow ganz to convincingly portray the austrian-born " führer , " he also had to get into the mass murderer 's head .
" if i only hate hitler , then i ca n't open things up for myself .
that only happens with affection , " ganz said .
" i was forced to develop an understanding for the man .
i 'm not ashamed of the fact that i was able to feel sympathy for him during fleeting seconds . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from " the downfall " moments of understanding are okay , according to the producer of " the downfall , " bernd eichinger .
but if viewers walk away after the movie 's more that two hours feeling general sympathy for hitler , then " the film has failed in its intention . "
after the € 13.5 million -lrb- $ 16.3 million -rrb- film ends it run in theaters , ganz wants to put the typecast theory to the test .
he said for his next project he 'd like a part in a comedy . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de film portrays hitler in human light adolf hitler spent his last days in an underground bunker in berlin amid a combination of fear and unreality .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 07.09.2004 villainous typecasting ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will bruno ganz 's hitler follow him for the rest of his career ?
sometimes actors play such powerful roles or infamous characters they get typecast for the rest of their careers .
bruno ganz is worried about falling into that trap after playing the ultimate bad guy - adolf hitler . " the downfall - hitler and the end of the third reich " tells the story of the dictator as a tragic human being , not just a monster , and ganz 's exceptional acting ability has him concerned how he 'll be seen after the film , which portrays the last 12 day of hitler 's life in a berlin bunker , opens on sept .
16 .
" i do n't know what 's going to happen when the film reaches the public , " the 63-year-old swiss actor told the bild am sonntag newspaper .
" there could be some mistaken or disturbed people who confuse me with hitler . "
if critics are to be believed , he may have something to worry about .
while many wonder if the time is right , or could ever be right , for a film showing hitler as a human being , commentators agree ganz 's portrayal is right on target .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ganz as hitler " ganz is hitler , " said historian joachim fest , whose biography of the nazi leader the film drew on .
ganz needed a long time before deciding to take the role , and his son was nearly successful in dissuading him when he said it would n't be healthy " to enter a sick person 's mind for so long . "
but upon seeing himself made up as hitler , complete with his famous moustache , ganz was convinced him to take his first leading role in a german movie in 16 years .
but hairpieces and uniforms were n't enough to allow ganz to convincingly portray the austrian-born " führer , " he also had to get into the mass murderer 's head .
" if i only hate hitler , then i ca n't open things up for myself .
that only happens with affection , " ganz said .
" i was forced to develop an understanding for the man .
i 'm not ashamed of the fact that i was able to feel sympathy for him during fleeting seconds . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from " the downfall " moments of understanding are okay , according to the producer of " the downfall , " bernd eichinger .
but if viewers walk away after the movie 's more that two hours feeling general sympathy for hitler , then " the film has failed in its intention . "
after the € 13.5 million -lrb- $ 16.3 million -rrb- film ends it run in theaters , ganz wants to put the typecast theory to the test .
he said for his next project he 'd like a part in a comedy . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de film portrays hitler in human light adolf hitler spent his last days in an underground bunker in berlin amid a combination of fear and unreality .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 07.09.2004 how to say ' fast food ' in polish großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they may not have polska kielbasa , but milk bars offer good eating though they 've become less prosperous since the fall of the iron curtain , many in poland would rather have a cheap healthy meal at a local milk bar than a big mac . today when polish got out to eat they can be overwhelmed by a blitz of possibilities ranging from michelin-starred restaurants to chinese take-aways to western fast food chains .
but this culinary diversity is something that only emerged after the iron curtain fell in 1989 .
before that , when poles did n't feel like slaving behind the stove , they did n't hop in the car and head for the nearest golden arches - instead they hopped on over to their local government-subsidized milk bars -lrb- bar mleczny -rrb- for a quick repast and a night on the town .
mcstate subsidized subsidized by the government , the milk bars served as an important social outlet under poland 's communist government .
the socialist idea behind the bars was to provide each worker and citizen with the possibility of an affordable warm meal .
people from all walks of life frequented the milk bars - and many still do .
and though the name may evoke images of bovine creations , the milk bars did n't just sell milk or ice cream .
you could also get a balanced , square meal .

during the peak of communism , self-service restaurants like milk bars could be found throughout the eastern bloc .

competition for the burger industry with the onslaught of western fast food and diminishing government subsidies , poland 's tradition of milk bars has struggled in recent years , with many going out of business .
but in the country 's metropolises , like warsaw or gdansk , milk bars are still trendy hangouts .
and though they now have to compete with fast food and kebab stands , the polish government wants to keep them in business and backs them to the tune of several million euros in subsidies each year .

" in former times there were as many milk bars as there are coffee shops now .
but now there are almost only kebab shops and asian takeaways , " recalled a guy named janusz , a 66-year-old warsaw native who was eating lunch with his friend bogdan at bar studencki , a traditional milk bar at the university of warsaw .
janusz said he 'd rather dig into a milk bar 's traditional fare of soup and potato-filled piroshkis than go to a fast food chain .

a cult following for many polish youngsters , who have long forgotten the days of long queing lines and food rations under communism , milk bars have gained cult status .

but this culinary diversity is something that only emerged after the iron curtain fell in 1989 .
before that , when poles did n't feel like slaving behind the stove , they did n't hop in the car and head for the nearest golden arches - instead they hopped on over to their local government-subsidized milk bars -lrb- bar mleczny -rrb- for a quick repast and a night on the town .
mcstate subsidized subsidized by the government , the milk bars served as an important social outlet under poland 's communist government .
the socialist idea behind the bars was to provide each worker and citizen with the possibility of an affordable warm meal .
people from all walks of life frequented the milk bars - and many still do .
and though the name may evoke images of bovine creations , the milk bars did n't just sell milk or ice cream .
you could also get a balanced , square meal .
but the meals did tend to rely heavily on dairy products for their inspiration .
during the peak of communism , self-service restaurants like milk bars could be found throughout the eastern bloc .
in the former east germany , for example , they could be found in most cities .
but today they have vanished from most countries except poland .
competition for the burger industry with the onslaught of western fast food and diminishing government subsidies , poland 's tradition of milk bars has struggled in recent years , with many going out of business .
but in the country 's metropolises , like warsaw or gdansk , milk bars are still trendy hangouts .
and though they now have to compete with fast food and kebab stands , the polish government wants to keep them in business and backs them to the tune of several million euros in subsidies each year .
with their low prices , the milk bars are attracting a growing number of students and pensioners .
with meals costing as little as € 1 to € 4 , the prices are attractive .
still , the hunt for a bargain is n't the only thing that draws people to the milk bars .
patrick szymanski , a 23-year-old student , eats in a milk bar every day and he loves warsaw 's milk bars , because he does n't have to do any cooking or clean-up .
" in former times there were as many milk bars as there are coffee shops now .
but now there are almost only kebab shops and asian takeaways , " recalled a guy named janusz , a 66-year-old warsaw native who was eating lunch with his friend bogdan at bar studencki , a traditional milk bar at the university of warsaw .
janusz said he 'd rather dig into a milk bar 's traditional fare of soup and potato-filled piroshkis than go to a fast food chain .
" it tastes almost as good as my wife 's cooking , " asserts the 59-year-old bodgan .
" i like the polish kitchen .
unlike fast food , it 's actually healthy , " said a friend of bodgan 's .
a cult following for many polish youngsters , who have long forgotten the days of long queing lines and food rations under communism , milk bars have gained cult status .
for some old enough to remember communism , it 's one of the friendlier reminders of poland 's socialist past .
but others , like janusz and bogdan have a simpler reason for hanging out at the milk bars .

eu officials are therefore touring the country to foster a more positive profile . at a series of seminars with the media in the southern cities of bangalore and hyderabad in the past week , held at glitzy locations linked to the country 's booming film industry , eu representatives have pitched for a greater understanding of what the eu does internally , on the global stage and in india itself .
they have had to start with basics by explaining the role taken by the executive european commission in initiating and policing eu legislation and the commission 's often troublesome interplay with the member states .
the distinction is important as in some areas of vital interest to india , notably trade ; the commission is the eu 's voice in international negotiations .
yet in others , such as foreign policy , the commission is powerless with the member states making the running . journalists drawn from southern india confessed to finding the details sometimes baffling and said the eu still has much work to do to establish its relevance to india beyond the trade front .
ordinary indians should be the target audience " the eu needs to do much more to raise public awareness among ordinary indians , by publicizing their important aid work and holding cultural events , " k.n. tilak kumar , chairman of the regional deccan herald newspaper group , told afp .
delegates at the seminars said eu-organized film events showcasing the best of contemporary european cinema had been big hits with indian audiences more used to a solid diet of bollywood fantasy interspersed with hollywood blockbusters .
" if they want the eu to be known here , they have to make news in india , " kumar added .
in-fighting creates a bad image the eu has been making headlines in the indian press , but for all the wrong reasons .
well-publicized rows among member states , such as over iraq , have undermined attempts by the bloc to portray itself as a big player on the world stage .
" you have to have a policy on iraq , the most important foreign policy issue of the day .
having a policy on some things and a non-policy on others is no way of carrying on , " said kumar .
caught at the sharp end are the under-resourced diplomats tasked with flying the eu 's blue starred flag abroad .
drawn from the commission 's external relations department , their work is largely confined to trade negotiations and overseeing aid projects .
for the staff of the new delhi embassy , that work is hugely important given india 's pivotal role as a leader of developing nations at the world trade organization and its status as a sizeable recipient of eu development funds .
they are also keen to promote the eu 's experience in conflict settlement , no small concern here given india 's intractable dispute with pakistan over kashmir . eu funding has made visible differences the € 100 million -lrb- $ 120 million -rrb- of eu grant aid spent annually in india is spread far and wide .
in the slums of mysore near bangalore , an eu-funded project has brought schooling , immunization and basic sanitation to communities where literacy was just 10 percent five years ago and easily preventable diseases were rife , according to the non-governmental organization overseeing the work .
but as eu officials freely admit , such work does not get much publicity in the local press , hence the seminars .
" the eu has an obligation still to explain that it is more than a fortress , the horrifying force behind the wto wanting to take over india .
we need to counter that with an alternative viewpoint , " said robert aarsse , first secretary at the dutch embassy in delhi , whose country holds the bloc 's rotating presidency .
" one thing we stress is that we are multilateral , whereas the us is unilateral .
we want to show india that we are a partner to work with , " he added .
proposed strategic partnership to be discussed at the highest levels of government , the two sides are already well engaged .
ministerial meetings are held regularly , and next month will see the fifth annual eu-india summit , in the dutch capital the hague .
in preparation for the summit , the european commission in june unveiled a new set of proposals designed to entrench a fledgling " strategic partnership " with india .
but for rajendra jain , professor of european studies at delhi 's jawaharlal nehru university , india still prefers to deal one-to-one with the big eu nations such as britain and france , and is " obsessed " by its relations with the united states .
" the indian elite thinks the eu is just not credible as a foreign policy actor , so the eu is not taken seriously , " jain said .
" and in india , the leading eu nations like britain often have their own agendas to promote , so they 're disinclined to give the eu a profile of its own . "
still , if nothing else the eu has covered itself in a sprinkling of glamour by organizing the seminars at a bangalore resort hotel owned by bollywood star sanjay khan and at southern india 's largest film studios outside hyderabad .

just do n't expect any fancy stuff - not from the germans anyway . world champions brazil take on germany in a friendly game in berlin on wednesday .
the prestigious match carries little importance to the home side other than it represents a chance to exact revenge on the samba stars who ruined their improbable world cup dream two years ago by beating them 2-0 in yokohama in the 2002 final . germany as hosts for the 2006 world cup are automatically installed in the tournament while recent rule changes dictate that reigning world champions brazil have to qualify for the right to defend their crown .
brazil will arrive in germany after beating bolivia 3-1 in a world cup qualifier in sao paulo and will view the match as a chance to keep the team ’ s momentum ahead of more demanding and important clashes in the south american qualifying group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn prays for the yokohama pitch to open up in the world cup final 2002 .
for germany , however , it will be the first opportunity since the world cup final to regain their pride against ronaldo and co .
after progressing against the odds to the showpiece finale in japan , the germans felt aggrieved that they did not take the chance to claim a famous victory and a fourth world cup . but for those expecting a german fairytale ending on wednesday , the recent words of team captain michael ballack may already have dampened the spirits of fans hoping for an exhibition display from the home side . ballack forgoes beauty for success midfielder ballack told the german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung on sunday that germany do not need to play a " beautiful game " to succeed and should focus instead on developing a winning mentality .
" one does n't have to play beautiful football .
success is what counts . " someone may want to remind ballack that the current germany team has lacked both beauty and success of late .
germany have not beaten a major soccer power in their last nine matches and were dumped out of the recent european championships after the first round .
the last time the germans beat a top-level side was october 7 , 2000 when they secured a 1-0 victory over england .
after that , they lost 1-0 to france , 5-1 to england and 1-0 to argentina in the run-up to the 2002 world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack scores past south korean goalkeeper lee woon jae during the 2002 world cup semi-final .

they then drew 1-1 against the netherlands at euro 2004 .
a victory over brazil may not be impossible but the statistics suggest a win would be unlikely , an attractive one even less so . brazil buzzing with invention in contrast , the brazilians arrive in berlin this week on the back of a splendid display of inspirational soccer against bolivia and bring with them a restored reputation as the harlem globetrotters of the international game . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronaldo real madrid striker and germany ’ s world cup final nemesis ronaldo had promised fans a gala in sao paulo .
and brazil did not fail to deliver .
ronaldo himself opened the scoring with a blistering volley before the game was even a minute old .
the game then turned into an exhibition of art-soccer when ronaldinho fired a 12th minute penalty into the lower left corner for a 2-0 lead .
and just before half-time , copa america hero adriano leaped above the bolivian backline to head in a cross from ronaldinho to make it 3-0 . " it was a good result and an excellent performance , " said ronaldo at the post-match press conference .
" we have every reason to be happy .
it was marvelous .
we played excellent soccer and we 're the leaders of the group . "

eu officials are therefore touring the country to foster a more positive profile . at a series of seminars with the media in the southern cities of bangalore and hyderabad in the past week , held at glitzy locations linked to the country 's booming film industry , eu representatives have pitched for a greater understanding of what the eu does internally , on the global stage and in india itself .
they have had to start with basics by explaining the role taken by the executive european commission in initiating and policing eu legislation and the commission 's often troublesome interplay with the member states .
the distinction is important as in some areas of vital interest to india , notably trade ; the commission is the eu 's voice in international negotiations .
yet in others , such as foreign policy , the commission is powerless with the member states making the running . journalists drawn from southern india confessed to finding the details sometimes baffling and said the eu still has much work to do to establish its relevance to india beyond the trade front .
ordinary indians should be the target audience " the eu needs to do much more to raise public awareness among ordinary indians , by publicizing their important aid work and holding cultural events , " k.n. tilak kumar , chairman of the regional deccan herald newspaper group , told afp .
delegates at the seminars said eu-organized film events showcasing the best of contemporary european cinema had been big hits with indian audiences more used to a solid diet of bollywood fantasy interspersed with hollywood blockbusters .
" if they want the eu to be known here , they have to make news in india , " kumar added .
in-fighting creates a bad image the eu has been making headlines in the indian press , but for all the wrong reasons .
well-publicized rows among member states , such as over iraq , have undermined attempts by the bloc to portray itself as a big player on the world stage .
" you have to have a policy on iraq , the most important foreign policy issue of the day .
having a policy on some things and a non-policy on others is no way of carrying on , " said kumar .
caught at the sharp end are the under-resourced diplomats tasked with flying the eu 's blue starred flag abroad .
drawn from the commission 's external relations department , their work is largely confined to trade negotiations and overseeing aid projects .
for the staff of the new delhi embassy , that work is hugely important given india 's pivotal role as a leader of developing nations at the world trade organization and its status as a sizeable recipient of eu development funds .
they are also keen to promote the eu 's experience in conflict settlement , no small concern here given india 's intractable dispute with pakistan over kashmir . eu funding has made visible differences the € 100 million -lrb- $ 120 million -rrb- of eu grant aid spent annually in india is spread far and wide .
in the slums of mysore near bangalore , an eu-funded project has brought schooling , immunization and basic sanitation to communities where literacy was just 10 percent five years ago and easily preventable diseases were rife , according to the non-governmental organization overseeing the work .
but as eu officials freely admit , such work does not get much publicity in the local press , hence the seminars .
" the eu has an obligation still to explain that it is more than a fortress , the horrifying force behind the wto wanting to take over india .
we need to counter that with an alternative viewpoint , " said robert aarsse , first secretary at the dutch embassy in delhi , whose country holds the bloc 's rotating presidency .
" one thing we stress is that we are multilateral , whereas the us is unilateral .
we want to show india that we are a partner to work with , " he added .
proposed strategic partnership to be discussed at the highest levels of government , the two sides are already well engaged .
ministerial meetings are held regularly , and next month will see the fifth annual eu-india summit , in the dutch capital the hague .
in preparation for the summit , the european commission in june unveiled a new set of proposals designed to entrench a fledgling " strategic partnership " with india .
but for rajendra jain , professor of european studies at delhi 's jawaharlal nehru university , india still prefers to deal one-to-one with the big eu nations such as britain and france , and is " obsessed " by its relations with the united states .
" the indian elite thinks the eu is just not credible as a foreign policy actor , so the eu is not taken seriously , " jain said .
" and in india , the leading eu nations like britain often have their own agendas to promote , so they 're disinclined to give the eu a profile of its own . "
still , if nothing else the eu has covered itself in a sprinkling of glamour by organizing the seminars at a bangalore resort hotel owned by bollywood star sanjay khan and at southern india 's largest film studios outside hyderabad .
it must now hope the stardust translates into more upbeat press coverage . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer finds few backers for un seat german foreign minister joschka fischer wrapped up his 10-day trip to asia on friday .

just do n't expect any fancy stuff - not from the germans anyway . world champions brazil take on germany in a friendly game in berlin on wednesday .
the prestigious match carries little importance to the home side other than it represents a chance to exact revenge on the samba stars who ruined their improbable world cup dream two years ago by beating them 2-0 in yokohama in the 2002 final . germany as hosts for the 2006 world cup are automatically installed in the tournament while recent rule changes dictate that reigning world champions brazil have to qualify for the right to defend their crown .
brazil will arrive in germany after beating bolivia 3-1 in a world cup qualifier in sao paulo and will view the match as a chance to keep the team ’ s momentum ahead of more demanding and important clashes in the south american qualifying group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn prays for the yokohama pitch to open up in the world cup final 2002 .
for germany , however , it will be the first opportunity since the world cup final to regain their pride against ronaldo and co .
after progressing against the odds to the showpiece finale in japan , the germans felt aggrieved that they did not take the chance to claim a famous victory and a fourth world cup . but for those expecting a german fairytale ending on wednesday , the recent words of team captain michael ballack may already have dampened the spirits of fans hoping for an exhibition display from the home side . ballack forgoes beauty for success midfielder ballack told the german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung on sunday that germany do not need to play a " beautiful game " to succeed and should focus instead on developing a winning mentality .
" one does n't have to play beautiful football .
success is what counts . " someone may want to remind ballack that the current germany team has lacked both beauty and success of late .
germany have not beaten a major soccer power in their last nine matches and were dumped out of the recent european championships after the first round .
the last time the germans beat a top-level side was october 7 , 2000 when they secured a 1-0 victory over england .
after that , they lost 1-0 to france , 5-1 to england and 1-0 to argentina in the run-up to the 2002 world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack scores past south korean goalkeeper lee woon jae during the 2002 world cup semi-final .
then in japan / korea , germany beat paraguay , the united states and south korea before losing in the final .
since then , they have gone down 3-1 to the netherlands , 3-1 to spain , 1-0 to italy and 3-0 to france .
they then drew 1-1 against the netherlands at euro 2004 .
a victory over brazil may not be impossible but the statistics suggest a win would be unlikely , an attractive one even less so . brazil buzzing with invention in contrast , the brazilians arrive in berlin this week on the back of a splendid display of inspirational soccer against bolivia and bring with them a restored reputation as the harlem globetrotters of the international game . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronaldo real madrid striker and germany ’ s world cup final nemesis ronaldo had promised fans a gala in sao paulo .
and brazil did not fail to deliver .
ronaldo himself opened the scoring with a blistering volley before the game was even a minute old .
the game then turned into an exhibition of art-soccer when ronaldinho fired a 12th minute penalty into the lower left corner for a 2-0 lead .
and just before half-time , copa america hero adriano leaped above the bolivian backline to head in a cross from ronaldinho to make it 3-0 . " it was a good result and an excellent performance , " said ronaldo at the post-match press conference .
" we have every reason to be happy .
it was marvelous .
we played excellent soccer and we 're the leaders of the group . "
the win puts brazil ahead of argentina in the group and their world cup campaign in motion . despite the feel-good factor running through the brazilian team after sunday ’ s win , there will be a cloud hanging over the samba stars when they arrive in germany . club restrictions lead to player ban bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucio .
some of brazil 's most exciting and established players will not be on view in berlin on wednesday .
the five players who did not play in brazil 's friendly international in haiti on the august 18 were left out of the bolivia game and will also be excluded for the germany clash .
ac milan players cafu , kaka and dida , along with bayer leverkusen 's lucio -lrb- photo -rrb- and ze roberto have been punished by the brazilian football federation -lrb- cbf -rrb- for not appearing in brazil 's 6-0 victory at port-au-prince .
the stars were absent after not being released by their clubs for the haiti game .
ronaldo has been quoted as supporting the decision , saying that the cbf wanted to preserve the honor of those who wear brazil 's green and yellow colors .
however , ronaldo 's team mate in the spanish capital , fellow galactico roberto carlos , was not of the same opinion , saying : " the federations and the clubs have to work together . "
the brazil captain added the five excluded players would have loved to be playing for brazil .
there is a feeling that the situation may stoke the fires of a simmering club-versus-country row with the affected players unhappy at their own clubs insistence that they remain with the domestic squad when brazil has issued call-ups . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de club versus country row mars brazil 's visit germany 's next game in its world cup preparations will be a friendly against brazil on wednesday .

eu officials are therefore touring the country to foster a more positive profile . at a series of seminars with the media in the southern cities of bangalore and hyderabad in the past week , held at glitzy locations linked to the country 's booming film industry , eu representatives have pitched for a greater understanding of what the eu does internally , on the global stage and in india itself .
they have had to start with basics by explaining the role taken by the executive european commission in initiating and policing eu legislation and the commission 's often troublesome interplay with the member states .
the distinction is important as in some areas of vital interest to india , notably trade ; the commission is the eu 's voice in international negotiations .
yet in others , such as foreign policy , the commission is powerless with the member states making the running . journalists drawn from southern india confessed to finding the details sometimes baffling and said the eu still has much work to do to establish its relevance to india beyond the trade front .
ordinary indians should be the target audience " the eu needs to do much more to raise public awareness among ordinary indians , by publicizing their important aid work and holding cultural events , " k.n. tilak kumar , chairman of the regional deccan herald newspaper group , told afp .
delegates at the seminars said eu-organized film events showcasing the best of contemporary european cinema had been big hits with indian audiences more used to a solid diet of bollywood fantasy interspersed with hollywood blockbusters .
" if they want the eu to be known here , they have to make news in india , " kumar added .
in-fighting creates a bad image the eu has been making headlines in the indian press , but for all the wrong reasons .
well-publicized rows among member states , such as over iraq , have undermined attempts by the bloc to portray itself as a big player on the world stage .
" you have to have a policy on iraq , the most important foreign policy issue of the day .
having a policy on some things and a non-policy on others is no way of carrying on , " said kumar .
caught at the sharp end are the under-resourced diplomats tasked with flying the eu 's blue starred flag abroad .
drawn from the commission 's external relations department , their work is largely confined to trade negotiations and overseeing aid projects .
for the staff of the new delhi embassy , that work is hugely important given india 's pivotal role as a leader of developing nations at the world trade organization and its status as a sizeable recipient of eu development funds .
they are also keen to promote the eu 's experience in conflict settlement , no small concern here given india 's intractable dispute with pakistan over kashmir . eu funding has made visible differences the € 100 million -lrb- $ 120 million -rrb- of eu grant aid spent annually in india is spread far and wide .
in the slums of mysore near bangalore , an eu-funded project has brought schooling , immunization and basic sanitation to communities where literacy was just 10 percent five years ago and easily preventable diseases were rife , according to the non-governmental organization overseeing the work .
but as eu officials freely admit , such work does not get much publicity in the local press , hence the seminars .
" the eu has an obligation still to explain that it is more than a fortress , the horrifying force behind the wto wanting to take over india .
we need to counter that with an alternative viewpoint , " said robert aarsse , first secretary at the dutch embassy in delhi , whose country holds the bloc 's rotating presidency .
" one thing we stress is that we are multilateral , whereas the us is unilateral .
we want to show india that we are a partner to work with , " he added .
proposed strategic partnership to be discussed at the highest levels of government , the two sides are already well engaged .
ministerial meetings are held regularly , and next month will see the fifth annual eu-india summit , in the dutch capital the hague .
in preparation for the summit , the european commission in june unveiled a new set of proposals designed to entrench a fledgling " strategic partnership " with india .
but for rajendra jain , professor of european studies at delhi 's jawaharlal nehru university , india still prefers to deal one-to-one with the big eu nations such as britain and france , and is " obsessed " by its relations with the united states .
" the indian elite thinks the eu is just not credible as a foreign policy actor , so the eu is not taken seriously , " jain said .
" and in india , the leading eu nations like britain often have their own agendas to promote , so they 're disinclined to give the eu a profile of its own . "
still , if nothing else the eu has covered itself in a sprinkling of glamour by organizing the seminars at a bangalore resort hotel owned by bollywood star sanjay khan and at southern india 's largest film studios outside hyderabad .

yet despite the kremlin 's restrictive policies , russia needs solidarity from the international community . on monday , hundreds of people said goodbye to the victims of the three-day school siege in the town of beslan , while in local hospitals many others continued to fight for their lives .
family members of the victims and survivors of the bloodbath in north ossetia are in despair - all of russia finds itself in mourning - and the world looks on in horror as the full magnitude of the tragedy is slowly revealed .
the hostage numbers are continually being revised upwards and the origin of the hostage takers is still uncertain .
the versions of the events at the violent end the siege are conflicting . there were mistakes on the part of the russian special bildunterschrift : forces , as president putin admitted in a speech .
eyewitnesses report serious failures during the storming of the school .
again , russian journalists are being prevented from providing a comprehensive account of what happened in beslan to the public .
a political debate in the country 's media over the background and consequences of the three-day siege is not taking place . only later did vladimir putin go to the site of these dramatic events , visiting the injured in the hospital and for good reason avoiding any meeting with residents of beslan .
instead , he turned to the russian people in a speech .
but on doing this , president putin , who so loves to present himself as the " man of action , " appeared to be at a loss and even downright petrified . he continues to avoid addressing the real causes of this tragedy - the war in chechnya that has been raging for years , and which is at least partly to blame for the growth of terror tactics and the deaths of many innocent people .
as much as putin would like russians to believe , these are not external conflicts that have been imported into the region .
it is a very russian problem - the independence fight for a small republic in the caucasus - that has fuelled this conflict . the radicals , and especially the determined terrorists in beslan , have only been able to gain ground after the long years of war and bloody conflict in the region have created an army of desperate people .
these are people who have lost everything , whose family members have been tortured and murdered and whose young people know nothing but violence .
these are people who have had to experience unbelievable barbarity from both russians and chechens and now want only one thing : revenge .
at the same time , there is no greater desire among the civilian population than to simply live in peace . beslan is a horrible symbol for a conflict that has long since expanded beyond the borders of chechnya and now threatens to set the entire caucasus region ablaze .
putin must now try to break this vicious circle , with international assistance if necessary .
and the west should be ready to provide it because in the war against terror , russian needs solidarity . cornelia rabitz -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de death toll above 320 in russian school attack while estimates of the number of people killed in the hostage-taking drama in a russian school rose ever higher on saturday , many questions remained unanswered the day after a siege put an end to the crisis .

sometimes actors play such powerful roles or infamous characters they get typecast for the rest of their careers .
bruno ganz is worried about falling into that trap after playing the ultimate bad guy - adolf hitler . " the downfall - hitler and the end of the third reich " tells the story of the dictator as a tragic human being , not just a monster , and ganz 's exceptional acting ability has him concerned how he 'll be seen after the film , which portrays the last 12 day of hitler 's life in a berlin bunker , opens on sept .
16 .
" i do n't know what 's going to happen when the film reaches the public , " the 63-year-old swiss actor told the bild am sonntag newspaper .
" there could be some mistaken or disturbed people who confuse me with hitler . "
if critics are to be believed , he may have something to worry about .
while many wonder if the time is right , or could ever be right , for a film showing hitler as a human being , commentators agree ganz 's portrayal is right on target .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ganz as hitler " ganz is hitler , " said historian joachim fest , whose biography of the nazi leader the film drew on .
ganz needed a long time before deciding to take the role , and his son was nearly successful in dissuading him when he said it would n't be healthy " to enter a sick person 's mind for so long . "
but upon seeing himself made up as hitler , complete with his famous moustache , ganz was convinced him to take his first leading role in a german movie in 16 years .
but hairpieces and uniforms were n't enough to allow ganz to convincingly portray the austrian-born " führer , " he also had to get into the mass murderer 's head .
" if i only hate hitler , then i ca n't open things up for myself .
that only happens with affection , " ganz said .
" i was forced to develop an understanding for the man .
i 'm not ashamed of the fact that i was able to feel sympathy for him during fleeting seconds . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from " the downfall " moments of understanding are okay , according to the producer of " the downfall , " bernd eichinger .

the eu has been calling on tehran to cooperate more closely with the un . details of the deal between teheran and the un 's international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- were not clear , but diplomats close to the talks have said they would include the production , testing and assembly of centrifuges . centrifuges are used to enrich uranium for power stations and can be enriched further to produce material for atomic bombs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director general of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- mohamed elbaradei talks between iran and the iaea , headed by mohamed el baradei -lrb- photo -rrb- , took place over the weekend .
envoys from the eu 's " big three , " germany , france and britain , followed the discussions closely . " iran said this weekend that they would come back to the suspension .
el baradei is trying to work out the details with the iranians , " a western diplomat told the reuters news agency . iran 's nuclear program has been a cause of concern among western politicians .
the united state has accused teheran of wanting to developing its uranium enrichment program to make material nuclear weapons and wants the un security council to impose sanctions on the country for failing to meet its commitments to the iaea . iran insists that its nuclear program is purely for energy generation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's top nuclear negotiator , hasan rowhani , who heads the supreme national security council , speaks with media during his press conference in tehran , iran , saturday , june 19 , 2004 .
" iran has never pursued nuclear arms but we are serious about having peaceful nuclear technology , " the head of iran 's supreme national security council hassan rowhani told iran 's state television . last year , eu foreign ministers from france , germany and britain convinced iran to suspend its uranium enrichment activities , but in june , teheran reneged on the pledge and resumed the production and testing of nuclear centrifuges .
just last week , it said it intended on processing 37 tons of raw uranium into uranium hexafluoride , the feed material for centrifuges . the possible deal agreed after this weekend 's talks could ease improve the diplomatic situation ahead of the iaea meeting on sept .

the us has preferred to take a hard line with teheran while the europeans have chosen a strategy of diplomatic engagement .
but teheran 's activities have had them worried . " we can not accept of course the development of weapon-grade uranium , " said dutch foreign minister bernard bot , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency .
" that signal should be very strong and should be unanimously given over by the 25 " eu member states . the dutch made the call in a statement late monday night after a visit by iran 's rowhani in amsterdam , where he met with bot and dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende .
the dutch also raised a number of other concerns , including human rights , terrorism and iran 's position towards israel . german foreign minister joschka fischer has also turned up the pressure on iran , saying a nuclear-capable iran " can become a subject for the -lrb- un -rrb- security council . " eu foreign ministers who met over the weekend said they were discussing whether or not to take iran to the un security council to ensure it is not secretly trying to develop atomic weapons .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 07.09.2004 opinion : russia needs international solidarity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : images from the school siege have shocked russia and the world official versions of the hostage drama in north ossetia and the true events on the ground are widely divergent .
yet despite the kremlin 's restrictive policies , russia needs solidarity from the international community . on monday , hundreds of people said goodbye to the victims of the three-day school siege in the town of beslan , while in local hospitals many others continued to fight for their lives .
family members of the victims and survivors of the bloodbath in north ossetia are in despair - all of russia finds itself in mourning - and the world looks on in horror as the full magnitude of the tragedy is slowly revealed .
the hostage numbers are continually being revised upwards and the origin of the hostage takers is still uncertain .
the versions of the events at the violent end the siege are conflicting . there were mistakes on the part of the russian special bildunterschrift : forces , as president putin admitted in a speech .
eyewitnesses report serious failures during the storming of the school .
again , russian journalists are being prevented from providing a comprehensive account of what happened in beslan to the public .
a political debate in the country 's media over the background and consequences of the three-day siege is not taking place . only later did vladimir putin go to the site of these dramatic events , visiting the injured in the hospital and for good reason avoiding any meeting with residents of beslan .
instead , he turned to the russian people in a speech .
but on doing this , president putin , who so loves to present himself as the " man of action , " appeared to be at a loss and even downright petrified . he continues to avoid addressing the real causes of this tragedy - the war in chechnya that has been raging for years , and which is at least partly to blame for the growth of terror tactics and the deaths of many innocent people .
as much as putin would like russians to believe , these are not external conflicts that have been imported into the region .
it is a very russian problem - the independence fight for a small republic in the caucasus - that has fuelled this conflict . the radicals , and especially the determined terrorists in beslan , have only been able to gain ground after the long years of war and bloody conflict in the region have created an army of desperate people .
these are people who have lost everything , whose family members have been tortured and murdered and whose young people know nothing but violence .
these are people who have had to experience unbelievable barbarity from both russians and chechens and now want only one thing : revenge .
at the same time , there is no greater desire among the civilian population than to simply live in peace . beslan is a horrible symbol for a conflict that has long since expanded beyond the borders of chechnya and now threatens to set the entire caucasus region ablaze .
putin must now try to break this vicious circle , with international assistance if necessary .
and the west should be ready to provide it because in the war against terror , russian needs solidarity . cornelia rabitz -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de death toll above 320 in russian school attack while estimates of the number of people killed in the hostage-taking drama in a russian school rose ever higher on saturday , many questions remained unanswered the day after a siege put an end to the crisis .
-lrb- sept .
4 , 2004 -rrb- funerals begin after russian hostage tragedy the first funerals since the bloody end of the school hostage crisis two days ago in southern russian beslan took place sunday .

" our economy has turned the corner .
all forecasts indicate we will reach growth of between 1.5 and 2 percent this year , " he told the assembled members of the bundestag . the finance minister revealed proposals for € 22 billion of new debt to finance expected new investments of € 22.8 billion .
eichel also stated that total government spending would reach € 258 billion in 2005 , about € 1 billion higher than in the current year .
however , his budget draft contained projected privatization proceeds of some € 15 billion next year , which the government hopes will help reign in the budget deficit to back below the eu stability and growth pact 's ceiling of three percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- . cdu calls for eichel to step down germany ’ s conservative opposition criticized eichels figures as wild guesses and accused him of disregarding a number of risks and pitfalls .
the cdu ’ s budget spokesman dietrich austerman spoke of a huge question mark behind predictions of revenues from a controversial highway toll system for trucks , which is to be introduced next year . he also pointed out that the government ’ s labor market reform would run up a bill of at least € 5 billion more than what was planned in the budget .
austerman called on the government to withdraw the budget plan and asked the finance minister to step down . " the budget 2005 epitomizes the failure of red-green budget policy , he says .
it is in violation of the constitution and the eu stability pact because it makes no attempt at consolidation .
it is entirely based on false figures and totally insufficient to boost the economy .
there are incalculable risks that should prompt the government to redo their budget and start all over again . " last week , eichel raised the forecast for this year 's budget deficit , saying declining tax income and increased spending on the unemployed would push the shortfall further beyond european union limits for a third straight year , reaching an estimated 3.7 percent of gdp in 2004 compared with a previous forecast of 3.25 percent published half a year ago . deficit reduction target gets helping hand the ultimate objective of getting the german budget deficit to below eu levels may also get a helping hand from the european commission and its proposed watering down of the hard-line pact .
brussels announced plans last week to make the pact less rigid including paying greater attention to economic developments when setting deadlines for budget cuts , taking account of whether a country 's debts are sustainable , and making greater allowances for the state of the economy . eichel welcomed the proposals drawn up by the european commission , saying the changes would help boost economic growth in europe .
" i can only welcome the proposals put forward by brussels , they 're what i 've been calling for all along , " he said . bundesbank lashes out at commission however , as eichel was addressing the bundestag on tuesday , the bundesbank was lashing out at the european commission 's proposals , arguing that the changes would weaken the stability and growth pact and lead to a worsening of monetary policy conditions in the euro area . " the bundesbank is of the opinion that the proposed changes will not strengthen but weaken the stability pact , " the german central bank said in a statement .
" that would lead to a deterioration of the conditions for monetary policy in the single currency area , " it added , indicating that if governments pursued a policy of loose purse strings in europe , the european central bank might be compelled to react by raising its key interest rates .
" healthy state finances are an important pre-condition for the ecb to guarantee price stability in the long term via relatively low interest rates , " the bundesbank said . the proposed changes " will reduce the incentive for euro zone countries to pursue solid budget policies and , at the same time , send a wrong signal to those countries that have not yet adopted the single currency " , the bank complained .
furthermore , many of the proposals would " make the rules more complicated and complex , thereby impairing its -lrb- the pact 's -rrb- ability to be implemented , " it argued . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european commission to loosen stability pact the european commission on friday unveiled a plan to introduce more flexibility in the stability and growth pact , saying it was vital to restore the credibility of its much-flouted budget discipline rules .

" that would lead to a deterioration of the conditions for monetary policy in the single currency area , " it added , indicating that if governments pursued a policy of loose purse strings in europe , the european central bank might be compelled to react by raising its key interest rates .
" healthy state finances are an important pre-condition for the ecb to guarantee price stability in the long term via relatively low interest rates , " the bundesbank said . the proposed changes " will reduce the incentive for euro zone countries to pursue solid budget policies and , at the same time , send a wrong signal to those countries that have not yet adopted the single currency " , the bank complained .
furthermore , many of the proposals would " make the rules more complicated and complex , thereby impairing its -lrb- the pact 's -rrb- ability to be implemented , " it argued . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european commission to loosen stability pact the european commission on friday unveiled a plan to introduce more flexibility in the stability and growth pact , saying it was vital to restore the credibility of its much-flouted budget discipline rules .

yet despite the kremlin 's restrictive policies , russia needs solidarity from the international community . on monday , hundreds of people said goodbye to the victims of the three-day school siege in the town of beslan , while in local hospitals many others continued to fight for their lives .
family members of the victims and survivors of the bloodbath in north ossetia are in despair - all of russia finds itself in mourning - and the world looks on in horror as the full magnitude of the tragedy is slowly revealed .
the hostage numbers are continually being revised upwards and the origin of the hostage takers is still uncertain .
the versions of the events at the violent end the siege are conflicting . there were mistakes on the part of the russian special bildunterschrift : forces , as president putin admitted in a speech .
eyewitnesses report serious failures during the storming of the school .
again , russian journalists are being prevented from providing a comprehensive account of what happened in beslan to the public .
a political debate in the country 's media over the background and consequences of the three-day siege is not taking place . only later did vladimir putin go to the site of these dramatic events , visiting the injured in the hospital and for good reason avoiding any meeting with residents of beslan .
instead , he turned to the russian people in a speech .
but on doing this , president putin , who so loves to present himself as the " man of action , " appeared to be at a loss and even downright petrified . he continues to avoid addressing the real causes of this tragedy - the war in chechnya that has been raging for years , and which is at least partly to blame for the growth of terror tactics and the deaths of many innocent people .
as much as putin would like russians to believe , these are not external conflicts that have been imported into the region .
it is a very russian problem - the independence fight for a small republic in the caucasus - that has fuelled this conflict . the radicals , and especially the determined terrorists in beslan , have only been able to gain ground after the long years of war and bloody conflict in the region have created an army of desperate people .
these are people who have lost everything , whose family members have been tortured and murdered and whose young people know nothing but violence .
these are people who have had to experience unbelievable barbarity from both russians and chechens and now want only one thing : revenge .
at the same time , there is no greater desire among the civilian population than to simply live in peace . beslan is a horrible symbol for a conflict that has long since expanded beyond the borders of chechnya and now threatens to set the entire caucasus region ablaze .
putin must now try to break this vicious circle , with international assistance if necessary .
and the west should be ready to provide it because in the war against terror , russian needs solidarity . cornelia rabitz -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de death toll above 320 in russian school attack while estimates of the number of people killed in the hostage-taking drama in a russian school rose ever higher on saturday , many questions remained unanswered the day after a siege put an end to the crisis .
-lrb- sept .

eu officials are therefore touring the country to foster a more positive profile . at a series of seminars with the media in the southern cities of bangalore and hyderabad in the past week , held at glitzy locations linked to the country 's booming film industry , eu representatives have pitched for a greater understanding of what the eu does internally , on the global stage and in india itself .
they have had to start with basics by explaining the role taken by the executive european commission in initiating and policing eu legislation and the commission 's often troublesome interplay with the member states .
the distinction is important as in some areas of vital interest to india , notably trade ; the commission is the eu 's voice in international negotiations .
yet in others , such as foreign policy , the commission is powerless with the member states making the running . journalists drawn from southern india confessed to finding the details sometimes baffling and said the eu still has much work to do to establish its relevance to india beyond the trade front .
ordinary indians should be the target audience " the eu needs to do much more to raise public awareness among ordinary indians , by publicizing their important aid work and holding cultural events , " k.n. tilak kumar , chairman of the regional deccan herald newspaper group , told afp .
delegates at the seminars said eu-organized film events showcasing the best of contemporary european cinema had been big hits with indian audiences more used to a solid diet of bollywood fantasy interspersed with hollywood blockbusters .
" if they want the eu to be known here , they have to make news in india , " kumar added .
in-fighting creates a bad image the eu has been making headlines in the indian press , but for all the wrong reasons .
well-publicized rows among member states , such as over iraq , have undermined attempts by the bloc to portray itself as a big player on the world stage .
" you have to have a policy on iraq , the most important foreign policy issue of the day .
having a policy on some things and a non-policy on others is no way of carrying on , " said kumar .
caught at the sharp end are the under-resourced diplomats tasked with flying the eu 's blue starred flag abroad .
drawn from the commission 's external relations department , their work is largely confined to trade negotiations and overseeing aid projects .
for the staff of the new delhi embassy , that work is hugely important given india 's pivotal role as a leader of developing nations at the world trade organization and its status as a sizeable recipient of eu development funds .
they are also keen to promote the eu 's experience in conflict settlement , no small concern here given india 's intractable dispute with pakistan over kashmir . eu funding has made visible differences the € 100 million -lrb- $ 120 million -rrb- of eu grant aid spent annually in india is spread far and wide .
in the slums of mysore near bangalore , an eu-funded project has brought schooling , immunization and basic sanitation to communities where literacy was just 10 percent five years ago and easily preventable diseases were rife , according to the non-governmental organization overseeing the work .
but as eu officials freely admit , such work does not get much publicity in the local press , hence the seminars .
" the eu has an obligation still to explain that it is more than a fortress , the horrifying force behind the wto wanting to take over india .
we need to counter that with an alternative viewpoint , " said robert aarsse , first secretary at the dutch embassy in delhi , whose country holds the bloc 's rotating presidency .
" one thing we stress is that we are multilateral , whereas the us is unilateral .
we want to show india that we are a partner to work with , " he added .
proposed strategic partnership to be discussed at the highest levels of government , the two sides are already well engaged .
ministerial meetings are held regularly , and next month will see the fifth annual eu-india summit , in the dutch capital the hague .
in preparation for the summit , the european commission in june unveiled a new set of proposals designed to entrench a fledgling " strategic partnership " with india .
but for rajendra jain , professor of european studies at delhi 's jawaharlal nehru university , india still prefers to deal one-to-one with the big eu nations such as britain and france , and is " obsessed " by its relations with the united states .
" the indian elite thinks the eu is just not credible as a foreign policy actor , so the eu is not taken seriously , " jain said .
" and in india , the leading eu nations like britain often have their own agendas to promote , so they 're disinclined to give the eu a profile of its own . "

eu officials are therefore touring the country to foster a more positive profile . at a series of seminars with the media in the southern cities of bangalore and hyderabad in the past week , held at glitzy locations linked to the country 's booming film industry , eu representatives have pitched for a greater understanding of what the eu does internally , on the global stage and in india itself .
they have had to start with basics by explaining the role taken by the executive european commission in initiating and policing eu legislation and the commission 's often troublesome interplay with the member states .
the distinction is important as in some areas of vital interest to india , notably trade ; the commission is the eu 's voice in international negotiations .
yet in others , such as foreign policy , the commission is powerless with the member states making the running . journalists drawn from southern india confessed to finding the details sometimes baffling and said the eu still has much work to do to establish its relevance to india beyond the trade front .
ordinary indians should be the target audience " the eu needs to do much more to raise public awareness among ordinary indians , by publicizing their important aid work and holding cultural events , " k.n. tilak kumar , chairman of the regional deccan herald newspaper group , told afp .
delegates at the seminars said eu-organized film events showcasing the best of contemporary european cinema had been big hits with indian audiences more used to a solid diet of bollywood fantasy interspersed with hollywood blockbusters .
" if they want the eu to be known here , they have to make news in india , " kumar added .
in-fighting creates a bad image the eu has been making headlines in the indian press , but for all the wrong reasons .
well-publicized rows among member states , such as over iraq , have undermined attempts by the bloc to portray itself as a big player on the world stage .
" you have to have a policy on iraq , the most important foreign policy issue of the day .
having a policy on some things and a non-policy on others is no way of carrying on , " said kumar .
caught at the sharp end are the under-resourced diplomats tasked with flying the eu 's blue starred flag abroad .
drawn from the commission 's external relations department , their work is largely confined to trade negotiations and overseeing aid projects .
for the staff of the new delhi embassy , that work is hugely important given india 's pivotal role as a leader of developing nations at the world trade organization and its status as a sizeable recipient of eu development funds .
they are also keen to promote the eu 's experience in conflict settlement , no small concern here given india 's intractable dispute with pakistan over kashmir . eu funding has made visible differences the € 100 million -lrb- $ 120 million -rrb- of eu grant aid spent annually in india is spread far and wide .
in the slums of mysore near bangalore , an eu-funded project has brought schooling , immunization and basic sanitation to communities where literacy was just 10 percent five years ago and easily preventable diseases were rife , according to the non-governmental organization overseeing the work .
but as eu officials freely admit , such work does not get much publicity in the local press , hence the seminars .
" the eu has an obligation still to explain that it is more than a fortress , the horrifying force behind the wto wanting to take over india .
we need to counter that with an alternative viewpoint , " said robert aarsse , first secretary at the dutch embassy in delhi , whose country holds the bloc 's rotating presidency .
" one thing we stress is that we are multilateral , whereas the us is unilateral .
we want to show india that we are a partner to work with , " he added .
proposed strategic partnership to be discussed at the highest levels of government , the two sides are already well engaged .
ministerial meetings are held regularly , and next month will see the fifth annual eu-india summit , in the dutch capital the hague .
in preparation for the summit , the european commission in june unveiled a new set of proposals designed to entrench a fledgling " strategic partnership " with india .
but for rajendra jain , professor of european studies at delhi 's jawaharlal nehru university , india still prefers to deal one-to-one with the big eu nations such as britain and france , and is " obsessed " by its relations with the united states .
" the indian elite thinks the eu is just not credible as a foreign policy actor , so the eu is not taken seriously , " jain said .
" and in india , the leading eu nations like britain often have their own agendas to promote , so they 're disinclined to give the eu a profile of its own . "
still , if nothing else the eu has covered itself in a sprinkling of glamour by organizing the seminars at a bangalore resort hotel owned by bollywood star sanjay khan and at southern india 's largest film studios outside hyderabad .

just do n't expect any fancy stuff - not from the germans anyway . world champions brazil take on germany in a friendly game in berlin on wednesday .
the prestigious match carries little importance to the home side other than it represents a chance to exact revenge on the samba stars who ruined their improbable world cup dream two years ago by beating them 2-0 in yokohama in the 2002 final . germany as hosts for the 2006 world cup are automatically installed in the tournament while recent rule changes dictate that reigning world champions brazil have to qualify for the right to defend their crown .
brazil will arrive in germany after beating bolivia 3-1 in a world cup qualifier in sao paulo and will view the match as a chance to keep the team ’ s momentum ahead of more demanding and important clashes in the south american qualifying group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn prays for the yokohama pitch to open up in the world cup final 2002 .
for germany , however , it will be the first opportunity since the world cup final to regain their pride against ronaldo and co .
after progressing against the odds to the showpiece finale in japan , the germans felt aggrieved that they did not take the chance to claim a famous victory and a fourth world cup . but for those expecting a german fairytale ending on wednesday , the recent words of team captain michael ballack may already have dampened the spirits of fans hoping for an exhibition display from the home side . ballack forgoes beauty for success midfielder ballack told the german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung on sunday that germany do not need to play a " beautiful game " to succeed and should focus instead on developing a winning mentality .
" one does n't have to play beautiful football .
success is what counts . " someone may want to remind ballack that the current germany team has lacked both beauty and success of late .
germany have not beaten a major soccer power in their last nine matches and were dumped out of the recent european championships after the first round .
the last time the germans beat a top-level side was october 7 , 2000 when they secured a 1-0 victory over england .
after that , they lost 1-0 to france , 5-1 to england and 1-0 to argentina in the run-up to the 2002 world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack scores past south korean goalkeeper lee woon jae during the 2002 world cup semi-final .
then in japan / korea , germany beat paraguay , the united states and south korea before losing in the final .
since then , they have gone down 3-1 to the netherlands , 3-1 to spain , 1-0 to italy and 3-0 to france .
they then drew 1-1 against the netherlands at euro 2004 .
a victory over brazil may not be impossible but the statistics suggest a win would be unlikely , an attractive one even less so . brazil buzzing with invention in contrast , the brazilians arrive in berlin this week on the back of a splendid display of inspirational soccer against bolivia and bring with them a restored reputation as the harlem globetrotters of the international game . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronaldo real madrid striker and germany ’ s world cup final nemesis ronaldo had promised fans a gala in sao paulo .
and brazil did not fail to deliver .
ronaldo himself opened the scoring with a blistering volley before the game was even a minute old .
the game then turned into an exhibition of art-soccer when ronaldinho fired a 12th minute penalty into the lower left corner for a 2-0 lead .
and just before half-time , copa america hero adriano leaped above the bolivian backline to head in a cross from ronaldinho to make it 3-0 . " it was a good result and an excellent performance , " said ronaldo at the post-match press conference .
" we have every reason to be happy .
it was marvelous .
we played excellent soccer and we 're the leaders of the group . "
the win puts brazil ahead of argentina in the group and their world cup campaign in motion . despite the feel-good factor running through the brazilian team after sunday ’ s win , there will be a cloud hanging over the samba stars when they arrive in germany . club restrictions lead to player ban bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucio .
some of brazil 's most exciting and established players will not be on view in berlin on wednesday .
the five players who did not play in brazil 's friendly international in haiti on the august 18 were left out of the bolivia game and will also be excluded for the germany clash .
ac milan players cafu , kaka and dida , along with bayer leverkusen 's lucio -lrb- photo -rrb- and ze roberto have been punished by the brazilian football federation -lrb- cbf -rrb- for not appearing in brazil 's 6-0 victory at port-au-prince .
the stars were absent after not being released by their clubs for the haiti game .
ronaldo has been quoted as supporting the decision , saying that the cbf wanted to preserve the honor of those who wear brazil 's green and yellow colors .
however , ronaldo 's team mate in the spanish capital , fellow galactico roberto carlos , was not of the same opinion , saying : " the federations and the clubs have to work together . "
the brazil captain added the five excluded players would have loved to be playing for brazil .

but this culinary diversity is something that only emerged after the iron curtain fell in 1989 .
before that , when poles did n't feel like slaving behind the stove , they did n't hop in the car and head for the nearest golden arches - instead they hopped on over to their local government-subsidized milk bars -lrb- bar mleczny -rrb- for a quick repast and a night on the town .
mcstate subsidized subsidized by the government , the milk bars served as an important social outlet under poland 's communist government .
the socialist idea behind the bars was to provide each worker and citizen with the possibility of an affordable warm meal .
people from all walks of life frequented the milk bars - and many still do .
and though the name may evoke images of bovine creations , the milk bars did n't just sell milk or ice cream .
you could also get a balanced , square meal .
but the meals did tend to rely heavily on dairy products for their inspiration .
during the peak of communism , self-service restaurants like milk bars could be found throughout the eastern bloc .
in the former east germany , for example , they could be found in most cities .
but today they have vanished from most countries except poland .
competition for the burger industry with the onslaught of western fast food and diminishing government subsidies , poland 's tradition of milk bars has struggled in recent years , with many going out of business .
but in the country 's metropolises , like warsaw or gdansk , milk bars are still trendy hangouts .
and though they now have to compete with fast food and kebab stands , the polish government wants to keep them in business and backs them to the tune of several million euros in subsidies each year .
with their low prices , the milk bars are attracting a growing number of students and pensioners .
with meals costing as little as € 1 to € 4 , the prices are attractive .
still , the hunt for a bargain is n't the only thing that draws people to the milk bars .
patrick szymanski , a 23-year-old student , eats in a milk bar every day and he loves warsaw 's milk bars , because he does n't have to do any cooking or clean-up .
" in former times there were as many milk bars as there are coffee shops now .
but now there are almost only kebab shops and asian takeaways , " recalled a guy named janusz , a 66-year-old warsaw native who was eating lunch with his friend bogdan at bar studencki , a traditional milk bar at the university of warsaw .
janusz said he 'd rather dig into a milk bar 's traditional fare of soup and potato-filled piroshkis than go to a fast food chain .
" it tastes almost as good as my wife 's cooking , " asserts the 59-year-old bodgan .
" i like the polish kitchen .
unlike fast food , it 's actually healthy , " said a friend of bodgan 's .
a cult following for many polish youngsters , who have long forgotten the days of long queing lines and food rations under communism , milk bars have gained cult status .
for some old enough to remember communism , it 's one of the friendlier reminders of poland 's socialist past .
but others , like janusz and bogdan have a simpler reason for hanging out at the milk bars .

eu officials are therefore touring the country to foster a more positive profile . at a series of seminars with the media in the southern cities of bangalore and hyderabad in the past week , held at glitzy locations linked to the country 's booming film industry , eu representatives have pitched for a greater understanding of what the eu does internally , on the global stage and in india itself .
they have had to start with basics by explaining the role taken by the executive european commission in initiating and policing eu legislation and the commission 's often troublesome interplay with the member states .
the distinction is important as in some areas of vital interest to india , notably trade ; the commission is the eu 's voice in international negotiations .
yet in others , such as foreign policy , the commission is powerless with the member states making the running . journalists drawn from southern india confessed to finding the details sometimes baffling and said the eu still has much work to do to establish its relevance to india beyond the trade front .
ordinary indians should be the target audience " the eu needs to do much more to raise public awareness among ordinary indians , by publicizing their important aid work and holding cultural events , " k.n. tilak kumar , chairman of the regional deccan herald newspaper group , told afp .
delegates at the seminars said eu-organized film events showcasing the best of contemporary european cinema had been big hits with indian audiences more used to a solid diet of bollywood fantasy interspersed with hollywood blockbusters .
" if they want the eu to be known here , they have to make news in india , " kumar added .
in-fighting creates a bad image the eu has been making headlines in the indian press , but for all the wrong reasons .
well-publicized rows among member states , such as over iraq , have undermined attempts by the bloc to portray itself as a big player on the world stage .
" you have to have a policy on iraq , the most important foreign policy issue of the day .
having a policy on some things and a non-policy on others is no way of carrying on , " said kumar .
caught at the sharp end are the under-resourced diplomats tasked with flying the eu 's blue starred flag abroad .
drawn from the commission 's external relations department , their work is largely confined to trade negotiations and overseeing aid projects .
for the staff of the new delhi embassy , that work is hugely important given india 's pivotal role as a leader of developing nations at the world trade organization and its status as a sizeable recipient of eu development funds .
they are also keen to promote the eu 's experience in conflict settlement , no small concern here given india 's intractable dispute with pakistan over kashmir . eu funding has made visible differences the € 100 million -lrb- $ 120 million -rrb- of eu grant aid spent annually in india is spread far and wide .
in the slums of mysore near bangalore , an eu-funded project has brought schooling , immunization and basic sanitation to communities where literacy was just 10 percent five years ago and easily preventable diseases were rife , according to the non-governmental organization overseeing the work .
but as eu officials freely admit , such work does not get much publicity in the local press , hence the seminars .
" the eu has an obligation still to explain that it is more than a fortress , the horrifying force behind the wto wanting to take over india .
we need to counter that with an alternative viewpoint , " said robert aarsse , first secretary at the dutch embassy in delhi , whose country holds the bloc 's rotating presidency .
" one thing we stress is that we are multilateral , whereas the us is unilateral .
we want to show india that we are a partner to work with , " he added .
proposed strategic partnership to be discussed at the highest levels of government , the two sides are already well engaged .
ministerial meetings are held regularly , and next month will see the fifth annual eu-india summit , in the dutch capital the hague .
in preparation for the summit , the european commission in june unveiled a new set of proposals designed to entrench a fledgling " strategic partnership " with india .
but for rajendra jain , professor of european studies at delhi 's jawaharlal nehru university , india still prefers to deal one-to-one with the big eu nations such as britain and france , and is " obsessed " by its relations with the united states .
" the indian elite thinks the eu is just not credible as a foreign policy actor , so the eu is not taken seriously , " jain said .
" and in india , the leading eu nations like britain often have their own agendas to promote , so they 're disinclined to give the eu a profile of its own . "
still , if nothing else the eu has covered itself in a sprinkling of glamour by organizing the seminars at a bangalore resort hotel owned by bollywood star sanjay khan and at southern india 's largest film studios outside hyderabad .

sometimes actors play such powerful roles or infamous characters they get typecast for the rest of their careers .
bruno ganz is worried about falling into that trap after playing the ultimate bad guy - adolf hitler . " the downfall - hitler and the end of the third reich " tells the story of the dictator as a tragic human being , not just a monster , and ganz 's exceptional acting ability has him concerned how he 'll be seen after the film , which portrays the last 12 day of hitler 's life in a berlin bunker , opens on sept .
16 .
" i do n't know what 's going to happen when the film reaches the public , " the 63-year-old swiss actor told the bild am sonntag newspaper .
" there could be some mistaken or disturbed people who confuse me with hitler . "
if critics are to be believed , he may have something to worry about .
while many wonder if the time is right , or could ever be right , for a film showing hitler as a human being , commentators agree ganz 's portrayal is right on target .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ganz as hitler " ganz is hitler , " said historian joachim fest , whose biography of the nazi leader the film drew on .
ganz needed a long time before deciding to take the role , and his son was nearly successful in dissuading him when he said it would n't be healthy " to enter a sick person 's mind for so long . "
but upon seeing himself made up as hitler , complete with his famous moustache , ganz was convinced him to take his first leading role in a german movie in 16 years .
but hairpieces and uniforms were n't enough to allow ganz to convincingly portray the austrian-born " führer , " he also had to get into the mass murderer 's head .
" if i only hate hitler , then i ca n't open things up for myself .
that only happens with affection , " ganz said .
" i was forced to develop an understanding for the man .
i 'm not ashamed of the fact that i was able to feel sympathy for him during fleeting seconds . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from " the downfall " moments of understanding are okay , according to the producer of " the downfall , " bernd eichinger .
but if viewers walk away after the movie 's more that two hours feeling general sympathy for hitler , then " the film has failed in its intention . "
after the € 13.5 million -lrb- $ 16.3 million -rrb- film ends it run in theaters , ganz wants to put the typecast theory to the test .
he said for his next project he 'd like a part in a comedy . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de film portrays hitler in human light adolf hitler spent his last days in an underground bunker in berlin amid a combination of fear and unreality .

just do n't expect any fancy stuff - not from the germans anyway . world champions brazil take on germany in a friendly game in berlin on wednesday .
the prestigious match carries little importance to the home side other than it represents a chance to exact revenge on the samba stars who ruined their improbable world cup dream two years ago by beating them 2-0 in yokohama in the 2002 final . germany as hosts for the 2006 world cup are automatically installed in the tournament while recent rule changes dictate that reigning world champions brazil have to qualify for the right to defend their crown .
brazil will arrive in germany after beating bolivia 3-1 in a world cup qualifier in sao paulo and will view the match as a chance to keep the team ’ s momentum ahead of more demanding and important clashes in the south american qualifying group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn prays for the yokohama pitch to open up in the world cup final 2002 .
for germany , however , it will be the first opportunity since the world cup final to regain their pride against ronaldo and co .
after progressing against the odds to the showpiece finale in japan , the germans felt aggrieved that they did not take the chance to claim a famous victory and a fourth world cup . but for those expecting a german fairytale ending on wednesday , the recent words of team captain michael ballack may already have dampened the spirits of fans hoping for an exhibition display from the home side . ballack forgoes beauty for success midfielder ballack told the german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung on sunday that germany do not need to play a " beautiful game " to succeed and should focus instead on developing a winning mentality .
" one does n't have to play beautiful football .
success is what counts . " someone may want to remind ballack that the current germany team has lacked both beauty and success of late .
germany have not beaten a major soccer power in their last nine matches and were dumped out of the recent european championships after the first round .
the last time the germans beat a top-level side was october 7 , 2000 when they secured a 1-0 victory over england .
after that , they lost 1-0 to france , 5-1 to england and 1-0 to argentina in the run-up to the 2002 world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack scores past south korean goalkeeper lee woon jae during the 2002 world cup semi-final .
then in japan / korea , germany beat paraguay , the united states and south korea before losing in the final .
since then , they have gone down 3-1 to the netherlands , 3-1 to spain , 1-0 to italy and 3-0 to france .
they then drew 1-1 against the netherlands at euro 2004 .
a victory over brazil may not be impossible but the statistics suggest a win would be unlikely , an attractive one even less so . brazil buzzing with invention in contrast , the brazilians arrive in berlin this week on the back of a splendid display of inspirational soccer against bolivia and bring with them a restored reputation as the harlem globetrotters of the international game . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronaldo real madrid striker and germany ’ s world cup final nemesis ronaldo had promised fans a gala in sao paulo .
and brazil did not fail to deliver .
ronaldo himself opened the scoring with a blistering volley before the game was even a minute old .
the game then turned into an exhibition of art-soccer when ronaldinho fired a 12th minute penalty into the lower left corner for a 2-0 lead .
and just before half-time , copa america hero adriano leaped above the bolivian backline to head in a cross from ronaldinho to make it 3-0 . " it was a good result and an excellent performance , " said ronaldo at the post-match press conference .
" we have every reason to be happy .
it was marvelous .
we played excellent soccer and we 're the leaders of the group . "
the win puts brazil ahead of argentina in the group and their world cup campaign in motion . despite the feel-good factor running through the brazilian team after sunday ’ s win , there will be a cloud hanging over the samba stars when they arrive in germany . club restrictions lead to player ban bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucio .
some of brazil 's most exciting and established players will not be on view in berlin on wednesday .
the five players who did not play in brazil 's friendly international in haiti on the august 18 were left out of the bolivia game and will also be excluded for the germany clash .
ac milan players cafu , kaka and dida , along with bayer leverkusen 's lucio -lrb- photo -rrb- and ze roberto have been punished by the brazilian football federation -lrb- cbf -rrb- for not appearing in brazil 's 6-0 victory at port-au-prince .
the stars were absent after not being released by their clubs for the haiti game .
ronaldo has been quoted as supporting the decision , saying that the cbf wanted to preserve the honor of those who wear brazil 's green and yellow colors .
however , ronaldo 's team mate in the spanish capital , fellow galactico roberto carlos , was not of the same opinion , saying : " the federations and the clubs have to work together . "
the brazil captain added the five excluded players would have loved to be playing for brazil .
there is a feeling that the situation may stoke the fires of a simmering club-versus-country row with the affected players unhappy at their own clubs insistence that they remain with the domestic squad when brazil has issued call-ups . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de club versus country row mars brazil 's visit germany 's next game in its world cup preparations will be a friendly against brazil on wednesday .

yet despite the kremlin 's restrictive policies , russia needs solidarity from the international community . on monday , hundreds of people said goodbye to the victims of the three-day school siege in the town of beslan , while in local hospitals many others continued to fight for their lives .
family members of the victims and survivors of the bloodbath in north ossetia are in despair - all of russia finds itself in mourning - and the world looks on in horror as the full magnitude of the tragedy is slowly revealed .

a political debate in the country 's media over the background and consequences of the three-day siege is not taking place . only later did vladimir putin go to the site of these dramatic events , visiting the injured in the hospital and for good reason avoiding any meeting with residents of beslan .
instead , he turned to the russian people in a speech .
but on doing this , president putin , who so loves to present himself as the " man of action , " appeared to be at a loss and even downright petrified . he continues to avoid addressing the real causes of this tragedy - the war in chechnya that has been raging for years , and which is at least partly to blame for the growth of terror tactics and the deaths of many innocent people .
as much as putin would like russians to believe , these are not external conflicts that have been imported into the region .
it is a very russian problem - the independence fight for a small republic in the caucasus - that has fuelled this conflict . the radicals , and especially the determined terrorists in beslan , have only been able to gain ground after the long years of war and bloody conflict in the region have created an army of desperate people .
these are people who have lost everything , whose family members have been tortured and murdered and whose young people know nothing but violence .
these are people who have had to experience unbelievable barbarity from both russians and chechens and now want only one thing : revenge .
at the same time , there is no greater desire among the civilian population than to simply live in peace . beslan is a horrible symbol for a conflict that has long since expanded beyond the borders of chechnya and now threatens to set the entire caucasus region ablaze .
putin must now try to break this vicious circle , with international assistance if necessary .
and the west should be ready to provide it because in the war against terror , russian needs solidarity . cornelia rabitz -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de death toll above 320 in russian school attack while estimates of the number of people killed in the hostage-taking drama in a russian school rose ever higher on saturday , many questions remained unanswered the day after a siege put an end to the crisis .

but this culinary diversity is something that only emerged after the iron curtain fell in 1989 .
before that , when poles did n't feel like slaving behind the stove , they did n't hop in the car and head for the nearest golden arches - instead they hopped on over to their local government-subsidized milk bars -lrb- bar mleczny -rrb- for a quick repast and a night on the town .
mcstate subsidized subsidized by the government , the milk bars served as an important social outlet under poland 's communist government .
the socialist idea behind the bars was to provide each worker and citizen with the possibility of an affordable warm meal .
people from all walks of life frequented the milk bars - and many still do .

and though they now have to compete with fast food and kebab stands , the polish government wants to keep them in business and backs them to the tune of several million euros in subsidies each year .

patrick szymanski , a 23-year-old student , eats in a milk bar every day and he loves warsaw 's milk bars , because he does n't have to do any cooking or clean-up .
" in former times there were as many milk bars as there are coffee shops now .
but now there are almost only kebab shops and asian takeaways , " recalled a guy named janusz , a 66-year-old warsaw native who was eating lunch with his friend bogdan at bar studencki , a traditional milk bar at the university of warsaw .

yet despite the kremlin 's restrictive policies , russia needs solidarity from the international community . on monday , hundreds of people said goodbye to the victims of the three-day school siege in the town of beslan , while in local hospitals many others continued to fight for their lives .
family members of the victims and survivors of the bloodbath in north ossetia are in despair - all of russia finds itself in mourning - and the world looks on in horror as the full magnitude of the tragedy is slowly revealed .
the hostage numbers are continually being revised upwards and the origin of the hostage takers is still uncertain .
the versions of the events at the violent end the siege are conflicting . there were mistakes on the part of the russian special bildunterschrift : forces , as president putin admitted in a speech .
eyewitnesses report serious failures during the storming of the school .

just do n't expect any fancy stuff - not from the germans anyway . world champions brazil take on germany in a friendly game in berlin on wednesday .
the prestigious match carries little importance to the home side other than it represents a chance to exact revenge on the samba stars who ruined their improbable world cup dream two years ago by beating them 2-0 in yokohama in the 2002 final . germany as hosts for the 2006 world cup are automatically installed in the tournament while recent rule changes dictate that reigning world champions brazil have to qualify for the right to defend their crown .

germany have not beaten a major soccer power in their last nine matches and were dumped out of the recent european championships after the first round .
the last time the germans beat a top-level side was october 7 , 2000 when they secured a 1-0 victory over england .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 07.09.2004 opinion : russia needs international solidarity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : images from the school siege have shocked russia and the world official versions of the hostage drama in north ossetia and the true events on the ground are widely divergent .
yet despite the kremlin 's restrictive policies , russia needs solidarity from the international community . on monday , hundreds of people said goodbye to the victims of the three-day school siege in the town of beslan , while in local hospitals many others continued to fight for their lives .
family members of the victims and survivors of the bloodbath in north ossetia are in despair - all of russia finds itself in mourning - and the world looks on in horror as the full magnitude of the tragedy is slowly revealed .
the hostage numbers are continually being revised upwards and the origin of the hostage takers is still uncertain .
the versions of the events at the violent end the siege are conflicting . there were mistakes on the part of the russian special bildunterschrift : forces , as president putin admitted in a speech .
eyewitnesses report serious failures during the storming of the school .
again , russian journalists are being prevented from providing a comprehensive account of what happened in beslan to the public .
a political debate in the country 's media over the background and consequences of the three-day siege is not taking place . only later did vladimir putin go to the site of these dramatic events , visiting the injured in the hospital and for good reason avoiding any meeting with residents of beslan .
instead , he turned to the russian people in a speech .
but on doing this , president putin , who so loves to present himself as the " man of action , " appeared to be at a loss and even downright petrified . he continues to avoid addressing the real causes of this tragedy - the war in chechnya that has been raging for years , and which is at least partly to blame for the growth of terror tactics and the deaths of many innocent people .
as much as putin would like russians to believe , these are not external conflicts that have been imported into the region .
it is a very russian problem - the independence fight for a small republic in the caucasus - that has fuelled this conflict . the radicals , and especially the determined terrorists in beslan , have only been able to gain ground after the long years of war and bloody conflict in the region have created an army of desperate people .
these are people who have lost everything , whose family members have been tortured and murdered and whose young people know nothing but violence .
these are people who have had to experience unbelievable barbarity from both russians and chechens and now want only one thing : revenge .
at the same time , there is no greater desire among the civilian population than to simply live in peace . beslan is a horrible symbol for a conflict that has long since expanded beyond the borders of chechnya and now threatens to set the entire caucasus region ablaze .
putin must now try to break this vicious circle , with international assistance if necessary .
and the west should be ready to provide it because in the war against terror , russian needs solidarity . cornelia rabitz -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de death toll above 320 in russian school attack while estimates of the number of people killed in the hostage-taking drama in a russian school rose ever higher on saturday , many questions remained unanswered the day after a siege put an end to the crisis .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 07.09.2004 opinion : russia needs international solidarity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : images from the school siege have shocked russia and the world official versions of the hostage drama in north ossetia and the true events on the ground are widely divergent .
yet despite the kremlin 's restrictive policies , russia needs solidarity from the international community . on monday , hundreds of people said goodbye to the victims of the three-day school siege in the town of beslan , while in local hospitals many others continued to fight for their lives .
family members of the victims and survivors of the bloodbath in north ossetia are in despair - all of russia finds itself in mourning - and the world looks on in horror as the full magnitude of the tragedy is slowly revealed .
the hostage numbers are continually being revised upwards and the origin of the hostage takers is still uncertain .
the versions of the events at the violent end the siege are conflicting . there were mistakes on the part of the russian special bildunterschrift : forces , as president putin admitted in a speech .
eyewitnesses report serious failures during the storming of the school .
again , russian journalists are being prevented from providing a comprehensive account of what happened in beslan to the public .
a political debate in the country 's media over the background and consequences of the three-day siege is not taking place . only later did vladimir putin go to the site of these dramatic events , visiting the injured in the hospital and for good reason avoiding any meeting with residents of beslan .
instead , he turned to the russian people in a speech .
but on doing this , president putin , who so loves to present himself as the " man of action , " appeared to be at a loss and even downright petrified . he continues to avoid addressing the real causes of this tragedy - the war in chechnya that has been raging for years , and which is at least partly to blame for the growth of terror tactics and the deaths of many innocent people .
as much as putin would like russians to believe , these are not external conflicts that have been imported into the region .
it is a very russian problem - the independence fight for a small republic in the caucasus - that has fuelled this conflict . the radicals , and especially the determined terrorists in beslan , have only been able to gain ground after the long years of war and bloody conflict in the region have created an army of desperate people .
these are people who have lost everything , whose family members have been tortured and murdered and whose young people know nothing but violence .
these are people who have had to experience unbelievable barbarity from both russians and chechens and now want only one thing : revenge .
at the same time , there is no greater desire among the civilian population than to simply live in peace . beslan is a horrible symbol for a conflict that has long since expanded beyond the borders of chechnya and now threatens to set the entire caucasus region ablaze .
putin must now try to break this vicious circle , with international assistance if necessary .
and the west should be ready to provide it because in the war against terror , russian needs solidarity . cornelia rabitz -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de death toll above 320 in russian school attack while estimates of the number of people killed in the hostage-taking drama in a russian school rose ever higher on saturday , many questions remained unanswered the day after a siege put an end to the crisis .

" our economy has turned the corner .
all forecasts indicate we will reach growth of between 1.5 and 2 percent this year , " he told the assembled members of the bundestag . the finance minister revealed proposals for € 22 billion of new debt to finance expected new investments of € 22.8 billion .
eichel also stated that total government spending would reach € 258 billion in 2005 , about € 1 billion higher than in the current year .
however , his budget draft contained projected privatization proceeds of some € 15 billion next year , which the government hopes will help reign in the budget deficit to back below the eu stability and growth pact 's ceiling of three percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- . cdu calls for eichel to step down germany ’ s conservative opposition criticized eichels figures as wild guesses and accused him of disregarding a number of risks and pitfalls .
the cdu ’ s budget spokesman dietrich austerman spoke of a huge question mark behind predictions of revenues from a controversial highway toll system for trucks , which is to be introduced next year . he also pointed out that the government ’ s labor market reform would run up a bill of at least € 5 billion more than what was planned in the budget .
austerman called on the government to withdraw the budget plan and asked the finance minister to step down . " the budget 2005 epitomizes the failure of red-green budget policy , he says .
it is in violation of the constitution and the eu stability pact because it makes no attempt at consolidation .
it is entirely based on false figures and totally insufficient to boost the economy .
there are incalculable risks that should prompt the government to redo their budget and start all over again . " last week , eichel raised the forecast for this year 's budget deficit , saying declining tax income and increased spending on the unemployed would push the shortfall further beyond european union limits for a third straight year , reaching an estimated 3.7 percent of gdp in 2004 compared with a previous forecast of 3.25 percent published half a year ago . deficit reduction target gets helping hand the ultimate objective of getting the german budget deficit to below eu levels may also get a helping hand from the european commission and its proposed watering down of the hard-line pact .
brussels announced plans last week to make the pact less rigid including paying greater attention to economic developments when setting deadlines for budget cuts , taking account of whether a country 's debts are sustainable , and making greater allowances for the state of the economy . eichel welcomed the proposals drawn up by the european commission , saying the changes would help boost economic growth in europe .
" i can only welcome the proposals put forward by brussels , they 're what i 've been calling for all along , " he said . bundesbank lashes out at commission however , as eichel was addressing the bundestag on tuesday , the bundesbank was lashing out at the european commission 's proposals , arguing that the changes would weaken the stability and growth pact and lead to a worsening of monetary policy conditions in the euro area . " the bundesbank is of the opinion that the proposed changes will not strengthen but weaken the stability pact , " the german central bank said in a statement .
" that would lead to a deterioration of the conditions for monetary policy in the single currency area , " it added , indicating that if governments pursued a policy of loose purse strings in europe , the european central bank might be compelled to react by raising its key interest rates .
" healthy state finances are an important pre-condition for the ecb to guarantee price stability in the long term via relatively low interest rates , " the bundesbank said . the proposed changes " will reduce the incentive for euro zone countries to pursue solid budget policies and , at the same time , send a wrong signal to those countries that have not yet adopted the single currency " , the bank complained .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 07.09.2004 opinion : russia needs international solidarity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : images from the school siege have shocked russia and the world official versions of the hostage drama in north ossetia and the true events on the ground are widely divergent .
yet despite the kremlin 's restrictive policies , russia needs solidarity from the international community . on monday , hundreds of people said goodbye to the victims of the three-day school siege in the town of beslan , while in local hospitals many others continued to fight for their lives .
family members of the victims and survivors of the bloodbath in north ossetia are in despair - all of russia finds itself in mourning - and the world looks on in horror as the full magnitude of the tragedy is slowly revealed .
the hostage numbers are continually being revised upwards and the origin of the hostage takers is still uncertain .
the versions of the events at the violent end the siege are conflicting . there were mistakes on the part of the russian special bildunterschrift : forces , as president putin admitted in a speech .
eyewitnesses report serious failures during the storming of the school .
again , russian journalists are being prevented from providing a comprehensive account of what happened in beslan to the public .
a political debate in the country 's media over the background and consequences of the three-day siege is not taking place . only later did vladimir putin go to the site of these dramatic events , visiting the injured in the hospital and for good reason avoiding any meeting with residents of beslan .
instead , he turned to the russian people in a speech .
but on doing this , president putin , who so loves to present himself as the " man of action , " appeared to be at a loss and even downright petrified . he continues to avoid addressing the real causes of this tragedy - the war in chechnya that has been raging for years , and which is at least partly to blame for the growth of terror tactics and the deaths of many innocent people .
as much as putin would like russians to believe , these are not external conflicts that have been imported into the region .
it is a very russian problem - the independence fight for a small republic in the caucasus - that has fuelled this conflict . the radicals , and especially the determined terrorists in beslan , have only been able to gain ground after the long years of war and bloody conflict in the region have created an army of desperate people .
these are people who have lost everything , whose family members have been tortured and murdered and whose young people know nothing but violence .
these are people who have had to experience unbelievable barbarity from both russians and chechens and now want only one thing : revenge .

eu officials are therefore touring the country to foster a more positive profile . at a series of seminars with the media in the southern cities of bangalore and hyderabad in the past week , held at glitzy locations linked to the country 's booming film industry , eu representatives have pitched for a greater understanding of what the eu does internally , on the global stage and in india itself .
they have had to start with basics by explaining the role taken by the executive european commission in initiating and policing eu legislation and the commission 's often troublesome interplay with the member states .
the distinction is important as in some areas of vital interest to india , notably trade ; the commission is the eu 's voice in international negotiations .
yet in others , such as foreign policy , the commission is powerless with the member states making the running . journalists drawn from southern india confessed to finding the details sometimes baffling and said the eu still has much work to do to establish its relevance to india beyond the trade front .
ordinary indians should be the target audience " the eu needs to do much more to raise public awareness among ordinary indians , by publicizing their important aid work and holding cultural events , " k.n. tilak kumar , chairman of the regional deccan herald newspaper group , told afp .
delegates at the seminars said eu-organized film events showcasing the best of contemporary european cinema had been big hits with indian audiences more used to a solid diet of bollywood fantasy interspersed with hollywood blockbusters .
" if they want the eu to be known here , they have to make news in india , " kumar added .
in-fighting creates a bad image the eu has been making headlines in the indian press , but for all the wrong reasons .
well-publicized rows among member states , such as over iraq , have undermined attempts by the bloc to portray itself as a big player on the world stage .
" you have to have a policy on iraq , the most important foreign policy issue of the day .
having a policy on some things and a non-policy on others is no way of carrying on , " said kumar .
caught at the sharp end are the under-resourced diplomats tasked with flying the eu 's blue starred flag abroad .
drawn from the commission 's external relations department , their work is largely confined to trade negotiations and overseeing aid projects .
for the staff of the new delhi embassy , that work is hugely important given india 's pivotal role as a leader of developing nations at the world trade organization and its status as a sizeable recipient of eu development funds .
they are also keen to promote the eu 's experience in conflict settlement , no small concern here given india 's intractable dispute with pakistan over kashmir . eu funding has made visible differences the € 100 million -lrb- $ 120 million -rrb- of eu grant aid spent annually in india is spread far and wide .
in the slums of mysore near bangalore , an eu-funded project has brought schooling , immunization and basic sanitation to communities where literacy was just 10 percent five years ago and easily preventable diseases were rife , according to the non-governmental organization overseeing the work .
but as eu officials freely admit , such work does not get much publicity in the local press , hence the seminars .
" the eu has an obligation still to explain that it is more than a fortress , the horrifying force behind the wto wanting to take over india .
we need to counter that with an alternative viewpoint , " said robert aarsse , first secretary at the dutch embassy in delhi , whose country holds the bloc 's rotating presidency .
" one thing we stress is that we are multilateral , whereas the us is unilateral .
we want to show india that we are a partner to work with , " he added .
proposed strategic partnership to be discussed at the highest levels of government , the two sides are already well engaged .
ministerial meetings are held regularly , and next month will see the fifth annual eu-india summit , in the dutch capital the hague .
in preparation for the summit , the european commission in june unveiled a new set of proposals designed to entrench a fledgling " strategic partnership " with india .
but for rajendra jain , professor of european studies at delhi 's jawaharlal nehru university , india still prefers to deal one-to-one with the big eu nations such as britain and france , and is " obsessed " by its relations with the united states .
" the indian elite thinks the eu is just not credible as a foreign policy actor , so the eu is not taken seriously , " jain said .
" and in india , the leading eu nations like britain often have their own agendas to promote , so they 're disinclined to give the eu a profile of its own . "
still , if nothing else the eu has covered itself in a sprinkling of glamour by organizing the seminars at a bangalore resort hotel owned by bollywood star sanjay khan and at southern india 's largest film studios outside hyderabad .

bruno ganz is worried about falling into that trap after playing the ultimate bad guy - adolf hitler . " the downfall - hitler and the end of the third reich " tells the story of the dictator as a tragic human being , not just a monster , and ganz 's exceptional acting ability has him concerned how he 'll be seen after the film , which portrays the last 12 day of hitler 's life in a berlin bunker , opens on sept .

" our economy has turned the corner .
all forecasts indicate we will reach growth of between 1.5 and 2 percent this year , " he told the assembled members of the bundestag . the finance minister revealed proposals for € 22 billion of new debt to finance expected new investments of € 22.8 billion .
eichel also stated that total government spending would reach € 258 billion in 2005 , about € 1 billion higher than in the current year .
however , his budget draft contained projected privatization proceeds of some € 15 billion next year , which the government hopes will help reign in the budget deficit to back below the eu stability and growth pact 's ceiling of three percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- . cdu calls for eichel to step down germany ’ s conservative opposition criticized eichels figures as wild guesses and accused him of disregarding a number of risks and pitfalls .
the cdu ’ s budget spokesman dietrich austerman spoke of a huge question mark behind predictions of revenues from a controversial highway toll system for trucks , which is to be introduced next year . he also pointed out that the government ’ s labor market reform would run up a bill of at least € 5 billion more than what was planned in the budget .
austerman called on the government to withdraw the budget plan and asked the finance minister to step down . " the budget 2005 epitomizes the failure of red-green budget policy , he says .
it is in violation of the constitution and the eu stability pact because it makes no attempt at consolidation .
it is entirely based on false figures and totally insufficient to boost the economy .
there are incalculable risks that should prompt the government to redo their budget and start all over again . " last week , eichel raised the forecast for this year 's budget deficit , saying declining tax income and increased spending on the unemployed would push the shortfall further beyond european union limits for a third straight year , reaching an estimated 3.7 percent of gdp in 2004 compared with a previous forecast of 3.25 percent published half a year ago . deficit reduction target gets helping hand the ultimate objective of getting the german budget deficit to below eu levels may also get a helping hand from the european commission and its proposed watering down of the hard-line pact .
brussels announced plans last week to make the pact less rigid including paying greater attention to economic developments when setting deadlines for budget cuts , taking account of whether a country 's debts are sustainable , and making greater allowances for the state of the economy . eichel welcomed the proposals drawn up by the european commission , saying the changes would help boost economic growth in europe .
" i can only welcome the proposals put forward by brussels , they 're what i 've been calling for all along , " he said . bundesbank lashes out at commission however , as eichel was addressing the bundestag on tuesday , the bundesbank was lashing out at the european commission 's proposals , arguing that the changes would weaken the stability and growth pact and lead to a worsening of monetary policy conditions in the euro area . " the bundesbank is of the opinion that the proposed changes will not strengthen but weaken the stability pact , " the german central bank said in a statement .
" that would lead to a deterioration of the conditions for monetary policy in the single currency area , " it added , indicating that if governments pursued a policy of loose purse strings in europe , the european central bank might be compelled to react by raising its key interest rates .
" healthy state finances are an important pre-condition for the ecb to guarantee price stability in the long term via relatively low interest rates , " the bundesbank said . the proposed changes " will reduce the incentive for euro zone countries to pursue solid budget policies and , at the same time , send a wrong signal to those countries that have not yet adopted the single currency " , the bank complained .
furthermore , many of the proposals would " make the rules more complicated and complex , thereby impairing its -lrb- the pact 's -rrb- ability to be implemented , " it argued . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european commission to loosen stability pact the european commission on friday unveiled a plan to introduce more flexibility in the stability and growth pact , saying it was vital to restore the credibility of its much-flouted budget discipline rules .

" our economy has turned the corner .
all forecasts indicate we will reach growth of between 1.5 and 2 percent this year , " he told the assembled members of the bundestag . the finance minister revealed proposals for € 22 billion of new debt to finance expected new investments of € 22.8 billion .
eichel also stated that total government spending would reach € 258 billion in 2005 , about € 1 billion higher than in the current year .
however , his budget draft contained projected privatization proceeds of some € 15 billion next year , which the government hopes will help reign in the budget deficit to back below the eu stability and growth pact 's ceiling of three percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- . cdu calls for eichel to step down germany ’ s conservative opposition criticized eichels figures as wild guesses and accused him of disregarding a number of risks and pitfalls .
the cdu ’ s budget spokesman dietrich austerman spoke of a huge question mark behind predictions of revenues from a controversial highway toll system for trucks , which is to be introduced next year . he also pointed out that the government ’ s labor market reform would run up a bill of at least € 5 billion more than what was planned in the budget .
austerman called on the government to withdraw the budget plan and asked the finance minister to step down . " the budget 2005 epitomizes the failure of red-green budget policy , he says .

" that signal should be very strong and should be unanimously given over by the 25 " eu member states . the dutch made the call in a statement late monday night after a visit by iran 's rowhani in amsterdam , where he met with bot and dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende .
the dutch also raised a number of other concerns , including human rights , terrorism and iran 's position towards israel . german foreign minister joschka fischer has also turned up the pressure on iran , saying a nuclear-capable iran " can become a subject for the -lrb- un -rrb- security council . " eu foreign ministers who met over the weekend said they were discussing whether or not to take iran to the un security council to ensure it is not secretly trying to develop atomic weapons .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 07.09.2004 no frills soccer versus the beautiful game großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just when oli kahn 's nightmares had subsided , this guy turns up again germany welcomes world champions brazil for a friendly match in berlin on wednesday hoping to exact revenge over its world cup nemesis .
just do n't expect any fancy stuff - not from the germans anyway . world champions brazil take on germany in a friendly game in berlin on wednesday .
the prestigious match carries little importance to the home side other than it represents a chance to exact revenge on the samba stars who ruined their improbable world cup dream two years ago by beating them 2-0 in yokohama in the 2002 final . germany as hosts for the 2006 world cup are automatically installed in the tournament while recent rule changes dictate that reigning world champions brazil have to qualify for the right to defend their crown .
brazil will arrive in germany after beating bolivia 3-1 in a world cup qualifier in sao paulo and will view the match as a chance to keep the team ’ s momentum ahead of more demanding and important clashes in the south american qualifying group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn prays for the yokohama pitch to open up in the world cup final 2002 .
for germany , however , it will be the first opportunity since the world cup final to regain their pride against ronaldo and co .
after progressing against the odds to the showpiece finale in japan , the germans felt aggrieved that they did not take the chance to claim a famous victory and a fourth world cup . but for those expecting a german fairytale ending on wednesday , the recent words of team captain michael ballack may already have dampened the spirits of fans hoping for an exhibition display from the home side . ballack forgoes beauty for success midfielder ballack told the german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung on sunday that germany do not need to play a " beautiful game " to succeed and should focus instead on developing a winning mentality .
" one does n't have to play beautiful football .
success is what counts . " someone may want to remind ballack that the current germany team has lacked both beauty and success of late .
germany have not beaten a major soccer power in their last nine matches and were dumped out of the recent european championships after the first round .
the last time the germans beat a top-level side was october 7 , 2000 when they secured a 1-0 victory over england .
after that , they lost 1-0 to france , 5-1 to england and 1-0 to argentina in the run-up to the 2002 world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack scores past south korean goalkeeper lee woon jae during the 2002 world cup semi-final .
then in japan / korea , germany beat paraguay , the united states and south korea before losing in the final .
since then , they have gone down 3-1 to the netherlands , 3-1 to spain , 1-0 to italy and 3-0 to france .
they then drew 1-1 against the netherlands at euro 2004 .
a victory over brazil may not be impossible but the statistics suggest a win would be unlikely , an attractive one even less so . brazil buzzing with invention in contrast , the brazilians arrive in berlin this week on the back of a splendid display of inspirational soccer against bolivia and bring with them a restored reputation as the harlem globetrotters of the international game . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronaldo real madrid striker and germany ’ s world cup final nemesis ronaldo had promised fans a gala in sao paulo .
and brazil did not fail to deliver .
ronaldo himself opened the scoring with a blistering volley before the game was even a minute old .
the game then turned into an exhibition of art-soccer when ronaldinho fired a 12th minute penalty into the lower left corner for a 2-0 lead .
and just before half-time , copa america hero adriano leaped above the bolivian backline to head in a cross from ronaldinho to make it 3-0 . " it was a good result and an excellent performance , " said ronaldo at the post-match press conference .
" we have every reason to be happy .
it was marvelous .
we played excellent soccer and we 're the leaders of the group . "
the win puts brazil ahead of argentina in the group and their world cup campaign in motion . despite the feel-good factor running through the brazilian team after sunday ’ s win , there will be a cloud hanging over the samba stars when they arrive in germany . club restrictions lead to player ban bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucio .
some of brazil 's most exciting and established players will not be on view in berlin on wednesday .
the five players who did not play in brazil 's friendly international in haiti on the august 18 were left out of the bolivia game and will also be excluded for the germany clash .
ac milan players cafu , kaka and dida , along with bayer leverkusen 's lucio -lrb- photo -rrb- and ze roberto have been punished by the brazilian football federation -lrb- cbf -rrb- for not appearing in brazil 's 6-0 victory at port-au-prince .
the stars were absent after not being released by their clubs for the haiti game .
ronaldo has been quoted as supporting the decision , saying that the cbf wanted to preserve the honor of those who wear brazil 's green and yellow colors .
however , ronaldo 's team mate in the spanish capital , fellow galactico roberto carlos , was not of the same opinion , saying : " the federations and the clubs have to work together . "
the brazil captain added the five excluded players would have loved to be playing for brazil .
there is a feeling that the situation may stoke the fires of a simmering club-versus-country row with the affected players unhappy at their own clubs insistence that they remain with the domestic squad when brazil has issued call-ups . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de club versus country row mars brazil 's visit germany 's next game in its world cup preparations will be a friendly against brazil on wednesday .

just do n't expect any fancy stuff - not from the germans anyway . world champions brazil take on germany in a friendly game in berlin on wednesday .
the prestigious match carries little importance to the home side other than it represents a chance to exact revenge on the samba stars who ruined their improbable world cup dream two years ago by beating them 2-0 in yokohama in the 2002 final . germany as hosts for the 2006 world cup are automatically installed in the tournament while recent rule changes dictate that reigning world champions brazil have to qualify for the right to defend their crown .
brazil will arrive in germany after beating bolivia 3-1 in a world cup qualifier in sao paulo and will view the match as a chance to keep the team ’ s momentum ahead of more demanding and important clashes in the south american qualifying group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn prays for the yokohama pitch to open up in the world cup final 2002 .
for germany , however , it will be the first opportunity since the world cup final to regain their pride against ronaldo and co .
after progressing against the odds to the showpiece finale in japan , the germans felt aggrieved that they did not take the chance to claim a famous victory and a fourth world cup . but for those expecting a german fairytale ending on wednesday , the recent words of team captain michael ballack may already have dampened the spirits of fans hoping for an exhibition display from the home side . ballack forgoes beauty for success midfielder ballack told the german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung on sunday that germany do not need to play a " beautiful game " to succeed and should focus instead on developing a winning mentality .
" one does n't have to play beautiful football .
success is what counts . " someone may want to remind ballack that the current germany team has lacked both beauty and success of late .
germany have not beaten a major soccer power in their last nine matches and were dumped out of the recent european championships after the first round .
the last time the germans beat a top-level side was october 7 , 2000 when they secured a 1-0 victory over england .
after that , they lost 1-0 to france , 5-1 to england and 1-0 to argentina in the run-up to the 2002 world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack scores past south korean goalkeeper lee woon jae during the 2002 world cup semi-final .
then in japan / korea , germany beat paraguay , the united states and south korea before losing in the final .
since then , they have gone down 3-1 to the netherlands , 3-1 to spain , 1-0 to italy and 3-0 to france .
they then drew 1-1 against the netherlands at euro 2004 .
a victory over brazil may not be impossible but the statistics suggest a win would be unlikely , an attractive one even less so . brazil buzzing with invention in contrast , the brazilians arrive in berlin this week on the back of a splendid display of inspirational soccer against bolivia and bring with them a restored reputation as the harlem globetrotters of the international game . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronaldo real madrid striker and germany ’ s world cup final nemesis ronaldo had promised fans a gala in sao paulo .
and brazil did not fail to deliver .
ronaldo himself opened the scoring with a blistering volley before the game was even a minute old .
the game then turned into an exhibition of art-soccer when ronaldinho fired a 12th minute penalty into the lower left corner for a 2-0 lead .
and just before half-time , copa america hero adriano leaped above the bolivian backline to head in a cross from ronaldinho to make it 3-0 . " it was a good result and an excellent performance , " said ronaldo at the post-match press conference .
" we have every reason to be happy .
it was marvelous .
we played excellent soccer and we 're the leaders of the group . "
the win puts brazil ahead of argentina in the group and their world cup campaign in motion . despite the feel-good factor running through the brazilian team after sunday ’ s win , there will be a cloud hanging over the samba stars when they arrive in germany . club restrictions lead to player ban bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucio .
some of brazil 's most exciting and established players will not be on view in berlin on wednesday .
the five players who did not play in brazil 's friendly international in haiti on the august 18 were left out of the bolivia game and will also be excluded for the germany clash .
ac milan players cafu , kaka and dida , along with bayer leverkusen 's lucio -lrb- photo -rrb- and ze roberto have been punished by the brazilian football federation -lrb- cbf -rrb- for not appearing in brazil 's 6-0 victory at port-au-prince .
the stars were absent after not being released by their clubs for the haiti game .
ronaldo has been quoted as supporting the decision , saying that the cbf wanted to preserve the honor of those who wear brazil 's green and yellow colors .
however , ronaldo 's team mate in the spanish capital , fellow galactico roberto carlos , was not of the same opinion , saying : " the federations and the clubs have to work together . "
the brazil captain added the five excluded players would have loved to be playing for brazil .
there is a feeling that the situation may stoke the fires of a simmering club-versus-country row with the affected players unhappy at their own clubs insistence that they remain with the domestic squad when brazil has issued call-ups . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de club versus country row mars brazil 's visit germany 's next game in its world cup preparations will be a friendly against brazil on wednesday .

but this culinary diversity is something that only emerged after the iron curtain fell in 1989 .
before that , when poles did n't feel like slaving behind the stove , they did n't hop in the car and head for the nearest golden arches - instead they hopped on over to their local government-subsidized milk bars -lrb- bar mleczny -rrb- for a quick repast and a night on the town .
mcstate subsidized subsidized by the government , the milk bars served as an important social outlet under poland 's communist government .
the socialist idea behind the bars was to provide each worker and citizen with the possibility of an affordable warm meal .
people from all walks of life frequented the milk bars - and many still do .
and though the name may evoke images of bovine creations , the milk bars did n't just sell milk or ice cream .
you could also get a balanced , square meal .
but the meals did tend to rely heavily on dairy products for their inspiration .
during the peak of communism , self-service restaurants like milk bars could be found throughout the eastern bloc .
in the former east germany , for example , they could be found in most cities .
but today they have vanished from most countries except poland .
competition for the burger industry with the onslaught of western fast food and diminishing government subsidies , poland 's tradition of milk bars has struggled in recent years , with many going out of business .
but in the country 's metropolises , like warsaw or gdansk , milk bars are still trendy hangouts .
and though they now have to compete with fast food and kebab stands , the polish government wants to keep them in business and backs them to the tune of several million euros in subsidies each year .
with their low prices , the milk bars are attracting a growing number of students and pensioners .
with meals costing as little as € 1 to € 4 , the prices are attractive .
still , the hunt for a bargain is n't the only thing that draws people to the milk bars .
patrick szymanski , a 23-year-old student , eats in a milk bar every day and he loves warsaw 's milk bars , because he does n't have to do any cooking or clean-up .
" in former times there were as many milk bars as there are coffee shops now .
but now there are almost only kebab shops and asian takeaways , " recalled a guy named janusz , a 66-year-old warsaw native who was eating lunch with his friend bogdan at bar studencki , a traditional milk bar at the university of warsaw .
janusz said he 'd rather dig into a milk bar 's traditional fare of soup and potato-filled piroshkis than go to a fast food chain .
" it tastes almost as good as my wife 's cooking , " asserts the 59-year-old bodgan .
" i like the polish kitchen .
unlike fast food , it 's actually healthy , " said a friend of bodgan 's .
a cult following for many polish youngsters , who have long forgotten the days of long queing lines and food rations under communism , milk bars have gained cult status .
for some old enough to remember communism , it 's one of the friendlier reminders of poland 's socialist past .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 07.09.2004 no frills soccer versus the beautiful game großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just when oli kahn 's nightmares had subsided , this guy turns up again germany welcomes world champions brazil for a friendly match in berlin on wednesday hoping to exact revenge over its world cup nemesis .
just do n't expect any fancy stuff - not from the germans anyway . world champions brazil take on germany in a friendly game in berlin on wednesday .
the prestigious match carries little importance to the home side other than it represents a chance to exact revenge on the samba stars who ruined their improbable world cup dream two years ago by beating them 2-0 in yokohama in the 2002 final . germany as hosts for the 2006 world cup are automatically installed in the tournament while recent rule changes dictate that reigning world champions brazil have to qualify for the right to defend their crown .
brazil will arrive in germany after beating bolivia 3-1 in a world cup qualifier in sao paulo and will view the match as a chance to keep the team ’ s momentum ahead of more demanding and important clashes in the south american qualifying group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn prays for the yokohama pitch to open up in the world cup final 2002 .
for germany , however , it will be the first opportunity since the world cup final to regain their pride against ronaldo and co .
after progressing against the odds to the showpiece finale in japan , the germans felt aggrieved that they did not take the chance to claim a famous victory and a fourth world cup . but for those expecting a german fairytale ending on wednesday , the recent words of team captain michael ballack may already have dampened the spirits of fans hoping for an exhibition display from the home side . ballack forgoes beauty for success midfielder ballack told the german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung on sunday that germany do not need to play a " beautiful game " to succeed and should focus instead on developing a winning mentality .
" one does n't have to play beautiful football .
success is what counts . " someone may want to remind ballack that the current germany team has lacked both beauty and success of late .
germany have not beaten a major soccer power in their last nine matches and were dumped out of the recent european championships after the first round .
the last time the germans beat a top-level side was october 7 , 2000 when they secured a 1-0 victory over england .
after that , they lost 1-0 to france , 5-1 to england and 1-0 to argentina in the run-up to the 2002 world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack scores past south korean goalkeeper lee woon jae during the 2002 world cup semi-final .
then in japan / korea , germany beat paraguay , the united states and south korea before losing in the final .
since then , they have gone down 3-1 to the netherlands , 3-1 to spain , 1-0 to italy and 3-0 to france .
they then drew 1-1 against the netherlands at euro 2004 .
a victory over brazil may not be impossible but the statistics suggest a win would be unlikely , an attractive one even less so . brazil buzzing with invention in contrast , the brazilians arrive in berlin this week on the back of a splendid display of inspirational soccer against bolivia and bring with them a restored reputation as the harlem globetrotters of the international game . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronaldo real madrid striker and germany ’ s world cup final nemesis ronaldo had promised fans a gala in sao paulo .
and brazil did not fail to deliver .
ronaldo himself opened the scoring with a blistering volley before the game was even a minute old .
the game then turned into an exhibition of art-soccer when ronaldinho fired a 12th minute penalty into the lower left corner for a 2-0 lead .
and just before half-time , copa america hero adriano leaped above the bolivian backline to head in a cross from ronaldinho to make it 3-0 . " it was a good result and an excellent performance , " said ronaldo at the post-match press conference .
" we have every reason to be happy .

the stars were absent after not being released by their clubs for the haiti game .
ronaldo has been quoted as supporting the decision , saying that the cbf wanted to preserve the honor of those who wear brazil 's green and yellow colors .

yet despite the kremlin 's restrictive policies , russia needs solidarity from the international community . on monday , hundreds of people said goodbye to the victims of the three-day school siege in the town of beslan , while in local hospitals many others continued to fight for their lives .
family members of the victims and survivors of the bloodbath in north ossetia are in despair - all of russia finds itself in mourning - and the world looks on in horror as the full magnitude of the tragedy is slowly revealed .
the hostage numbers are continually being revised upwards and the origin of the hostage takers is still uncertain .
the versions of the events at the violent end the siege are conflicting . there were mistakes on the part of the russian special bildunterschrift : forces , as president putin admitted in a speech .
eyewitnesses report serious failures during the storming of the school .
again , russian journalists are being prevented from providing a comprehensive account of what happened in beslan to the public .
a political debate in the country 's media over the background and consequences of the three-day siege is not taking place . only later did vladimir putin go to the site of these dramatic events , visiting the injured in the hospital and for good reason avoiding any meeting with residents of beslan .
instead , he turned to the russian people in a speech .
but on doing this , president putin , who so loves to present himself as the " man of action , " appeared to be at a loss and even downright petrified . he continues to avoid addressing the real causes of this tragedy - the war in chechnya that has been raging for years , and which is at least partly to blame for the growth of terror tactics and the deaths of many innocent people .
as much as putin would like russians to believe , these are not external conflicts that have been imported into the region .
it is a very russian problem - the independence fight for a small republic in the caucasus - that has fuelled this conflict . the radicals , and especially the determined terrorists in beslan , have only been able to gain ground after the long years of war and bloody conflict in the region have created an army of desperate people .
these are people who have lost everything , whose family members have been tortured and murdered and whose young people know nothing but violence .
these are people who have had to experience unbelievable barbarity from both russians and chechens and now want only one thing : revenge .
at the same time , there is no greater desire among the civilian population than to simply live in peace . beslan is a horrible symbol for a conflict that has long since expanded beyond the borders of chechnya and now threatens to set the entire caucasus region ablaze .
putin must now try to break this vicious circle , with international assistance if necessary .
and the west should be ready to provide it because in the war against terror , russian needs solidarity . cornelia rabitz -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de death toll above 320 in russian school attack while estimates of the number of people killed in the hostage-taking drama in a russian school rose ever higher on saturday , many questions remained unanswered the day after a siege put an end to the crisis .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 07.09.2004 no frills soccer versus the beautiful game großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just when oli kahn 's nightmares had subsided , this guy turns up again germany welcomes world champions brazil for a friendly match in berlin on wednesday hoping to exact revenge over its world cup nemesis .
just do n't expect any fancy stuff - not from the germans anyway . world champions brazil take on germany in a friendly game in berlin on wednesday .
the prestigious match carries little importance to the home side other than it represents a chance to exact revenge on the samba stars who ruined their improbable world cup dream two years ago by beating them 2-0 in yokohama in the 2002 final . germany as hosts for the 2006 world cup are automatically installed in the tournament while recent rule changes dictate that reigning world champions brazil have to qualify for the right to defend their crown .
brazil will arrive in germany after beating bolivia 3-1 in a world cup qualifier in sao paulo and will view the match as a chance to keep the team ’ s momentum ahead of more demanding and important clashes in the south american qualifying group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn prays for the yokohama pitch to open up in the world cup final 2002 .
for germany , however , it will be the first opportunity since the world cup final to regain their pride against ronaldo and co .
after progressing against the odds to the showpiece finale in japan , the germans felt aggrieved that they did not take the chance to claim a famous victory and a fourth world cup . but for those expecting a german fairytale ending on wednesday , the recent words of team captain michael ballack may already have dampened the spirits of fans hoping for an exhibition display from the home side . ballack forgoes beauty for success midfielder ballack told the german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung on sunday that germany do not need to play a " beautiful game " to succeed and should focus instead on developing a winning mentality .
" one does n't have to play beautiful football .
success is what counts . " someone may want to remind ballack that the current germany team has lacked both beauty and success of late .
germany have not beaten a major soccer power in their last nine matches and were dumped out of the recent european championships after the first round .
the last time the germans beat a top-level side was october 7 , 2000 when they secured a 1-0 victory over england .
after that , they lost 1-0 to france , 5-1 to england and 1-0 to argentina in the run-up to the 2002 world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack scores past south korean goalkeeper lee woon jae during the 2002 world cup semi-final .
then in japan / korea , germany beat paraguay , the united states and south korea before losing in the final .
since then , they have gone down 3-1 to the netherlands , 3-1 to spain , 1-0 to italy and 3-0 to france .
they then drew 1-1 against the netherlands at euro 2004 .
a victory over brazil may not be impossible but the statistics suggest a win would be unlikely , an attractive one even less so . brazil buzzing with invention in contrast , the brazilians arrive in berlin this week on the back of a splendid display of inspirational soccer against bolivia and bring with them a restored reputation as the harlem globetrotters of the international game . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronaldo real madrid striker and germany ’ s world cup final nemesis ronaldo had promised fans a gala in sao paulo .
and brazil did not fail to deliver .
ronaldo himself opened the scoring with a blistering volley before the game was even a minute old .
the game then turned into an exhibition of art-soccer when ronaldinho fired a 12th minute penalty into the lower left corner for a 2-0 lead .
and just before half-time , copa america hero adriano leaped above the bolivian backline to head in a cross from ronaldinho to make it 3-0 . " it was a good result and an excellent performance , " said ronaldo at the post-match press conference .
" we have every reason to be happy .
it was marvelous .
we played excellent soccer and we 're the leaders of the group . "
the win puts brazil ahead of argentina in the group and their world cup campaign in motion . despite the feel-good factor running through the brazilian team after sunday ’ s win , there will be a cloud hanging over the samba stars when they arrive in germany . club restrictions lead to player ban bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucio .

eu officials are therefore touring the country to foster a more positive profile . at a series of seminars with the media in the southern cities of bangalore and hyderabad in the past week , held at glitzy locations linked to the country 's booming film industry , eu representatives have pitched for a greater understanding of what the eu does internally , on the global stage and in india itself .
they have had to start with basics by explaining the role taken by the executive european commission in initiating and policing eu legislation and the commission 's often troublesome interplay with the member states .
the distinction is important as in some areas of vital interest to india , notably trade ; the commission is the eu 's voice in international negotiations .
yet in others , such as foreign policy , the commission is powerless with the member states making the running . journalists drawn from southern india confessed to finding the details sometimes baffling and said the eu still has much work to do to establish its relevance to india beyond the trade front .
ordinary indians should be the target audience " the eu needs to do much more to raise public awareness among ordinary indians , by publicizing their important aid work and holding cultural events , " k.n. tilak kumar , chairman of the regional deccan herald newspaper group , told afp .
delegates at the seminars said eu-organized film events showcasing the best of contemporary european cinema had been big hits with indian audiences more used to a solid diet of bollywood fantasy interspersed with hollywood blockbusters .
" if they want the eu to be known here , they have to make news in india , " kumar added .

caught at the sharp end are the under-resourced diplomats tasked with flying the eu 's blue starred flag abroad .
drawn from the commission 's external relations department , their work is largely confined to trade negotiations and overseeing aid projects .
for the staff of the new delhi embassy , that work is hugely important given india 's pivotal role as a leader of developing nations at the world trade organization and its status as a sizeable recipient of eu development funds .
they are also keen to promote the eu 's experience in conflict settlement , no small concern here given india 's intractable dispute with pakistan over kashmir . eu funding has made visible differences the € 100 million -lrb- $ 120 million -rrb- of eu grant aid spent annually in india is spread far and wide .

but as eu officials freely admit , such work does not get much publicity in the local press , hence the seminars .
" the eu has an obligation still to explain that it is more than a fortress , the horrifying force behind the wto wanting to take over india .
we need to counter that with an alternative viewpoint , " said robert aarsse , first secretary at the dutch embassy in delhi , whose country holds the bloc 's rotating presidency .

sometimes actors play such powerful roles or infamous characters they get typecast for the rest of their careers .
bruno ganz is worried about falling into that trap after playing the ultimate bad guy - adolf hitler . " the downfall - hitler and the end of the third reich " tells the story of the dictator as a tragic human being , not just a monster , and ganz 's exceptional acting ability has him concerned how he 'll be seen after the film , which portrays the last 12 day of hitler 's life in a berlin bunker , opens on sept .
16 .
" i do n't know what 's going to happen when the film reaches the public , " the 63-year-old swiss actor told the bild am sonntag newspaper .
" there could be some mistaken or disturbed people who confuse me with hitler . "
if critics are to be believed , he may have something to worry about .
while many wonder if the time is right , or could ever be right , for a film showing hitler as a human being , commentators agree ganz 's portrayal is right on target .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ganz as hitler " ganz is hitler , " said historian joachim fest , whose biography of the nazi leader the film drew on .
ganz needed a long time before deciding to take the role , and his son was nearly successful in dissuading him when he said it would n't be healthy " to enter a sick person 's mind for so long . "
but upon seeing himself made up as hitler , complete with his famous moustache , ganz was convinced him to take his first leading role in a german movie in 16 years .
but hairpieces and uniforms were n't enough to allow ganz to convincingly portray the austrian-born " führer , " he also had to get into the mass murderer 's head .
" if i only hate hitler , then i ca n't open things up for myself .
that only happens with affection , " ganz said .
" i was forced to develop an understanding for the man .
i 'm not ashamed of the fact that i was able to feel sympathy for him during fleeting seconds . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from " the downfall " moments of understanding are okay , according to the producer of " the downfall , " bernd eichinger .
but if viewers walk away after the movie 's more that two hours feeling general sympathy for hitler , then " the film has failed in its intention . "
after the € 13.5 million -lrb- $ 16.3 million -rrb- film ends it run in theaters , ganz wants to put the typecast theory to the test .
he said for his next project he 'd like a part in a comedy . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de film portrays hitler in human light adolf hitler spent his last days in an underground bunker in berlin amid a combination of fear and unreality .

yet despite the kremlin 's restrictive policies , russia needs solidarity from the international community . on monday , hundreds of people said goodbye to the victims of the three-day school siege in the town of beslan , while in local hospitals many others continued to fight for their lives .
family members of the victims and survivors of the bloodbath in north ossetia are in despair - all of russia finds itself in mourning - and the world looks on in horror as the full magnitude of the tragedy is slowly revealed .
the hostage numbers are continually being revised upwards and the origin of the hostage takers is still uncertain .
the versions of the events at the violent end the siege are conflicting . there were mistakes on the part of the russian special bildunterschrift : forces , as president putin admitted in a speech .
eyewitnesses report serious failures during the storming of the school .
again , russian journalists are being prevented from providing a comprehensive account of what happened in beslan to the public .
a political debate in the country 's media over the background and consequences of the three-day siege is not taking place . only later did vladimir putin go to the site of these dramatic events , visiting the injured in the hospital and for good reason avoiding any meeting with residents of beslan .
instead , he turned to the russian people in a speech .
but on doing this , president putin , who so loves to present himself as the " man of action , " appeared to be at a loss and even downright petrified . he continues to avoid addressing the real causes of this tragedy - the war in chechnya that has been raging for years , and which is at least partly to blame for the growth of terror tactics and the deaths of many innocent people .
as much as putin would like russians to believe , these are not external conflicts that have been imported into the region .
it is a very russian problem - the independence fight for a small republic in the caucasus - that has fuelled this conflict . the radicals , and especially the determined terrorists in beslan , have only been able to gain ground after the long years of war and bloody conflict in the region have created an army of desperate people .
these are people who have lost everything , whose family members have been tortured and murdered and whose young people know nothing but violence .
these are people who have had to experience unbelievable barbarity from both russians and chechens and now want only one thing : revenge .
at the same time , there is no greater desire among the civilian population than to simply live in peace . beslan is a horrible symbol for a conflict that has long since expanded beyond the borders of chechnya and now threatens to set the entire caucasus region ablaze .
putin must now try to break this vicious circle , with international assistance if necessary .
and the west should be ready to provide it because in the war against terror , russian needs solidarity . cornelia rabitz -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de death toll above 320 in russian school attack while estimates of the number of people killed in the hostage-taking drama in a russian school rose ever higher on saturday , many questions remained unanswered the day after a siege put an end to the crisis .

" our economy has turned the corner .
all forecasts indicate we will reach growth of between 1.5 and 2 percent this year , " he told the assembled members of the bundestag . the finance minister revealed proposals for € 22 billion of new debt to finance expected new investments of € 22.8 billion .
eichel also stated that total government spending would reach € 258 billion in 2005 , about € 1 billion higher than in the current year .
however , his budget draft contained projected privatization proceeds of some € 15 billion next year , which the government hopes will help reign in the budget deficit to back below the eu stability and growth pact 's ceiling of three percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- . cdu calls for eichel to step down germany ’ s conservative opposition criticized eichels figures as wild guesses and accused him of disregarding a number of risks and pitfalls .
the cdu ’ s budget spokesman dietrich austerman spoke of a huge question mark behind predictions of revenues from a controversial highway toll system for trucks , which is to be introduced next year . he also pointed out that the government ’ s labor market reform would run up a bill of at least € 5 billion more than what was planned in the budget .
austerman called on the government to withdraw the budget plan and asked the finance minister to step down . " the budget 2005 epitomizes the failure of red-green budget policy , he says .
it is in violation of the constitution and the eu stability pact because it makes no attempt at consolidation .
it is entirely based on false figures and totally insufficient to boost the economy .
there are incalculable risks that should prompt the government to redo their budget and start all over again . " last week , eichel raised the forecast for this year 's budget deficit , saying declining tax income and increased spending on the unemployed would push the shortfall further beyond european union limits for a third straight year , reaching an estimated 3.7 percent of gdp in 2004 compared with a previous forecast of 3.25 percent published half a year ago . deficit reduction target gets helping hand the ultimate objective of getting the german budget deficit to below eu levels may also get a helping hand from the european commission and its proposed watering down of the hard-line pact .
brussels announced plans last week to make the pact less rigid including paying greater attention to economic developments when setting deadlines for budget cuts , taking account of whether a country 's debts are sustainable , and making greater allowances for the state of the economy . eichel welcomed the proposals drawn up by the european commission , saying the changes would help boost economic growth in europe .
" i can only welcome the proposals put forward by brussels , they 're what i 've been calling for all along , " he said . bundesbank lashes out at commission however , as eichel was addressing the bundestag on tuesday , the bundesbank was lashing out at the european commission 's proposals , arguing that the changes would weaken the stability and growth pact and lead to a worsening of monetary policy conditions in the euro area . " the bundesbank is of the opinion that the proposed changes will not strengthen but weaken the stability pact , " the german central bank said in a statement .
" that would lead to a deterioration of the conditions for monetary policy in the single currency area , " it added , indicating that if governments pursued a policy of loose purse strings in europe , the european central bank might be compelled to react by raising its key interest rates .
" healthy state finances are an important pre-condition for the ecb to guarantee price stability in the long term via relatively low interest rates , " the bundesbank said . the proposed changes " will reduce the incentive for euro zone countries to pursue solid budget policies and , at the same time , send a wrong signal to those countries that have not yet adopted the single currency " , the bank complained .
furthermore , many of the proposals would " make the rules more complicated and complex , thereby impairing its -lrb- the pact 's -rrb- ability to be implemented , " it argued . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european commission to loosen stability pact the european commission on friday unveiled a plan to introduce more flexibility in the stability and growth pact , saying it was vital to restore the credibility of its much-flouted budget discipline rules .
-lrb- september 3 , 2004 -rrb- germany to breach eu deficit rules in 2004 german finance minister hans eichel on tuesday said berlin would breach eu deficit limits for a third consecutive year in 2004 .
the announcement comes amid speculation brussels will loosen its budget rules .
-lrb- august 31 , 2004 -rrb- germany set to violate eu deficit rules in 2005 according to leading economic institutes , germany 's deficit will surpass 3 percent next year , meaning that the euro zone 's biggest economy is on the verge of breaching the stability and growth pact for the fourth year .

after progressing against the odds to the showpiece finale in japan , the germans felt aggrieved that they did not take the chance to claim a famous victory and a fourth world cup . but for those expecting a german fairytale ending on wednesday , the recent words of team captain michael ballack may already have dampened the spirits of fans hoping for an exhibition display from the home side . ballack forgoes beauty for success midfielder ballack told the german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung on sunday that germany do not need to play a " beautiful game " to succeed and should focus instead on developing a winning mentality .
" one does n't have to play beautiful football .
success is what counts . " someone may want to remind ballack that the current germany team has lacked both beauty and success of late .
germany have not beaten a major soccer power in their last nine matches and were dumped out of the recent european championships after the first round .
the last time the germans beat a top-level side was october 7 , 2000 when they secured a 1-0 victory over england .
after that , they lost 1-0 to france , 5-1 to england and 1-0 to argentina in the run-up to the 2002 world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack scores past south korean goalkeeper lee woon jae during the 2002 world cup semi-final .
then in japan / korea , germany beat paraguay , the united states and south korea before losing in the final .
since then , they have gone down 3-1 to the netherlands , 3-1 to spain , 1-0 to italy and 3-0 to france .
they then drew 1-1 against the netherlands at euro 2004 .
a victory over brazil may not be impossible but the statistics suggest a win would be unlikely , an attractive one even less so . brazil buzzing with invention in contrast , the brazilians arrive in berlin this week on the back of a splendid display of inspirational soccer against bolivia and bring with them a restored reputation as the harlem globetrotters of the international game . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronaldo real madrid striker and germany ’ s world cup final nemesis ronaldo had promised fans a gala in sao paulo .
and brazil did not fail to deliver .
ronaldo himself opened the scoring with a blistering volley before the game was even a minute old .
the game then turned into an exhibition of art-soccer when ronaldinho fired a 12th minute penalty into the lower left corner for a 2-0 lead .
and just before half-time , copa america hero adriano leaped above the bolivian backline to head in a cross from ronaldinho to make it 3-0 . " it was a good result and an excellent performance , " said ronaldo at the post-match press conference .
" we have every reason to be happy .
it was marvelous .
we played excellent soccer and we 're the leaders of the group . "
the win puts brazil ahead of argentina in the group and their world cup campaign in motion . despite the feel-good factor running through the brazilian team after sunday ’ s win , there will be a cloud hanging over the samba stars when they arrive in germany . club restrictions lead to player ban bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucio .
some of brazil 's most exciting and established players will not be on view in berlin on wednesday .
the five players who did not play in brazil 's friendly international in haiti on the august 18 were left out of the bolivia game and will also be excluded for the germany clash .
ac milan players cafu , kaka and dida , along with bayer leverkusen 's lucio -lrb- photo -rrb- and ze roberto have been punished by the brazilian football federation -lrb- cbf -rrb- for not appearing in brazil 's 6-0 victory at port-au-prince .
the stars were absent after not being released by their clubs for the haiti game .
ronaldo has been quoted as supporting the decision , saying that the cbf wanted to preserve the honor of those who wear brazil 's green and yellow colors .
however , ronaldo 's team mate in the spanish capital , fellow galactico roberto carlos , was not of the same opinion , saying : " the federations and the clubs have to work together . "
the brazil captain added the five excluded players would have loved to be playing for brazil .
there is a feeling that the situation may stoke the fires of a simmering club-versus-country row with the affected players unhappy at their own clubs insistence that they remain with the domestic squad when brazil has issued call-ups . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de club versus country row mars brazil 's visit germany 's next game in its world cup preparations will be a friendly against brazil on wednesday .

sometimes actors play such powerful roles or infamous characters they get typecast for the rest of their careers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 07.09.2004 how to say ' fast food ' in polish großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they may not have polska kielbasa , but milk bars offer good eating though they 've become less prosperous since the fall of the iron curtain , many in poland would rather have a cheap healthy meal at a local milk bar than a big mac . today when polish got out to eat they can be overwhelmed by a blitz of possibilities ranging from michelin-starred restaurants to chinese take-aways to western fast food chains .
but this culinary diversity is something that only emerged after the iron curtain fell in 1989 .
before that , when poles did n't feel like slaving behind the stove , they did n't hop in the car and head for the nearest golden arches - instead they hopped on over to their local government-subsidized milk bars -lrb- bar mleczny -rrb- for a quick repast and a night on the town .
mcstate subsidized subsidized by the government , the milk bars served as an important social outlet under poland 's communist government .
the socialist idea behind the bars was to provide each worker and citizen with the possibility of an affordable warm meal .
people from all walks of life frequented the milk bars - and many still do .
and though the name may evoke images of bovine creations , the milk bars did n't just sell milk or ice cream .
you could also get a balanced , square meal .
but the meals did tend to rely heavily on dairy products for their inspiration .
during the peak of communism , self-service restaurants like milk bars could be found throughout the eastern bloc .
in the former east germany , for example , they could be found in most cities .
but today they have vanished from most countries except poland .
competition for the burger industry with the onslaught of western fast food and diminishing government subsidies , poland 's tradition of milk bars has struggled in recent years , with many going out of business .
but in the country 's metropolises , like warsaw or gdansk , milk bars are still trendy hangouts .
and though they now have to compete with fast food and kebab stands , the polish government wants to keep them in business and backs them to the tune of several million euros in subsidies each year .
with their low prices , the milk bars are attracting a growing number of students and pensioners .
with meals costing as little as € 1 to € 4 , the prices are attractive .
still , the hunt for a bargain is n't the only thing that draws people to the milk bars .
patrick szymanski , a 23-year-old student , eats in a milk bar every day and he loves warsaw 's milk bars , because he does n't have to do any cooking or clean-up .
" in former times there were as many milk bars as there are coffee shops now .
but now there are almost only kebab shops and asian takeaways , " recalled a guy named janusz , a 66-year-old warsaw native who was eating lunch with his friend bogdan at bar studencki , a traditional milk bar at the university of warsaw .
janusz said he 'd rather dig into a milk bar 's traditional fare of soup and potato-filled piroshkis than go to a fast food chain .
" it tastes almost as good as my wife 's cooking , " asserts the 59-year-old bodgan .
" i like the polish kitchen .
unlike fast food , it 's actually healthy , " said a friend of bodgan 's .
a cult following for many polish youngsters , who have long forgotten the days of long queing lines and food rations under communism , milk bars have gained cult status .
for some old enough to remember communism , it 's one of the friendlier reminders of poland 's socialist past .
but others , like janusz and bogdan have a simpler reason for hanging out at the milk bars .

just do n't expect any fancy stuff - not from the germans anyway . world champions brazil take on germany in a friendly game in berlin on wednesday .
the prestigious match carries little importance to the home side other than it represents a chance to exact revenge on the samba stars who ruined their improbable world cup dream two years ago by beating them 2-0 in yokohama in the 2002 final . germany as hosts for the 2006 world cup are automatically installed in the tournament while recent rule changes dictate that reigning world champions brazil have to qualify for the right to defend their crown .
brazil will arrive in germany after beating bolivia 3-1 in a world cup qualifier in sao paulo and will view the match as a chance to keep the team ’ s momentum ahead of more demanding and important clashes in the south american qualifying group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn prays for the yokohama pitch to open up in the world cup final 2002 .
for germany , however , it will be the first opportunity since the world cup final to regain their pride against ronaldo and co .
after progressing against the odds to the showpiece finale in japan , the germans felt aggrieved that they did not take the chance to claim a famous victory and a fourth world cup . but for those expecting a german fairytale ending on wednesday , the recent words of team captain michael ballack may already have dampened the spirits of fans hoping for an exhibition display from the home side . ballack forgoes beauty for success midfielder ballack told the german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung on sunday that germany do not need to play a " beautiful game " to succeed and should focus instead on developing a winning mentality .
" one does n't have to play beautiful football .
success is what counts . " someone may want to remind ballack that the current germany team has lacked both beauty and success of late .
germany have not beaten a major soccer power in their last nine matches and were dumped out of the recent european championships after the first round .
the last time the germans beat a top-level side was october 7 , 2000 when they secured a 1-0 victory over england .
after that , they lost 1-0 to france , 5-1 to england and 1-0 to argentina in the run-up to the 2002 world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack scores past south korean goalkeeper lee woon jae during the 2002 world cup semi-final .
then in japan / korea , germany beat paraguay , the united states and south korea before losing in the final .
since then , they have gone down 3-1 to the netherlands , 3-1 to spain , 1-0 to italy and 3-0 to france .
they then drew 1-1 against the netherlands at euro 2004 .
a victory over brazil may not be impossible but the statistics suggest a win would be unlikely , an attractive one even less so . brazil buzzing with invention in contrast , the brazilians arrive in berlin this week on the back of a splendid display of inspirational soccer against bolivia and bring with them a restored reputation as the harlem globetrotters of the international game . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronaldo real madrid striker and germany ’ s world cup final nemesis ronaldo had promised fans a gala in sao paulo .
and brazil did not fail to deliver .
ronaldo himself opened the scoring with a blistering volley before the game was even a minute old .
the game then turned into an exhibition of art-soccer when ronaldinho fired a 12th minute penalty into the lower left corner for a 2-0 lead .
and just before half-time , copa america hero adriano leaped above the bolivian backline to head in a cross from ronaldinho to make it 3-0 . " it was a good result and an excellent performance , " said ronaldo at the post-match press conference .
" we have every reason to be happy .
it was marvelous .
we played excellent soccer and we 're the leaders of the group . "
the win puts brazil ahead of argentina in the group and their world cup campaign in motion . despite the feel-good factor running through the brazilian team after sunday ’ s win , there will be a cloud hanging over the samba stars when they arrive in germany . club restrictions lead to player ban bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucio .
some of brazil 's most exciting and established players will not be on view in berlin on wednesday .
the five players who did not play in brazil 's friendly international in haiti on the august 18 were left out of the bolivia game and will also be excluded for the germany clash .
ac milan players cafu , kaka and dida , along with bayer leverkusen 's lucio -lrb- photo -rrb- and ze roberto have been punished by the brazilian football federation -lrb- cbf -rrb- for not appearing in brazil 's 6-0 victory at port-au-prince .
the stars were absent after not being released by their clubs for the haiti game .
ronaldo has been quoted as supporting the decision , saying that the cbf wanted to preserve the honor of those who wear brazil 's green and yellow colors .
however , ronaldo 's team mate in the spanish capital , fellow galactico roberto carlos , was not of the same opinion , saying : " the federations and the clubs have to work together . "
the brazil captain added the five excluded players would have loved to be playing for brazil .
there is a feeling that the situation may stoke the fires of a simmering club-versus-country row with the affected players unhappy at their own clubs insistence that they remain with the domestic squad when brazil has issued call-ups . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de club versus country row mars brazil 's visit germany 's next game in its world cup preparations will be a friendly against brazil on wednesday .

sometimes actors play such powerful roles or infamous characters they get typecast for the rest of their careers .
bruno ganz is worried about falling into that trap after playing the ultimate bad guy - adolf hitler . " the downfall - hitler and the end of the third reich " tells the story of the dictator as a tragic human being , not just a monster , and ganz 's exceptional acting ability has him concerned how he 'll be seen after the film , which portrays the last 12 day of hitler 's life in a berlin bunker , opens on sept .
16 .
" i do n't know what 's going to happen when the film reaches the public , " the 63-year-old swiss actor told the bild am sonntag newspaper .
" there could be some mistaken or disturbed people who confuse me with hitler . "
if critics are to be believed , he may have something to worry about .
while many wonder if the time is right , or could ever be right , for a film showing hitler as a human being , commentators agree ganz 's portrayal is right on target .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ganz as hitler " ganz is hitler , " said historian joachim fest , whose biography of the nazi leader the film drew on .
ganz needed a long time before deciding to take the role , and his son was nearly successful in dissuading him when he said it would n't be healthy " to enter a sick person 's mind for so long . "
but upon seeing himself made up as hitler , complete with his famous moustache , ganz was convinced him to take his first leading role in a german movie in 16 years .
but hairpieces and uniforms were n't enough to allow ganz to convincingly portray the austrian-born " führer , " he also had to get into the mass murderer 's head .
" if i only hate hitler , then i ca n't open things up for myself .
that only happens with affection , " ganz said .
" i was forced to develop an understanding for the man .
i 'm not ashamed of the fact that i was able to feel sympathy for him during fleeting seconds . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from " the downfall " moments of understanding are okay , according to the producer of " the downfall , " bernd eichinger .
but if viewers walk away after the movie 's more that two hours feeling general sympathy for hitler , then " the film has failed in its intention . "
after the € 13.5 million -lrb- $ 16.3 million -rrb- film ends it run in theaters , ganz wants to put the typecast theory to the test .
he said for his next project he 'd like a part in a comedy . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de film portrays hitler in human light adolf hitler spent his last days in an underground bunker in berlin amid a combination of fear and unreality .

sometimes actors play such powerful roles or infamous characters they get typecast for the rest of their careers .
bruno ganz is worried about falling into that trap after playing the ultimate bad guy - adolf hitler . " the downfall - hitler and the end of the third reich " tells the story of the dictator as a tragic human being , not just a monster , and ganz 's exceptional acting ability has him concerned how he 'll be seen after the film , which portrays the last 12 day of hitler 's life in a berlin bunker , opens on sept .
16 .
" i do n't know what 's going to happen when the film reaches the public , " the 63-year-old swiss actor told the bild am sonntag newspaper .
" there could be some mistaken or disturbed people who confuse me with hitler . "
if critics are to be believed , he may have something to worry about .
while many wonder if the time is right , or could ever be right , for a film showing hitler as a human being , commentators agree ganz 's portrayal is right on target .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ganz as hitler " ganz is hitler , " said historian joachim fest , whose biography of the nazi leader the film drew on .
ganz needed a long time before deciding to take the role , and his son was nearly successful in dissuading him when he said it would n't be healthy " to enter a sick person 's mind for so long . "
but upon seeing himself made up as hitler , complete with his famous moustache , ganz was convinced him to take his first leading role in a german movie in 16 years .
but hairpieces and uniforms were n't enough to allow ganz to convincingly portray the austrian-born " führer , " he also had to get into the mass murderer 's head .
" if i only hate hitler , then i ca n't open things up for myself .
that only happens with affection , " ganz said .
" i was forced to develop an understanding for the man .
i 'm not ashamed of the fact that i was able to feel sympathy for him during fleeting seconds . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from " the downfall " moments of understanding are okay , according to the producer of " the downfall , " bernd eichinger .
but if viewers walk away after the movie 's more that two hours feeling general sympathy for hitler , then " the film has failed in its intention . "
after the € 13.5 million -lrb- $ 16.3 million -rrb- film ends it run in theaters , ganz wants to put the typecast theory to the test .
he said for his next project he 'd like a part in a comedy . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de film portrays hitler in human light adolf hitler spent his last days in an underground bunker in berlin amid a combination of fear and unreality .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 07.09.2004 opinion : russia needs international solidarity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : images from the school siege have shocked russia and the world official versions of the hostage drama in north ossetia and the true events on the ground are widely divergent .
yet despite the kremlin 's restrictive policies , russia needs solidarity from the international community . on monday , hundreds of people said goodbye to the victims of the three-day school siege in the town of beslan , while in local hospitals many others continued to fight for their lives .
family members of the victims and survivors of the bloodbath in north ossetia are in despair - all of russia finds itself in mourning - and the world looks on in horror as the full magnitude of the tragedy is slowly revealed .
the hostage numbers are continually being revised upwards and the origin of the hostage takers is still uncertain .
the versions of the events at the violent end the siege are conflicting . there were mistakes on the part of the russian special bildunterschrift : forces , as president putin admitted in a speech .
eyewitnesses report serious failures during the storming of the school .
again , russian journalists are being prevented from providing a comprehensive account of what happened in beslan to the public .
a political debate in the country 's media over the background and consequences of the three-day siege is not taking place . only later did vladimir putin go to the site of these dramatic events , visiting the injured in the hospital and for good reason avoiding any meeting with residents of beslan .
instead , he turned to the russian people in a speech .
but on doing this , president putin , who so loves to present himself as the " man of action , " appeared to be at a loss and even downright petrified . he continues to avoid addressing the real causes of this tragedy - the war in chechnya that has been raging for years , and which is at least partly to blame for the growth of terror tactics and the deaths of many innocent people .
as much as putin would like russians to believe , these are not external conflicts that have been imported into the region .
it is a very russian problem - the independence fight for a small republic in the caucasus - that has fuelled this conflict . the radicals , and especially the determined terrorists in beslan , have only been able to gain ground after the long years of war and bloody conflict in the region have created an army of desperate people .
these are people who have lost everything , whose family members have been tortured and murdered and whose young people know nothing but violence .
these are people who have had to experience unbelievable barbarity from both russians and chechens and now want only one thing : revenge .
at the same time , there is no greater desire among the civilian population than to simply live in peace . beslan is a horrible symbol for a conflict that has long since expanded beyond the borders of chechnya and now threatens to set the entire caucasus region ablaze .
putin must now try to break this vicious circle , with international assistance if necessary .
and the west should be ready to provide it because in the war against terror , russian needs solidarity . cornelia rabitz -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de death toll above 320 in russian school attack while estimates of the number of people killed in the hostage-taking drama in a russian school rose ever higher on saturday , many questions remained unanswered the day after a siege put an end to the crisis .

" our economy has turned the corner .
all forecasts indicate we will reach growth of between 1.5 and 2 percent this year , " he told the assembled members of the bundestag . the finance minister revealed proposals for € 22 billion of new debt to finance expected new investments of € 22.8 billion .
eichel also stated that total government spending would reach € 258 billion in 2005 , about € 1 billion higher than in the current year .
however , his budget draft contained projected privatization proceeds of some € 15 billion next year , which the government hopes will help reign in the budget deficit to back below the eu stability and growth pact 's ceiling of three percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- . cdu calls for eichel to step down germany ’ s conservative opposition criticized eichels figures as wild guesses and accused him of disregarding a number of risks and pitfalls .
the cdu ’ s budget spokesman dietrich austerman spoke of a huge question mark behind predictions of revenues from a controversial highway toll system for trucks , which is to be introduced next year . he also pointed out that the government ’ s labor market reform would run up a bill of at least € 5 billion more than what was planned in the budget .
austerman called on the government to withdraw the budget plan and asked the finance minister to step down . " the budget 2005 epitomizes the failure of red-green budget policy , he says .
it is in violation of the constitution and the eu stability pact because it makes no attempt at consolidation .
it is entirely based on false figures and totally insufficient to boost the economy .
there are incalculable risks that should prompt the government to redo their budget and start all over again . " last week , eichel raised the forecast for this year 's budget deficit , saying declining tax income and increased spending on the unemployed would push the shortfall further beyond european union limits for a third straight year , reaching an estimated 3.7 percent of gdp in 2004 compared with a previous forecast of 3.25 percent published half a year ago . deficit reduction target gets helping hand the ultimate objective of getting the german budget deficit to below eu levels may also get a helping hand from the european commission and its proposed watering down of the hard-line pact .
brussels announced plans last week to make the pact less rigid including paying greater attention to economic developments when setting deadlines for budget cuts , taking account of whether a country 's debts are sustainable , and making greater allowances for the state of the economy . eichel welcomed the proposals drawn up by the european commission , saying the changes would help boost economic growth in europe .
" i can only welcome the proposals put forward by brussels , they 're what i 've been calling for all along , " he said . bundesbank lashes out at commission however , as eichel was addressing the bundestag on tuesday , the bundesbank was lashing out at the european commission 's proposals , arguing that the changes would weaken the stability and growth pact and lead to a worsening of monetary policy conditions in the euro area . " the bundesbank is of the opinion that the proposed changes will not strengthen but weaken the stability pact , " the german central bank said in a statement .
" that would lead to a deterioration of the conditions for monetary policy in the single currency area , " it added , indicating that if governments pursued a policy of loose purse strings in europe , the european central bank might be compelled to react by raising its key interest rates .
" healthy state finances are an important pre-condition for the ecb to guarantee price stability in the long term via relatively low interest rates , " the bundesbank said . the proposed changes " will reduce the incentive for euro zone countries to pursue solid budget policies and , at the same time , send a wrong signal to those countries that have not yet adopted the single currency " , the bank complained .

" our economy has turned the corner .
all forecasts indicate we will reach growth of between 1.5 and 2 percent this year , " he told the assembled members of the bundestag . the finance minister revealed proposals for € 22 billion of new debt to finance expected new investments of € 22.8 billion .
eichel also stated that total government spending would reach € 258 billion in 2005 , about € 1 billion higher than in the current year .
however , his budget draft contained projected privatization proceeds of some € 15 billion next year , which the government hopes will help reign in the budget deficit to back below the eu stability and growth pact 's ceiling of three percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- . cdu calls for eichel to step down germany ’ s conservative opposition criticized eichels figures as wild guesses and accused him of disregarding a number of risks and pitfalls .
the cdu ’ s budget spokesman dietrich austerman spoke of a huge question mark behind predictions of revenues from a controversial highway toll system for trucks , which is to be introduced next year . he also pointed out that the government ’ s labor market reform would run up a bill of at least € 5 billion more than what was planned in the budget .
austerman called on the government to withdraw the budget plan and asked the finance minister to step down . " the budget 2005 epitomizes the failure of red-green budget policy , he says .
it is in violation of the constitution and the eu stability pact because it makes no attempt at consolidation .
it is entirely based on false figures and totally insufficient to boost the economy .
there are incalculable risks that should prompt the government to redo their budget and start all over again . " last week , eichel raised the forecast for this year 's budget deficit , saying declining tax income and increased spending on the unemployed would push the shortfall further beyond european union limits for a third straight year , reaching an estimated 3.7 percent of gdp in 2004 compared with a previous forecast of 3.25 percent published half a year ago . deficit reduction target gets helping hand the ultimate objective of getting the german budget deficit to below eu levels may also get a helping hand from the european commission and its proposed watering down of the hard-line pact .
brussels announced plans last week to make the pact less rigid including paying greater attention to economic developments when setting deadlines for budget cuts , taking account of whether a country 's debts are sustainable , and making greater allowances for the state of the economy . eichel welcomed the proposals drawn up by the european commission , saying the changes would help boost economic growth in europe .
" i can only welcome the proposals put forward by brussels , they 're what i 've been calling for all along , " he said . bundesbank lashes out at commission however , as eichel was addressing the bundestag on tuesday , the bundesbank was lashing out at the european commission 's proposals , arguing that the changes would weaken the stability and growth pact and lead to a worsening of monetary policy conditions in the euro area . " the bundesbank is of the opinion that the proposed changes will not strengthen but weaken the stability pact , " the german central bank said in a statement .
" that would lead to a deterioration of the conditions for monetary policy in the single currency area , " it added , indicating that if governments pursued a policy of loose purse strings in europe , the european central bank might be compelled to react by raising its key interest rates .
" healthy state finances are an important pre-condition for the ecb to guarantee price stability in the long term via relatively low interest rates , " the bundesbank said . the proposed changes " will reduce the incentive for euro zone countries to pursue solid budget policies and , at the same time , send a wrong signal to those countries that have not yet adopted the single currency " , the bank complained .
furthermore , many of the proposals would " make the rules more complicated and complex , thereby impairing its -lrb- the pact 's -rrb- ability to be implemented , " it argued . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european commission to loosen stability pact the european commission on friday unveiled a plan to introduce more flexibility in the stability and growth pact , saying it was vital to restore the credibility of its much-flouted budget discipline rules .
-lrb- september 3 , 2004 -rrb- germany to breach eu deficit rules in 2004 german finance minister hans eichel on tuesday said berlin would breach eu deficit limits for a third consecutive year in 2004 .
the announcement comes amid speculation brussels will loosen its budget rules .

eu officials are therefore touring the country to foster a more positive profile . at a series of seminars with the media in the southern cities of bangalore and hyderabad in the past week , held at glitzy locations linked to the country 's booming film industry , eu representatives have pitched for a greater understanding of what the eu does internally , on the global stage and in india itself .
they have had to start with basics by explaining the role taken by the executive european commission in initiating and policing eu legislation and the commission 's often troublesome interplay with the member states .
the distinction is important as in some areas of vital interest to india , notably trade ; the commission is the eu 's voice in international negotiations .
yet in others , such as foreign policy , the commission is powerless with the member states making the running . journalists drawn from southern india confessed to finding the details sometimes baffling and said the eu still has much work to do to establish its relevance to india beyond the trade front .
ordinary indians should be the target audience " the eu needs to do much more to raise public awareness among ordinary indians , by publicizing their important aid work and holding cultural events , " k.n. tilak kumar , chairman of the regional deccan herald newspaper group , told afp .
delegates at the seminars said eu-organized film events showcasing the best of contemporary european cinema had been big hits with indian audiences more used to a solid diet of bollywood fantasy interspersed with hollywood blockbusters .

" the eu has an obligation still to explain that it is more than a fortress , the horrifying force behind the wto wanting to take over india .

eu officials are therefore touring the country to foster a more positive profile . at a series of seminars with the media in the southern cities of bangalore and hyderabad in the past week , held at glitzy locations linked to the country 's booming film industry , eu representatives have pitched for a greater understanding of what the eu does internally , on the global stage and in india itself .
they have had to start with basics by explaining the role taken by the executive european commission in initiating and policing eu legislation and the commission 's often troublesome interplay with the member states .
the distinction is important as in some areas of vital interest to india , notably trade ; the commission is the eu 's voice in international negotiations .
yet in others , such as foreign policy , the commission is powerless with the member states making the running . journalists drawn from southern india confessed to finding the details sometimes baffling and said the eu still has much work to do to establish its relevance to india beyond the trade front .
ordinary indians should be the target audience " the eu needs to do much more to raise public awareness among ordinary indians , by publicizing their important aid work and holding cultural events , " k.n. tilak kumar , chairman of the regional deccan herald newspaper group , told afp .
delegates at the seminars said eu-organized film events showcasing the best of contemporary european cinema had been big hits with indian audiences more used to a solid diet of bollywood fantasy interspersed with hollywood blockbusters .
" if they want the eu to be known here , they have to make news in india , " kumar added .
in-fighting creates a bad image the eu has been making headlines in the indian press , but for all the wrong reasons .
well-publicized rows among member states , such as over iraq , have undermined attempts by the bloc to portray itself as a big player on the world stage .
" you have to have a policy on iraq , the most important foreign policy issue of the day .
having a policy on some things and a non-policy on others is no way of carrying on , " said kumar .
caught at the sharp end are the under-resourced diplomats tasked with flying the eu 's blue starred flag abroad .
drawn from the commission 's external relations department , their work is largely confined to trade negotiations and overseeing aid projects .
for the staff of the new delhi embassy , that work is hugely important given india 's pivotal role as a leader of developing nations at the world trade organization and its status as a sizeable recipient of eu development funds .
they are also keen to promote the eu 's experience in conflict settlement , no small concern here given india 's intractable dispute with pakistan over kashmir . eu funding has made visible differences the € 100 million -lrb- $ 120 million -rrb- of eu grant aid spent annually in india is spread far and wide .
in the slums of mysore near bangalore , an eu-funded project has brought schooling , immunization and basic sanitation to communities where literacy was just 10 percent five years ago and easily preventable diseases were rife , according to the non-governmental organization overseeing the work .
but as eu officials freely admit , such work does not get much publicity in the local press , hence the seminars .
" the eu has an obligation still to explain that it is more than a fortress , the horrifying force behind the wto wanting to take over india .
we need to counter that with an alternative viewpoint , " said robert aarsse , first secretary at the dutch embassy in delhi , whose country holds the bloc 's rotating presidency .
" one thing we stress is that we are multilateral , whereas the us is unilateral .
we want to show india that we are a partner to work with , " he added .
proposed strategic partnership to be discussed at the highest levels of government , the two sides are already well engaged .
ministerial meetings are held regularly , and next month will see the fifth annual eu-india summit , in the dutch capital the hague .
in preparation for the summit , the european commission in june unveiled a new set of proposals designed to entrench a fledgling " strategic partnership " with india .
but for rajendra jain , professor of european studies at delhi 's jawaharlal nehru university , india still prefers to deal one-to-one with the big eu nations such as britain and france , and is " obsessed " by its relations with the united states .
" the indian elite thinks the eu is just not credible as a foreign policy actor , so the eu is not taken seriously , " jain said .
" and in india , the leading eu nations like britain often have their own agendas to promote , so they 're disinclined to give the eu a profile of its own . "
still , if nothing else the eu has covered itself in a sprinkling of glamour by organizing the seminars at a bangalore resort hotel owned by bollywood star sanjay khan and at southern india 's largest film studios outside hyderabad .

yet despite the kremlin 's restrictive policies , russia needs solidarity from the international community . on monday , hundreds of people said goodbye to the victims of the three-day school siege in the town of beslan , while in local hospitals many others continued to fight for their lives .
family members of the victims and survivors of the bloodbath in north ossetia are in despair - all of russia finds itself in mourning - and the world looks on in horror as the full magnitude of the tragedy is slowly revealed .
the hostage numbers are continually being revised upwards and the origin of the hostage takers is still uncertain .
the versions of the events at the violent end the siege are conflicting . there were mistakes on the part of the russian special bildunterschrift : forces , as president putin admitted in a speech .
eyewitnesses report serious failures during the storming of the school .
again , russian journalists are being prevented from providing a comprehensive account of what happened in beslan to the public .
a political debate in the country 's media over the background and consequences of the three-day siege is not taking place . only later did vladimir putin go to the site of these dramatic events , visiting the injured in the hospital and for good reason avoiding any meeting with residents of beslan .
instead , he turned to the russian people in a speech .
but on doing this , president putin , who so loves to present himself as the " man of action , " appeared to be at a loss and even downright petrified . he continues to avoid addressing the real causes of this tragedy - the war in chechnya that has been raging for years , and which is at least partly to blame for the growth of terror tactics and the deaths of many innocent people .
as much as putin would like russians to believe , these are not external conflicts that have been imported into the region .
it is a very russian problem - the independence fight for a small republic in the caucasus - that has fuelled this conflict . the radicals , and especially the determined terrorists in beslan , have only been able to gain ground after the long years of war and bloody conflict in the region have created an army of desperate people .
these are people who have lost everything , whose family members have been tortured and murdered and whose young people know nothing but violence .
these are people who have had to experience unbelievable barbarity from both russians and chechens and now want only one thing : revenge .
at the same time , there is no greater desire among the civilian population than to simply live in peace . beslan is a horrible symbol for a conflict that has long since expanded beyond the borders of chechnya and now threatens to set the entire caucasus region ablaze .
putin must now try to break this vicious circle , with international assistance if necessary .

mcstate subsidized subsidized by the government , the milk bars served as an important social outlet under poland 's communist government .
the socialist idea behind the bars was to provide each worker and citizen with the possibility of an affordable warm meal .
people from all walks of life frequented the milk bars - and many still do .

just do n't expect any fancy stuff - not from the germans anyway . world champions brazil take on germany in a friendly game in berlin on wednesday .
the prestigious match carries little importance to the home side other than it represents a chance to exact revenge on the samba stars who ruined their improbable world cup dream two years ago by beating them 2-0 in yokohama in the 2002 final . germany as hosts for the 2006 world cup are automatically installed in the tournament while recent rule changes dictate that reigning world champions brazil have to qualify for the right to defend their crown .
brazil will arrive in germany after beating bolivia 3-1 in a world cup qualifier in sao paulo and will view the match as a chance to keep the team ’ s momentum ahead of more demanding and important clashes in the south american qualifying group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn prays for the yokohama pitch to open up in the world cup final 2002 .
for germany , however , it will be the first opportunity since the world cup final to regain their pride against ronaldo and co .
after progressing against the odds to the showpiece finale in japan , the germans felt aggrieved that they did not take the chance to claim a famous victory and a fourth world cup . but for those expecting a german fairytale ending on wednesday , the recent words of team captain michael ballack may already have dampened the spirits of fans hoping for an exhibition display from the home side . ballack forgoes beauty for success midfielder ballack told the german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung on sunday that germany do not need to play a " beautiful game " to succeed and should focus instead on developing a winning mentality .
" one does n't have to play beautiful football .
success is what counts . " someone may want to remind ballack that the current germany team has lacked both beauty and success of late .
germany have not beaten a major soccer power in their last nine matches and were dumped out of the recent european championships after the first round .
the last time the germans beat a top-level side was october 7 , 2000 when they secured a 1-0 victory over england .
after that , they lost 1-0 to france , 5-1 to england and 1-0 to argentina in the run-up to the 2002 world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack scores past south korean goalkeeper lee woon jae during the 2002 world cup semi-final .
then in japan / korea , germany beat paraguay , the united states and south korea before losing in the final .
since then , they have gone down 3-1 to the netherlands , 3-1 to spain , 1-0 to italy and 3-0 to france .
they then drew 1-1 against the netherlands at euro 2004 .
a victory over brazil may not be impossible but the statistics suggest a win would be unlikely , an attractive one even less so . brazil buzzing with invention in contrast , the brazilians arrive in berlin this week on the back of a splendid display of inspirational soccer against bolivia and bring with them a restored reputation as the harlem globetrotters of the international game . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronaldo real madrid striker and germany ’ s world cup final nemesis ronaldo had promised fans a gala in sao paulo .
and brazil did not fail to deliver .
ronaldo himself opened the scoring with a blistering volley before the game was even a minute old .
the game then turned into an exhibition of art-soccer when ronaldinho fired a 12th minute penalty into the lower left corner for a 2-0 lead .
and just before half-time , copa america hero adriano leaped above the bolivian backline to head in a cross from ronaldinho to make it 3-0 . " it was a good result and an excellent performance , " said ronaldo at the post-match press conference .
" we have every reason to be happy .
it was marvelous .
we played excellent soccer and we 're the leaders of the group . "
the win puts brazil ahead of argentina in the group and their world cup campaign in motion . despite the feel-good factor running through the brazilian team after sunday ’ s win , there will be a cloud hanging over the samba stars when they arrive in germany . club restrictions lead to player ban bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucio .
some of brazil 's most exciting and established players will not be on view in berlin on wednesday .
the five players who did not play in brazil 's friendly international in haiti on the august 18 were left out of the bolivia game and will also be excluded for the germany clash .
ac milan players cafu , kaka and dida , along with bayer leverkusen 's lucio -lrb- photo -rrb- and ze roberto have been punished by the brazilian football federation -lrb- cbf -rrb- for not appearing in brazil 's 6-0 victory at port-au-prince .
the stars were absent after not being released by their clubs for the haiti game .
ronaldo has been quoted as supporting the decision , saying that the cbf wanted to preserve the honor of those who wear brazil 's green and yellow colors .
however , ronaldo 's team mate in the spanish capital , fellow galactico roberto carlos , was not of the same opinion , saying : " the federations and the clubs have to work together . "
the brazil captain added the five excluded players would have loved to be playing for brazil .
there is a feeling that the situation may stoke the fires of a simmering club-versus-country row with the affected players unhappy at their own clubs insistence that they remain with the domestic squad when brazil has issued call-ups . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de club versus country row mars brazil 's visit germany 's next game in its world cup preparations will be a friendly against brazil on wednesday .

a victory over brazil may not be impossible but the statistics suggest a win would be unlikely , an attractive one even less so . brazil buzzing with invention in contrast , the brazilians arrive in berlin this week on the back of a splendid display of inspirational soccer against bolivia and bring with them a restored reputation as the harlem globetrotters of the international game . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronaldo real madrid striker and germany ’ s world cup final nemesis ronaldo had promised fans a gala in sao paulo .
and brazil did not fail to deliver .
ronaldo himself opened the scoring with a blistering volley before the game was even a minute old .
the game then turned into an exhibition of art-soccer when ronaldinho fired a 12th minute penalty into the lower left corner for a 2-0 lead .
and just before half-time , copa america hero adriano leaped above the bolivian backline to head in a cross from ronaldinho to make it 3-0 . " it was a good result and an excellent performance , " said ronaldo at the post-match press conference .
" we have every reason to be happy .
it was marvelous .
we played excellent soccer and we 're the leaders of the group . "
the win puts brazil ahead of argentina in the group and their world cup campaign in motion . despite the feel-good factor running through the brazilian team after sunday ’ s win , there will be a cloud hanging over the samba stars when they arrive in germany . club restrictions lead to player ban bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucio .
some of brazil 's most exciting and established players will not be on view in berlin on wednesday .
the five players who did not play in brazil 's friendly international in haiti on the august 18 were left out of the bolivia game and will also be excluded for the germany clash .
ac milan players cafu , kaka and dida , along with bayer leverkusen 's lucio -lrb- photo -rrb- and ze roberto have been punished by the brazilian football federation -lrb- cbf -rrb- for not appearing in brazil 's 6-0 victory at port-au-prince .
the stars were absent after not being released by their clubs for the haiti game .
ronaldo has been quoted as supporting the decision , saying that the cbf wanted to preserve the honor of those who wear brazil 's green and yellow colors .
however , ronaldo 's team mate in the spanish capital , fellow galactico roberto carlos , was not of the same opinion , saying : " the federations and the clubs have to work together . "
the brazil captain added the five excluded players would have loved to be playing for brazil .
there is a feeling that the situation may stoke the fires of a simmering club-versus-country row with the affected players unhappy at their own clubs insistence that they remain with the domestic squad when brazil has issued call-ups . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de club versus country row mars brazil 's visit germany 's next game in its world cup preparations will be a friendly against brazil on wednesday .

sometimes actors play such powerful roles or infamous characters they get typecast for the rest of their careers .
bruno ganz is worried about falling into that trap after playing the ultimate bad guy - adolf hitler . " the downfall - hitler and the end of the third reich " tells the story of the dictator as a tragic human being , not just a monster , and ganz 's exceptional acting ability has him concerned how he 'll be seen after the film , which portrays the last 12 day of hitler 's life in a berlin bunker , opens on sept .
16 .
" i do n't know what 's going to happen when the film reaches the public , " the 63-year-old swiss actor told the bild am sonntag newspaper .
" there could be some mistaken or disturbed people who confuse me with hitler . "
if critics are to be believed , he may have something to worry about .
while many wonder if the time is right , or could ever be right , for a film showing hitler as a human being , commentators agree ganz 's portrayal is right on target .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ganz as hitler " ganz is hitler , " said historian joachim fest , whose biography of the nazi leader the film drew on .
ganz needed a long time before deciding to take the role , and his son was nearly successful in dissuading him when he said it would n't be healthy " to enter a sick person 's mind for so long . "
but upon seeing himself made up as hitler , complete with his famous moustache , ganz was convinced him to take his first leading role in a german movie in 16 years .
but hairpieces and uniforms were n't enough to allow ganz to convincingly portray the austrian-born " führer , " he also had to get into the mass murderer 's head .
" if i only hate hitler , then i ca n't open things up for myself .
that only happens with affection , " ganz said .
" i was forced to develop an understanding for the man .
i 'm not ashamed of the fact that i was able to feel sympathy for him during fleeting seconds . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from " the downfall " moments of understanding are okay , according to the producer of " the downfall , " bernd eichinger .
but if viewers walk away after the movie 's more that two hours feeling general sympathy for hitler , then " the film has failed in its intention . "
after the € 13.5 million -lrb- $ 16.3 million -rrb- film ends it run in theaters , ganz wants to put the typecast theory to the test .
he said for his next project he 'd like a part in a comedy . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de film portrays hitler in human light adolf hitler spent his last days in an underground bunker in berlin amid a combination of fear and unreality .

but this culinary diversity is something that only emerged after the iron curtain fell in 1989 .
before that , when poles did n't feel like slaving behind the stove , they did n't hop in the car and head for the nearest golden arches - instead they hopped on over to their local government-subsidized milk bars -lrb- bar mleczny -rrb- for a quick repast and a night on the town .
mcstate subsidized subsidized by the government , the milk bars served as an important social outlet under poland 's communist government .
the socialist idea behind the bars was to provide each worker and citizen with the possibility of an affordable warm meal .
people from all walks of life frequented the milk bars - and many still do .
and though the name may evoke images of bovine creations , the milk bars did n't just sell milk or ice cream .
you could also get a balanced , square meal .
but the meals did tend to rely heavily on dairy products for their inspiration .
during the peak of communism , self-service restaurants like milk bars could be found throughout the eastern bloc .
in the former east germany , for example , they could be found in most cities .
but today they have vanished from most countries except poland .
competition for the burger industry with the onslaught of western fast food and diminishing government subsidies , poland 's tradition of milk bars has struggled in recent years , with many going out of business .
but in the country 's metropolises , like warsaw or gdansk , milk bars are still trendy hangouts .
and though they now have to compete with fast food and kebab stands , the polish government wants to keep them in business and backs them to the tune of several million euros in subsidies each year .
with their low prices , the milk bars are attracting a growing number of students and pensioners .
with meals costing as little as € 1 to € 4 , the prices are attractive .
still , the hunt for a bargain is n't the only thing that draws people to the milk bars .
patrick szymanski , a 23-year-old student , eats in a milk bar every day and he loves warsaw 's milk bars , because he does n't have to do any cooking or clean-up .
" in former times there were as many milk bars as there are coffee shops now .
but now there are almost only kebab shops and asian takeaways , " recalled a guy named janusz , a 66-year-old warsaw native who was eating lunch with his friend bogdan at bar studencki , a traditional milk bar at the university of warsaw .
janusz said he 'd rather dig into a milk bar 's traditional fare of soup and potato-filled piroshkis than go to a fast food chain .
" it tastes almost as good as my wife 's cooking , " asserts the 59-year-old bodgan .
" i like the polish kitchen .
unlike fast food , it 's actually healthy , " said a friend of bodgan 's .
a cult following for many polish youngsters , who have long forgotten the days of long queing lines and food rations under communism , milk bars have gained cult status .
for some old enough to remember communism , it 's one of the friendlier reminders of poland 's socialist past .
but others , like janusz and bogdan have a simpler reason for hanging out at the milk bars .

yet despite the kremlin 's restrictive policies , russia needs solidarity from the international community . on monday , hundreds of people said goodbye to the victims of the three-day school siege in the town of beslan , while in local hospitals many others continued to fight for their lives .
family members of the victims and survivors of the bloodbath in north ossetia are in despair - all of russia finds itself in mourning - and the world looks on in horror as the full magnitude of the tragedy is slowly revealed .
the hostage numbers are continually being revised upwards and the origin of the hostage takers is still uncertain .
the versions of the events at the violent end the siege are conflicting . there were mistakes on the part of the russian special bildunterschrift : forces , as president putin admitted in a speech .
eyewitnesses report serious failures during the storming of the school .
again , russian journalists are being prevented from providing a comprehensive account of what happened in beslan to the public .
a political debate in the country 's media over the background and consequences of the three-day siege is not taking place . only later did vladimir putin go to the site of these dramatic events , visiting the injured in the hospital and for good reason avoiding any meeting with residents of beslan .
instead , he turned to the russian people in a speech .
but on doing this , president putin , who so loves to present himself as the " man of action , " appeared to be at a loss and even downright petrified . he continues to avoid addressing the real causes of this tragedy - the war in chechnya that has been raging for years , and which is at least partly to blame for the growth of terror tactics and the deaths of many innocent people .
as much as putin would like russians to believe , these are not external conflicts that have been imported into the region .
it is a very russian problem - the independence fight for a small republic in the caucasus - that has fuelled this conflict . the radicals , and especially the determined terrorists in beslan , have only been able to gain ground after the long years of war and bloody conflict in the region have created an army of desperate people .
these are people who have lost everything , whose family members have been tortured and murdered and whose young people know nothing but violence .
these are people who have had to experience unbelievable barbarity from both russians and chechens and now want only one thing : revenge .
at the same time , there is no greater desire among the civilian population than to simply live in peace . beslan is a horrible symbol for a conflict that has long since expanded beyond the borders of chechnya and now threatens to set the entire caucasus region ablaze .
putin must now try to break this vicious circle , with international assistance if necessary .

but this culinary diversity is something that only emerged after the iron curtain fell in 1989 .
before that , when poles did n't feel like slaving behind the stove , they did n't hop in the car and head for the nearest golden arches - instead they hopped on over to their local government-subsidized milk bars -lrb- bar mleczny -rrb- for a quick repast and a night on the town .
mcstate subsidized subsidized by the government , the milk bars served as an important social outlet under poland 's communist government .
the socialist idea behind the bars was to provide each worker and citizen with the possibility of an affordable warm meal .
people from all walks of life frequented the milk bars - and many still do .
and though the name may evoke images of bovine creations , the milk bars did n't just sell milk or ice cream .
you could also get a balanced , square meal .
but the meals did tend to rely heavily on dairy products for their inspiration .
during the peak of communism , self-service restaurants like milk bars could be found throughout the eastern bloc .
in the former east germany , for example , they could be found in most cities .
but today they have vanished from most countries except poland .
competition for the burger industry with the onslaught of western fast food and diminishing government subsidies , poland 's tradition of milk bars has struggled in recent years , with many going out of business .
but in the country 's metropolises , like warsaw or gdansk , milk bars are still trendy hangouts .
and though they now have to compete with fast food and kebab stands , the polish government wants to keep them in business and backs them to the tune of several million euros in subsidies each year .
with their low prices , the milk bars are attracting a growing number of students and pensioners .
with meals costing as little as € 1 to € 4 , the prices are attractive .
still , the hunt for a bargain is n't the only thing that draws people to the milk bars .
patrick szymanski , a 23-year-old student , eats in a milk bar every day and he loves warsaw 's milk bars , because he does n't have to do any cooking or clean-up .
" in former times there were as many milk bars as there are coffee shops now .
but now there are almost only kebab shops and asian takeaways , " recalled a guy named janusz , a 66-year-old warsaw native who was eating lunch with his friend bogdan at bar studencki , a traditional milk bar at the university of warsaw .
janusz said he 'd rather dig into a milk bar 's traditional fare of soup and potato-filled piroshkis than go to a fast food chain .
" it tastes almost as good as my wife 's cooking , " asserts the 59-year-old bodgan .
" i like the polish kitchen .
unlike fast food , it 's actually healthy , " said a friend of bodgan 's .
a cult following for many polish youngsters , who have long forgotten the days of long queing lines and food rations under communism , milk bars have gained cult status .
for some old enough to remember communism , it 's one of the friendlier reminders of poland 's socialist past .
but others , like janusz and bogdan have a simpler reason for hanging out at the milk bars .

sometimes actors play such powerful roles or infamous characters they get typecast for the rest of their careers .
bruno ganz is worried about falling into that trap after playing the ultimate bad guy - adolf hitler . " the downfall - hitler and the end of the third reich " tells the story of the dictator as a tragic human being , not just a monster , and ganz 's exceptional acting ability has him concerned how he 'll be seen after the film , which portrays the last 12 day of hitler 's life in a berlin bunker , opens on sept .
16 .
" i do n't know what 's going to happen when the film reaches the public , " the 63-year-old swiss actor told the bild am sonntag newspaper .
" there could be some mistaken or disturbed people who confuse me with hitler . "
if critics are to be believed , he may have something to worry about .
while many wonder if the time is right , or could ever be right , for a film showing hitler as a human being , commentators agree ganz 's portrayal is right on target .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ganz as hitler " ganz is hitler , " said historian joachim fest , whose biography of the nazi leader the film drew on .
ganz needed a long time before deciding to take the role , and his son was nearly successful in dissuading him when he said it would n't be healthy " to enter a sick person 's mind for so long . "
but upon seeing himself made up as hitler , complete with his famous moustache , ganz was convinced him to take his first leading role in a german movie in 16 years .
but hairpieces and uniforms were n't enough to allow ganz to convincingly portray the austrian-born " führer , " he also had to get into the mass murderer 's head .
" if i only hate hitler , then i ca n't open things up for myself .
that only happens with affection , " ganz said .
" i was forced to develop an understanding for the man .
i 'm not ashamed of the fact that i was able to feel sympathy for him during fleeting seconds . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from " the downfall " moments of understanding are okay , according to the producer of " the downfall , " bernd eichinger .
but if viewers walk away after the movie 's more that two hours feeling general sympathy for hitler , then " the film has failed in its intention . "
after the € 13.5 million -lrb- $ 16.3 million -rrb- film ends it run in theaters , ganz wants to put the typecast theory to the test .
he said for his next project he 'd like a part in a comedy . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de film portrays hitler in human light adolf hitler spent his last days in an underground bunker in berlin amid a combination of fear and unreality .

family members of the victims and survivors of the bloodbath in north ossetia are in despair - all of russia finds itself in mourning - and the world looks on in horror as the full magnitude of the tragedy is slowly revealed .

as much as putin would like russians to believe , these are not external conflicts that have been imported into the region .
it is a very russian problem - the independence fight for a small republic in the caucasus - that has fuelled this conflict . the radicals , and especially the determined terrorists in beslan , have only been able to gain ground after the long years of war and bloody conflict in the region have created an army of desperate people .
these are people who have lost everything , whose family members have been tortured and murdered and whose young people know nothing but violence .
these are people who have had to experience unbelievable barbarity from both russians and chechens and now want only one thing : revenge .
at the same time , there is no greater desire among the civilian population than to simply live in peace . beslan is a horrible symbol for a conflict that has long since expanded beyond the borders of chechnya and now threatens to set the entire caucasus region ablaze .

" our economy has turned the corner .
all forecasts indicate we will reach growth of between 1.5 and 2 percent this year , " he told the assembled members of the bundestag . the finance minister revealed proposals for € 22 billion of new debt to finance expected new investments of € 22.8 billion .
eichel also stated that total government spending would reach € 258 billion in 2005 , about € 1 billion higher than in the current year .
however , his budget draft contained projected privatization proceeds of some € 15 billion next year , which the government hopes will help reign in the budget deficit to back below the eu stability and growth pact 's ceiling of three percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- . cdu calls for eichel to step down germany ’ s conservative opposition criticized eichels figures as wild guesses and accused him of disregarding a number of risks and pitfalls .
the cdu ’ s budget spokesman dietrich austerman spoke of a huge question mark behind predictions of revenues from a controversial highway toll system for trucks , which is to be introduced next year . he also pointed out that the government ’ s labor market reform would run up a bill of at least € 5 billion more than what was planned in the budget .
austerman called on the government to withdraw the budget plan and asked the finance minister to step down . " the budget 2005 epitomizes the failure of red-green budget policy , he says .
it is in violation of the constitution and the eu stability pact because it makes no attempt at consolidation .
it is entirely based on false figures and totally insufficient to boost the economy .
there are incalculable risks that should prompt the government to redo their budget and start all over again . " last week , eichel raised the forecast for this year 's budget deficit , saying declining tax income and increased spending on the unemployed would push the shortfall further beyond european union limits for a third straight year , reaching an estimated 3.7 percent of gdp in 2004 compared with a previous forecast of 3.25 percent published half a year ago . deficit reduction target gets helping hand the ultimate objective of getting the german budget deficit to below eu levels may also get a helping hand from the european commission and its proposed watering down of the hard-line pact .
brussels announced plans last week to make the pact less rigid including paying greater attention to economic developments when setting deadlines for budget cuts , taking account of whether a country 's debts are sustainable , and making greater allowances for the state of the economy . eichel welcomed the proposals drawn up by the european commission , saying the changes would help boost economic growth in europe .
" i can only welcome the proposals put forward by brussels , they 're what i 've been calling for all along , " he said . bundesbank lashes out at commission however , as eichel was addressing the bundestag on tuesday , the bundesbank was lashing out at the european commission 's proposals , arguing that the changes would weaken the stability and growth pact and lead to a worsening of monetary policy conditions in the euro area . " the bundesbank is of the opinion that the proposed changes will not strengthen but weaken the stability pact , " the german central bank said in a statement .
" that would lead to a deterioration of the conditions for monetary policy in the single currency area , " it added , indicating that if governments pursued a policy of loose purse strings in europe , the european central bank might be compelled to react by raising its key interest rates .
" healthy state finances are an important pre-condition for the ecb to guarantee price stability in the long term via relatively low interest rates , " the bundesbank said . the proposed changes " will reduce the incentive for euro zone countries to pursue solid budget policies and , at the same time , send a wrong signal to those countries that have not yet adopted the single currency " , the bank complained .
furthermore , many of the proposals would " make the rules more complicated and complex , thereby impairing its -lrb- the pact 's -rrb- ability to be implemented , " it argued . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european commission to loosen stability pact the european commission on friday unveiled a plan to introduce more flexibility in the stability and growth pact , saying it was vital to restore the credibility of its much-flouted budget discipline rules .
-lrb- september 3 , 2004 -rrb- germany to breach eu deficit rules in 2004 german finance minister hans eichel on tuesday said berlin would breach eu deficit limits for a third consecutive year in 2004 .
the announcement comes amid speculation brussels will loosen its budget rules .
-lrb- august 31 , 2004 -rrb- germany set to violate eu deficit rules in 2005 according to leading economic institutes , germany 's deficit will surpass 3 percent next year , meaning that the euro zone 's biggest economy is on the verge of breaching the stability and growth pact for the fourth year .

the eu has been calling on tehran to cooperate more closely with the un . details of the deal between teheran and the un 's international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- were not clear , but diplomats close to the talks have said they would include the production , testing and assembly of centrifuges . centrifuges are used to enrich uranium for power stations and can be enriched further to produce material for atomic bombs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director general of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- mohamed elbaradei talks between iran and the iaea , headed by mohamed el baradei -lrb- photo -rrb- , took place over the weekend .
envoys from the eu 's " big three , " germany , france and britain , followed the discussions closely . " iran said this weekend that they would come back to the suspension .
el baradei is trying to work out the details with the iranians , " a western diplomat told the reuters news agency . iran 's nuclear program has been a cause of concern among western politicians .
the united state has accused teheran of wanting to developing its uranium enrichment program to make material nuclear weapons and wants the un security council to impose sanctions on the country for failing to meet its commitments to the iaea . iran insists that its nuclear program is purely for energy generation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's top nuclear negotiator , hasan rowhani , who heads the supreme national security council , speaks with media during his press conference in tehran , iran , saturday , june 19 , 2004 .
" iran has never pursued nuclear arms but we are serious about having peaceful nuclear technology , " the head of iran 's supreme national security council hassan rowhani told iran 's state television . last year , eu foreign ministers from france , germany and britain convinced iran to suspend its uranium enrichment activities , but in june , teheran reneged on the pledge and resumed the production and testing of nuclear centrifuges .
just last week , it said it intended on processing 37 tons of raw uranium into uranium hexafluoride , the feed material for centrifuges . the possible deal agreed after this weekend 's talks could ease improve the diplomatic situation ahead of the iaea meeting on sept .

the us has preferred to take a hard line with teheran while the europeans have chosen a strategy of diplomatic engagement .
but teheran 's activities have had them worried . " we can not accept of course the development of weapon-grade uranium , " said dutch foreign minister bernard bot , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency .
" that signal should be very strong and should be unanimously given over by the 25 " eu member states . the dutch made the call in a statement late monday night after a visit by iran 's rowhani in amsterdam , where he met with bot and dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende .
the dutch also raised a number of other concerns , including human rights , terrorism and iran 's position towards israel . german foreign minister joschka fischer has also turned up the pressure on iran , saying a nuclear-capable iran " can become a subject for the -lrb- un -rrb- security council . " eu foreign ministers who met over the weekend said they were discussing whether or not to take iran to the un security council to ensure it is not secretly trying to develop atomic weapons .

just do n't expect any fancy stuff - not from the germans anyway . world champions brazil take on germany in a friendly game in berlin on wednesday .
the prestigious match carries little importance to the home side other than it represents a chance to exact revenge on the samba stars who ruined their improbable world cup dream two years ago by beating them 2-0 in yokohama in the 2002 final . germany as hosts for the 2006 world cup are automatically installed in the tournament while recent rule changes dictate that reigning world champions brazil have to qualify for the right to defend their crown .
brazil will arrive in germany after beating bolivia 3-1 in a world cup qualifier in sao paulo and will view the match as a chance to keep the team ’ s momentum ahead of more demanding and important clashes in the south american qualifying group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn prays for the yokohama pitch to open up in the world cup final 2002 .
for germany , however , it will be the first opportunity since the world cup final to regain their pride against ronaldo and co .
after progressing against the odds to the showpiece finale in japan , the germans felt aggrieved that they did not take the chance to claim a famous victory and a fourth world cup . but for those expecting a german fairytale ending on wednesday , the recent words of team captain michael ballack may already have dampened the spirits of fans hoping for an exhibition display from the home side . ballack forgoes beauty for success midfielder ballack told the german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung on sunday that germany do not need to play a " beautiful game " to succeed and should focus instead on developing a winning mentality .
" one does n't have to play beautiful football .
success is what counts . " someone may want to remind ballack that the current germany team has lacked both beauty and success of late .
germany have not beaten a major soccer power in their last nine matches and were dumped out of the recent european championships after the first round .
the last time the germans beat a top-level side was october 7 , 2000 when they secured a 1-0 victory over england .
after that , they lost 1-0 to france , 5-1 to england and 1-0 to argentina in the run-up to the 2002 world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack scores past south korean goalkeeper lee woon jae during the 2002 world cup semi-final .

since then , they have gone down 3-1 to the netherlands , 3-1 to spain , 1-0 to italy and 3-0 to france .
they then drew 1-1 against the netherlands at euro 2004 .
a victory over brazil may not be impossible but the statistics suggest a win would be unlikely , an attractive one even less so . brazil buzzing with invention in contrast , the brazilians arrive in berlin this week on the back of a splendid display of inspirational soccer against bolivia and bring with them a restored reputation as the harlem globetrotters of the international game . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronaldo real madrid striker and germany ’ s world cup final nemesis ronaldo had promised fans a gala in sao paulo .
and brazil did not fail to deliver .
ronaldo himself opened the scoring with a blistering volley before the game was even a minute old .
the game then turned into an exhibition of art-soccer when ronaldinho fired a 12th minute penalty into the lower left corner for a 2-0 lead .
and just before half-time , copa america hero adriano leaped above the bolivian backline to head in a cross from ronaldinho to make it 3-0 . " it was a good result and an excellent performance , " said ronaldo at the post-match press conference .
" we have every reason to be happy .
it was marvelous .
we played excellent soccer and we 're the leaders of the group . "
the win puts brazil ahead of argentina in the group and their world cup campaign in motion . despite the feel-good factor running through the brazilian team after sunday ’ s win , there will be a cloud hanging over the samba stars when they arrive in germany . club restrictions lead to player ban bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucio .

just do n't expect any fancy stuff - not from the germans anyway . world champions brazil take on germany in a friendly game in berlin on wednesday .
the prestigious match carries little importance to the home side other than it represents a chance to exact revenge on the samba stars who ruined their improbable world cup dream two years ago by beating them 2-0 in yokohama in the 2002 final . germany as hosts for the 2006 world cup are automatically installed in the tournament while recent rule changes dictate that reigning world champions brazil have to qualify for the right to defend their crown .

germany have not beaten a major soccer power in their last nine matches and were dumped out of the recent european championships after the first round .
the last time the germans beat a top-level side was october 7 , 2000 when they secured a 1-0 victory over england .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 07.09.2004 stability pact plans prompt criticism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans eichel 's budget plan drew criticism from opposition parties both german finance minister hans eichel and the european commission took flak for separate stability and growth pact proposals on tuesday . germany 's beleaguered finance minister hans eichel addressed the bundestag on his 2005 federal budget proposal on tuesday and ruled out further spending cuts in the year ahead so as not to undermine the still fragile recovery in the german economy . eichel put on a brave face by telling the lower house of parliament that the german economy could at last look forward to an upturn , though the recovery was still being led by strengthening exports rather than domestic demand , which remained weak .
" our economy has turned the corner .
all forecasts indicate we will reach growth of between 1.5 and 2 percent this year , " he told the assembled members of the bundestag . the finance minister revealed proposals for € 22 billion of new debt to finance expected new investments of € 22.8 billion .
eichel also stated that total government spending would reach € 258 billion in 2005 , about € 1 billion higher than in the current year .
however , his budget draft contained projected privatization proceeds of some € 15 billion next year , which the government hopes will help reign in the budget deficit to back below the eu stability and growth pact 's ceiling of three percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- . cdu calls for eichel to step down germany ’ s conservative opposition criticized eichels figures as wild guesses and accused him of disregarding a number of risks and pitfalls .
the cdu ’ s budget spokesman dietrich austerman spoke of a huge question mark behind predictions of revenues from a controversial highway toll system for trucks , which is to be introduced next year . he also pointed out that the government ’ s labor market reform would run up a bill of at least € 5 billion more than what was planned in the budget .
austerman called on the government to withdraw the budget plan and asked the finance minister to step down . " the budget 2005 epitomizes the failure of red-green budget policy , he says .
it is in violation of the constitution and the eu stability pact because it makes no attempt at consolidation .
it is entirely based on false figures and totally insufficient to boost the economy .
there are incalculable risks that should prompt the government to redo their budget and start all over again . " last week , eichel raised the forecast for this year 's budget deficit , saying declining tax income and increased spending on the unemployed would push the shortfall further beyond european union limits for a third straight year , reaching an estimated 3.7 percent of gdp in 2004 compared with a previous forecast of 3.25 percent published half a year ago . deficit reduction target gets helping hand the ultimate objective of getting the german budget deficit to below eu levels may also get a helping hand from the european commission and its proposed watering down of the hard-line pact .
brussels announced plans last week to make the pact less rigid including paying greater attention to economic developments when setting deadlines for budget cuts , taking account of whether a country 's debts are sustainable , and making greater allowances for the state of the economy . eichel welcomed the proposals drawn up by the european commission , saying the changes would help boost economic growth in europe .
" i can only welcome the proposals put forward by brussels , they 're what i 've been calling for all along , " he said . bundesbank lashes out at commission however , as eichel was addressing the bundestag on tuesday , the bundesbank was lashing out at the european commission 's proposals , arguing that the changes would weaken the stability and growth pact and lead to a worsening of monetary policy conditions in the euro area . " the bundesbank is of the opinion that the proposed changes will not strengthen but weaken the stability pact , " the german central bank said in a statement .
" that would lead to a deterioration of the conditions for monetary policy in the single currency area , " it added , indicating that if governments pursued a policy of loose purse strings in europe , the european central bank might be compelled to react by raising its key interest rates .
" healthy state finances are an important pre-condition for the ecb to guarantee price stability in the long term via relatively low interest rates , " the bundesbank said . the proposed changes " will reduce the incentive for euro zone countries to pursue solid budget policies and , at the same time , send a wrong signal to those countries that have not yet adopted the single currency " , the bank complained .
furthermore , many of the proposals would " make the rules more complicated and complex , thereby impairing its -lrb- the pact 's -rrb- ability to be implemented , " it argued . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european commission to loosen stability pact the european commission on friday unveiled a plan to introduce more flexibility in the stability and growth pact , saying it was vital to restore the credibility of its much-flouted budget discipline rules .
-lrb- september 3 , 2004 -rrb- germany to breach eu deficit rules in 2004 german finance minister hans eichel on tuesday said berlin would breach eu deficit limits for a third consecutive year in 2004 .
the announcement comes amid speculation brussels will loosen its budget rules .
-lrb- august 31 , 2004 -rrb- germany set to violate eu deficit rules in 2005 according to leading economic institutes , germany 's deficit will surpass 3 percent next year , meaning that the euro zone 's biggest economy is on the verge of breaching the stability and growth pact for the fourth year .

" our economy has turned the corner .
all forecasts indicate we will reach growth of between 1.5 and 2 percent this year , " he told the assembled members of the bundestag . the finance minister revealed proposals for € 22 billion of new debt to finance expected new investments of € 22.8 billion .
eichel also stated that total government spending would reach € 258 billion in 2005 , about € 1 billion higher than in the current year .
however , his budget draft contained projected privatization proceeds of some € 15 billion next year , which the government hopes will help reign in the budget deficit to back below the eu stability and growth pact 's ceiling of three percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- . cdu calls for eichel to step down germany ’ s conservative opposition criticized eichels figures as wild guesses and accused him of disregarding a number of risks and pitfalls .
the cdu ’ s budget spokesman dietrich austerman spoke of a huge question mark behind predictions of revenues from a controversial highway toll system for trucks , which is to be introduced next year . he also pointed out that the government ’ s labor market reform would run up a bill of at least € 5 billion more than what was planned in the budget .
austerman called on the government to withdraw the budget plan and asked the finance minister to step down . " the budget 2005 epitomizes the failure of red-green budget policy , he says .
it is in violation of the constitution and the eu stability pact because it makes no attempt at consolidation .
it is entirely based on false figures and totally insufficient to boost the economy .
there are incalculable risks that should prompt the government to redo their budget and start all over again . " last week , eichel raised the forecast for this year 's budget deficit , saying declining tax income and increased spending on the unemployed would push the shortfall further beyond european union limits for a third straight year , reaching an estimated 3.7 percent of gdp in 2004 compared with a previous forecast of 3.25 percent published half a year ago . deficit reduction target gets helping hand the ultimate objective of getting the german budget deficit to below eu levels may also get a helping hand from the european commission and its proposed watering down of the hard-line pact .
brussels announced plans last week to make the pact less rigid including paying greater attention to economic developments when setting deadlines for budget cuts , taking account of whether a country 's debts are sustainable , and making greater allowances for the state of the economy . eichel welcomed the proposals drawn up by the european commission , saying the changes would help boost economic growth in europe .
" i can only welcome the proposals put forward by brussels , they 're what i 've been calling for all along , " he said . bundesbank lashes out at commission however , as eichel was addressing the bundestag on tuesday , the bundesbank was lashing out at the european commission 's proposals , arguing that the changes would weaken the stability and growth pact and lead to a worsening of monetary policy conditions in the euro area . " the bundesbank is of the opinion that the proposed changes will not strengthen but weaken the stability pact , " the german central bank said in a statement .
" that would lead to a deterioration of the conditions for monetary policy in the single currency area , " it added , indicating that if governments pursued a policy of loose purse strings in europe , the european central bank might be compelled to react by raising its key interest rates .
" healthy state finances are an important pre-condition for the ecb to guarantee price stability in the long term via relatively low interest rates , " the bundesbank said . the proposed changes " will reduce the incentive for euro zone countries to pursue solid budget policies and , at the same time , send a wrong signal to those countries that have not yet adopted the single currency " , the bank complained .
furthermore , many of the proposals would " make the rules more complicated and complex , thereby impairing its -lrb- the pact 's -rrb- ability to be implemented , " it argued . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european commission to loosen stability pact the european commission on friday unveiled a plan to introduce more flexibility in the stability and growth pact , saying it was vital to restore the credibility of its much-flouted budget discipline rules .
-lrb- september 3 , 2004 -rrb- germany to breach eu deficit rules in 2004 german finance minister hans eichel on tuesday said berlin would breach eu deficit limits for a third consecutive year in 2004 .
the announcement comes amid speculation brussels will loosen its budget rules .

" last week , eichel raised the forecast for this year 's budget deficit , saying declining tax income and increased spending on the unemployed would push the shortfall further beyond european union limits for a third straight year , reaching an estimated 3.7 percent of gdp in 2004 compared with a previous forecast of 3.25 percent published half a year ago . deficit reduction target gets helping hand the ultimate objective of getting the german budget deficit to below eu levels may also get a helping hand from the european commission and its proposed watering down of the hard-line pact .
brussels announced plans last week to make the pact less rigid including paying greater attention to economic developments when setting deadlines for budget cuts , taking account of whether a country 's debts are sustainable , and making greater allowances for the state of the economy . eichel welcomed the proposals drawn up by the european commission , saying the changes would help boost economic growth in europe .
" i can only welcome the proposals put forward by brussels , they 're what i 've been calling for all along , " he said . bundesbank lashes out at commission however , as eichel was addressing the bundestag on tuesday , the bundesbank was lashing out at the european commission 's proposals , arguing that the changes would weaken the stability and growth pact and lead to a worsening of monetary policy conditions in the euro area . " the bundesbank is of the opinion that the proposed changes will not strengthen but weaken the stability pact , " the german central bank said in a statement .
" that would lead to a deterioration of the conditions for monetary policy in the single currency area , " it added , indicating that if governments pursued a policy of loose purse strings in europe , the european central bank might be compelled to react by raising its key interest rates .
" healthy state finances are an important pre-condition for the ecb to guarantee price stability in the long term via relatively low interest rates , " the bundesbank said . the proposed changes " will reduce the incentive for euro zone countries to pursue solid budget policies and , at the same time , send a wrong signal to those countries that have not yet adopted the single currency " , the bank complained .
furthermore , many of the proposals would " make the rules more complicated and complex , thereby impairing its -lrb- the pact 's -rrb- ability to be implemented , " it argued . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european commission to loosen stability pact the european commission on friday unveiled a plan to introduce more flexibility in the stability and growth pact , saying it was vital to restore the credibility of its much-flouted budget discipline rules .
-lrb- september 3 , 2004 -rrb- germany to breach eu deficit rules in 2004 german finance minister hans eichel on tuesday said berlin would breach eu deficit limits for a third consecutive year in 2004 .
the announcement comes amid speculation brussels will loosen its budget rules .

yet despite the kremlin 's restrictive policies , russia needs solidarity from the international community . on monday , hundreds of people said goodbye to the victims of the three-day school siege in the town of beslan , while in local hospitals many others continued to fight for their lives .
family members of the victims and survivors of the bloodbath in north ossetia are in despair - all of russia finds itself in mourning - and the world looks on in horror as the full magnitude of the tragedy is slowly revealed .
the hostage numbers are continually being revised upwards and the origin of the hostage takers is still uncertain .
the versions of the events at the violent end the siege are conflicting . there were mistakes on the part of the russian special bildunterschrift : forces , as president putin admitted in a speech .
eyewitnesses report serious failures during the storming of the school .
again , russian journalists are being prevented from providing a comprehensive account of what happened in beslan to the public .
a political debate in the country 's media over the background and consequences of the three-day siege is not taking place . only later did vladimir putin go to the site of these dramatic events , visiting the injured in the hospital and for good reason avoiding any meeting with residents of beslan .
instead , he turned to the russian people in a speech .
but on doing this , president putin , who so loves to present himself as the " man of action , " appeared to be at a loss and even downright petrified . he continues to avoid addressing the real causes of this tragedy - the war in chechnya that has been raging for years , and which is at least partly to blame for the growth of terror tactics and the deaths of many innocent people .
as much as putin would like russians to believe , these are not external conflicts that have been imported into the region .
it is a very russian problem - the independence fight for a small republic in the caucasus - that has fuelled this conflict . the radicals , and especially the determined terrorists in beslan , have only been able to gain ground after the long years of war and bloody conflict in the region have created an army of desperate people .
these are people who have lost everything , whose family members have been tortured and murdered and whose young people know nothing but violence .
these are people who have had to experience unbelievable barbarity from both russians and chechens and now want only one thing : revenge .
at the same time , there is no greater desire among the civilian population than to simply live in peace . beslan is a horrible symbol for a conflict that has long since expanded beyond the borders of chechnya and now threatens to set the entire caucasus region ablaze .
putin must now try to break this vicious circle , with international assistance if necessary .
and the west should be ready to provide it because in the war against terror , russian needs solidarity . cornelia rabitz -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de death toll above 320 in russian school attack while estimates of the number of people killed in the hostage-taking drama in a russian school rose ever higher on saturday , many questions remained unanswered the day after a siege put an end to the crisis .

eu officials are therefore touring the country to foster a more positive profile . at a series of seminars with the media in the southern cities of bangalore and hyderabad in the past week , held at glitzy locations linked to the country 's booming film industry , eu representatives have pitched for a greater understanding of what the eu does internally , on the global stage and in india itself .
they have had to start with basics by explaining the role taken by the executive european commission in initiating and policing eu legislation and the commission 's often troublesome interplay with the member states .
the distinction is important as in some areas of vital interest to india , notably trade ; the commission is the eu 's voice in international negotiations .
yet in others , such as foreign policy , the commission is powerless with the member states making the running . journalists drawn from southern india confessed to finding the details sometimes baffling and said the eu still has much work to do to establish its relevance to india beyond the trade front .
ordinary indians should be the target audience " the eu needs to do much more to raise public awareness among ordinary indians , by publicizing their important aid work and holding cultural events , " k.n. tilak kumar , chairman of the regional deccan herald newspaper group , told afp .

" the eu has an obligation still to explain that it is more than a fortress , the horrifying force behind the wto wanting to take over india .
we need to counter that with an alternative viewpoint , " said robert aarsse , first secretary at the dutch embassy in delhi , whose country holds the bloc 's rotating presidency .
" one thing we stress is that we are multilateral , whereas the us is unilateral .
we want to show india that we are a partner to work with , " he added .

eu officials are therefore touring the country to foster a more positive profile . at a series of seminars with the media in the southern cities of bangalore and hyderabad in the past week , held at glitzy locations linked to the country 's booming film industry , eu representatives have pitched for a greater understanding of what the eu does internally , on the global stage and in india itself .
they have had to start with basics by explaining the role taken by the executive european commission in initiating and policing eu legislation and the commission 's often troublesome interplay with the member states .
the distinction is important as in some areas of vital interest to india , notably trade ; the commission is the eu 's voice in international negotiations .
yet in others , such as foreign policy , the commission is powerless with the member states making the running . journalists drawn from southern india confessed to finding the details sometimes baffling and said the eu still has much work to do to establish its relevance to india beyond the trade front .
ordinary indians should be the target audience " the eu needs to do much more to raise public awareness among ordinary indians , by publicizing their important aid work and holding cultural events , " k.n. tilak kumar , chairman of the regional deccan herald newspaper group , told afp .
delegates at the seminars said eu-organized film events showcasing the best of contemporary european cinema had been big hits with indian audiences more used to a solid diet of bollywood fantasy interspersed with hollywood blockbusters .
" if they want the eu to be known here , they have to make news in india , " kumar added .
in-fighting creates a bad image the eu has been making headlines in the indian press , but for all the wrong reasons .
well-publicized rows among member states , such as over iraq , have undermined attempts by the bloc to portray itself as a big player on the world stage .
" you have to have a policy on iraq , the most important foreign policy issue of the day .
having a policy on some things and a non-policy on others is no way of carrying on , " said kumar .

drawn from the commission 's external relations department , their work is largely confined to trade negotiations and overseeing aid projects .
for the staff of the new delhi embassy , that work is hugely important given india 's pivotal role as a leader of developing nations at the world trade organization and its status as a sizeable recipient of eu development funds .
they are also keen to promote the eu 's experience in conflict settlement , no small concern here given india 's intractable dispute with pakistan over kashmir . eu funding has made visible differences the € 100 million -lrb- $ 120 million -rrb- of eu grant aid spent annually in india is spread far and wide .
in the slums of mysore near bangalore , an eu-funded project has brought schooling , immunization and basic sanitation to communities where literacy was just 10 percent five years ago and easily preventable diseases were rife , according to the non-governmental organization overseeing the work .
but as eu officials freely admit , such work does not get much publicity in the local press , hence the seminars .
" the eu has an obligation still to explain that it is more than a fortress , the horrifying force behind the wto wanting to take over india .
we need to counter that with an alternative viewpoint , " said robert aarsse , first secretary at the dutch embassy in delhi , whose country holds the bloc 's rotating presidency .
" one thing we stress is that we are multilateral , whereas the us is unilateral .
we want to show india that we are a partner to work with , " he added .
proposed strategic partnership to be discussed at the highest levels of government , the two sides are already well engaged .
ministerial meetings are held regularly , and next month will see the fifth annual eu-india summit , in the dutch capital the hague .
in preparation for the summit , the european commission in june unveiled a new set of proposals designed to entrench a fledgling " strategic partnership " with india .
but for rajendra jain , professor of european studies at delhi 's jawaharlal nehru university , india still prefers to deal one-to-one with the big eu nations such as britain and france , and is " obsessed " by its relations with the united states .
" the indian elite thinks the eu is just not credible as a foreign policy actor , so the eu is not taken seriously , " jain said .
" and in india , the leading eu nations like britain often have their own agendas to promote , so they 're disinclined to give the eu a profile of its own . "

" the downfall - hitler and the end of the third reich " tells the story of the dictator as a tragic human being , not just a monster , and ganz 's exceptional acting ability has him concerned how he 'll be seen after the film , which portrays the last 12 day of hitler 's life in a berlin bunker , opens on sept .
16 .
" i do n't know what 's going to happen when the film reaches the public , " the 63-year-old swiss actor told the bild am sonntag newspaper .
" there could be some mistaken or disturbed people who confuse me with hitler . "
if critics are to be believed , he may have something to worry about .
while many wonder if the time is right , or could ever be right , for a film showing hitler as a human being , commentators agree ganz 's portrayal is right on target .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ganz as hitler " ganz is hitler , " said historian joachim fest , whose biography of the nazi leader the film drew on .
ganz needed a long time before deciding to take the role , and his son was nearly successful in dissuading him when he said it would n't be healthy " to enter a sick person 's mind for so long . "
but upon seeing himself made up as hitler , complete with his famous moustache , ganz was convinced him to take his first leading role in a german movie in 16 years .
but hairpieces and uniforms were n't enough to allow ganz to convincingly portray the austrian-born " führer , " he also had to get into the mass murderer 's head .
" if i only hate hitler , then i ca n't open things up for myself .
that only happens with affection , " ganz said .
" i was forced to develop an understanding for the man .
i 'm not ashamed of the fact that i was able to feel sympathy for him during fleeting seconds . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from " the downfall " moments of understanding are okay , according to the producer of " the downfall , " bernd eichinger .
but if viewers walk away after the movie 's more that two hours feeling general sympathy for hitler , then " the film has failed in its intention . "
after the € 13.5 million -lrb- $ 16.3 million -rrb- film ends it run in theaters , ganz wants to put the typecast theory to the test .
he said for his next project he 'd like a part in a comedy . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de film portrays hitler in human light adolf hitler spent his last days in an underground bunker in berlin amid a combination of fear and unreality .

" iran has never pursued nuclear arms but we are serious about having peaceful nuclear technology , " the head of iran 's supreme national security council hassan rowhani told iran 's state television . last year , eu foreign ministers from france , germany and britain convinced iran to suspend its uranium enrichment activities , but in june , teheran reneged on the pledge and resumed the production and testing of nuclear centrifuges .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 07.09.2004 opinion : russia needs international solidarity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : images from the school siege have shocked russia and the world official versions of the hostage drama in north ossetia and the true events on the ground are widely divergent .
yet despite the kremlin 's restrictive policies , russia needs solidarity from the international community . on monday , hundreds of people said goodbye to the victims of the three-day school siege in the town of beslan , while in local hospitals many others continued to fight for their lives .
family members of the victims and survivors of the bloodbath in north ossetia are in despair - all of russia finds itself in mourning - and the world looks on in horror as the full magnitude of the tragedy is slowly revealed .
the hostage numbers are continually being revised upwards and the origin of the hostage takers is still uncertain .
the versions of the events at the violent end the siege are conflicting . there were mistakes on the part of the russian special bildunterschrift : forces , as president putin admitted in a speech .
eyewitnesses report serious failures during the storming of the school .
again , russian journalists are being prevented from providing a comprehensive account of what happened in beslan to the public .
a political debate in the country 's media over the background and consequences of the three-day siege is not taking place . only later did vladimir putin go to the site of these dramatic events , visiting the injured in the hospital and for good reason avoiding any meeting with residents of beslan .
instead , he turned to the russian people in a speech .
but on doing this , president putin , who so loves to present himself as the " man of action , " appeared to be at a loss and even downright petrified . he continues to avoid addressing the real causes of this tragedy - the war in chechnya that has been raging for years , and which is at least partly to blame for the growth of terror tactics and the deaths of many innocent people .
as much as putin would like russians to believe , these are not external conflicts that have been imported into the region .
it is a very russian problem - the independence fight for a small republic in the caucasus - that has fuelled this conflict . the radicals , and especially the determined terrorists in beslan , have only been able to gain ground after the long years of war and bloody conflict in the region have created an army of desperate people .
these are people who have lost everything , whose family members have been tortured and murdered and whose young people know nothing but violence .
these are people who have had to experience unbelievable barbarity from both russians and chechens and now want only one thing : revenge .
at the same time , there is no greater desire among the civilian population than to simply live in peace . beslan is a horrible symbol for a conflict that has long since expanded beyond the borders of chechnya and now threatens to set the entire caucasus region ablaze .
putin must now try to break this vicious circle , with international assistance if necessary .
and the west should be ready to provide it because in the war against terror , russian needs solidarity . cornelia rabitz -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de death toll above 320 in russian school attack while estimates of the number of people killed in the hostage-taking drama in a russian school rose ever higher on saturday , many questions remained unanswered the day after a siege put an end to the crisis .

just do n't expect any fancy stuff - not from the germans anyway . world champions brazil take on germany in a friendly game in berlin on wednesday .
the prestigious match carries little importance to the home side other than it represents a chance to exact revenge on the samba stars who ruined their improbable world cup dream two years ago by beating them 2-0 in yokohama in the 2002 final . germany as hosts for the 2006 world cup are automatically installed in the tournament while recent rule changes dictate that reigning world champions brazil have to qualify for the right to defend their crown .
brazil will arrive in germany after beating bolivia 3-1 in a world cup qualifier in sao paulo and will view the match as a chance to keep the team ’ s momentum ahead of more demanding and important clashes in the south american qualifying group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn prays for the yokohama pitch to open up in the world cup final 2002 .
for germany , however , it will be the first opportunity since the world cup final to regain their pride against ronaldo and co .
after progressing against the odds to the showpiece finale in japan , the germans felt aggrieved that they did not take the chance to claim a famous victory and a fourth world cup . but for those expecting a german fairytale ending on wednesday , the recent words of team captain michael ballack may already have dampened the spirits of fans hoping for an exhibition display from the home side . ballack forgoes beauty for success midfielder ballack told the german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung on sunday that germany do not need to play a " beautiful game " to succeed and should focus instead on developing a winning mentality .
" one does n't have to play beautiful football .
success is what counts . " someone may want to remind ballack that the current germany team has lacked both beauty and success of late .
germany have not beaten a major soccer power in their last nine matches and were dumped out of the recent european championships after the first round .
the last time the germans beat a top-level side was october 7 , 2000 when they secured a 1-0 victory over england .
after that , they lost 1-0 to france , 5-1 to england and 1-0 to argentina in the run-up to the 2002 world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack scores past south korean goalkeeper lee woon jae during the 2002 world cup semi-final .

since then , they have gone down 3-1 to the netherlands , 3-1 to spain , 1-0 to italy and 3-0 to france .
they then drew 1-1 against the netherlands at euro 2004 .
a victory over brazil may not be impossible but the statistics suggest a win would be unlikely , an attractive one even less so . brazil buzzing with invention in contrast , the brazilians arrive in berlin this week on the back of a splendid display of inspirational soccer against bolivia and bring with them a restored reputation as the harlem globetrotters of the international game . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronaldo real madrid striker and germany ’ s world cup final nemesis ronaldo had promised fans a gala in sao paulo .
and brazil did not fail to deliver .
ronaldo himself opened the scoring with a blistering volley before the game was even a minute old .
the game then turned into an exhibition of art-soccer when ronaldinho fired a 12th minute penalty into the lower left corner for a 2-0 lead .
and just before half-time , copa america hero adriano leaped above the bolivian backline to head in a cross from ronaldinho to make it 3-0 . " it was a good result and an excellent performance , " said ronaldo at the post-match press conference .
" we have every reason to be happy .
it was marvelous .
we played excellent soccer and we 're the leaders of the group . "

but this culinary diversity is something that only emerged after the iron curtain fell in 1989 .
before that , when poles did n't feel like slaving behind the stove , they did n't hop in the car and head for the nearest golden arches - instead they hopped on over to their local government-subsidized milk bars -lrb- bar mleczny -rrb- for a quick repast and a night on the town .
mcstate subsidized subsidized by the government , the milk bars served as an important social outlet under poland 's communist government .
the socialist idea behind the bars was to provide each worker and citizen with the possibility of an affordable warm meal .
people from all walks of life frequented the milk bars - and many still do .
and though the name may evoke images of bovine creations , the milk bars did n't just sell milk or ice cream .
you could also get a balanced , square meal .
but the meals did tend to rely heavily on dairy products for their inspiration .
during the peak of communism , self-service restaurants like milk bars could be found throughout the eastern bloc .
in the former east germany , for example , they could be found in most cities .
but today they have vanished from most countries except poland .
competition for the burger industry with the onslaught of western fast food and diminishing government subsidies , poland 's tradition of milk bars has struggled in recent years , with many going out of business .
but in the country 's metropolises , like warsaw or gdansk , milk bars are still trendy hangouts .
and though they now have to compete with fast food and kebab stands , the polish government wants to keep them in business and backs them to the tune of several million euros in subsidies each year .
with their low prices , the milk bars are attracting a growing number of students and pensioners .
with meals costing as little as € 1 to € 4 , the prices are attractive .
still , the hunt for a bargain is n't the only thing that draws people to the milk bars .
patrick szymanski , a 23-year-old student , eats in a milk bar every day and he loves warsaw 's milk bars , because he does n't have to do any cooking or clean-up .
" in former times there were as many milk bars as there are coffee shops now .
but now there are almost only kebab shops and asian takeaways , " recalled a guy named janusz , a 66-year-old warsaw native who was eating lunch with his friend bogdan at bar studencki , a traditional milk bar at the university of warsaw .
janusz said he 'd rather dig into a milk bar 's traditional fare of soup and potato-filled piroshkis than go to a fast food chain .
" it tastes almost as good as my wife 's cooking , " asserts the 59-year-old bodgan .
" i like the polish kitchen .
unlike fast food , it 's actually healthy , " said a friend of bodgan 's .
a cult following for many polish youngsters , who have long forgotten the days of long queing lines and food rations under communism , milk bars have gained cult status .
for some old enough to remember communism , it 's one of the friendlier reminders of poland 's socialist past .
but others , like janusz and bogdan have a simpler reason for hanging out at the milk bars .
" where can you eat so well and be finished in 15 minutes ?

sometimes actors play such powerful roles or infamous characters they get typecast for the rest of their careers .
bruno ganz is worried about falling into that trap after playing the ultimate bad guy - adolf hitler . " the downfall - hitler and the end of the third reich " tells the story of the dictator as a tragic human being , not just a monster , and ganz 's exceptional acting ability has him concerned how he 'll be seen after the film , which portrays the last 12 day of hitler 's life in a berlin bunker , opens on sept .

ganz needed a long time before deciding to take the role , and his son was nearly successful in dissuading him when he said it would n't be healthy " to enter a sick person 's mind for so long . "
but upon seeing himself made up as hitler , complete with his famous moustache , ganz was convinced him to take his first leading role in a german movie in 16 years .
but hairpieces and uniforms were n't enough to allow ganz to convincingly portray the austrian-born " führer , " he also had to get into the mass murderer 's head .
" if i only hate hitler , then i ca n't open things up for myself .
that only happens with affection , " ganz said .

i 'm not ashamed of the fact that i was able to feel sympathy for him during fleeting seconds . "

ganz needed a long time before deciding to take the role , and his son was nearly successful in dissuading him when he said it would n't be healthy " to enter a sick person 's mind for so long . "
but upon seeing himself made up as hitler , complete with his famous moustache , ganz was convinced him to take his first leading role in a german movie in 16 years .
but hairpieces and uniforms were n't enough to allow ganz to convincingly portray the austrian-born " führer , " he also had to get into the mass murderer 's head .
" if i only hate hitler , then i ca n't open things up for myself .
that only happens with affection , " ganz said .
" i was forced to develop an understanding for the man .
i 'm not ashamed of the fact that i was able to feel sympathy for him during fleeting seconds . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from " the downfall " moments of understanding are okay , according to the producer of " the downfall , " bernd eichinger .
but if viewers walk away after the movie 's more that two hours feeling general sympathy for hitler , then " the film has failed in its intention . "
after the € 13.5 million -lrb- $ 16.3 million -rrb- film ends it run in theaters , ganz wants to put the typecast theory to the test .
he said for his next project he 'd like a part in a comedy . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de film portrays hitler in human light adolf hitler spent his last days in an underground bunker in berlin amid a combination of fear and unreality .

el baradei is trying to work out the details with the iranians , " a western diplomat told the reuters news agency . iran 's nuclear program has been a cause of concern among western politicians .
the united state has accused teheran of wanting to developing its uranium enrichment program to make material nuclear weapons and wants the un security council to impose sanctions on the country for failing to meet its commitments to the iaea . iran insists that its nuclear program is purely for energy generation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's top nuclear negotiator , hasan rowhani , who heads the supreme national security council , speaks with media during his press conference in tehran , iran , saturday , june 19 , 2004 .

" our economy has turned the corner .
all forecasts indicate we will reach growth of between 1.5 and 2 percent this year , " he told the assembled members of the bundestag . the finance minister revealed proposals for € 22 billion of new debt to finance expected new investments of € 22.8 billion .
eichel also stated that total government spending would reach € 258 billion in 2005 , about € 1 billion higher than in the current year .
however , his budget draft contained projected privatization proceeds of some € 15 billion next year , which the government hopes will help reign in the budget deficit to back below the eu stability and growth pact 's ceiling of three percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- . cdu calls for eichel to step down germany ’ s conservative opposition criticized eichels figures as wild guesses and accused him of disregarding a number of risks and pitfalls .
the cdu ’ s budget spokesman dietrich austerman spoke of a huge question mark behind predictions of revenues from a controversial highway toll system for trucks , which is to be introduced next year . he also pointed out that the government ’ s labor market reform would run up a bill of at least € 5 billion more than what was planned in the budget .
austerman called on the government to withdraw the budget plan and asked the finance minister to step down . " the budget 2005 epitomizes the failure of red-green budget policy , he says .
it is in violation of the constitution and the eu stability pact because it makes no attempt at consolidation .
it is entirely based on false figures and totally insufficient to boost the economy .
there are incalculable risks that should prompt the government to redo their budget and start all over again . " last week , eichel raised the forecast for this year 's budget deficit , saying declining tax income and increased spending on the unemployed would push the shortfall further beyond european union limits for a third straight year , reaching an estimated 3.7 percent of gdp in 2004 compared with a previous forecast of 3.25 percent published half a year ago . deficit reduction target gets helping hand the ultimate objective of getting the german budget deficit to below eu levels may also get a helping hand from the european commission and its proposed watering down of the hard-line pact .
brussels announced plans last week to make the pact less rigid including paying greater attention to economic developments when setting deadlines for budget cuts , taking account of whether a country 's debts are sustainable , and making greater allowances for the state of the economy . eichel welcomed the proposals drawn up by the european commission , saying the changes would help boost economic growth in europe .
" i can only welcome the proposals put forward by brussels , they 're what i 've been calling for all along , " he said . bundesbank lashes out at commission however , as eichel was addressing the bundestag on tuesday , the bundesbank was lashing out at the european commission 's proposals , arguing that the changes would weaken the stability and growth pact and lead to a worsening of monetary policy conditions in the euro area . " the bundesbank is of the opinion that the proposed changes will not strengthen but weaken the stability pact , " the german central bank said in a statement .
" that would lead to a deterioration of the conditions for monetary policy in the single currency area , " it added , indicating that if governments pursued a policy of loose purse strings in europe , the european central bank might be compelled to react by raising its key interest rates .
" healthy state finances are an important pre-condition for the ecb to guarantee price stability in the long term via relatively low interest rates , " the bundesbank said . the proposed changes " will reduce the incentive for euro zone countries to pursue solid budget policies and , at the same time , send a wrong signal to those countries that have not yet adopted the single currency " , the bank complained .

however , his budget draft contained projected privatization proceeds of some € 15 billion next year , which the government hopes will help reign in the budget deficit to back below the eu stability and growth pact 's ceiling of three percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- . cdu calls for eichel to step down germany ’ s conservative opposition criticized eichels figures as wild guesses and accused him of disregarding a number of risks and pitfalls .
the cdu ’ s budget spokesman dietrich austerman spoke of a huge question mark behind predictions of revenues from a controversial highway toll system for trucks , which is to be introduced next year . he also pointed out that the government ’ s labor market reform would run up a bill of at least € 5 billion more than what was planned in the budget .
austerman called on the government to withdraw the budget plan and asked the finance minister to step down . " the budget 2005 epitomizes the failure of red-green budget policy , he says .
it is in violation of the constitution and the eu stability pact because it makes no attempt at consolidation .
it is entirely based on false figures and totally insufficient to boost the economy .
there are incalculable risks that should prompt the government to redo their budget and start all over again . " last week , eichel raised the forecast for this year 's budget deficit , saying declining tax income and increased spending on the unemployed would push the shortfall further beyond european union limits for a third straight year , reaching an estimated 3.7 percent of gdp in 2004 compared with a previous forecast of 3.25 percent published half a year ago . deficit reduction target gets helping hand the ultimate objective of getting the german budget deficit to below eu levels may also get a helping hand from the european commission and its proposed watering down of the hard-line pact .
brussels announced plans last week to make the pact less rigid including paying greater attention to economic developments when setting deadlines for budget cuts , taking account of whether a country 's debts are sustainable , and making greater allowances for the state of the economy . eichel welcomed the proposals drawn up by the european commission , saying the changes would help boost economic growth in europe .
" i can only welcome the proposals put forward by brussels , they 're what i 've been calling for all along , " he said . bundesbank lashes out at commission however , as eichel was addressing the bundestag on tuesday , the bundesbank was lashing out at the european commission 's proposals , arguing that the changes would weaken the stability and growth pact and lead to a worsening of monetary policy conditions in the euro area . " the bundesbank is of the opinion that the proposed changes will not strengthen but weaken the stability pact , " the german central bank said in a statement .
" that would lead to a deterioration of the conditions for monetary policy in the single currency area , " it added , indicating that if governments pursued a policy of loose purse strings in europe , the european central bank might be compelled to react by raising its key interest rates .
" healthy state finances are an important pre-condition for the ecb to guarantee price stability in the long term via relatively low interest rates , " the bundesbank said . the proposed changes " will reduce the incentive for euro zone countries to pursue solid budget policies and , at the same time , send a wrong signal to those countries that have not yet adopted the single currency " , the bank complained .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 07.09.2004 stability pact plans prompt criticism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans eichel 's budget plan drew criticism from opposition parties both german finance minister hans eichel and the european commission took flak for separate stability and growth pact proposals on tuesday . germany 's beleaguered finance minister hans eichel addressed the bundestag on his 2005 federal budget proposal on tuesday and ruled out further spending cuts in the year ahead so as not to undermine the still fragile recovery in the german economy . eichel put on a brave face by telling the lower house of parliament that the german economy could at last look forward to an upturn , though the recovery was still being led by strengthening exports rather than domestic demand , which remained weak .
" our economy has turned the corner .
all forecasts indicate we will reach growth of between 1.5 and 2 percent this year , " he told the assembled members of the bundestag . the finance minister revealed proposals for € 22 billion of new debt to finance expected new investments of € 22.8 billion .
eichel also stated that total government spending would reach € 258 billion in 2005 , about € 1 billion higher than in the current year .
however , his budget draft contained projected privatization proceeds of some € 15 billion next year , which the government hopes will help reign in the budget deficit to back below the eu stability and growth pact 's ceiling of three percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- . cdu calls for eichel to step down germany ’ s conservative opposition criticized eichels figures as wild guesses and accused him of disregarding a number of risks and pitfalls .
the cdu ’ s budget spokesman dietrich austerman spoke of a huge question mark behind predictions of revenues from a controversial highway toll system for trucks , which is to be introduced next year . he also pointed out that the government ’ s labor market reform would run up a bill of at least € 5 billion more than what was planned in the budget .
austerman called on the government to withdraw the budget plan and asked the finance minister to step down . " the budget 2005 epitomizes the failure of red-green budget policy , he says .
it is in violation of the constitution and the eu stability pact because it makes no attempt at consolidation .
it is entirely based on false figures and totally insufficient to boost the economy .
there are incalculable risks that should prompt the government to redo their budget and start all over again . " last week , eichel raised the forecast for this year 's budget deficit , saying declining tax income and increased spending on the unemployed would push the shortfall further beyond european union limits for a third straight year , reaching an estimated 3.7 percent of gdp in 2004 compared with a previous forecast of 3.25 percent published half a year ago . deficit reduction target gets helping hand the ultimate objective of getting the german budget deficit to below eu levels may also get a helping hand from the european commission and its proposed watering down of the hard-line pact .
brussels announced plans last week to make the pact less rigid including paying greater attention to economic developments when setting deadlines for budget cuts , taking account of whether a country 's debts are sustainable , and making greater allowances for the state of the economy . eichel welcomed the proposals drawn up by the european commission , saying the changes would help boost economic growth in europe .
" i can only welcome the proposals put forward by brussels , they 're what i 've been calling for all along , " he said . bundesbank lashes out at commission however , as eichel was addressing the bundestag on tuesday , the bundesbank was lashing out at the european commission 's proposals , arguing that the changes would weaken the stability and growth pact and lead to a worsening of monetary policy conditions in the euro area . " the bundesbank is of the opinion that the proposed changes will not strengthen but weaken the stability pact , " the german central bank said in a statement .
" that would lead to a deterioration of the conditions for monetary policy in the single currency area , " it added , indicating that if governments pursued a policy of loose purse strings in europe , the european central bank might be compelled to react by raising its key interest rates .
" healthy state finances are an important pre-condition for the ecb to guarantee price stability in the long term via relatively low interest rates , " the bundesbank said . the proposed changes " will reduce the incentive for euro zone countries to pursue solid budget policies and , at the same time , send a wrong signal to those countries that have not yet adopted the single currency " , the bank complained .
furthermore , many of the proposals would " make the rules more complicated and complex , thereby impairing its -lrb- the pact 's -rrb- ability to be implemented , " it argued . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european commission to loosen stability pact the european commission on friday unveiled a plan to introduce more flexibility in the stability and growth pact , saying it was vital to restore the credibility of its much-flouted budget discipline rules .
-lrb- september 3 , 2004 -rrb- germany to breach eu deficit rules in 2004 german finance minister hans eichel on tuesday said berlin would breach eu deficit limits for a third consecutive year in 2004 .
the announcement comes amid speculation brussels will loosen its budget rules .

eu officials are therefore touring the country to foster a more positive profile . at a series of seminars with the media in the southern cities of bangalore and hyderabad in the past week , held at glitzy locations linked to the country 's booming film industry , eu representatives have pitched for a greater understanding of what the eu does internally , on the global stage and in india itself .
they have had to start with basics by explaining the role taken by the executive european commission in initiating and policing eu legislation and the commission 's often troublesome interplay with the member states .
the distinction is important as in some areas of vital interest to india , notably trade ; the commission is the eu 's voice in international negotiations .
yet in others , such as foreign policy , the commission is powerless with the member states making the running . journalists drawn from southern india confessed to finding the details sometimes baffling and said the eu still has much work to do to establish its relevance to india beyond the trade front .
ordinary indians should be the target audience " the eu needs to do much more to raise public awareness among ordinary indians , by publicizing their important aid work and holding cultural events , " k.n. tilak kumar , chairman of the regional deccan herald newspaper group , told afp .
delegates at the seminars said eu-organized film events showcasing the best of contemporary european cinema had been big hits with indian audiences more used to a solid diet of bollywood fantasy interspersed with hollywood blockbusters .
" if they want the eu to be known here , they have to make news in india , " kumar added .
in-fighting creates a bad image the eu has been making headlines in the indian press , but for all the wrong reasons .
well-publicized rows among member states , such as over iraq , have undermined attempts by the bloc to portray itself as a big player on the world stage .
" you have to have a policy on iraq , the most important foreign policy issue of the day .
having a policy on some things and a non-policy on others is no way of carrying on , " said kumar .
caught at the sharp end are the under-resourced diplomats tasked with flying the eu 's blue starred flag abroad .
drawn from the commission 's external relations department , their work is largely confined to trade negotiations and overseeing aid projects .
for the staff of the new delhi embassy , that work is hugely important given india 's pivotal role as a leader of developing nations at the world trade organization and its status as a sizeable recipient of eu development funds .
they are also keen to promote the eu 's experience in conflict settlement , no small concern here given india 's intractable dispute with pakistan over kashmir . eu funding has made visible differences the € 100 million -lrb- $ 120 million -rrb- of eu grant aid spent annually in india is spread far and wide .
in the slums of mysore near bangalore , an eu-funded project has brought schooling , immunization and basic sanitation to communities where literacy was just 10 percent five years ago and easily preventable diseases were rife , according to the non-governmental organization overseeing the work .
but as eu officials freely admit , such work does not get much publicity in the local press , hence the seminars .
" the eu has an obligation still to explain that it is more than a fortress , the horrifying force behind the wto wanting to take over india .
we need to counter that with an alternative viewpoint , " said robert aarsse , first secretary at the dutch embassy in delhi , whose country holds the bloc 's rotating presidency .
" one thing we stress is that we are multilateral , whereas the us is unilateral .
we want to show india that we are a partner to work with , " he added .
proposed strategic partnership to be discussed at the highest levels of government , the two sides are already well engaged .
ministerial meetings are held regularly , and next month will see the fifth annual eu-india summit , in the dutch capital the hague .
in preparation for the summit , the european commission in june unveiled a new set of proposals designed to entrench a fledgling " strategic partnership " with india .
but for rajendra jain , professor of european studies at delhi 's jawaharlal nehru university , india still prefers to deal one-to-one with the big eu nations such as britain and france , and is " obsessed " by its relations with the united states .
" the indian elite thinks the eu is just not credible as a foreign policy actor , so the eu is not taken seriously , " jain said .
" and in india , the leading eu nations like britain often have their own agendas to promote , so they 're disinclined to give the eu a profile of its own . "
still , if nothing else the eu has covered itself in a sprinkling of glamour by organizing the seminars at a bangalore resort hotel owned by bollywood star sanjay khan and at southern india 's largest film studios outside hyderabad .
it must now hope the stardust translates into more upbeat press coverage . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : fischer finds few backers for un seat german foreign minister joschka fischer wrapped up his 10-day trip to asia on friday .

bolivia hopes to do things differently .
centuries of exporting mineral resources and more recently oil and gas have failed to lift bolivia 's 8.7 million people out of poverty .
two thirds of its population , which is largely aymara or quechua indian in origin , remain poor .
" the exploitation of natural resources -lsb- has not -rsb- led to bolivia 's industrialisation , or even to the development of a national middle class , " says viktor de los heros , president of bolivia 's national chamber of commerce .
but that could change .
in july this year , bolivians voted in a controversial referendum to combine higher taxes on foreign energy firms operating in bolivia with a sharp increase in the country 's gas exports .
" we are in a new century .
bolivians are demanding a new approach " to how the country 's natural gas reserves , the second largest in south america , should be managed , says mr heros .
responsibility increasingly , the government , the ever more important opposition party movement for socialism -lrb- mas -rrb- and the national chamber of commerce are all urging firms to become " socially responsible " .
they want the country 's oil , gas and mineral exports to benefit low-income bolivians through increased investments in social services , in job creation and in basic infrastructure such as heating and lighting .
" foreign investors have a right to make a profit .
they risk their money investing , " says gerardo velasco , a member of the chamber of commerce .
" but they also have a responsibility to the bolivian society . "
jobs the pressure placed on inward investors is beginning to work .
coeur d 'alene , the us 's largest silver producer , recently announced plans to invest $ 105m in a silver and tin mining operation near bolivia 's historic mining town of potosi , south of the capital , la paz .
the spaniards started mining near potosi in 1545 and kept the mines working there throughout spain 's 300-year empire .
the size of coeur d 'alene 's investment shows how rich the area 's mineral seams still are .
" it will be the biggest silver mining operation of the company overseas , " says bob martinez , coeur d 'alene 's president .
at first glance there is little difference between the coeur d 'alene operation and traditional investments .
raw materials are exported and most of the silver refining will be done abroad .
but as part of the investment package the company will not only create 1,000 mining jobs , but establish a foundation to help generate alternative employment in local industries , in tourism and in a potosi city silversmith .
pipeline another " socially responsible " project , says the chamber of commerce , are plans to build a gas pipeline from the landlocked country through peru to the pacific for exports to mexico and california .
it is supported both by president mesa 's government and the opposition .
the pipeline would make it possible to connect 250,000 homes of poor subsistence farmers in the western highlands and reduce their dependence on primitive forms of fuel , says jorge alvarado , mas deputy in the bolivian congress .
building it would also generate many jobs , and as a large section of the pipeline would pass through the country , bolivia could hope for royalty payments as well .
plans for an alternative route - from bolivia through to ports in chile - are much less popular .
it would generate fewer jobs and royalties .
but land-locked bolivians also harbour a deep-seated grudge against chile stemming from a war in 1879 over valuable nitrate deposits .
bolivia was defeated and lost its ports on the pacific .
news that the gas pipeline might go through chile sparked last october 's riots , which toppled the government .
dozens died in the unrest .
licenses bolivian reformers are also eager for the country to move up the technological ladder .
they want to use the gas reserves to create more value-added products both for export and the domestic market .
to this effect , the texan energy firm sasol synfuels international could license its gas-to-liquids technology to state-owned gas and oil company yacimientos petroliferos fiscales bolivianos -lrb- ypfb -rrb- .
the technology liquefies methane , which makes up 90 % of bolivia 's gas .
it also occupies less space than traditional liquid gas plants , which in turn means it could be built in remote areas , for instance in tarija near the source of bolivia 's gas , rather than at a terminal on the pacific coast .
" the gas can be blended with crude oil to replace the lead in petrol , greatly reducing car exhaust fumes , " says ben weber , synfuels president .
it could also be used to replace oil and coal in electricity power plants , or in petrochemical plants which manufacture plastics and fertilisers .
exports other gas export agreements with neighbouring countries could also help bolivia 's plans for industrialisation .
under a 10-year agreement with argentina , a 1,000 mile long pipeline will be built by 2007 , at a cost of $ 1bn .
in addition , argentina will finance a liquefied gas plant in tarija .
once completed , bolivia should earn an extra $ 500m from its gas exports to argentina .
similarly , brazil , which already imports gas from bolivia through an existing pipeline , will build a petrochemical complex and a gas fired electricity plant near the bolivian border town of puerto suarez .
but the country 's infrastructure is under-developed and there are not enough skilled workers .
president mesa 's government and the opposition hope to tackle shortcomings through royalties and higher taxes on the gas and oil sector - although they disagree on how much to take .
bolivia 's industrialisation will take some doing .

the hope is that bolivia 's young will not have to grow up in poverty coeur d 'alene , the us 's largest silver producer , recently announced plans to invest $ 105m in a silver and tin mining operation near bolivia 's historic mining town of potosi , south of the capital , la paz .
the spaniards started mining near potosi in 1545 and kept the mines working there throughout spain 's 300-year empire .
the size of coeur d 'alene 's investment shows how rich the area 's mineral seams still are .
" it will be the biggest silver mining operation of the company overseas , " says bob martinez , coeur d 'alene 's president .
at first glance there is little difference between the coeur d 'alene operation and traditional investments .
raw materials are exported and most of the silver refining will be done abroad .
but as part of the investment package the company will not only create 1,000 mining jobs , but establish a foundation to help generate alternative employment in local industries , in tourism and in a potosi city silversmith .
pipeline another " socially responsible " project , says the chamber of commerce , are plans to build a gas pipeline from the landlocked country through peru to the pacific for exports to mexico and california .
it is supported both by president mesa 's government and the opposition .
the pipeline would make it possible to connect 250,000 homes of poor subsistence farmers in the western highlands and reduce their dependence on primitive forms of fuel , says jorge alvarado , mas deputy in the bolivian congress .
building it would also generate many jobs , and as a large section of the pipeline would pass through the country , bolivia could hope for royalty payments as well .
plans for an alternative route - from bolivia through to ports in chile - are much less popular .
it would generate fewer jobs and royalties .
but land-locked bolivians also harbour a deep-seated grudge against chile stemming from a war in 1879 over valuable nitrate deposits .
bolivia was defeated and lost its ports on the pacific .
news that the gas pipeline might go through chile sparked last october 's riots , which toppled the government .
dozens died in the unrest .
licenses bolivian reformers are also eager for the country to move up the technological ladder .
they want to use the gas reserves to create more value-added products both for export and the domestic market .
to this effect , the texan energy firm sasol synfuels international could license its gas-to-liquids technology to state-owned gas and oil company yacimientos petroliferos fiscales bolivianos -lrb- ypfb -rrb- .
the technology liquefies methane , which makes up 90 % of bolivia 's gas .
it also occupies less space than traditional liquid gas plants , which in turn means it could be built in remote areas , for instance in tarija near the source of bolivia 's gas , rather than at a terminal on the pacific coast .
" the gas can be blended with crude oil to replace the lead in petrol , greatly reducing car exhaust fumes , " says ben weber , synfuels president .
it could also be used to replace oil and coal in electricity power plants , or in petrochemical plants which manufacture plastics and fertilisers .
exports other gas export agreements with neighbouring countries could also help bolivia 's plans for industrialisation .
under a 10-year agreement with argentina , a 1,000 mile long pipeline will be built by 2007 , at a cost of $ 1bn .
in addition , argentina will finance a liquefied gas plant in tarija .
once completed , bolivia should earn an extra $ 500m from its gas exports to argentina .
similarly , brazil , which already imports gas from bolivia through an existing pipeline , will build a petrochemical complex and a gas fired electricity plant near the bolivian border town of puerto suarez .
but the country 's infrastructure is under-developed and there are not enough skilled workers .
president mesa 's government and the opposition hope to tackle shortcomings through royalties and higher taxes on the gas and oil sector - although they disagree on how much to take .
bolivia 's industrialisation will take some doing .

for industrialised oil-consuming countries , sudden price surges of this kind are bad news .
they take money out of the pockets of businesses and consumers that would otherwise be spent on creating jobs or buying goods , acting as a brake on economic growth .

investment banks and hedge funds have been doing just that over the past three months .
indeed , oil producers ' cartel opec - and many independent analysts - believe heavy speculative trading by big financial institutions has itself contributed to the latest jump in prices .
but making money from oil is no longer the sole preserve of wall street giants .
public demand last year 's surge in oil prices during the run-up to the iraq war created strong demand for financial instruments which would allow private individuals to profit from oil price rallies .
several banks have responded with a range of derivative products such as warrants , which give investors the right to buy oil at a pre-determined price at some point in the future .
it 's easy to place a bet , but it 's just as easy to lose a great deal of money alpesh patel , private investor but the spread bet has this year emerged as by far the most popular means for private individuals to join in the oil trading bonanza .
will armitage at london-based spread-betting firm ig index says the number of oil transactions the firm handles has gone up " hugely " in recent months .
" our customers are drawn towards volatility , and nothing has been as volatile as oil this year , " he said .
so how do spread bets on oil work ?
in a typical scenario , the spread betting firm will tell the investor that it expects the oil price to fluctuate within a range , or spread , for the foreseeable future .
the investor can bet either that the price will rise above that range , or that it will fall below it .
in either case , if he is proved correct , he wins back his stake for every cent by which the oil price breaks out of the quoted range .
for instance , if an investor bets £ 2 that the price will rise above a quoted range of $ 40.80 - $ 40.90 a barrel , and it then jumps to $ 40.95 , he stands to win £ 10 .
roller coaster spread bets therefore offer high returns to those who call the market correctly , and also have the great advantage of being easy to place .
alpesh patel : betting on a fall all it takes is an account with a spread betting firm , and a two-minute phone call .
crucially , they also allow investors to bet on a fall as well as a rise in prices - a highly useful feature in the rapidly changing oil market .
but the catch is that spread betting is particularly unforgiving to those who bet the wrong way .
the investor who calls the market incorrectly must pay the spread-betting firm his stake for each cent by which the price misses the upper or lower end of the range .
in the example above , if instead of rising , the oil price fell to $ 40.75 , the unlucky punter would lose £ 30 .
unlike the conventional gambler , therefore , the spread better runs the risk of losing not just his original outlay , but many multiples of it .
experienced investors also warn that because oil prices tend to be highly volatile , the unwary spread better can watch hefty profits turn into massive losses in a matter of minutes .
playing safe " it 's easy to place a bet , but it 's just as easy to lose a great deal of money , " said alpesh patel , a london-based private investor who has recently been betting that oil prices will fall .
mr patel says anyone contemplating a spread bet on oil must first understand historical oil price trends , and even then , should place only a moderate stake .
" the price can go against you , and it can go against you for a long time .
you need to be quite clear about why you 're placing a bet in the first place , " he said .
luckily , there is a safer alternative for would-be oil investors who lack the nerves of steel required for spread betting .

investment banks and hedge funds have been doing just that over the past three months .
indeed , oil producers ' cartel opec - and many independent analysts - believe heavy speculative trading by big financial institutions has itself contributed to the latest jump in prices .
but making money from oil is no longer the sole preserve of wall street giants .
public demand last year 's surge in oil prices during the run-up to the iraq war created strong demand for financial instruments which would allow private individuals to profit from oil price rallies .
several banks have responded with a range of derivative products such as warrants , which give investors the right to buy oil at a pre-determined price at some point in the future .
it 's easy to place a bet , but it 's just as easy to lose a great deal of money alpesh patel , private investor but the spread bet has this year emerged as by far the most popular means for private individuals to join in the oil trading bonanza .
will armitage at london-based spread-betting firm ig index says the number of oil transactions the firm handles has gone up " hugely " in recent months .
" our customers are drawn towards volatility , and nothing has been as volatile as oil this year , " he said .
so how do spread bets on oil work ?
in a typical scenario , the spread betting firm will tell the investor that it expects the oil price to fluctuate within a range , or spread , for the foreseeable future .
the investor can bet either that the price will rise above that range , or that it will fall below it .
in either case , if he is proved correct , he wins back his stake for every cent by which the oil price breaks out of the quoted range .
for instance , if an investor bets £ 2 that the price will rise above a quoted range of $ 40.80 - $ 40.90 a barrel , and it then jumps to $ 40.95 , he stands to win £ 10 .
roller coaster spread bets therefore offer high returns to those who call the market correctly , and also have the great advantage of being easy to place .
alpesh patel : betting on a fall all it takes is an account with a spread betting firm , and a two-minute phone call .
crucially , they also allow investors to bet on a fall as well as a rise in prices - a highly useful feature in the rapidly changing oil market .
but the catch is that spread betting is particularly unforgiving to those who bet the wrong way .
the investor who calls the market incorrectly must pay the spread-betting firm his stake for each cent by which the price misses the upper or lower end of the range .
in the example above , if instead of rising , the oil price fell to $ 40.75 , the unlucky punter would lose £ 30 .
unlike the conventional gambler , therefore , the spread better runs the risk of losing not just his original outlay , but many multiples of it .
experienced investors also warn that because oil prices tend to be highly volatile , the unwary spread better can watch hefty profits turn into massive losses in a matter of minutes .
playing safe " it 's easy to place a bet , but it 's just as easy to lose a great deal of money , " said alpesh patel , a london-based private investor who has recently been betting that oil prices will fall .
mr patel says anyone contemplating a spread bet on oil must first understand historical oil price trends , and even then , should place only a moderate stake .
" the price can go against you , and it can go against you for a long time .
you need to be quite clear about why you 're placing a bet in the first place , " he said .
luckily , there is a safer alternative for would-be oil investors who lack the nerves of steel required for spread betting .
oil price rallies are generally accompanied by steady gains in oil company stocks , and this one is no exception .

hurricane ivan is moving towards barbados , st vincent , st lucia , trinidad and tobago , grenada and martinique , us officials said .
the warnings came as hurricane frances threatened florida once again .
the storm was blamed for at least three deaths and the loss of power for six million people when it hit on sunday .
it returned , into the florida panhandle in the north of the state , on monday .
forecasters warned it could bring up to 10 inches -lrb- 25cm -rrb- of rain .

the wfp had appealed last month for $ 74m from donor countries .
but a wfp representative in dhaka told the bbc there had been a very poor response to the request .
more than 600 people died in the floods , which destroyed rice crops leaving 20 million people likely to be dependent on food aid for months .
the wfp says it wants to provide food aid to flood victims in return for repairing roads , dykes and embankments in a long-term strategy that would help protect them from the next disaster .
douglas casson coutts , the wfp representative in dhaka , says many donor countries assumed that the receding waters meant the problem was over .
" it 's frustrating , i think , that we obviously have had difficulties to get the world community to focus specifically on the situation here , " he told the bbc .
hampered the wfp says that with the flood victims leaving the emergency shelters , they need assistance not only to restore their households but also to acquire skills and assets that will arm them against the next disaster .
but without more funds coming in , it will be force to curtail its plans .
" if we do n't have enough money , we will do what we can with our limited funds we have available so far .
" but it will be much less than we had originally planned for , " mr coutts said .
the bangladeshi minister of food and disaster management , chowdhury kamal ibne yusuf , told the bbc that there was sufficient financial support to fulfil the government 's promise to feed five million families .
last month , the un urged the international community to offer more aid to help the flood victims in bangladesh .
