program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.08.2004 german news auf englisch großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerd still prefers his news auf deutsch costly and complicated , running a foreign language editorial operation is not an easy thing to do .
but that 's not stopping a growing number of german publications from experimenting with english-language news products . as germany 's state-backed international broadcaster , deutsche welle 's mandate is to provide unbiased news and information to people who may not necessarily understand german .
funded by german taxpayers , dw-world is able to compete in the rough-and-tumble world of english-speaking media . germany 's private print media do n't have that security or mandate , but that 's not stopping several publications - tempted by the chance to reach a wider audience - from exploring different ways to tap into the english market . the country 's leading weekly newsmagazine , der spiegel , has decided to become the latest to enter the fray , offering an english e-mail newsletter starting this autumn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first issue of der spiegel was published january 4 , 1947 . " we want to expand the spiegel brand to the english market .
there are a lot of people there that are aware of the magazine but they unfortunately ca n't read it , " spiegel online editor-in-chief mathias müller von blumencron told dw-world . managing news operations in foreign languages can be notoriously difficult , which is why spiegel is starting with a small team of three english-language editors who will work with the magazine 's online edition .
that way if the project does n't work out , the financial downside will be limited . the berliner zeitung newspaper last month quoted spiegel publisher fried von bismarck as saying the initial investment in the project would be limited to around half a million euros .
von blumencron said the daily newsletter would predominately have specialized original content , complemented by translated spiegel articles .
he expects the service to launch in october . a niche market ? horst röper , director of the dortmund-based formatt media institute , said despite spiegel 's top-drawer reputation , moving into the english media world was not without risk .
" it can certainly be successful , so long as one does n't have large expectations , " he said .
" generally foreign language products are niche products for niche markets . " spiegel is just the latest prestigious german publication to hop on the english bandwagon .

there are a lot of people there that are aware of the magazine but they unfortunately ca n't read it , " spiegel online editor-in-chief mathias müller von blumencron told dw-world . managing news operations in foreign languages can be notoriously difficult , which is why spiegel is starting with a small team of three english-language editors who will work with the magazine 's online edition .
that way if the project does n't work out , the financial downside will be limited . the berliner zeitung newspaper last month quoted spiegel publisher fried von bismarck as saying the initial investment in the project would be limited to around half a million euros .
von blumencron said the daily newsletter would predominately have specialized original content , complemented by translated spiegel articles .
he expects the service to launch in october . a niche market ? horst röper , director of the dortmund-based formatt media institute , said despite spiegel 's top-drawer reputation , moving into the english media world was not without risk .

so the süddeutsche is focusing on germans who read english and the faz is catering to english-speakers who want to read about germany . " we are targeting different groups - we are focused mainly on international travellers , " anke bryson , faz weekly 's executive editor , told dw-world .
she said her staff of full-time journalists wrote predominately original content for the iht , with about a third of the supplement coming from translated faz articles . scaled back , or worse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you mean i have to write this twice ?
but the faz 's foray into english publishing has n't always been a smooth ride .
the english editorial staff has been cut dramatically since its launch in 2000 .
in 2002 , the paper ceased publication of its daily english edition and instead launched a new weekly publication . other attempts have fared even worse .
die welt newspaper , backed by the powerful axel springer publishing group , folded its english language offering entirely a few years ago . with that in mind , von blumencron has no illusions that spiegel 's effort will be easy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 03.08.2004 sudan irked by un resolution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudan 's foreign minister called the resolution 's deadline " illogical " sudanese government officials are unhappy with the un resolution calling on it to do more to solve the problems of its darfur region .
a military official went so far as to describe it as a " declaration of war . " government officials in khartoum said they can not meet the 30-day deadline set by the united nations to disarm the janjaweed militias who are accused of a campaign of murder and rape against the people of sudan 's southwestern darfur region .
the militia members are alleged to enjoy government support as part of their battle against rebels in the region . sudan 's foreign minister , mustafa osman ismail , described the deadline as " illogical " and said sudan would implement a 90-day program agreed earlier with the un secretary-general , kofi annan . he said the new urgency required by the west could be linked to " elections taking place in some western countries " or to its " guilty conscience over failing to prevent the 1994 genocide in rwanda . " other sudanese officials have been even more outspoken .
the army spokesman , mohammed bashir suleiman , described the motion as an " american declaration of war " and said the sudanese army was prepared to confront the enemies of sudan on land , sea and air . easing or worsening the conflict ? adam thaim , spokesman for the african union , said he had some understanding for the sudanese annoyance .
he added that the resolution came at a sensitive time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudanese displaced woman line up to receive " the pressure on the sudanese government was beginning to work , " he said .
" the sudanese government is fully aware of the risk of a bigger humanitarian tragedy in darfur .
the conflict is not really escalating , the conflict is instead easing and it is in this meantime that the un resolution came out so i can understand - without justifying - the position of the government of sudan . " but there is a feeling in europe and the us that the sudanese government is once more trying to avoid its international obligations . a spokesman for the us state department , adam ereli , said that there was no excuse for not taking action now . the resolution was not a declaration of war , he said , but simply a demand that sudan fulfil commitments it has already made to disarm the militias . germany responds to criticism german deputy foreign minister kerstin müller meanwhile defended her country 's position in the conflict in an open letter to the editor of the wa shington post on monday .
the us paper had criticized european countries in a previous editorial for not doing enough to resolve the problem .
müller countered that germany first introduced discussions about the darfur conflict to the un security council during the country 's presidency of that body in april .
she added that the eu has pledged more than $ 260 million -lrb- € 216 million -rrb- to help refugees and that germany also has earmarked more than $ 105 million for the reconstruction of sudan after a peace agreement is signed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kerstin müller müller -lrb- photo -rrb- described the resolution as an important step in helping to resolve the conflict .
" germany will do whatever is in its power to stop the violations of human rights in sudan and to solve the humanitarian crisis and the political conflict in darfur and elsewhere in that country , " müller wrote .
" it will support all efforts to find a political solution to the underlying problems .
this also would be an important contribution to our common fight against terrorism . "
a long term strategy needed thaim of the african union also argued that there 's a need for a long term strategy . " the disarmament of janjaweed militias , the investigation into human rights violations , are conditions to peace , but they are not the only conditions to peace , " thaim said .
" the darfur problem is more complex than that .
you have land issues , you have sociological issues , you have religious issues .
it 's very complicated and i think that what we should go towards is political dialogues for darfur . " thaim added that the african union had started such a dialogue , but said that talks were regrettably suspended because the rebels were being inflexible . un food program needs more money meanwhile , the united nations world food program has begun dropping aid to isolated areas of darfur from the air , as a response to the lack of security on the ground and the beginning of the rainy season . but it said that it has received only half the funds it needs for emergency work in darfur this year .
about 2.2 million people are thought to be in need of food , medicine and other basics . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : an impotent international community the un security council on friday gave sudan 30 days to stop the genocide in darfur without threatening the government with sanctions for non-compliance .

a military official went so far as to describe it as a " declaration of war . " government officials in khartoum said they can not meet the 30-day deadline set by the united nations to disarm the janjaweed militias who are accused of a campaign of murder and rape against the people of sudan 's southwestern darfur region .
the militia members are alleged to enjoy government support as part of their battle against rebels in the region . sudan 's foreign minister , mustafa osman ismail , described the deadline as " illogical " and said sudan would implement a 90-day program agreed earlier with the un secretary-general , kofi annan . he said the new urgency required by the west could be linked to " elections taking place in some western countries " or to its " guilty conscience over failing to prevent the 1994 genocide in rwanda . " other sudanese officials have been even more outspoken .
the army spokesman , mohammed bashir suleiman , described the motion as an " american declaration of war " and said the sudanese army was prepared to confront the enemies of sudan on land , sea and air . easing or worsening the conflict ? adam thaim , spokesman for the african union , said he had some understanding for the sudanese annoyance .
he added that the resolution came at a sensitive time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudanese displaced woman line up to receive " the pressure on the sudanese government was beginning to work , " he said .
" the sudanese government is fully aware of the risk of a bigger humanitarian tragedy in darfur .
the conflict is not really escalating , the conflict is instead easing and it is in this meantime that the un resolution came out so i can understand - without justifying - the position of the government of sudan . " but there is a feeling in europe and the us that the sudanese government is once more trying to avoid its international obligations . a spokesman for the us state department , adam ereli , said that there was no excuse for not taking action now . the resolution was not a declaration of war , he said , but simply a demand that sudan fulfil commitments it has already made to disarm the militias . germany responds to criticism german deputy foreign minister kerstin müller meanwhile defended her country 's position in the conflict in an open letter to the editor of the wa shington post on monday .
the us paper had criticized european countries in a previous editorial for not doing enough to resolve the problem .
müller countered that germany first introduced discussions about the darfur conflict to the un security council during the country 's presidency of that body in april .
she added that the eu has pledged more than $ 260 million -lrb- € 216 million -rrb- to help refugees and that germany also has earmarked more than $ 105 million for the reconstruction of sudan after a peace agreement is signed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kerstin müller müller -lrb- photo -rrb- described the resolution as an important step in helping to resolve the conflict .
" germany will do whatever is in its power to stop the violations of human rights in sudan and to solve the humanitarian crisis and the political conflict in darfur and elsewhere in that country , " müller wrote .
" it will support all efforts to find a political solution to the underlying problems .
this also would be an important contribution to our common fight against terrorism . "
a long term strategy needed thaim of the african union also argued that there 's a need for a long term strategy . " the disarmament of janjaweed militias , the investigation into human rights violations , are conditions to peace , but they are not the only conditions to peace , " thaim said .
" the darfur problem is more complex than that .
you have land issues , you have sociological issues , you have religious issues .
it 's very complicated and i think that what we should go towards is political dialogues for darfur . " thaim added that the african union had started such a dialogue , but said that talks were regrettably suspended because the rebels were being inflexible . un food program needs more money meanwhile , the united nations world food program has begun dropping aid to isolated areas of darfur from the air , as a response to the lack of security on the ground and the beginning of the rainy season . but it said that it has received only half the funds it needs for emergency work in darfur this year .

the militia members are alleged to enjoy government support as part of their battle against rebels in the region . sudan 's foreign minister , mustafa osman ismail , described the deadline as " illogical " and said sudan would implement a 90-day program agreed earlier with the un secretary-general , kofi annan . he said the new urgency required by the west could be linked to " elections taking place in some western countries " or to its " guilty conscience over failing to prevent the 1994 genocide in rwanda . " other sudanese officials have been even more outspoken .
the army spokesman , mohammed bashir suleiman , described the motion as an " american declaration of war " and said the sudanese army was prepared to confront the enemies of sudan on land , sea and air . easing or worsening the conflict ? adam thaim , spokesman for the african union , said he had some understanding for the sudanese annoyance .
he added that the resolution came at a sensitive time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudanese displaced woman line up to receive " the pressure on the sudanese government was beginning to work , " he said .
" the sudanese government is fully aware of the risk of a bigger humanitarian tragedy in darfur .
the conflict is not really escalating , the conflict is instead easing and it is in this meantime that the un resolution came out so i can understand - without justifying - the position of the government of sudan . " but there is a feeling in europe and the us that the sudanese government is once more trying to avoid its international obligations . a spokesman for the us state department , adam ereli , said that there was no excuse for not taking action now . the resolution was not a declaration of war , he said , but simply a demand that sudan fulfil commitments it has already made to disarm the militias . germany responds to criticism german deputy foreign minister kerstin müller meanwhile defended her country 's position in the conflict in an open letter to the editor of the wa shington post on monday .
the us paper had criticized european countries in a previous editorial for not doing enough to resolve the problem .
müller countered that germany first introduced discussions about the darfur conflict to the un security council during the country 's presidency of that body in april .
she added that the eu has pledged more than $ 260 million -lrb- € 216 million -rrb- to help refugees and that germany also has earmarked more than $ 105 million for the reconstruction of sudan after a peace agreement is signed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kerstin müller müller -lrb- photo -rrb- described the resolution as an important step in helping to resolve the conflict .
" germany will do whatever is in its power to stop the violations of human rights in sudan and to solve the humanitarian crisis and the political conflict in darfur and elsewhere in that country , " müller wrote .
" it will support all efforts to find a political solution to the underlying problems .
this also would be an important contribution to our common fight against terrorism . "
a long term strategy needed thaim of the african union also argued that there 's a need for a long term strategy . " the disarmament of janjaweed militias , the investigation into human rights violations , are conditions to peace , but they are not the only conditions to peace , " thaim said .
" the darfur problem is more complex than that .
you have land issues , you have sociological issues , you have religious issues .
it 's very complicated and i think that what we should go towards is political dialogues for darfur . " thaim added that the african union had started such a dialogue , but said that talks were regrettably suspended because the rebels were being inflexible . un food program needs more money meanwhile , the united nations world food program has begun dropping aid to isolated areas of darfur from the air , as a response to the lack of security on the ground and the beginning of the rainy season . but it said that it has received only half the funds it needs for emergency work in darfur this year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 03.08.2004 terror suspect lawyers to seek case dismissal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq 's 15-year sentence was thrown out in march lawyers for the only man convicted over the sept .
11 attacks in the us said tuesday they will call for the case against him to be thrown out when he returns to trial next week . one of the attorneys for moroccan student mounir el motassadeq , josef grässle-münscher , told afp newsagency that he would argue that key witnesses in us custody had been tortured , making their testimony inadmissible in court . motassadeq , 30 , was sentenced in february 2003 to 15 years in prison for his involvement in the so-called hamburg cell around mohammad atta which produced three of the 19 hijackers who attacked new york and washington . but a federal tribunal quashed the conviction in march and sent the case back to the hamburg court that originally sentenced him , citing the absence of potentially crucial testimony by the hamburg mastermind behind the plot , ramzi binalshibh . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramzi binalshibh binalshibh -lrb- photo -rrb- , a yemeni national , is currently being held by us authorities in an undisclosed location . fair trial no longer possible ? grässle-münscher said he would argue that even if the united states now agreed to provide detailed information secured during the interrogation of binalshibh , it would be legally tainted . " a fair trial is no longer possible because the important evidence is either lacking or contaminated , " grässle-münscher said , referring to rumors that binalshibh had been tortured since he was handed over to the us authorities after his arrest in pakistan in september 2002 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq during his trial in february 2003 the hamburg court had found motassadeq guilty of membership in a terrorist organization and more than 3,000 counts of accessory to murder based on the logistical help he allegedly provided to the hijackers . after the federal tribunal rejected that judgment in the spring , motassadeq was released from prison .
his new trial is scheduled to start on august 10 and last until early 2005 . prosecution is confident britain 's observer newspaper reported last month that concerns surrounding the alleged torture of the key witnesses could force german prosecutors to abandon the retrial of motassadeq , because under german law courts can not accept evidence if it is thought to come under duress or torture . a senior german intelligence official reportedly told the observer that the inability to prove the testimony was admissible would make it worthless . " they contain no details as to where binalshibh was questioned , nor whether torture or other forms of force were used to make them talk , " the official said , saying german courts would be extremely tough after the abu ghraib prison torture scandal in iraq . but germany 's federal prosecutor said friday he was confident he could get a fresh conviction against motassadeq because he believed us authorities would now cooperate in supplying testimony from binalshibh . the us justice department had previously refused to provide detailed intelligence from terror suspects in its custody , citing national security concerns . will key witnesses testify ? grässle-münscher said he would insist binalshibh and all other alleged operatives from the al-qaeda network relevant to the case testify personally , a request already rejected by us authorities . " it would only be acceptable for us if these witnesses appear in court , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdelghani mzoudi -lrb- left -rrb- smiles besides his attorney guel pinar after his acquittal in february binalshibh has reportedly told his interrogators that motassadeq and a fellow moroccan who was acquitted in hamburg in february , abdelghani mzoudi -lrb- photo -rrb- , had nothing to do with the conspiracy to attack us targets . grässle-münscher said that even if binalshibh 's potentially favorable testimony is judged inadmissible by the court , it should still find his client not guilty . " if a defendant is forced to give up evidence because torture is used , the court can not hold that against him , " he said . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de prosecutors seen dropping charges against 9/11 suspect the most serious charges facing the only person ever to be convicted for the sept .

11 attacks in the us said tuesday they will call for the case against him to be thrown out when he returns to trial next week . one of the attorneys for moroccan student mounir el motassadeq , josef grässle-münscher , told afp newsagency that he would argue that key witnesses in us custody had been tortured , making their testimony inadmissible in court . motassadeq , 30 , was sentenced in february 2003 to 15 years in prison for his involvement in the so-called hamburg cell around mohammad atta which produced three of the 19 hijackers who attacked new york and washington . but a federal tribunal quashed the conviction in march and sent the case back to the hamburg court that originally sentenced him , citing the absence of potentially crucial testimony by the hamburg mastermind behind the plot , ramzi binalshibh . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramzi binalshibh binalshibh -lrb- photo -rrb- , a yemeni national , is currently being held by us authorities in an undisclosed location . fair trial no longer possible ? grässle-münscher said he would argue that even if the united states now agreed to provide detailed information secured during the interrogation of binalshibh , it would be legally tainted . " a fair trial is no longer possible because the important evidence is either lacking or contaminated , " grässle-münscher said , referring to rumors that binalshibh had been tortured since he was handed over to the us authorities after his arrest in pakistan in september 2002 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq during his trial in february 2003 the hamburg court had found motassadeq guilty of membership in a terrorist organization and more than 3,000 counts of accessory to murder based on the logistical help he allegedly provided to the hijackers . after the federal tribunal rejected that judgment in the spring , motassadeq was released from prison .
his new trial is scheduled to start on august 10 and last until early 2005 . prosecution is confident britain 's observer newspaper reported last month that concerns surrounding the alleged torture of the key witnesses could force german prosecutors to abandon the retrial of motassadeq , because under german law courts can not accept evidence if it is thought to come under duress or torture . a senior german intelligence official reportedly told the observer that the inability to prove the testimony was admissible would make it worthless . " they contain no details as to where binalshibh was questioned , nor whether torture or other forms of force were used to make them talk , " the official said , saying german courts would be extremely tough after the abu ghraib prison torture scandal in iraq . but germany 's federal prosecutor said friday he was confident he could get a fresh conviction against motassadeq because he believed us authorities would now cooperate in supplying testimony from binalshibh . the us justice department had previously refused to provide detailed intelligence from terror suspects in its custody , citing national security concerns . will key witnesses testify ? grässle-münscher said he would insist binalshibh and all other alleged operatives from the al-qaeda network relevant to the case testify personally , a request already rejected by us authorities . " it would only be acceptable for us if these witnesses appear in court , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdelghani mzoudi -lrb- left -rrb- smiles besides his attorney guel pinar after his acquittal in february binalshibh has reportedly told his interrogators that motassadeq and a fellow moroccan who was acquitted in hamburg in february , abdelghani mzoudi -lrb- photo -rrb- , had nothing to do with the conspiracy to attack us targets . grässle-münscher said that even if binalshibh 's potentially favorable testimony is judged inadmissible by the court , it should still find his client not guilty . " if a defendant is forced to give up evidence because torture is used , the court can not hold that against him , " he said . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de prosecutors seen dropping charges against 9/11 suspect the most serious charges facing the only person ever to be convicted for the sept .

" certain documents can be released without kohl 's consent , " said marianne birthler , adding that her agency was preparing publication of the files .
the court had ruled in june that kohl 's filed could not be released and that access to other filed for researchers and journalists had to be severely limited .
birthler said that in her opinion , the fight over the kohl files arose because some hope to garner evidence about kohl 's role in a bribery scandal involving his christian democratic union party .
she said that such information could not be released anyway , as the files are only released to give people insight into the workings of the stasi ministry .
she added that most requests to see the files still come from private individuals who want to see any documents the stasi collected about them . dw-world.de court hands partial victory to kohl in stasi case a german appeals court has ruled to impose major restrictions on the release and publication of information from the stasi files of former chancellor helmut kohl .

11 attacks in the us said tuesday they will call for the case against him to be thrown out when he returns to trial next week . one of the attorneys for moroccan student mounir el motassadeq , josef grässle-münscher , told afp newsagency that he would argue that key witnesses in us custody had been tortured , making their testimony inadmissible in court . motassadeq , 30 , was sentenced in february 2003 to 15 years in prison for his involvement in the so-called hamburg cell around mohammad atta which produced three of the 19 hijackers who attacked new york and washington . but a federal tribunal quashed the conviction in march and sent the case back to the hamburg court that originally sentenced him , citing the absence of potentially crucial testimony by the hamburg mastermind behind the plot , ramzi binalshibh . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramzi binalshibh binalshibh -lrb- photo -rrb- , a yemeni national , is currently being held by us authorities in an undisclosed location . fair trial no longer possible ? grässle-münscher said he would argue that even if the united states now agreed to provide detailed information secured during the interrogation of binalshibh , it would be legally tainted . " a fair trial is no longer possible because the important evidence is either lacking or contaminated , " grässle-münscher said , referring to rumors that binalshibh had been tortured since he was handed over to the us authorities after his arrest in pakistan in september 2002 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq during his trial in february 2003 the hamburg court had found motassadeq guilty of membership in a terrorist organization and more than 3,000 counts of accessory to murder based on the logistical help he allegedly provided to the hijackers . after the federal tribunal rejected that judgment in the spring , motassadeq was released from prison .
his new trial is scheduled to start on august 10 and last until early 2005 . prosecution is confident britain 's observer newspaper reported last month that concerns surrounding the alleged torture of the key witnesses could force german prosecutors to abandon the retrial of motassadeq , because under german law courts can not accept evidence if it is thought to come under duress or torture . a senior german intelligence official reportedly told the observer that the inability to prove the testimony was admissible would make it worthless . " they contain no details as to where binalshibh was questioned , nor whether torture or other forms of force were used to make them talk , " the official said , saying german courts would be extremely tough after the abu ghraib prison torture scandal in iraq . but germany 's federal prosecutor said friday he was confident he could get a fresh conviction against motassadeq because he believed us authorities would now cooperate in supplying testimony from binalshibh . the us justice department had previously refused to provide detailed intelligence from terror suspects in its custody , citing national security concerns . will key witnesses testify ? grässle-münscher said he would insist binalshibh and all other alleged operatives from the al-qaeda network relevant to the case testify personally , a request already rejected by us authorities . " it would only be acceptable for us if these witnesses appear in court , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdelghani mzoudi -lrb- left -rrb- smiles besides his attorney guel pinar after his acquittal in february binalshibh has reportedly told his interrogators that motassadeq and a fellow moroccan who was acquitted in hamburg in february , abdelghani mzoudi -lrb- photo -rrb- , had nothing to do with the conspiracy to attack us targets . grässle-münscher said that even if binalshibh 's potentially favorable testimony is judged inadmissible by the court , it should still find his client not guilty .

but that 's not stopping a growing number of german publications from experimenting with english-language news products . as germany 's state-backed international broadcaster , deutsche welle 's mandate is to provide unbiased news and information to people who may not necessarily understand german .
funded by german taxpayers , dw-world is able to compete in the rough-and-tumble world of english-speaking media . germany 's private print media do n't have that security or mandate , but that 's not stopping several publications - tempted by the chance to reach a wider audience - from exploring different ways to tap into the english market . the country 's leading weekly newsmagazine , der spiegel , has decided to become the latest to enter the fray , offering an english e-mail newsletter starting this autumn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first issue of der spiegel was published january 4 , 1947 . " we want to expand the spiegel brand to the english market .
there are a lot of people there that are aware of the magazine but they unfortunately ca n't read it , " spiegel online editor-in-chief mathias müller von blumencron told dw-world . managing news operations in foreign languages can be notoriously difficult , which is why spiegel is starting with a small team of three english-language editors who will work with the magazine 's online edition .
that way if the project does n't work out , the financial downside will be limited . the berliner zeitung newspaper last month quoted spiegel publisher fried von bismarck as saying the initial investment in the project would be limited to around half a million euros .
von blumencron said the daily newsletter would predominately have specialized original content , complemented by translated spiegel articles .
he expects the service to launch in october . a niche market ? horst röper , director of the dortmund-based formatt media institute , said despite spiegel 's top-drawer reputation , moving into the english media world was not without risk .
" it can certainly be successful , so long as one does n't have large expectations , " he said .
" generally foreign language products are niche products for niche markets . " spiegel is just the latest prestigious german publication to hop on the english bandwagon .
both the süddeutsche zeitung and frankfurter allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- newspapers already have weekly english supplements . however , the two papers have taken different approaches : whereas the faz supplies the german edition of the international herald tribune -lrb- iht -rrb- with an english faz weekly supplement , the süddeutsche each monday publishes a section with selected articles from the new york times in english .
so the süddeutsche is focusing on germans who read english and the faz is catering to english-speakers who want to read about germany . " we are targeting different groups - we are focused mainly on international travellers , " anke bryson , faz weekly 's executive editor , told dw-world .
she said her staff of full-time journalists wrote predominately original content for the iht , with about a third of the supplement coming from translated faz articles . scaled back , or worse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you mean i have to write this twice ?
but the faz 's foray into english publishing has n't always been a smooth ride .
the english editorial staff has been cut dramatically since its launch in 2000 .
in 2002 , the paper ceased publication of its daily english edition and instead launched a new weekly publication . other attempts have fared even worse .
die welt newspaper , backed by the powerful axel springer publishing group , folded its english language offering entirely a few years ago . with that in mind , von blumencron has no illusions that spiegel 's effort will be easy .
" we obviously ca n't earn money with it right away , " he said .
" we 'll have to see how fast it grows . " yet some are hoping that spiegel 's entry to the english market is signalling the start of better times .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.08.2004 german news auf englisch großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerd still prefers his news auf deutsch costly and complicated , running a foreign language editorial operation is not an easy thing to do .
but that 's not stopping a growing number of german publications from experimenting with english-language news products . as germany 's state-backed international broadcaster , deutsche welle 's mandate is to provide unbiased news and information to people who may not necessarily understand german .
funded by german taxpayers , dw-world is able to compete in the rough-and-tumble world of english-speaking media . germany 's private print media do n't have that security or mandate , but that 's not stopping several publications - tempted by the chance to reach a wider audience - from exploring different ways to tap into the english market . the country 's leading weekly newsmagazine , der spiegel , has decided to become the latest to enter the fray , offering an english e-mail newsletter starting this autumn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first issue of der spiegel was published january 4 , 1947 . " we want to expand the spiegel brand to the english market .
there are a lot of people there that are aware of the magazine but they unfortunately ca n't read it , " spiegel online editor-in-chief mathias müller von blumencron told dw-world . managing news operations in foreign languages can be notoriously difficult , which is why spiegel is starting with a small team of three english-language editors who will work with the magazine 's online edition .
that way if the project does n't work out , the financial downside will be limited . the berliner zeitung newspaper last month quoted spiegel publisher fried von bismarck as saying the initial investment in the project would be limited to around half a million euros .
von blumencron said the daily newsletter would predominately have specialized original content , complemented by translated spiegel articles .
he expects the service to launch in october . a niche market ? horst röper , director of the dortmund-based formatt media institute , said despite spiegel 's top-drawer reputation , moving into the english media world was not without risk .
" it can certainly be successful , so long as one does n't have large expectations , " he said .
" generally foreign language products are niche products for niche markets . " spiegel is just the latest prestigious german publication to hop on the english bandwagon .
both the süddeutsche zeitung and frankfurter allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- newspapers already have weekly english supplements . however , the two papers have taken different approaches : whereas the faz supplies the german edition of the international herald tribune -lrb- iht -rrb- with an english faz weekly supplement , the süddeutsche each monday publishes a section with selected articles from the new york times in english .
so the süddeutsche is focusing on germans who read english and the faz is catering to english-speakers who want to read about germany . " we are targeting different groups - we are focused mainly on international travellers , " anke bryson , faz weekly 's executive editor , told dw-world .
she said her staff of full-time journalists wrote predominately original content for the iht , with about a third of the supplement coming from translated faz articles . scaled back , or worse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you mean i have to write this twice ?
but the faz 's foray into english publishing has n't always been a smooth ride .
the english editorial staff has been cut dramatically since its launch in 2000 .
in 2002 , the paper ceased publication of its daily english edition and instead launched a new weekly publication . other attempts have fared even worse .
die welt newspaper , backed by the powerful axel springer publishing group , folded its english language offering entirely a few years ago . with that in mind , von blumencron has no illusions that spiegel 's effort will be easy .
" we obviously ca n't earn money with it right away , " he said .
" we 'll have to see how fast it grows . " yet some are hoping that spiegel 's entry to the english market is signalling the start of better times . " it 's still a difficult business to be in - however , that 's the case for the entire publishing industry at the moment , " said bryson from the faz .

a military official went so far as to describe it as a " declaration of war . " government officials in khartoum said they can not meet the 30-day deadline set by the united nations to disarm the janjaweed militias who are accused of a campaign of murder and rape against the people of sudan 's southwestern darfur region .
the militia members are alleged to enjoy government support as part of their battle against rebels in the region . sudan 's foreign minister , mustafa osman ismail , described the deadline as " illogical " and said sudan would implement a 90-day program agreed earlier with the un secretary-general , kofi annan . he said the new urgency required by the west could be linked to " elections taking place in some western countries " or to its " guilty conscience over failing to prevent the 1994 genocide in rwanda . " other sudanese officials have been even more outspoken .
the army spokesman , mohammed bashir suleiman , described the motion as an " american declaration of war " and said the sudanese army was prepared to confront the enemies of sudan on land , sea and air . easing or worsening the conflict ? adam thaim , spokesman for the african union , said he had some understanding for the sudanese annoyance .
he added that the resolution came at a sensitive time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudanese displaced woman line up to receive " the pressure on the sudanese government was beginning to work , " he said .
" the sudanese government is fully aware of the risk of a bigger humanitarian tragedy in darfur .
the conflict is not really escalating , the conflict is instead easing and it is in this meantime that the un resolution came out so i can understand - without justifying - the position of the government of sudan . " but there is a feeling in europe and the us that the sudanese government is once more trying to avoid its international obligations . a spokesman for the us state department , adam ereli , said that there was no excuse for not taking action now . the resolution was not a declaration of war , he said , but simply a demand that sudan fulfil commitments it has already made to disarm the militias . germany responds to criticism german deputy foreign minister kerstin müller meanwhile defended her country 's position in the conflict in an open letter to the editor of the wa shington post on monday .
the us paper had criticized european countries in a previous editorial for not doing enough to resolve the problem .
müller countered that germany first introduced discussions about the darfur conflict to the un security council during the country 's presidency of that body in april .
she added that the eu has pledged more than $ 260 million -lrb- € 216 million -rrb- to help refugees and that germany also has earmarked more than $ 105 million for the reconstruction of sudan after a peace agreement is signed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kerstin müller müller -lrb- photo -rrb- described the resolution as an important step in helping to resolve the conflict .
" germany will do whatever is in its power to stop the violations of human rights in sudan and to solve the humanitarian crisis and the political conflict in darfur and elsewhere in that country , " müller wrote .
" it will support all efforts to find a political solution to the underlying problems .
this also would be an important contribution to our common fight against terrorism . "
a long term strategy needed thaim of the african union also argued that there 's a need for a long term strategy . " the disarmament of janjaweed militias , the investigation into human rights violations , are conditions to peace , but they are not the only conditions to peace , " thaim said .
" the darfur problem is more complex than that .
you have land issues , you have sociological issues , you have religious issues .
it 's very complicated and i think that what we should go towards is political dialogues for darfur . " thaim added that the african union had started such a dialogue , but said that talks were regrettably suspended because the rebels were being inflexible . un food program needs more money meanwhile , the united nations world food program has begun dropping aid to isolated areas of darfur from the air , as a response to the lack of security on the ground and the beginning of the rainy season . but it said that it has received only half the funds it needs for emergency work in darfur this year .

the army spokesman , mohammed bashir suleiman , described the motion as an " american declaration of war " and said the sudanese army was prepared to confront the enemies of sudan on land , sea and air . easing or worsening the conflict ? adam thaim , spokesman for the african union , said he had some understanding for the sudanese annoyance .
he added that the resolution came at a sensitive time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudanese displaced woman line up to receive " the pressure on the sudanese government was beginning to work , " he said .
" the sudanese government is fully aware of the risk of a bigger humanitarian tragedy in darfur .
the conflict is not really escalating , the conflict is instead easing and it is in this meantime that the un resolution came out so i can understand - without justifying - the position of the government of sudan . " but there is a feeling in europe and the us that the sudanese government is once more trying to avoid its international obligations . a spokesman for the us state department , adam ereli , said that there was no excuse for not taking action now . the resolution was not a declaration of war , he said , but simply a demand that sudan fulfil commitments it has already made to disarm the militias . germany responds to criticism german deputy foreign minister kerstin müller meanwhile defended her country 's position in the conflict in an open letter to the editor of the wa shington post on monday .
the us paper had criticized european countries in a previous editorial for not doing enough to resolve the problem .
müller countered that germany first introduced discussions about the darfur conflict to the un security council during the country 's presidency of that body in april .
she added that the eu has pledged more than $ 260 million -lrb- € 216 million -rrb- to help refugees and that germany also has earmarked more than $ 105 million for the reconstruction of sudan after a peace agreement is signed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 03.08.2004 sudan irked by un resolution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudan 's foreign minister called the resolution 's deadline " illogical " sudanese government officials are unhappy with the un resolution calling on it to do more to solve the problems of its darfur region .
a military official went so far as to describe it as a " declaration of war . " government officials in khartoum said they can not meet the 30-day deadline set by the united nations to disarm the janjaweed militias who are accused of a campaign of murder and rape against the people of sudan 's southwestern darfur region .
the militia members are alleged to enjoy government support as part of their battle against rebels in the region . sudan 's foreign minister , mustafa osman ismail , described the deadline as " illogical " and said sudan would implement a 90-day program agreed earlier with the un secretary-general , kofi annan . he said the new urgency required by the west could be linked to " elections taking place in some western countries " or to its " guilty conscience over failing to prevent the 1994 genocide in rwanda . " other sudanese officials have been even more outspoken .
the army spokesman , mohammed bashir suleiman , described the motion as an " american declaration of war " and said the sudanese army was prepared to confront the enemies of sudan on land , sea and air . easing or worsening the conflict ? adam thaim , spokesman for the african union , said he had some understanding for the sudanese annoyance .
he added that the resolution came at a sensitive time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudanese displaced woman line up to receive " the pressure on the sudanese government was beginning to work , " he said .
" the sudanese government is fully aware of the risk of a bigger humanitarian tragedy in darfur .
the conflict is not really escalating , the conflict is instead easing and it is in this meantime that the un resolution came out so i can understand - without justifying - the position of the government of sudan . " but there is a feeling in europe and the us that the sudanese government is once more trying to avoid its international obligations . a spokesman for the us state department , adam ereli , said that there was no excuse for not taking action now . the resolution was not a declaration of war , he said , but simply a demand that sudan fulfil commitments it has already made to disarm the militias . germany responds to criticism german deputy foreign minister kerstin müller meanwhile defended her country 's position in the conflict in an open letter to the editor of the wa shington post on monday .
the us paper had criticized european countries in a previous editorial for not doing enough to resolve the problem .
müller countered that germany first introduced discussions about the darfur conflict to the un security council during the country 's presidency of that body in april .
she added that the eu has pledged more than $ 260 million -lrb- € 216 million -rrb- to help refugees and that germany also has earmarked more than $ 105 million for the reconstruction of sudan after a peace agreement is signed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kerstin müller müller -lrb- photo -rrb- described the resolution as an important step in helping to resolve the conflict .
" germany will do whatever is in its power to stop the violations of human rights in sudan and to solve the humanitarian crisis and the political conflict in darfur and elsewhere in that country , " müller wrote .
" it will support all efforts to find a political solution to the underlying problems .
this also would be an important contribution to our common fight against terrorism . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 03.08.2004 terror suspect lawyers to seek case dismissal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq 's 15-year sentence was thrown out in march lawyers for the only man convicted over the sept .
11 attacks in the us said tuesday they will call for the case against him to be thrown out when he returns to trial next week . one of the attorneys for moroccan student mounir el motassadeq , josef grässle-münscher , told afp newsagency that he would argue that key witnesses in us custody had been tortured , making their testimony inadmissible in court . motassadeq , 30 , was sentenced in february 2003 to 15 years in prison for his involvement in the so-called hamburg cell around mohammad atta which produced three of the 19 hijackers who attacked new york and washington . but a federal tribunal quashed the conviction in march and sent the case back to the hamburg court that originally sentenced him , citing the absence of potentially crucial testimony by the hamburg mastermind behind the plot , ramzi binalshibh . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramzi binalshibh binalshibh -lrb- photo -rrb- , a yemeni national , is currently being held by us authorities in an undisclosed location . fair trial no longer possible ? grässle-münscher said he would argue that even if the united states now agreed to provide detailed information secured during the interrogation of binalshibh , it would be legally tainted . " a fair trial is no longer possible because the important evidence is either lacking or contaminated , " grässle-münscher said , referring to rumors that binalshibh had been tortured since he was handed over to the us authorities after his arrest in pakistan in september 2002 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq during his trial in february 2003 the hamburg court had found motassadeq guilty of membership in a terrorist organization and more than 3,000 counts of accessory to murder based on the logistical help he allegedly provided to the hijackers . after the federal tribunal rejected that judgment in the spring , motassadeq was released from prison .
his new trial is scheduled to start on august 10 and last until early 2005 . prosecution is confident britain 's observer newspaper reported last month that concerns surrounding the alleged torture of the key witnesses could force german prosecutors to abandon the retrial of motassadeq , because under german law courts can not accept evidence if it is thought to come under duress or torture . a senior german intelligence official reportedly told the observer that the inability to prove the testimony was admissible would make it worthless . " they contain no details as to where binalshibh was questioned , nor whether torture or other forms of force were used to make them talk , " the official said , saying german courts would be extremely tough after the abu ghraib prison torture scandal in iraq . but germany 's federal prosecutor said friday he was confident he could get a fresh conviction against motassadeq because he believed us authorities would now cooperate in supplying testimony from binalshibh . the us justice department had previously refused to provide detailed intelligence from terror suspects in its custody , citing national security concerns . will key witnesses testify ? grässle-münscher said he would insist binalshibh and all other alleged operatives from the al-qaeda network relevant to the case testify personally , a request already rejected by us authorities .

11 attacks in the us said tuesday they will call for the case against him to be thrown out when he returns to trial next week . one of the attorneys for moroccan student mounir el motassadeq , josef grässle-münscher , told afp newsagency that he would argue that key witnesses in us custody had been tortured , making their testimony inadmissible in court . motassadeq , 30 , was sentenced in february 2003 to 15 years in prison for his involvement in the so-called hamburg cell around mohammad atta which produced three of the 19 hijackers who attacked new york and washington . but a federal tribunal quashed the conviction in march and sent the case back to the hamburg court that originally sentenced him , citing the absence of potentially crucial testimony by the hamburg mastermind behind the plot , ramzi binalshibh . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramzi binalshibh binalshibh -lrb- photo -rrb- , a yemeni national , is currently being held by us authorities in an undisclosed location . fair trial no longer possible ? grässle-münscher said he would argue that even if the united states now agreed to provide detailed information secured during the interrogation of binalshibh , it would be legally tainted . " a fair trial is no longer possible because the important evidence is either lacking or contaminated , " grässle-münscher said , referring to rumors that binalshibh had been tortured since he was handed over to the us authorities after his arrest in pakistan in september 2002 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq during his trial in february 2003 the hamburg court had found motassadeq guilty of membership in a terrorist organization and more than 3,000 counts of accessory to murder based on the logistical help he allegedly provided to the hijackers . after the federal tribunal rejected that judgment in the spring , motassadeq was released from prison .
his new trial is scheduled to start on august 10 and last until early 2005 . prosecution is confident britain 's observer newspaper reported last month that concerns surrounding the alleged torture of the key witnesses could force german prosecutors to abandon the retrial of motassadeq , because under german law courts can not accept evidence if it is thought to come under duress or torture . a senior german intelligence official reportedly told the observer that the inability to prove the testimony was admissible would make it worthless . " they contain no details as to where binalshibh was questioned , nor whether torture or other forms of force were used to make them talk , " the official said , saying german courts would be extremely tough after the abu ghraib prison torture scandal in iraq . but germany 's federal prosecutor said friday he was confident he could get a fresh conviction against motassadeq because he believed us authorities would now cooperate in supplying testimony from binalshibh . the us justice department had previously refused to provide detailed intelligence from terror suspects in its custody , citing national security concerns . will key witnesses testify ? grässle-münscher said he would insist binalshibh and all other alleged operatives from the al-qaeda network relevant to the case testify personally , a request already rejected by us authorities . " it would only be acceptable for us if these witnesses appear in court , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdelghani mzoudi -lrb- left -rrb- smiles besides his attorney guel pinar after his acquittal in february binalshibh has reportedly told his interrogators that motassadeq and a fellow moroccan who was acquitted in hamburg in february , abdelghani mzoudi -lrb- photo -rrb- , had nothing to do with the conspiracy to attack us targets . grässle-münscher said that even if binalshibh 's potentially favorable testimony is judged inadmissible by the court , it should still find his client not guilty .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.08.2004 german news auf englisch großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerd still prefers his news auf deutsch costly and complicated , running a foreign language editorial operation is not an easy thing to do .
but that 's not stopping a growing number of german publications from experimenting with english-language news products . as germany 's state-backed international broadcaster , deutsche welle 's mandate is to provide unbiased news and information to people who may not necessarily understand german .
funded by german taxpayers , dw-world is able to compete in the rough-and-tumble world of english-speaking media . germany 's private print media do n't have that security or mandate , but that 's not stopping several publications - tempted by the chance to reach a wider audience - from exploring different ways to tap into the english market . the country 's leading weekly newsmagazine , der spiegel , has decided to become the latest to enter the fray , offering an english e-mail newsletter starting this autumn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first issue of der spiegel was published january 4 , 1947 . " we want to expand the spiegel brand to the english market .
there are a lot of people there that are aware of the magazine but they unfortunately ca n't read it , " spiegel online editor-in-chief mathias müller von blumencron told dw-world . managing news operations in foreign languages can be notoriously difficult , which is why spiegel is starting with a small team of three english-language editors who will work with the magazine 's online edition .
that way if the project does n't work out , the financial downside will be limited . the berliner zeitung newspaper last month quoted spiegel publisher fried von bismarck as saying the initial investment in the project would be limited to around half a million euros .
von blumencron said the daily newsletter would predominately have specialized original content , complemented by translated spiegel articles .
he expects the service to launch in october . a niche market ? horst röper , director of the dortmund-based formatt media institute , said despite spiegel 's top-drawer reputation , moving into the english media world was not without risk .
" it can certainly be successful , so long as one does n't have large expectations , " he said .
" generally foreign language products are niche products for niche markets . " spiegel is just the latest prestigious german publication to hop on the english bandwagon .
both the süddeutsche zeitung and frankfurter allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- newspapers already have weekly english supplements . however , the two papers have taken different approaches : whereas the faz supplies the german edition of the international herald tribune -lrb- iht -rrb- with an english faz weekly supplement , the süddeutsche each monday publishes a section with selected articles from the new york times in english .
so the süddeutsche is focusing on germans who read english and the faz is catering to english-speakers who want to read about germany . " we are targeting different groups - we are focused mainly on international travellers , " anke bryson , faz weekly 's executive editor , told dw-world .
she said her staff of full-time journalists wrote predominately original content for the iht , with about a third of the supplement coming from translated faz articles . scaled back , or worse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you mean i have to write this twice ?
but the faz 's foray into english publishing has n't always been a smooth ride .
the english editorial staff has been cut dramatically since its launch in 2000 .
in 2002 , the paper ceased publication of its daily english edition and instead launched a new weekly publication . other attempts have fared even worse .
die welt newspaper , backed by the powerful axel springer publishing group , folded its english language offering entirely a few years ago . with that in mind , von blumencron has no illusions that spiegel 's effort will be easy .
" we obviously ca n't earn money with it right away , " he said .
" we 'll have to see how fast it grows . " yet some are hoping that spiegel 's entry to the english market is signalling the start of better times . " it 's still a difficult business to be in - however , that 's the case for the entire publishing industry at the moment , " said bryson from the faz .
" but i 'm pleased that the market for english language publications in germany appears to be reviving .

the court had ruled in june that kohl 's filed could not be released and that access to other filed for researchers and journalists had to be severely limited .
birthler said that in her opinion , the fight over the kohl files arose because some hope to garner evidence about kohl 's role in a bribery scandal involving his christian democratic union party .
she said that such information could not be released anyway , as the files are only released to give people insight into the workings of the stasi ministry .
she added that most requests to see the files still come from private individuals who want to see any documents the stasi collected about them . dw-world.de court hands partial victory to kohl in stasi case a german appeals court has ruled to impose major restrictions on the release and publication of information from the stasi files of former chancellor helmut kohl .

11 attacks in the us said tuesday they will call for the case against him to be thrown out when he returns to trial next week . one of the attorneys for moroccan student mounir el motassadeq , josef grässle-münscher , told afp newsagency that he would argue that key witnesses in us custody had been tortured , making their testimony inadmissible in court . motassadeq , 30 , was sentenced in february 2003 to 15 years in prison for his involvement in the so-called hamburg cell around mohammad atta which produced three of the 19 hijackers who attacked new york and washington . but a federal tribunal quashed the conviction in march and sent the case back to the hamburg court that originally sentenced him , citing the absence of potentially crucial testimony by the hamburg mastermind behind the plot , ramzi binalshibh . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramzi binalshibh binalshibh -lrb- photo -rrb- , a yemeni national , is currently being held by us authorities in an undisclosed location . fair trial no longer possible ? grässle-münscher said he would argue that even if the united states now agreed to provide detailed information secured during the interrogation of binalshibh , it would be legally tainted . " a fair trial is no longer possible because the important evidence is either lacking or contaminated , " grässle-münscher said , referring to rumors that binalshibh had been tortured since he was handed over to the us authorities after his arrest in pakistan in september 2002 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq during his trial in february 2003 the hamburg court had found motassadeq guilty of membership in a terrorist organization and more than 3,000 counts of accessory to murder based on the logistical help he allegedly provided to the hijackers . after the federal tribunal rejected that judgment in the spring , motassadeq was released from prison .
his new trial is scheduled to start on august 10 and last until early 2005 . prosecution is confident britain 's observer newspaper reported last month that concerns surrounding the alleged torture of the key witnesses could force german prosecutors to abandon the retrial of motassadeq , because under german law courts can not accept evidence if it is thought to come under duress or torture . a senior german intelligence official reportedly told the observer that the inability to prove the testimony was admissible would make it worthless . " they contain no details as to where binalshibh was questioned , nor whether torture or other forms of force were used to make them talk , " the official said , saying german courts would be extremely tough after the abu ghraib prison torture scandal in iraq . but germany 's federal prosecutor said friday he was confident he could get a fresh conviction against motassadeq because he believed us authorities would now cooperate in supplying testimony from binalshibh . the us justice department had previously refused to provide detailed intelligence from terror suspects in its custody , citing national security concerns . will key witnesses testify ? grässle-münscher said he would insist binalshibh and all other alleged operatives from the al-qaeda network relevant to the case testify personally , a request already rejected by us authorities . " it would only be acceptable for us if these witnesses appear in court , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdelghani mzoudi -lrb- left -rrb- smiles besides his attorney guel pinar after his acquittal in february binalshibh has reportedly told his interrogators that motassadeq and a fellow moroccan who was acquitted in hamburg in february , abdelghani mzoudi -lrb- photo -rrb- , had nothing to do with the conspiracy to attack us targets . grässle-münscher said that even if binalshibh 's potentially favorable testimony is judged inadmissible by the court , it should still find his client not guilty .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.08.2004 german news auf englisch großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerd still prefers his news auf deutsch costly and complicated , running a foreign language editorial operation is not an easy thing to do .
but that 's not stopping a growing number of german publications from experimenting with english-language news products . as germany 's state-backed international broadcaster , deutsche welle 's mandate is to provide unbiased news and information to people who may not necessarily understand german .
funded by german taxpayers , dw-world is able to compete in the rough-and-tumble world of english-speaking media . germany 's private print media do n't have that security or mandate , but that 's not stopping several publications - tempted by the chance to reach a wider audience - from exploring different ways to tap into the english market . the country 's leading weekly newsmagazine , der spiegel , has decided to become the latest to enter the fray , offering an english e-mail newsletter starting this autumn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first issue of der spiegel was published january 4 , 1947 . " we want to expand the spiegel brand to the english market .
there are a lot of people there that are aware of the magazine but they unfortunately ca n't read it , " spiegel online editor-in-chief mathias müller von blumencron told dw-world . managing news operations in foreign languages can be notoriously difficult , which is why spiegel is starting with a small team of three english-language editors who will work with the magazine 's online edition .
that way if the project does n't work out , the financial downside will be limited . the berliner zeitung newspaper last month quoted spiegel publisher fried von bismarck as saying the initial investment in the project would be limited to around half a million euros .
von blumencron said the daily newsletter would predominately have specialized original content , complemented by translated spiegel articles .
he expects the service to launch in october . a niche market ? horst röper , director of the dortmund-based formatt media institute , said despite spiegel 's top-drawer reputation , moving into the english media world was not without risk .
" it can certainly be successful , so long as one does n't have large expectations , " he said .
" generally foreign language products are niche products for niche markets . " spiegel is just the latest prestigious german publication to hop on the english bandwagon .
both the süddeutsche zeitung and frankfurter allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- newspapers already have weekly english supplements . however , the two papers have taken different approaches : whereas the faz supplies the german edition of the international herald tribune -lrb- iht -rrb- with an english faz weekly supplement , the süddeutsche each monday publishes a section with selected articles from the new york times in english .
so the süddeutsche is focusing on germans who read english and the faz is catering to english-speakers who want to read about germany . " we are targeting different groups - we are focused mainly on international travellers , " anke bryson , faz weekly 's executive editor , told dw-world .
she said her staff of full-time journalists wrote predominately original content for the iht , with about a third of the supplement coming from translated faz articles . scaled back , or worse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you mean i have to write this twice ?
but the faz 's foray into english publishing has n't always been a smooth ride .
the english editorial staff has been cut dramatically since its launch in 2000 .
in 2002 , the paper ceased publication of its daily english edition and instead launched a new weekly publication . other attempts have fared even worse .
die welt newspaper , backed by the powerful axel springer publishing group , folded its english language offering entirely a few years ago . with that in mind , von blumencron has no illusions that spiegel 's effort will be easy .
" we obviously ca n't earn money with it right away , " he said .
" we 'll have to see how fast it grows . " yet some are hoping that spiegel 's entry to the english market is signalling the start of better times . " it 's still a difficult business to be in - however , that 's the case for the entire publishing industry at the moment , " said bryson from the faz .
" but i 'm pleased that the market for english language publications in germany appears to be reviving .

11 attacks in the us said tuesday they will call for the case against him to be thrown out when he returns to trial next week . one of the attorneys for moroccan student mounir el motassadeq , josef grässle-münscher , told afp newsagency that he would argue that key witnesses in us custody had been tortured , making their testimony inadmissible in court . motassadeq , 30 , was sentenced in february 2003 to 15 years in prison for his involvement in the so-called hamburg cell around mohammad atta which produced three of the 19 hijackers who attacked new york and washington . but a federal tribunal quashed the conviction in march and sent the case back to the hamburg court that originally sentenced him , citing the absence of potentially crucial testimony by the hamburg mastermind behind the plot , ramzi binalshibh . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramzi binalshibh binalshibh -lrb- photo -rrb- , a yemeni national , is currently being held by us authorities in an undisclosed location . fair trial no longer possible ? grässle-münscher said he would argue that even if the united states now agreed to provide detailed information secured during the interrogation of binalshibh , it would be legally tainted . " a fair trial is no longer possible because the important evidence is either lacking or contaminated , " grässle-münscher said , referring to rumors that binalshibh had been tortured since he was handed over to the us authorities after his arrest in pakistan in september 2002 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq during his trial in february 2003 the hamburg court had found motassadeq guilty of membership in a terrorist organization and more than 3,000 counts of accessory to murder based on the logistical help he allegedly provided to the hijackers . after the federal tribunal rejected that judgment in the spring , motassadeq was released from prison .
his new trial is scheduled to start on august 10 and last until early 2005 . prosecution is confident britain 's observer newspaper reported last month that concerns surrounding the alleged torture of the key witnesses could force german prosecutors to abandon the retrial of motassadeq , because under german law courts can not accept evidence if it is thought to come under duress or torture . a senior german intelligence official reportedly told the observer that the inability to prove the testimony was admissible would make it worthless . " they contain no details as to where binalshibh was questioned , nor whether torture or other forms of force were used to make them talk , " the official said , saying german courts would be extremely tough after the abu ghraib prison torture scandal in iraq . but germany 's federal prosecutor said friday he was confident he could get a fresh conviction against motassadeq because he believed us authorities would now cooperate in supplying testimony from binalshibh . the us justice department had previously refused to provide detailed intelligence from terror suspects in its custody , citing national security concerns . will key witnesses testify ? grässle-münscher said he would insist binalshibh and all other alleged operatives from the al-qaeda network relevant to the case testify personally , a request already rejected by us authorities . " it would only be acceptable for us if these witnesses appear in court , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdelghani mzoudi -lrb- left -rrb- smiles besides his attorney guel pinar after his acquittal in february binalshibh has reportedly told his interrogators that motassadeq and a fellow moroccan who was acquitted in hamburg in february , abdelghani mzoudi -lrb- photo -rrb- , had nothing to do with the conspiracy to attack us targets . grässle-münscher said that even if binalshibh 's potentially favorable testimony is judged inadmissible by the court , it should still find his client not guilty .

" normally you would have to go through the appeals process in an individual country -lrb- before going to a european court -rrb- , " pawelka told the newspaper .

he said given germany 's blame for the war and the nazi atrocities committed in poland , his government could by no means accept restitution claims which effectively " turn history on its head . "
" property issues related to world war ii are no longer a subject of controversy between our two governments , " schröder said referring to past discussions between berlin and warsaw . " neither the german government nor any other serious political force supports any restitution claims still being voiced .
this is our position , and we won ’ t hesitate to make this position clear before international courts , if need be , " he stressed . the chancellor has often said that while germans who were forced to abandon their homes undeniably suffered , it is wrong to put their fates on a par with those of jews or other polish citizens who bore the brunt of nazi aggression . testing the government 's resolve pawelka said the prussian claims society now aimed to test the government 's resolve in opposing the claims . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish officials plant a marker near the german-polish border at the oder river in 1945 he said that because polish courts would likely reject the lawsuit out of hand , the society would file claims at the same time with the european court of human rights in strasbourg . pawelka stressed , however , that the organization had no intention of victimizing poles a second time . " we never said that a pole who lives in a house or on property that once belonged to a german must leave it , " he said . " i do n't understand why this fear is being stoked , " he said , adding that the organization sought " solutions that are bearable for both sides . " polish officials are wary polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz warned monday that schröder 's rejection of reparations demands by germans did not close an issue which has dogged relations between the two neighbors . " the declaration is of great importance for poland and the poles , but does not close the issue once and for all , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wlodzimierz cimoszewicz cimoszewicz -lrb- photo -rrb- presciently warned that german expellees might press their claims further . " one could imagine theoretically that german expellees file claims with european tribunals even if their cases are rejected by polish and german courts , " he said after schröder 's speech on sunday . expellee organizations estimate that nine million germans were forced to leave poland after world war ii and that 13 percent of them owned real estate there .

a military official went so far as to describe it as a " declaration of war . " government officials in khartoum said they can not meet the 30-day deadline set by the united nations to disarm the janjaweed militias who are accused of a campaign of murder and rape against the people of sudan 's southwestern darfur region .
the militia members are alleged to enjoy government support as part of their battle against rebels in the region . sudan 's foreign minister , mustafa osman ismail , described the deadline as " illogical " and said sudan would implement a 90-day program agreed earlier with the un secretary-general , kofi annan . he said the new urgency required by the west could be linked to " elections taking place in some western countries " or to its " guilty conscience over failing to prevent the 1994 genocide in rwanda . " other sudanese officials have been even more outspoken .
the army spokesman , mohammed bashir suleiman , described the motion as an " american declaration of war " and said the sudanese army was prepared to confront the enemies of sudan on land , sea and air . easing or worsening the conflict ? adam thaim , spokesman for the african union , said he had some understanding for the sudanese annoyance .
he added that the resolution came at a sensitive time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudanese displaced woman line up to receive " the pressure on the sudanese government was beginning to work , " he said .
" the sudanese government is fully aware of the risk of a bigger humanitarian tragedy in darfur .
the conflict is not really escalating , the conflict is instead easing and it is in this meantime that the un resolution came out so i can understand - without justifying - the position of the government of sudan . " but there is a feeling in europe and the us that the sudanese government is once more trying to avoid its international obligations . a spokesman for the us state department , adam ereli , said that there was no excuse for not taking action now . the resolution was not a declaration of war , he said , but simply a demand that sudan fulfil commitments it has already made to disarm the militias . germany responds to criticism german deputy foreign minister kerstin müller meanwhile defended her country 's position in the conflict in an open letter to the editor of the wa shington post on monday .
the us paper had criticized european countries in a previous editorial for not doing enough to resolve the problem .
müller countered that germany first introduced discussions about the darfur conflict to the un security council during the country 's presidency of that body in april .
she added that the eu has pledged more than $ 260 million -lrb- € 216 million -rrb- to help refugees and that germany also has earmarked more than $ 105 million for the reconstruction of sudan after a peace agreement is signed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kerstin müller müller -lrb- photo -rrb- described the resolution as an important step in helping to resolve the conflict .
" germany will do whatever is in its power to stop the violations of human rights in sudan and to solve the humanitarian crisis and the political conflict in darfur and elsewhere in that country , " müller wrote .
" it will support all efforts to find a political solution to the underlying problems .
this also would be an important contribution to our common fight against terrorism . "
a long term strategy needed thaim of the african union also argued that there 's a need for a long term strategy . " the disarmament of janjaweed militias , the investigation into human rights violations , are conditions to peace , but they are not the only conditions to peace , " thaim said .
" the darfur problem is more complex than that .
you have land issues , you have sociological issues , you have religious issues .
it 's very complicated and i think that what we should go towards is political dialogues for darfur . " thaim added that the african union had started such a dialogue , but said that talks were regrettably suspended because the rebels were being inflexible . un food program needs more money meanwhile , the united nations world food program has begun dropping aid to isolated areas of darfur from the air , as a response to the lack of security on the ground and the beginning of the rainy season . but it said that it has received only half the funds it needs for emergency work in darfur this year .

the conflict is not really escalating , the conflict is instead easing and it is in this meantime that the un resolution came out so i can understand - without justifying - the position of the government of sudan . " but there is a feeling in europe and the us that the sudanese government is once more trying to avoid its international obligations . a spokesman for the us state department , adam ereli , said that there was no excuse for not taking action now . the resolution was not a declaration of war , he said , but simply a demand that sudan fulfil commitments it has already made to disarm the militias . germany responds to criticism german deputy foreign minister kerstin müller meanwhile defended her country 's position in the conflict in an open letter to the editor of the wa shington post on monday .
the us paper had criticized european countries in a previous editorial for not doing enough to resolve the problem .
müller countered that germany first introduced discussions about the darfur conflict to the un security council during the country 's presidency of that body in april .
she added that the eu has pledged more than $ 260 million -lrb- € 216 million -rrb- to help refugees and that germany also has earmarked more than $ 105 million for the reconstruction of sudan after a peace agreement is signed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kerstin müller müller -lrb- photo -rrb- described the resolution as an important step in helping to resolve the conflict .
" germany will do whatever is in its power to stop the violations of human rights in sudan and to solve the humanitarian crisis and the political conflict in darfur and elsewhere in that country , " müller wrote .
" it will support all efforts to find a political solution to the underlying problems .
this also would be an important contribution to our common fight against terrorism . "
a long term strategy needed thaim of the african union also argued that there 's a need for a long term strategy . " the disarmament of janjaweed militias , the investigation into human rights violations , are conditions to peace , but they are not the only conditions to peace , " thaim said .
" the darfur problem is more complex than that .
you have land issues , you have sociological issues , you have religious issues .
it 's very complicated and i think that what we should go towards is political dialogues for darfur . " thaim added that the african union had started such a dialogue , but said that talks were regrettably suspended because the rebels were being inflexible . un food program needs more money meanwhile , the united nations world food program has begun dropping aid to isolated areas of darfur from the air , as a response to the lack of security on the ground and the beginning of the rainy season . but it said that it has received only half the funds it needs for emergency work in darfur this year .

funded by german taxpayers , dw-world is able to compete in the rough-and-tumble world of english-speaking media . germany 's private print media do n't have that security or mandate , but that 's not stopping several publications - tempted by the chance to reach a wider audience - from exploring different ways to tap into the english market . the country 's leading weekly newsmagazine , der spiegel , has decided to become the latest to enter the fray , offering an english e-mail newsletter starting this autumn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first issue of der spiegel was published january 4 , 1947 . " we want to expand the spiegel brand to the english market .

that way if the project does n't work out , the financial downside will be limited . the berliner zeitung newspaper last month quoted spiegel publisher fried von bismarck as saying the initial investment in the project would be limited to around half a million euros .

so the süddeutsche is focusing on germans who read english and the faz is catering to english-speakers who want to read about germany . " we are targeting different groups - we are focused mainly on international travellers , " anke bryson , faz weekly 's executive editor , told dw-world .
she said her staff of full-time journalists wrote predominately original content for the iht , with about a third of the supplement coming from translated faz articles . scaled back , or worse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you mean i have to write this twice ?

birthler said that in her opinion , the fight over the kohl files arose because some hope to garner evidence about kohl 's role in a bribery scandal involving his christian democratic union party .
she said that such information could not be released anyway , as the files are only released to give people insight into the workings of the stasi ministry .

but that 's not stopping a growing number of german publications from experimenting with english-language news products . as germany 's state-backed international broadcaster , deutsche welle 's mandate is to provide unbiased news and information to people who may not necessarily understand german .
funded by german taxpayers , dw-world is able to compete in the rough-and-tumble world of english-speaking media . germany 's private print media do n't have that security or mandate , but that 's not stopping several publications - tempted by the chance to reach a wider audience - from exploring different ways to tap into the english market . the country 's leading weekly newsmagazine , der spiegel , has decided to become the latest to enter the fray , offering an english e-mail newsletter starting this autumn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first issue of der spiegel was published january 4 , 1947 . " we want to expand the spiegel brand to the english market .
there are a lot of people there that are aware of the magazine but they unfortunately ca n't read it , " spiegel online editor-in-chief mathias müller von blumencron told dw-world . managing news operations in foreign languages can be notoriously difficult , which is why spiegel is starting with a small team of three english-language editors who will work with the magazine 's online edition .
that way if the project does n't work out , the financial downside will be limited . the berliner zeitung newspaper last month quoted spiegel publisher fried von bismarck as saying the initial investment in the project would be limited to around half a million euros .
von blumencron said the daily newsletter would predominately have specialized original content , complemented by translated spiegel articles .
he expects the service to launch in october . a niche market ? horst röper , director of the dortmund-based formatt media institute , said despite spiegel 's top-drawer reputation , moving into the english media world was not without risk .
" it can certainly be successful , so long as one does n't have large expectations , " he said .
" generally foreign language products are niche products for niche markets . " spiegel is just the latest prestigious german publication to hop on the english bandwagon .
both the süddeutsche zeitung and frankfurter allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- newspapers already have weekly english supplements . however , the two papers have taken different approaches : whereas the faz supplies the german edition of the international herald tribune -lrb- iht -rrb- with an english faz weekly supplement , the süddeutsche each monday publishes a section with selected articles from the new york times in english .
so the süddeutsche is focusing on germans who read english and the faz is catering to english-speakers who want to read about germany . " we are targeting different groups - we are focused mainly on international travellers , " anke bryson , faz weekly 's executive editor , told dw-world .
she said her staff of full-time journalists wrote predominately original content for the iht , with about a third of the supplement coming from translated faz articles . scaled back , or worse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you mean i have to write this twice ?
but the faz 's foray into english publishing has n't always been a smooth ride .
the english editorial staff has been cut dramatically since its launch in 2000 .
in 2002 , the paper ceased publication of its daily english edition and instead launched a new weekly publication . other attempts have fared even worse .
die welt newspaper , backed by the powerful axel springer publishing group , folded its english language offering entirely a few years ago . with that in mind , von blumencron has no illusions that spiegel 's effort will be easy .
" we obviously ca n't earn money with it right away , " he said .
" we 'll have to see how fast it grows . " yet some are hoping that spiegel 's entry to the english market is signalling the start of better times . " it 's still a difficult business to be in - however , that 's the case for the entire publishing industry at the moment , " said bryson from the faz .

but that 's not stopping a growing number of german publications from experimenting with english-language news products . as germany 's state-backed international broadcaster , deutsche welle 's mandate is to provide unbiased news and information to people who may not necessarily understand german .
funded by german taxpayers , dw-world is able to compete in the rough-and-tumble world of english-speaking media . germany 's private print media do n't have that security or mandate , but that 's not stopping several publications - tempted by the chance to reach a wider audience - from exploring different ways to tap into the english market . the country 's leading weekly newsmagazine , der spiegel , has decided to become the latest to enter the fray , offering an english e-mail newsletter starting this autumn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first issue of der spiegel was published january 4 , 1947 . " we want to expand the spiegel brand to the english market .
there are a lot of people there that are aware of the magazine but they unfortunately ca n't read it , " spiegel online editor-in-chief mathias müller von blumencron told dw-world . managing news operations in foreign languages can be notoriously difficult , which is why spiegel is starting with a small team of three english-language editors who will work with the magazine 's online edition .
that way if the project does n't work out , the financial downside will be limited . the berliner zeitung newspaper last month quoted spiegel publisher fried von bismarck as saying the initial investment in the project would be limited to around half a million euros .
von blumencron said the daily newsletter would predominately have specialized original content , complemented by translated spiegel articles .
he expects the service to launch in october . a niche market ? horst röper , director of the dortmund-based formatt media institute , said despite spiegel 's top-drawer reputation , moving into the english media world was not without risk .
" it can certainly be successful , so long as one does n't have large expectations , " he said .
" generally foreign language products are niche products for niche markets . " spiegel is just the latest prestigious german publication to hop on the english bandwagon .
both the süddeutsche zeitung and frankfurter allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- newspapers already have weekly english supplements . however , the two papers have taken different approaches : whereas the faz supplies the german edition of the international herald tribune -lrb- iht -rrb- with an english faz weekly supplement , the süddeutsche each monday publishes a section with selected articles from the new york times in english .
so the süddeutsche is focusing on germans who read english and the faz is catering to english-speakers who want to read about germany . " we are targeting different groups - we are focused mainly on international travellers , " anke bryson , faz weekly 's executive editor , told dw-world .
she said her staff of full-time journalists wrote predominately original content for the iht , with about a third of the supplement coming from translated faz articles . scaled back , or worse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you mean i have to write this twice ?
but the faz 's foray into english publishing has n't always been a smooth ride .
the english editorial staff has been cut dramatically since its launch in 2000 .
in 2002 , the paper ceased publication of its daily english edition and instead launched a new weekly publication . other attempts have fared even worse .
die welt newspaper , backed by the powerful axel springer publishing group , folded its english language offering entirely a few years ago . with that in mind , von blumencron has no illusions that spiegel 's effort will be easy .
" we obviously ca n't earn money with it right away , " he said .
" we 'll have to see how fast it grows . " yet some are hoping that spiegel 's entry to the english market is signalling the start of better times . " it 's still a difficult business to be in - however , that 's the case for the entire publishing industry at the moment , " said bryson from the faz .

a military official went so far as to describe it as a " declaration of war . " government officials in khartoum said they can not meet the 30-day deadline set by the united nations to disarm the janjaweed militias who are accused of a campaign of murder and rape against the people of sudan 's southwestern darfur region .
the militia members are alleged to enjoy government support as part of their battle against rebels in the region . sudan 's foreign minister , mustafa osman ismail , described the deadline as " illogical " and said sudan would implement a 90-day program agreed earlier with the un secretary-general , kofi annan . he said the new urgency required by the west could be linked to " elections taking place in some western countries " or to its " guilty conscience over failing to prevent the 1994 genocide in rwanda . " other sudanese officials have been even more outspoken .
the army spokesman , mohammed bashir suleiman , described the motion as an " american declaration of war " and said the sudanese army was prepared to confront the enemies of sudan on land , sea and air . easing or worsening the conflict ? adam thaim , spokesman for the african union , said he had some understanding for the sudanese annoyance .
he added that the resolution came at a sensitive time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudanese displaced woman line up to receive " the pressure on the sudanese government was beginning to work , " he said .
" the sudanese government is fully aware of the risk of a bigger humanitarian tragedy in darfur .
the conflict is not really escalating , the conflict is instead easing and it is in this meantime that the un resolution came out so i can understand - without justifying - the position of the government of sudan . " but there is a feeling in europe and the us that the sudanese government is once more trying to avoid its international obligations . a spokesman for the us state department , adam ereli , said that there was no excuse for not taking action now . the resolution was not a declaration of war , he said , but simply a demand that sudan fulfil commitments it has already made to disarm the militias . germany responds to criticism german deputy foreign minister kerstin müller meanwhile defended her country 's position in the conflict in an open letter to the editor of the wa shington post on monday .
the us paper had criticized european countries in a previous editorial for not doing enough to resolve the problem .
müller countered that germany first introduced discussions about the darfur conflict to the un security council during the country 's presidency of that body in april .
she added that the eu has pledged more than $ 260 million -lrb- € 216 million -rrb- to help refugees and that germany also has earmarked more than $ 105 million for the reconstruction of sudan after a peace agreement is signed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kerstin müller müller -lrb- photo -rrb- described the resolution as an important step in helping to resolve the conflict .
" germany will do whatever is in its power to stop the violations of human rights in sudan and to solve the humanitarian crisis and the political conflict in darfur and elsewhere in that country , " müller wrote .
" it will support all efforts to find a political solution to the underlying problems .
this also would be an important contribution to our common fight against terrorism . "
a long term strategy needed thaim of the african union also argued that there 's a need for a long term strategy . " the disarmament of janjaweed militias , the investigation into human rights violations , are conditions to peace , but they are not the only conditions to peace , " thaim said .
" the darfur problem is more complex than that .
you have land issues , you have sociological issues , you have religious issues .
it 's very complicated and i think that what we should go towards is political dialogues for darfur . " thaim added that the african union had started such a dialogue , but said that talks were regrettably suspended because the rebels were being inflexible . un food program needs more money meanwhile , the united nations world food program has begun dropping aid to isolated areas of darfur from the air , as a response to the lack of security on the ground and the beginning of the rainy season . but it said that it has received only half the funds it needs for emergency work in darfur this year .

a military official went so far as to describe it as a " declaration of war . " government officials in khartoum said they can not meet the 30-day deadline set by the united nations to disarm the janjaweed militias who are accused of a campaign of murder and rape against the people of sudan 's southwestern darfur region .
the militia members are alleged to enjoy government support as part of their battle against rebels in the region . sudan 's foreign minister , mustafa osman ismail , described the deadline as " illogical " and said sudan would implement a 90-day program agreed earlier with the un secretary-general , kofi annan . he said the new urgency required by the west could be linked to " elections taking place in some western countries " or to its " guilty conscience over failing to prevent the 1994 genocide in rwanda . " other sudanese officials have been even more outspoken .
the army spokesman , mohammed bashir suleiman , described the motion as an " american declaration of war " and said the sudanese army was prepared to confront the enemies of sudan on land , sea and air . easing or worsening the conflict ? adam thaim , spokesman for the african union , said he had some understanding for the sudanese annoyance .
he added that the resolution came at a sensitive time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudanese displaced woman line up to receive " the pressure on the sudanese government was beginning to work , " he said .
" the sudanese government is fully aware of the risk of a bigger humanitarian tragedy in darfur .
the conflict is not really escalating , the conflict is instead easing and it is in this meantime that the un resolution came out so i can understand - without justifying - the position of the government of sudan . " but there is a feeling in europe and the us that the sudanese government is once more trying to avoid its international obligations . a spokesman for the us state department , adam ereli , said that there was no excuse for not taking action now . the resolution was not a declaration of war , he said , but simply a demand that sudan fulfil commitments it has already made to disarm the militias . germany responds to criticism german deputy foreign minister kerstin müller meanwhile defended her country 's position in the conflict in an open letter to the editor of the wa shington post on monday .
the us paper had criticized european countries in a previous editorial for not doing enough to resolve the problem .
müller countered that germany first introduced discussions about the darfur conflict to the un security council during the country 's presidency of that body in april .
she added that the eu has pledged more than $ 260 million -lrb- € 216 million -rrb- to help refugees and that germany also has earmarked more than $ 105 million for the reconstruction of sudan after a peace agreement is signed .

" normally you would have to go through the appeals process in an individual country -lrb- before going to a european court -rrb- , " pawelka told the newspaper .
" we will see what means the government will bring to bear against the independence of the courts . " the organization could not be reached for comment tuesday , saying on its answering machine that it had closed its offices until thursday . schröder dismisses reparations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder -lrb- right -rrb- and poland 's president aleksander kwasniewski in front of the monument to child insurgents in warsaw schröder -lrb- photo , right -rrb- on sunday firmly dismissed reparations demands by germans forced to leave poland after the war , ahead of commemorations in warsaw marking the 60th anniversary of the city 's failed uprising against the nazis in 1944 .
he said given germany 's blame for the war and the nazi atrocities committed in poland , his government could by no means accept restitution claims which effectively " turn history on its head . "

11 attacks in the us said tuesday they will call for the case against him to be thrown out when he returns to trial next week . one of the attorneys for moroccan student mounir el motassadeq , josef grässle-münscher , told afp newsagency that he would argue that key witnesses in us custody had been tortured , making their testimony inadmissible in court . motassadeq , 30 , was sentenced in february 2003 to 15 years in prison for his involvement in the so-called hamburg cell around mohammad atta which produced three of the 19 hijackers who attacked new york and washington . but a federal tribunal quashed the conviction in march and sent the case back to the hamburg court that originally sentenced him , citing the absence of potentially crucial testimony by the hamburg mastermind behind the plot , ramzi binalshibh . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramzi binalshibh binalshibh -lrb- photo -rrb- , a yemeni national , is currently being held by us authorities in an undisclosed location . fair trial no longer possible ? grässle-münscher said he would argue that even if the united states now agreed to provide detailed information secured during the interrogation of binalshibh , it would be legally tainted . " a fair trial is no longer possible because the important evidence is either lacking or contaminated , " grässle-münscher said , referring to rumors that binalshibh had been tortured since he was handed over to the us authorities after his arrest in pakistan in september 2002 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq during his trial in february 2003 the hamburg court had found motassadeq guilty of membership in a terrorist organization and more than 3,000 counts of accessory to murder based on the logistical help he allegedly provided to the hijackers . after the federal tribunal rejected that judgment in the spring , motassadeq was released from prison .
his new trial is scheduled to start on august 10 and last until early 2005 . prosecution is confident britain 's observer newspaper reported last month that concerns surrounding the alleged torture of the key witnesses could force german prosecutors to abandon the retrial of motassadeq , because under german law courts can not accept evidence if it is thought to come under duress or torture . a senior german intelligence official reportedly told the observer that the inability to prove the testimony was admissible would make it worthless . " they contain no details as to where binalshibh was questioned , nor whether torture or other forms of force were used to make them talk , " the official said , saying german courts would be extremely tough after the abu ghraib prison torture scandal in iraq . but germany 's federal prosecutor said friday he was confident he could get a fresh conviction against motassadeq because he believed us authorities would now cooperate in supplying testimony from binalshibh . the us justice department had previously refused to provide detailed intelligence from terror suspects in its custody , citing national security concerns . will key witnesses testify ? grässle-münscher said he would insist binalshibh and all other alleged operatives from the al-qaeda network relevant to the case testify personally , a request already rejected by us authorities . " it would only be acceptable for us if these witnesses appear in court , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdelghani mzoudi -lrb- left -rrb- smiles besides his attorney guel pinar after his acquittal in february binalshibh has reportedly told his interrogators that motassadeq and a fellow moroccan who was acquitted in hamburg in february , abdelghani mzoudi -lrb- photo -rrb- , had nothing to do with the conspiracy to attack us targets . grässle-münscher said that even if binalshibh 's potentially favorable testimony is judged inadmissible by the court , it should still find his client not guilty .

11 attacks in the us said tuesday they will call for the case against him to be thrown out when he returns to trial next week . one of the attorneys for moroccan student mounir el motassadeq , josef grässle-münscher , told afp newsagency that he would argue that key witnesses in us custody had been tortured , making their testimony inadmissible in court . motassadeq , 30 , was sentenced in february 2003 to 15 years in prison for his involvement in the so-called hamburg cell around mohammad atta which produced three of the 19 hijackers who attacked new york and washington . but a federal tribunal quashed the conviction in march and sent the case back to the hamburg court that originally sentenced him , citing the absence of potentially crucial testimony by the hamburg mastermind behind the plot , ramzi binalshibh . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramzi binalshibh binalshibh -lrb- photo -rrb- , a yemeni national , is currently being held by us authorities in an undisclosed location . fair trial no longer possible ? grässle-münscher said he would argue that even if the united states now agreed to provide detailed information secured during the interrogation of binalshibh , it would be legally tainted . " a fair trial is no longer possible because the important evidence is either lacking or contaminated , " grässle-münscher said , referring to rumors that binalshibh had been tortured since he was handed over to the us authorities after his arrest in pakistan in september 2002 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq during his trial in february 2003 the hamburg court had found motassadeq guilty of membership in a terrorist organization and more than 3,000 counts of accessory to murder based on the logistical help he allegedly provided to the hijackers . after the federal tribunal rejected that judgment in the spring , motassadeq was released from prison .
his new trial is scheduled to start on august 10 and last until early 2005 . prosecution is confident britain 's observer newspaper reported last month that concerns surrounding the alleged torture of the key witnesses could force german prosecutors to abandon the retrial of motassadeq , because under german law courts can not accept evidence if it is thought to come under duress or torture . a senior german intelligence official reportedly told the observer that the inability to prove the testimony was admissible would make it worthless . " they contain no details as to where binalshibh was questioned , nor whether torture or other forms of force were used to make them talk , " the official said , saying german courts would be extremely tough after the abu ghraib prison torture scandal in iraq . but germany 's federal prosecutor said friday he was confident he could get a fresh conviction against motassadeq because he believed us authorities would now cooperate in supplying testimony from binalshibh . the us justice department had previously refused to provide detailed intelligence from terror suspects in its custody , citing national security concerns . will key witnesses testify ? grässle-münscher said he would insist binalshibh and all other alleged operatives from the al-qaeda network relevant to the case testify personally , a request already rejected by us authorities . " it would only be acceptable for us if these witnesses appear in court , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdelghani mzoudi -lrb- left -rrb- smiles besides his attorney guel pinar after his acquittal in february binalshibh has reportedly told his interrogators that motassadeq and a fellow moroccan who was acquitted in hamburg in february , abdelghani mzoudi -lrb- photo -rrb- , had nothing to do with the conspiracy to attack us targets . grässle-münscher said that even if binalshibh 's potentially favorable testimony is judged inadmissible by the court , it should still find his client not guilty . " if a defendant is forced to give up evidence because torture is used , the court can not hold that against him , " he said . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de prosecutors seen dropping charges against 9/11 suspect the most serious charges facing the only person ever to be convicted for the sept .

11 attacks in the us said tuesday they will call for the case against him to be thrown out when he returns to trial next week . one of the attorneys for moroccan student mounir el motassadeq , josef grässle-münscher , told afp newsagency that he would argue that key witnesses in us custody had been tortured , making their testimony inadmissible in court . motassadeq , 30 , was sentenced in february 2003 to 15 years in prison for his involvement in the so-called hamburg cell around mohammad atta which produced three of the 19 hijackers who attacked new york and washington . but a federal tribunal quashed the conviction in march and sent the case back to the hamburg court that originally sentenced him , citing the absence of potentially crucial testimony by the hamburg mastermind behind the plot , ramzi binalshibh . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramzi binalshibh binalshibh -lrb- photo -rrb- , a yemeni national , is currently being held by us authorities in an undisclosed location . fair trial no longer possible ? grässle-münscher said he would argue that even if the united states now agreed to provide detailed information secured during the interrogation of binalshibh , it would be legally tainted . " a fair trial is no longer possible because the important evidence is either lacking or contaminated , " grässle-münscher said , referring to rumors that binalshibh had been tortured since he was handed over to the us authorities after his arrest in pakistan in september 2002 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq during his trial in february 2003 the hamburg court had found motassadeq guilty of membership in a terrorist organization and more than 3,000 counts of accessory to murder based on the logistical help he allegedly provided to the hijackers . after the federal tribunal rejected that judgment in the spring , motassadeq was released from prison .
his new trial is scheduled to start on august 10 and last until early 2005 . prosecution is confident britain 's observer newspaper reported last month that concerns surrounding the alleged torture of the key witnesses could force german prosecutors to abandon the retrial of motassadeq , because under german law courts can not accept evidence if it is thought to come under duress or torture . a senior german intelligence official reportedly told the observer that the inability to prove the testimony was admissible would make it worthless . " they contain no details as to where binalshibh was questioned , nor whether torture or other forms of force were used to make them talk , " the official said , saying german courts would be extremely tough after the abu ghraib prison torture scandal in iraq . but germany 's federal prosecutor said friday he was confident he could get a fresh conviction against motassadeq because he believed us authorities would now cooperate in supplying testimony from binalshibh . the us justice department had previously refused to provide detailed intelligence from terror suspects in its custody , citing national security concerns . will key witnesses testify ? grässle-münscher said he would insist binalshibh and all other alleged operatives from the al-qaeda network relevant to the case testify personally , a request already rejected by us authorities . " it would only be acceptable for us if these witnesses appear in court , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdelghani mzoudi -lrb- left -rrb- smiles besides his attorney guel pinar after his acquittal in february binalshibh has reportedly told his interrogators that motassadeq and a fellow moroccan who was acquitted in hamburg in february , abdelghani mzoudi -lrb- photo -rrb- , had nothing to do with the conspiracy to attack us targets . grässle-münscher said that even if binalshibh 's potentially favorable testimony is judged inadmissible by the court , it should still find his client not guilty . " if a defendant is forced to give up evidence because torture is used , the court can not hold that against him , " he said . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de prosecutors seen dropping charges against 9/11 suspect the most serious charges facing the only person ever to be convicted for the sept .

but that 's not stopping a growing number of german publications from experimenting with english-language news products . as germany 's state-backed international broadcaster , deutsche welle 's mandate is to provide unbiased news and information to people who may not necessarily understand german .
funded by german taxpayers , dw-world is able to compete in the rough-and-tumble world of english-speaking media . germany 's private print media do n't have that security or mandate , but that 's not stopping several publications - tempted by the chance to reach a wider audience - from exploring different ways to tap into the english market . the country 's leading weekly newsmagazine , der spiegel , has decided to become the latest to enter the fray , offering an english e-mail newsletter starting this autumn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first issue of der spiegel was published january 4 , 1947 . " we want to expand the spiegel brand to the english market .
there are a lot of people there that are aware of the magazine but they unfortunately ca n't read it , " spiegel online editor-in-chief mathias müller von blumencron told dw-world . managing news operations in foreign languages can be notoriously difficult , which is why spiegel is starting with a small team of three english-language editors who will work with the magazine 's online edition .
that way if the project does n't work out , the financial downside will be limited . the berliner zeitung newspaper last month quoted spiegel publisher fried von bismarck as saying the initial investment in the project would be limited to around half a million euros .
von blumencron said the daily newsletter would predominately have specialized original content , complemented by translated spiegel articles .
he expects the service to launch in october . a niche market ? horst röper , director of the dortmund-based formatt media institute , said despite spiegel 's top-drawer reputation , moving into the english media world was not without risk .
" it can certainly be successful , so long as one does n't have large expectations , " he said .
" generally foreign language products are niche products for niche markets . " spiegel is just the latest prestigious german publication to hop on the english bandwagon .
both the süddeutsche zeitung and frankfurter allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- newspapers already have weekly english supplements . however , the two papers have taken different approaches : whereas the faz supplies the german edition of the international herald tribune -lrb- iht -rrb- with an english faz weekly supplement , the süddeutsche each monday publishes a section with selected articles from the new york times in english .
so the süddeutsche is focusing on germans who read english and the faz is catering to english-speakers who want to read about germany . " we are targeting different groups - we are focused mainly on international travellers , " anke bryson , faz weekly 's executive editor , told dw-world .
she said her staff of full-time journalists wrote predominately original content for the iht , with about a third of the supplement coming from translated faz articles . scaled back , or worse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you mean i have to write this twice ?
but the faz 's foray into english publishing has n't always been a smooth ride .
the english editorial staff has been cut dramatically since its launch in 2000 .
in 2002 , the paper ceased publication of its daily english edition and instead launched a new weekly publication . other attempts have fared even worse .
die welt newspaper , backed by the powerful axel springer publishing group , folded its english language offering entirely a few years ago . with that in mind , von blumencron has no illusions that spiegel 's effort will be easy .
" we obviously ca n't earn money with it right away , " he said .
" we 'll have to see how fast it grows . " yet some are hoping that spiegel 's entry to the english market is signalling the start of better times .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.08.2004 german news auf englisch großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerd still prefers his news auf deutsch costly and complicated , running a foreign language editorial operation is not an easy thing to do .
but that 's not stopping a growing number of german publications from experimenting with english-language news products . as germany 's state-backed international broadcaster , deutsche welle 's mandate is to provide unbiased news and information to people who may not necessarily understand german .
funded by german taxpayers , dw-world is able to compete in the rough-and-tumble world of english-speaking media . germany 's private print media do n't have that security or mandate , but that 's not stopping several publications - tempted by the chance to reach a wider audience - from exploring different ways to tap into the english market . the country 's leading weekly newsmagazine , der spiegel , has decided to become the latest to enter the fray , offering an english e-mail newsletter starting this autumn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first issue of der spiegel was published january 4 , 1947 . " we want to expand the spiegel brand to the english market .
there are a lot of people there that are aware of the magazine but they unfortunately ca n't read it , " spiegel online editor-in-chief mathias müller von blumencron told dw-world . managing news operations in foreign languages can be notoriously difficult , which is why spiegel is starting with a small team of three english-language editors who will work with the magazine 's online edition .
that way if the project does n't work out , the financial downside will be limited . the berliner zeitung newspaper last month quoted spiegel publisher fried von bismarck as saying the initial investment in the project would be limited to around half a million euros .
von blumencron said the daily newsletter would predominately have specialized original content , complemented by translated spiegel articles .
he expects the service to launch in october . a niche market ? horst röper , director of the dortmund-based formatt media institute , said despite spiegel 's top-drawer reputation , moving into the english media world was not without risk .
" it can certainly be successful , so long as one does n't have large expectations , " he said .
" generally foreign language products are niche products for niche markets . " spiegel is just the latest prestigious german publication to hop on the english bandwagon .

a military official went so far as to describe it as a " declaration of war . " government officials in khartoum said they can not meet the 30-day deadline set by the united nations to disarm the janjaweed militias who are accused of a campaign of murder and rape against the people of sudan 's southwestern darfur region .
the militia members are alleged to enjoy government support as part of their battle against rebels in the region . sudan 's foreign minister , mustafa osman ismail , described the deadline as " illogical " and said sudan would implement a 90-day program agreed earlier with the un secretary-general , kofi annan . he said the new urgency required by the west could be linked to " elections taking place in some western countries " or to its " guilty conscience over failing to prevent the 1994 genocide in rwanda . " other sudanese officials have been even more outspoken .
the army spokesman , mohammed bashir suleiman , described the motion as an " american declaration of war " and said the sudanese army was prepared to confront the enemies of sudan on land , sea and air . easing or worsening the conflict ? adam thaim , spokesman for the african union , said he had some understanding for the sudanese annoyance .
he added that the resolution came at a sensitive time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudanese displaced woman line up to receive " the pressure on the sudanese government was beginning to work , " he said .
" the sudanese government is fully aware of the risk of a bigger humanitarian tragedy in darfur .
the conflict is not really escalating , the conflict is instead easing and it is in this meantime that the un resolution came out so i can understand - without justifying - the position of the government of sudan . " but there is a feeling in europe and the us that the sudanese government is once more trying to avoid its international obligations . a spokesman for the us state department , adam ereli , said that there was no excuse for not taking action now . the resolution was not a declaration of war , he said , but simply a demand that sudan fulfil commitments it has already made to disarm the militias . germany responds to criticism german deputy foreign minister kerstin müller meanwhile defended her country 's position in the conflict in an open letter to the editor of the wa shington post on monday .
the us paper had criticized european countries in a previous editorial for not doing enough to resolve the problem .
müller countered that germany first introduced discussions about the darfur conflict to the un security council during the country 's presidency of that body in april .
she added that the eu has pledged more than $ 260 million -lrb- € 216 million -rrb- to help refugees and that germany also has earmarked more than $ 105 million for the reconstruction of sudan after a peace agreement is signed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kerstin müller müller -lrb- photo -rrb- described the resolution as an important step in helping to resolve the conflict .
" germany will do whatever is in its power to stop the violations of human rights in sudan and to solve the humanitarian crisis and the political conflict in darfur and elsewhere in that country , " müller wrote .
" it will support all efforts to find a political solution to the underlying problems .
this also would be an important contribution to our common fight against terrorism . "
a long term strategy needed thaim of the african union also argued that there 's a need for a long term strategy . " the disarmament of janjaweed militias , the investigation into human rights violations , are conditions to peace , but they are not the only conditions to peace , " thaim said .
" the darfur problem is more complex than that .
you have land issues , you have sociological issues , you have religious issues .
it 's very complicated and i think that what we should go towards is political dialogues for darfur . " thaim added that the african union had started such a dialogue , but said that talks were regrettably suspended because the rebels were being inflexible . un food program needs more money meanwhile , the united nations world food program has begun dropping aid to isolated areas of darfur from the air , as a response to the lack of security on the ground and the beginning of the rainy season . but it said that it has received only half the funds it needs for emergency work in darfur this year .

a military official went so far as to describe it as a " declaration of war . " government officials in khartoum said they can not meet the 30-day deadline set by the united nations to disarm the janjaweed militias who are accused of a campaign of murder and rape against the people of sudan 's southwestern darfur region .
the militia members are alleged to enjoy government support as part of their battle against rebels in the region . sudan 's foreign minister , mustafa osman ismail , described the deadline as " illogical " and said sudan would implement a 90-day program agreed earlier with the un secretary-general , kofi annan . he said the new urgency required by the west could be linked to " elections taking place in some western countries " or to its " guilty conscience over failing to prevent the 1994 genocide in rwanda . " other sudanese officials have been even more outspoken .
the army spokesman , mohammed bashir suleiman , described the motion as an " american declaration of war " and said the sudanese army was prepared to confront the enemies of sudan on land , sea and air . easing or worsening the conflict ? adam thaim , spokesman for the african union , said he had some understanding for the sudanese annoyance .
he added that the resolution came at a sensitive time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudanese displaced woman line up to receive " the pressure on the sudanese government was beginning to work , " he said .
" the sudanese government is fully aware of the risk of a bigger humanitarian tragedy in darfur .
the conflict is not really escalating , the conflict is instead easing and it is in this meantime that the un resolution came out so i can understand - without justifying - the position of the government of sudan . " but there is a feeling in europe and the us that the sudanese government is once more trying to avoid its international obligations . a spokesman for the us state department , adam ereli , said that there was no excuse for not taking action now . the resolution was not a declaration of war , he said , but simply a demand that sudan fulfil commitments it has already made to disarm the militias . germany responds to criticism german deputy foreign minister kerstin müller meanwhile defended her country 's position in the conflict in an open letter to the editor of the wa shington post on monday .
the us paper had criticized european countries in a previous editorial for not doing enough to resolve the problem .
müller countered that germany first introduced discussions about the darfur conflict to the un security council during the country 's presidency of that body in april .
she added that the eu has pledged more than $ 260 million -lrb- € 216 million -rrb- to help refugees and that germany also has earmarked more than $ 105 million for the reconstruction of sudan after a peace agreement is signed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kerstin müller müller -lrb- photo -rrb- described the resolution as an important step in helping to resolve the conflict .
" germany will do whatever is in its power to stop the violations of human rights in sudan and to solve the humanitarian crisis and the political conflict in darfur and elsewhere in that country , " müller wrote .
" it will support all efforts to find a political solution to the underlying problems .
this also would be an important contribution to our common fight against terrorism . "
a long term strategy needed thaim of the african union also argued that there 's a need for a long term strategy . " the disarmament of janjaweed militias , the investigation into human rights violations , are conditions to peace , but they are not the only conditions to peace , " thaim said .
" the darfur problem is more complex than that .
you have land issues , you have sociological issues , you have religious issues .
it 's very complicated and i think that what we should go towards is political dialogues for darfur . " thaim added that the african union had started such a dialogue , but said that talks were regrettably suspended because the rebels were being inflexible . un food program needs more money meanwhile , the united nations world food program has begun dropping aid to isolated areas of darfur from the air , as a response to the lack of security on the ground and the beginning of the rainy season . but it said that it has received only half the funds it needs for emergency work in darfur this year .

" normally you would have to go through the appeals process in an individual country -lrb- before going to a european court -rrb- , " pawelka told the newspaper .
" we will see what means the government will bring to bear against the independence of the courts .

he said given germany 's blame for the war and the nazi atrocities committed in poland , his government could by no means accept restitution claims which effectively " turn history on its head . "
" property issues related to world war ii are no longer a subject of controversy between our two governments , " schröder said referring to past discussions between berlin and warsaw . " neither the german government nor any other serious political force supports any restitution claims still being voiced .
this is our position , and we won ’ t hesitate to make this position clear before international courts , if need be , " he stressed . the chancellor has often said that while germans who were forced to abandon their homes undeniably suffered , it is wrong to put their fates on a par with those of jews or other polish citizens who bore the brunt of nazi aggression . testing the government 's resolve pawelka said the prussian claims society now aimed to test the government 's resolve in opposing the claims . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish officials plant a marker near the german-polish border at the oder river in 1945 he said that because polish courts would likely reject the lawsuit out of hand , the society would file claims at the same time with the european court of human rights in strasbourg . pawelka stressed , however , that the organization had no intention of victimizing poles a second time . " we never said that a pole who lives in a house or on property that once belonged to a german must leave it , " he said . " i do n't understand why this fear is being stoked , " he said , adding that the organization sought " solutions that are bearable for both sides . " polish officials are wary polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz warned monday that schröder 's rejection of reparations demands by germans did not close an issue which has dogged relations between the two neighbors . " the declaration is of great importance for poland and the poles , but does not close the issue once and for all , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wlodzimierz cimoszewicz cimoszewicz -lrb- photo -rrb- presciently warned that german expellees might press their claims further . " one could imagine theoretically that german expellees file claims with european tribunals even if their cases are rejected by polish and german courts , " he said after schröder 's speech on sunday . expellee organizations estimate that nine million germans were forced to leave poland after world war ii and that 13 percent of them owned real estate there .

11 attacks in the us said tuesday they will call for the case against him to be thrown out when he returns to trial next week . one of the attorneys for moroccan student mounir el motassadeq , josef grässle-münscher , told afp newsagency that he would argue that key witnesses in us custody had been tortured , making their testimony inadmissible in court . motassadeq , 30 , was sentenced in february 2003 to 15 years in prison for his involvement in the so-called hamburg cell around mohammad atta which produced three of the 19 hijackers who attacked new york and washington . but a federal tribunal quashed the conviction in march and sent the case back to the hamburg court that originally sentenced him , citing the absence of potentially crucial testimony by the hamburg mastermind behind the plot , ramzi binalshibh . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramzi binalshibh binalshibh -lrb- photo -rrb- , a yemeni national , is currently being held by us authorities in an undisclosed location . fair trial no longer possible ? grässle-münscher said he would argue that even if the united states now agreed to provide detailed information secured during the interrogation of binalshibh , it would be legally tainted . " a fair trial is no longer possible because the important evidence is either lacking or contaminated , " grässle-münscher said , referring to rumors that binalshibh had been tortured since he was handed over to the us authorities after his arrest in pakistan in september 2002 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq during his trial in february 2003 the hamburg court had found motassadeq guilty of membership in a terrorist organization and more than 3,000 counts of accessory to murder based on the logistical help he allegedly provided to the hijackers . after the federal tribunal rejected that judgment in the spring , motassadeq was released from prison .
his new trial is scheduled to start on august 10 and last until early 2005 . prosecution is confident britain 's observer newspaper reported last month that concerns surrounding the alleged torture of the key witnesses could force german prosecutors to abandon the retrial of motassadeq , because under german law courts can not accept evidence if it is thought to come under duress or torture . a senior german intelligence official reportedly told the observer that the inability to prove the testimony was admissible would make it worthless . " they contain no details as to where binalshibh was questioned , nor whether torture or other forms of force were used to make them talk , " the official said , saying german courts would be extremely tough after the abu ghraib prison torture scandal in iraq . but germany 's federal prosecutor said friday he was confident he could get a fresh conviction against motassadeq because he believed us authorities would now cooperate in supplying testimony from binalshibh . the us justice department had previously refused to provide detailed intelligence from terror suspects in its custody , citing national security concerns . will key witnesses testify ? grässle-münscher said he would insist binalshibh and all other alleged operatives from the al-qaeda network relevant to the case testify personally , a request already rejected by us authorities . " it would only be acceptable for us if these witnesses appear in court , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdelghani mzoudi -lrb- left -rrb- smiles besides his attorney guel pinar after his acquittal in february binalshibh has reportedly told his interrogators that motassadeq and a fellow moroccan who was acquitted in hamburg in february , abdelghani mzoudi -lrb- photo -rrb- , had nothing to do with the conspiracy to attack us targets . grässle-münscher said that even if binalshibh 's potentially favorable testimony is judged inadmissible by the court , it should still find his client not guilty . " if a defendant is forced to give up evidence because torture is used , the court can not hold that against him , " he said . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de prosecutors seen dropping charges against 9/11 suspect the most serious charges facing the only person ever to be convicted for the sept .

11 attacks in the us said tuesday they will call for the case against him to be thrown out when he returns to trial next week . one of the attorneys for moroccan student mounir el motassadeq , josef grässle-münscher , told afp newsagency that he would argue that key witnesses in us custody had been tortured , making their testimony inadmissible in court . motassadeq , 30 , was sentenced in february 2003 to 15 years in prison for his involvement in the so-called hamburg cell around mohammad atta which produced three of the 19 hijackers who attacked new york and washington . but a federal tribunal quashed the conviction in march and sent the case back to the hamburg court that originally sentenced him , citing the absence of potentially crucial testimony by the hamburg mastermind behind the plot , ramzi binalshibh . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramzi binalshibh binalshibh -lrb- photo -rrb- , a yemeni national , is currently being held by us authorities in an undisclosed location . fair trial no longer possible ? grässle-münscher said he would argue that even if the united states now agreed to provide detailed information secured during the interrogation of binalshibh , it would be legally tainted . " a fair trial is no longer possible because the important evidence is either lacking or contaminated , " grässle-münscher said , referring to rumors that binalshibh had been tortured since he was handed over to the us authorities after his arrest in pakistan in september 2002 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq during his trial in february 2003 the hamburg court had found motassadeq guilty of membership in a terrorist organization and more than 3,000 counts of accessory to murder based on the logistical help he allegedly provided to the hijackers . after the federal tribunal rejected that judgment in the spring , motassadeq was released from prison .
his new trial is scheduled to start on august 10 and last until early 2005 . prosecution is confident britain 's observer newspaper reported last month that concerns surrounding the alleged torture of the key witnesses could force german prosecutors to abandon the retrial of motassadeq , because under german law courts can not accept evidence if it is thought to come under duress or torture . a senior german intelligence official reportedly told the observer that the inability to prove the testimony was admissible would make it worthless . " they contain no details as to where binalshibh was questioned , nor whether torture or other forms of force were used to make them talk , " the official said , saying german courts would be extremely tough after the abu ghraib prison torture scandal in iraq . but germany 's federal prosecutor said friday he was confident he could get a fresh conviction against motassadeq because he believed us authorities would now cooperate in supplying testimony from binalshibh . the us justice department had previously refused to provide detailed intelligence from terror suspects in its custody , citing national security concerns . will key witnesses testify ? grässle-münscher said he would insist binalshibh and all other alleged operatives from the al-qaeda network relevant to the case testify personally , a request already rejected by us authorities . " it would only be acceptable for us if these witnesses appear in court , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdelghani mzoudi -lrb- left -rrb- smiles besides his attorney guel pinar after his acquittal in february binalshibh has reportedly told his interrogators that motassadeq and a fellow moroccan who was acquitted in hamburg in february , abdelghani mzoudi -lrb- photo -rrb- , had nothing to do with the conspiracy to attack us targets . grässle-münscher said that even if binalshibh 's potentially favorable testimony is judged inadmissible by the court , it should still find his client not guilty .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 03.08.2004 terror suspect lawyers to seek case dismissal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq 's 15-year sentence was thrown out in march lawyers for the only man convicted over the sept .
11 attacks in the us said tuesday they will call for the case against him to be thrown out when he returns to trial next week . one of the attorneys for moroccan student mounir el motassadeq , josef grässle-münscher , told afp newsagency that he would argue that key witnesses in us custody had been tortured , making their testimony inadmissible in court . motassadeq , 30 , was sentenced in february 2003 to 15 years in prison for his involvement in the so-called hamburg cell around mohammad atta which produced three of the 19 hijackers who attacked new york and washington . but a federal tribunal quashed the conviction in march and sent the case back to the hamburg court that originally sentenced him , citing the absence of potentially crucial testimony by the hamburg mastermind behind the plot , ramzi binalshibh . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramzi binalshibh binalshibh -lrb- photo -rrb- , a yemeni national , is currently being held by us authorities in an undisclosed location . fair trial no longer possible ? grässle-münscher said he would argue that even if the united states now agreed to provide detailed information secured during the interrogation of binalshibh , it would be legally tainted . " a fair trial is no longer possible because the important evidence is either lacking or contaminated , " grässle-münscher said , referring to rumors that binalshibh had been tortured since he was handed over to the us authorities after his arrest in pakistan in september 2002 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq during his trial in february 2003 the hamburg court had found motassadeq guilty of membership in a terrorist organization and more than 3,000 counts of accessory to murder based on the logistical help he allegedly provided to the hijackers . after the federal tribunal rejected that judgment in the spring , motassadeq was released from prison .
his new trial is scheduled to start on august 10 and last until early 2005 . prosecution is confident britain 's observer newspaper reported last month that concerns surrounding the alleged torture of the key witnesses could force german prosecutors to abandon the retrial of motassadeq , because under german law courts can not accept evidence if it is thought to come under duress or torture . a senior german intelligence official reportedly told the observer that the inability to prove the testimony was admissible would make it worthless . " they contain no details as to where binalshibh was questioned , nor whether torture or other forms of force were used to make them talk , " the official said , saying german courts would be extremely tough after the abu ghraib prison torture scandal in iraq . but germany 's federal prosecutor said friday he was confident he could get a fresh conviction against motassadeq because he believed us authorities would now cooperate in supplying testimony from binalshibh . the us justice department had previously refused to provide detailed intelligence from terror suspects in its custody , citing national security concerns . will key witnesses testify ? grässle-münscher said he would insist binalshibh and all other alleged operatives from the al-qaeda network relevant to the case testify personally , a request already rejected by us authorities . " it would only be acceptable for us if these witnesses appear in court , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdelghani mzoudi -lrb- left -rrb- smiles besides his attorney guel pinar after his acquittal in february binalshibh has reportedly told his interrogators that motassadeq and a fellow moroccan who was acquitted in hamburg in february , abdelghani mzoudi -lrb- photo -rrb- , had nothing to do with the conspiracy to attack us targets . grässle-münscher said that even if binalshibh 's potentially favorable testimony is judged inadmissible by the court , it should still find his client not guilty . " if a defendant is forced to give up evidence because torture is used , the court can not hold that against him , " he said . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de prosecutors seen dropping charges against 9/11 suspect the most serious charges facing the only person ever to be convicted for the sept .

11 attacks in the us said tuesday they will call for the case against him to be thrown out when he returns to trial next week . one of the attorneys for moroccan student mounir el motassadeq , josef grässle-münscher , told afp newsagency that he would argue that key witnesses in us custody had been tortured , making their testimony inadmissible in court . motassadeq , 30 , was sentenced in february 2003 to 15 years in prison for his involvement in the so-called hamburg cell around mohammad atta which produced three of the 19 hijackers who attacked new york and washington . but a federal tribunal quashed the conviction in march and sent the case back to the hamburg court that originally sentenced him , citing the absence of potentially crucial testimony by the hamburg mastermind behind the plot , ramzi binalshibh . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramzi binalshibh binalshibh -lrb- photo -rrb- , a yemeni national , is currently being held by us authorities in an undisclosed location . fair trial no longer possible ? grässle-münscher said he would argue that even if the united states now agreed to provide detailed information secured during the interrogation of binalshibh , it would be legally tainted . " a fair trial is no longer possible because the important evidence is either lacking or contaminated , " grässle-münscher said , referring to rumors that binalshibh had been tortured since he was handed over to the us authorities after his arrest in pakistan in september 2002 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq during his trial in february 2003 the hamburg court had found motassadeq guilty of membership in a terrorist organization and more than 3,000 counts of accessory to murder based on the logistical help he allegedly provided to the hijackers . after the federal tribunal rejected that judgment in the spring , motassadeq was released from prison .
his new trial is scheduled to start on august 10 and last until early 2005 . prosecution is confident britain 's observer newspaper reported last month that concerns surrounding the alleged torture of the key witnesses could force german prosecutors to abandon the retrial of motassadeq , because under german law courts can not accept evidence if it is thought to come under duress or torture . a senior german intelligence official reportedly told the observer that the inability to prove the testimony was admissible would make it worthless . " they contain no details as to where binalshibh was questioned , nor whether torture or other forms of force were used to make them talk , " the official said , saying german courts would be extremely tough after the abu ghraib prison torture scandal in iraq . but germany 's federal prosecutor said friday he was confident he could get a fresh conviction against motassadeq because he believed us authorities would now cooperate in supplying testimony from binalshibh . the us justice department had previously refused to provide detailed intelligence from terror suspects in its custody , citing national security concerns . will key witnesses testify ? grässle-münscher said he would insist binalshibh and all other alleged operatives from the al-qaeda network relevant to the case testify personally , a request already rejected by us authorities . " it would only be acceptable for us if these witnesses appear in court , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdelghani mzoudi -lrb- left -rrb- smiles besides his attorney guel pinar after his acquittal in february binalshibh has reportedly told his interrogators that motassadeq and a fellow moroccan who was acquitted in hamburg in february , abdelghani mzoudi -lrb- photo -rrb- , had nothing to do with the conspiracy to attack us targets . grässle-münscher said that even if binalshibh 's potentially favorable testimony is judged inadmissible by the court , it should still find his client not guilty .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.08.2004 -pipe- 15:00 utc controversy over kohl 's stasi files continues files compiled by the former east german secret service -lrb- stasi -rrb- on former german chancellor helmut kohl could become public despite a recent court ruling imposing major restrictions on their publication , the head of the german agency in charge of the files said tuesday .
" certain documents can be released without kohl 's consent , " said marianne birthler , adding that her agency was preparing publication of the files .
the court had ruled in june that kohl 's filed could not be released and that access to other filed for researchers and journalists had to be severely limited .
birthler said that in her opinion , the fight over the kohl files arose because some hope to garner evidence about kohl 's role in a bribery scandal involving his christian democratic union party .
she said that such information could not be released anyway , as the files are only released to give people insight into the workings of the stasi ministry .
she added that most requests to see the files still come from private individuals who want to see any documents the stasi collected about them . dw-world.de court hands partial victory to kohl in stasi case a german appeals court has ruled to impose major restrictions on the release and publication of information from the stasi files of former chancellor helmut kohl .

but that 's not stopping a growing number of german publications from experimenting with english-language news products . as germany 's state-backed international broadcaster , deutsche welle 's mandate is to provide unbiased news and information to people who may not necessarily understand german .
funded by german taxpayers , dw-world is able to compete in the rough-and-tumble world of english-speaking media . germany 's private print media do n't have that security or mandate , but that 's not stopping several publications - tempted by the chance to reach a wider audience - from exploring different ways to tap into the english market . the country 's leading weekly newsmagazine , der spiegel , has decided to become the latest to enter the fray , offering an english e-mail newsletter starting this autumn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first issue of der spiegel was published january 4 , 1947 . " we want to expand the spiegel brand to the english market .
there are a lot of people there that are aware of the magazine but they unfortunately ca n't read it , " spiegel online editor-in-chief mathias müller von blumencron told dw-world . managing news operations in foreign languages can be notoriously difficult , which is why spiegel is starting with a small team of three english-language editors who will work with the magazine 's online edition .
that way if the project does n't work out , the financial downside will be limited . the berliner zeitung newspaper last month quoted spiegel publisher fried von bismarck as saying the initial investment in the project would be limited to around half a million euros .
von blumencron said the daily newsletter would predominately have specialized original content , complemented by translated spiegel articles .
he expects the service to launch in october . a niche market ? horst röper , director of the dortmund-based formatt media institute , said despite spiegel 's top-drawer reputation , moving into the english media world was not without risk .
" it can certainly be successful , so long as one does n't have large expectations , " he said .
" generally foreign language products are niche products for niche markets . " spiegel is just the latest prestigious german publication to hop on the english bandwagon .
both the süddeutsche zeitung and frankfurter allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- newspapers already have weekly english supplements . however , the two papers have taken different approaches : whereas the faz supplies the german edition of the international herald tribune -lrb- iht -rrb- with an english faz weekly supplement , the süddeutsche each monday publishes a section with selected articles from the new york times in english .
so the süddeutsche is focusing on germans who read english and the faz is catering to english-speakers who want to read about germany . " we are targeting different groups - we are focused mainly on international travellers , " anke bryson , faz weekly 's executive editor , told dw-world .
she said her staff of full-time journalists wrote predominately original content for the iht , with about a third of the supplement coming from translated faz articles . scaled back , or worse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you mean i have to write this twice ?
but the faz 's foray into english publishing has n't always been a smooth ride .
the english editorial staff has been cut dramatically since its launch in 2000 .
in 2002 , the paper ceased publication of its daily english edition and instead launched a new weekly publication . other attempts have fared even worse .
die welt newspaper , backed by the powerful axel springer publishing group , folded its english language offering entirely a few years ago . with that in mind , von blumencron has no illusions that spiegel 's effort will be easy .
" we obviously ca n't earn money with it right away , " he said .
" we 'll have to see how fast it grows . " yet some are hoping that spiegel 's entry to the english market is signalling the start of better times . " it 's still a difficult business to be in - however , that 's the case for the entire publishing industry at the moment , " said bryson from the faz .

but that 's not stopping a growing number of german publications from experimenting with english-language news products . as germany 's state-backed international broadcaster , deutsche welle 's mandate is to provide unbiased news and information to people who may not necessarily understand german .
funded by german taxpayers , dw-world is able to compete in the rough-and-tumble world of english-speaking media . germany 's private print media do n't have that security or mandate , but that 's not stopping several publications - tempted by the chance to reach a wider audience - from exploring different ways to tap into the english market . the country 's leading weekly newsmagazine , der spiegel , has decided to become the latest to enter the fray , offering an english e-mail newsletter starting this autumn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first issue of der spiegel was published january 4 , 1947 . " we want to expand the spiegel brand to the english market .
there are a lot of people there that are aware of the magazine but they unfortunately ca n't read it , " spiegel online editor-in-chief mathias müller von blumencron told dw-world . managing news operations in foreign languages can be notoriously difficult , which is why spiegel is starting with a small team of three english-language editors who will work with the magazine 's online edition .
that way if the project does n't work out , the financial downside will be limited . the berliner zeitung newspaper last month quoted spiegel publisher fried von bismarck as saying the initial investment in the project would be limited to around half a million euros .
von blumencron said the daily newsletter would predominately have specialized original content , complemented by translated spiegel articles .
he expects the service to launch in october . a niche market ? horst röper , director of the dortmund-based formatt media institute , said despite spiegel 's top-drawer reputation , moving into the english media world was not without risk .
" it can certainly be successful , so long as one does n't have large expectations , " he said .
" generally foreign language products are niche products for niche markets . " spiegel is just the latest prestigious german publication to hop on the english bandwagon .
both the süddeutsche zeitung and frankfurter allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- newspapers already have weekly english supplements . however , the two papers have taken different approaches : whereas the faz supplies the german edition of the international herald tribune -lrb- iht -rrb- with an english faz weekly supplement , the süddeutsche each monday publishes a section with selected articles from the new york times in english .
so the süddeutsche is focusing on germans who read english and the faz is catering to english-speakers who want to read about germany . " we are targeting different groups - we are focused mainly on international travellers , " anke bryson , faz weekly 's executive editor , told dw-world .
she said her staff of full-time journalists wrote predominately original content for the iht , with about a third of the supplement coming from translated faz articles . scaled back , or worse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you mean i have to write this twice ?
but the faz 's foray into english publishing has n't always been a smooth ride .
the english editorial staff has been cut dramatically since its launch in 2000 .
in 2002 , the paper ceased publication of its daily english edition and instead launched a new weekly publication . other attempts have fared even worse .
die welt newspaper , backed by the powerful axel springer publishing group , folded its english language offering entirely a few years ago . with that in mind , von blumencron has no illusions that spiegel 's effort will be easy .

both the süddeutsche zeitung and frankfurter allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- newspapers already have weekly english supplements . however , the two papers have taken different approaches : whereas the faz supplies the german edition of the international herald tribune -lrb- iht -rrb- with an english faz weekly supplement , the süddeutsche each monday publishes a section with selected articles from the new york times in english .
so the süddeutsche is focusing on germans who read english and the faz is catering to english-speakers who want to read about germany . " we are targeting different groups - we are focused mainly on international travellers , " anke bryson , faz weekly 's executive editor , told dw-world .
she said her staff of full-time journalists wrote predominately original content for the iht , with about a third of the supplement coming from translated faz articles . scaled back , or worse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you mean i have to write this twice ?
but the faz 's foray into english publishing has n't always been a smooth ride .
the english editorial staff has been cut dramatically since its launch in 2000 .
in 2002 , the paper ceased publication of its daily english edition and instead launched a new weekly publication . other attempts have fared even worse .
die welt newspaper , backed by the powerful axel springer publishing group , folded its english language offering entirely a few years ago . with that in mind , von blumencron has no illusions that spiegel 's effort will be easy .
" we obviously ca n't earn money with it right away , " he said .
" we 'll have to see how fast it grows . " yet some are hoping that spiegel 's entry to the english market is signalling the start of better times . " it 's still a difficult business to be in - however , that 's the case for the entire publishing industry at the moment , " said bryson from the faz .
" but i 'm pleased that the market for english language publications in germany appears to be reviving .

a military official went so far as to describe it as a " declaration of war . " government officials in khartoum said they can not meet the 30-day deadline set by the united nations to disarm the janjaweed militias who are accused of a campaign of murder and rape against the people of sudan 's southwestern darfur region .
the militia members are alleged to enjoy government support as part of their battle against rebels in the region . sudan 's foreign minister , mustafa osman ismail , described the deadline as " illogical " and said sudan would implement a 90-day program agreed earlier with the un secretary-general , kofi annan . he said the new urgency required by the west could be linked to " elections taking place in some western countries " or to its " guilty conscience over failing to prevent the 1994 genocide in rwanda . " other sudanese officials have been even more outspoken .
the army spokesman , mohammed bashir suleiman , described the motion as an " american declaration of war " and said the sudanese army was prepared to confront the enemies of sudan on land , sea and air . easing or worsening the conflict ? adam thaim , spokesman for the african union , said he had some understanding for the sudanese annoyance .
he added that the resolution came at a sensitive time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudanese displaced woman line up to receive " the pressure on the sudanese government was beginning to work , " he said .
" the sudanese government is fully aware of the risk of a bigger humanitarian tragedy in darfur .
the conflict is not really escalating , the conflict is instead easing and it is in this meantime that the un resolution came out so i can understand - without justifying - the position of the government of sudan . " but there is a feeling in europe and the us that the sudanese government is once more trying to avoid its international obligations . a spokesman for the us state department , adam ereli , said that there was no excuse for not taking action now . the resolution was not a declaration of war , he said , but simply a demand that sudan fulfil commitments it has already made to disarm the militias . germany responds to criticism german deputy foreign minister kerstin müller meanwhile defended her country 's position in the conflict in an open letter to the editor of the wa shington post on monday .
the us paper had criticized european countries in a previous editorial for not doing enough to resolve the problem .
müller countered that germany first introduced discussions about the darfur conflict to the un security council during the country 's presidency of that body in april .
she added that the eu has pledged more than $ 260 million -lrb- € 216 million -rrb- to help refugees and that germany also has earmarked more than $ 105 million for the reconstruction of sudan after a peace agreement is signed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kerstin müller müller -lrb- photo -rrb- described the resolution as an important step in helping to resolve the conflict .
" germany will do whatever is in its power to stop the violations of human rights in sudan and to solve the humanitarian crisis and the political conflict in darfur and elsewhere in that country , " müller wrote .
" it will support all efforts to find a political solution to the underlying problems .
this also would be an important contribution to our common fight against terrorism . "
a long term strategy needed thaim of the african union also argued that there 's a need for a long term strategy . " the disarmament of janjaweed militias , the investigation into human rights violations , are conditions to peace , but they are not the only conditions to peace , " thaim said .
" the darfur problem is more complex than that .
you have land issues , you have sociological issues , you have religious issues .
it 's very complicated and i think that what we should go towards is political dialogues for darfur . " thaim added that the african union had started such a dialogue , but said that talks were regrettably suspended because the rebels were being inflexible . un food program needs more money meanwhile , the united nations world food program has begun dropping aid to isolated areas of darfur from the air , as a response to the lack of security on the ground and the beginning of the rainy season . but it said that it has received only half the funds it needs for emergency work in darfur this year .

a military official went so far as to describe it as a " declaration of war . " government officials in khartoum said they can not meet the 30-day deadline set by the united nations to disarm the janjaweed militias who are accused of a campaign of murder and rape against the people of sudan 's southwestern darfur region .
the militia members are alleged to enjoy government support as part of their battle against rebels in the region . sudan 's foreign minister , mustafa osman ismail , described the deadline as " illogical " and said sudan would implement a 90-day program agreed earlier with the un secretary-general , kofi annan . he said the new urgency required by the west could be linked to " elections taking place in some western countries " or to its " guilty conscience over failing to prevent the 1994 genocide in rwanda . " other sudanese officials have been even more outspoken .
the army spokesman , mohammed bashir suleiman , described the motion as an " american declaration of war " and said the sudanese army was prepared to confront the enemies of sudan on land , sea and air . easing or worsening the conflict ? adam thaim , spokesman for the african union , said he had some understanding for the sudanese annoyance .
he added that the resolution came at a sensitive time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudanese displaced woman line up to receive " the pressure on the sudanese government was beginning to work , " he said .
" the sudanese government is fully aware of the risk of a bigger humanitarian tragedy in darfur .
the conflict is not really escalating , the conflict is instead easing and it is in this meantime that the un resolution came out so i can understand - without justifying - the position of the government of sudan . " but there is a feeling in europe and the us that the sudanese government is once more trying to avoid its international obligations . a spokesman for the us state department , adam ereli , said that there was no excuse for not taking action now . the resolution was not a declaration of war , he said , but simply a demand that sudan fulfil commitments it has already made to disarm the militias . germany responds to criticism german deputy foreign minister kerstin müller meanwhile defended her country 's position in the conflict in an open letter to the editor of the wa shington post on monday .
the us paper had criticized european countries in a previous editorial for not doing enough to resolve the problem .
müller countered that germany first introduced discussions about the darfur conflict to the un security council during the country 's presidency of that body in april .
she added that the eu has pledged more than $ 260 million -lrb- € 216 million -rrb- to help refugees and that germany also has earmarked more than $ 105 million for the reconstruction of sudan after a peace agreement is signed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kerstin müller müller -lrb- photo -rrb- described the resolution as an important step in helping to resolve the conflict .
" germany will do whatever is in its power to stop the violations of human rights in sudan and to solve the humanitarian crisis and the political conflict in darfur and elsewhere in that country , " müller wrote .
" it will support all efforts to find a political solution to the underlying problems .
this also would be an important contribution to our common fight against terrorism . "
a long term strategy needed thaim of the african union also argued that there 's a need for a long term strategy . " the disarmament of janjaweed militias , the investigation into human rights violations , are conditions to peace , but they are not the only conditions to peace , " thaim said .
" the darfur problem is more complex than that .
you have land issues , you have sociological issues , you have religious issues .
it 's very complicated and i think that what we should go towards is political dialogues for darfur . " thaim added that the african union had started such a dialogue , but said that talks were regrettably suspended because the rebels were being inflexible . un food program needs more money meanwhile , the united nations world food program has begun dropping aid to isolated areas of darfur from the air , as a response to the lack of security on the ground and the beginning of the rainy season . but it said that it has received only half the funds it needs for emergency work in darfur this year .

" normally you would have to go through the appeals process in an individual country -lrb- before going to a european court -rrb- , " pawelka told the newspaper .
" we will see what means the government will bring to bear against the independence of the courts . " the organization could not be reached for comment tuesday , saying on its answering machine that it had closed its offices until thursday . schröder dismisses reparations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder -lrb- right -rrb- and poland 's president aleksander kwasniewski in front of the monument to child insurgents in warsaw schröder -lrb- photo , right -rrb- on sunday firmly dismissed reparations demands by germans forced to leave poland after the war , ahead of commemorations in warsaw marking the 60th anniversary of the city 's failed uprising against the nazis in 1944 .
he said given germany 's blame for the war and the nazi atrocities committed in poland , his government could by no means accept restitution claims which effectively " turn history on its head . "
" property issues related to world war ii are no longer a subject of controversy between our two governments , " schröder said referring to past discussions between berlin and warsaw . " neither the german government nor any other serious political force supports any restitution claims still being voiced .
this is our position , and we won ’ t hesitate to make this position clear before international courts , if need be , " he stressed . the chancellor has often said that while germans who were forced to abandon their homes undeniably suffered , it is wrong to put their fates on a par with those of jews or other polish citizens who bore the brunt of nazi aggression . testing the government 's resolve pawelka said the prussian claims society now aimed to test the government 's resolve in opposing the claims . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish officials plant a marker near the german-polish border at the oder river in 1945 he said that because polish courts would likely reject the lawsuit out of hand , the society would file claims at the same time with the european court of human rights in strasbourg . pawelka stressed , however , that the organization had no intention of victimizing poles a second time . " we never said that a pole who lives in a house or on property that once belonged to a german must leave it , " he said . " i do n't understand why this fear is being stoked , " he said , adding that the organization sought " solutions that are bearable for both sides . " polish officials are wary polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz warned monday that schröder 's rejection of reparations demands by germans did not close an issue which has dogged relations between the two neighbors . " the declaration is of great importance for poland and the poles , but does not close the issue once and for all , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wlodzimierz cimoszewicz cimoszewicz -lrb- photo -rrb- presciently warned that german expellees might press their claims further . " one could imagine theoretically that german expellees file claims with european tribunals even if their cases are rejected by polish and german courts , " he said after schröder 's speech on sunday . expellee organizations estimate that nine million germans were forced to leave poland after world war ii and that 13 percent of them owned real estate there .

engineers at cambridge university are creating a system which uses photo-recognition software to find a person 's location to within one meter .
users can take a photo of the nearest building on their mobile handset and send it to the service along with details of where they should be .
software recognises the building and sends directions via a text message .
lost in japan the system was the idea of roberto cipolla , professor of information engineering at the university .
he decided it was a necessary tool after getting lost on his way to meetings in japan .
his team has now developed a program which matches a photograph of a building with images on a database .

the spacecraft blasted off just before 0616 gmt on tuesday from cape canaveral in florida , us , aboard a boeing delta 2 rocket for a seven-year journey .
it is the first us mission to mercury for more than 30 years .
after arriving in 2011 , the probe will orbit mercury for a year to explore its atmosphere , composition and structure .
a scheduled lift-off on monday had to be scrubbed due to thick clouds .
the poor weather is understood to have been due to residual effects of tropical storm alex .
during its 7.9bn km voyage it will also make one flyby of earth , two of venus and three of mercury before slipping into orbit around the solar system 's innermost planet .
the probe will gather information on the composition and structure of mercury 's crust , its geological history , polar regions , atmosphere and magnetic environment as well as the make-up of its core .
mercurial world scientists hope the $ 427m mission will help solve some of the mysteries surrounding this enigmatic world .
mercury is probably the least explored of the so-called rocky planets that also include venus , earth and mars .
in 1973 , nasa launched the mariner 10 spacecraft which flew by the planet three times , but was only able to photograph 45 % of its surface .
astronomers already know that mercury - which has a comparable density to earth even though it is much smaller - is about two-thirds iron .
but why it became so much richer in this metal than the other inner planets is unknown .
some scientists think the planet may once have been rocky but lost its exterior , perhaps through exposure to solar winds or through some giant impact .
sean solomon , principal scientist for the mission , said he also wanted to understand why the solar system 's inner planets -lrb- mercury , venus , earth and mars -rrb- are so different from its outer planets like jupiter and saturn .
for this it was important " to study the most extreme of those outcomes , and that 's mercury , " dr solomon explained .
mercury is also the only inner planet besides earth with a global magnetic field .
scientists hope to learn how this formed .
fire and ice one of the most intriguing mysteries about mercury , however , is the apparent presence of ice on its surface .
on a planet where surface temperatures at the equator can reach 450c -lrb- about 840f -rrb- , any ice must stay out of the sun , inside the shadowy interior of craters at the poles .
radio telescopes on earth have detected the signature of ice in craters at some shaded , high latitude regions , where the temperature could remain below -184c -lrb- -300f -rrb- .
but some scientists caution that the " ice " could actually be super-frozen silica or something else .
the planet mercury closest planet to the sun diameter : 4,800km mercurian year : 88 days has global magnetic field mercury messenger carries seven scientific instruments to characterise the properties of its target planet .
it will operate at room temperature behind a screen of heat-resistant ceramic fabric .
the 1.2-tonne spacecraft also carries a heat radiation system and will pass only briefly over the hottest regions of the planet , so limiting exposure to the intense heat bouncing back from mercury 's broiling surface .

dublin-based ryanair said it had 28 % more passengers and 23 % higher revenues year on year during april to june .
however , its yield - the money it makes per passenger - was down 6 % and could drop as much as 20 % in the winter .
the carrier said expansion plans were on track , with more airports vying for ryanair flights than it could handle .
ryanair 's pre-tax profits during the quarter were up 28 % to 57.7m euros .
however , the strong year-on-year growth figures were flattered by the fact that a year ago ryanair bought its faltering rival buzz , sustaining substantial restructuring costs which weakened that quarter 's results .
' chronically loss-making competitors ' ryanair chief executive michael o 'leary said the numbers reflected " the continued disciplined roll out of ryanair 's low-fares model " .
and he repeated his prediction that both " high cost , high fare " rivals and other budget carriers would not be able to compete with his company .
this winter the industry could expect " even more airline casualties " , he said in a statement , as " chronically loss making competitors " tried to " dump prices " .
as a result , ryanair would see its yields fall by between 5 % and 10 % this summer , and between 10 % and 20 % this winter .
the cautious yield forecast is a repeat of guidance given to investors earlier in the year - this quarter 's decline of 6 % is at the lower end of predictions .
soaring oil prices , which have troubled many ryanair rivals , have not been a problem so far , with the company being " almost fully hedged " until the end of september .
however , after that date ryanair will be " largely unhedged " , because mr o 'leary expects oil prices to fall over the medium term and " it would be unwise to lock-in -lsb- oil prices -rsb- at the current high rates " .
driving down airport costs ryanair also said its expansion programme was on track , with its two new bases at rome ciampino and girona near barcelona performing " particularly well " .
the company is now eyeing the new eu member countries , and says it has " far more offers " from airports vying for its business than it can presently handle .
this would " drive down airports costs " , ryanair said .
mr o 'leary also took a swipe at uk airport operator baa , which is currently its opponent in a high court battle over airport charges .
ryanair objects to a special fuel levy charged to pay for a fuel hydrant system .
the airline argues that baa has recovered more than three times the original cost of the system .
baa , in turn , recently raised ryanair 's landing fees at stansted airport .
in his statement to the stock exchange mr o 'leary , who is not known for mincing his words , accused baa of an " anti-consumer rip-off " .
