according to news reports , most german states are supporting the plan to let states rather than the federal government decide on opening hours during the work week .

supporters of the plan say the liberalization could take effect as early as next spring . dw-world.de high court rejects liberalizing store hours germany 's highest court decided on wednesday that the country 's strict shopping hours are in line with the constitution .

" greeted the right-wing npd success in saxony germany woke up to fears that the political tremors sparked by state elections in saxony and brandenburg on sunday could lead to deeper division within their country and scare off investors . observers say the success of the party of democratic socialism , the successor to east germany 's communist party , and the extreme right national party of germany -lrb- npd -rrb- and german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- in sunday 's elections show how angry east germans are at the reality they face 14 years after reunification . the pds rode a wave of discontent over chancellor gerhard schröder 's tough social reforms to 28 percent of the vote , making them second-strongest party in brandenburg , behind schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- . the governing spd and conservative christian democratic union " got a serious slap in the face , " said lothar bisky , the brandenburg parliamentary head for the pds , a party that most analysts left for dead after their failure in the last federal election . left-wingers " divide " the country , says schily though the party will most likely be excluded from a coalition government - the spd is more likely to pick the conservative christian democratic union - their success has nevertheless sent the government in berlin a message , and one they do n't like to hear .
by making themselves , as a regional party , the " mouthpiece of a part of germany " they are deepening the divide between east and west , interior minister otto schily said of the party , which has only found success so far in the east . the same goes for the npd , which schily tried and failed to ban two years ago .
based on their sunday success , the right wing party can claim 12 seats in saxony 's parliament .
the 9.2 percent they won was almost as much as the 9.8 percent of the social democratic party , the party of germany 's chancellor .
right wing candidate ignored on television " today is a fantastic day for all germans that still want to be bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holger apfel -lrb- in brown -rrb- , celebrates with npd functionaries germans , " the npd 's top candidate , holger apfel , said during a round of candidate interviews in german station zdf 's studios .
soon after his comment , the other candidates walked off the set and the reporter broke off apfel 's diatribe . political scientists say the miserable economic climate and the anger of young east germans that fuelled the npd 's sunday success could spark a worrying trend .
" if some sort of economic miracle doesn ’ t take place in the east , our society 's potential for supporting right wing politics could reach high levels , " said political scientist jürgen felter on the german talk show sabine christiansen , sunday night ..
he estimated the potential at 15 percent across germany . saxony state officials fear the presence of right- wing extremists in the state parliament will scare off the international investors that have made saxony one of the few economic bright spots in the east .
in recent years , the state has been able to profile itself as a center for bio-technology and microchip production while enjoying an increase in tourism . ahead of the elections , saxony 's premier , georg milbradt , said that should the npd make it into the parliament , he need n't bother going to america anymore to promote his state . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder 's social democrats suffer fresh losses german chancellor schröder 's social democrats lost major ground in elections on sunday in two former communist states as parties from the extreme right and far left posted electoral gains .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 20.09.2004 iran rejects un nuclear demands großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran could face un sanctions for its nuclear program iran 's chief nuclear negotiator hassan rohani referred to demands from the international atomic energy agency to freeze all work on uranium enrichment as " illegal " . " iran will not accept any obligation regarding the suspension of uranium enrichment , " rohani said at a news conference on sunday .
" no international body can force iran to do so . "
over the weekend , the united nations ' nuclear watchdog , iaea , had unanimously adopted a joint us-european resolution giving iran two months to stop producing enriched uranium or face referral to the security council .
iran digs its heels in according to reuters news agency , the resolution agreed to by the iaea 's board of governors called on iran to freeze all activities related to uranium enrichment and to grant full and prompt access to the iaea 's inspectors , as well as provide them with any further information needed , by nov .
25 .
iran responded by saying that if the issue were referred to the security council for possible sanctions , it would respond by blocking snap checks of its atomic facilities .
hassan rohani , head of iran 's supreme national security council , added that were the case to go to the security council , iran would also consider withdrawing from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , which it signed in 2003 .
" if they want to send iran to the security council , it is not wise , and we will stop implementing the additional protocol , " he said .
the additional protocol to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty calls for snap nuclear checks by iaea inspectors .
a " peaceful " nuclear program tehran has said it wants to secure its own source of fuel for power stations so that it is not dependent on other countries and stresses that iran has a legal right to develop nuclear power .
rohani insisted that no institution had the authority to deprive a country of a peaceful nuclear energy program .
but experts also say that enrichment is an integral step in the production of atomic weapons , and washington has long harbored suspicions about the islamic country 's aims for developing its nuclear capacity .
the us believes that oil-rich iran , which the bush administration described as a member of the " axis of evil , " has no need for nuclear reactors , even for civilian programs .
criticism from eu the threatening posture from tehran marks a turn-around from last october , when the country agreed to more stringent inspections and signed the additional protocol .
at the time , iran also consented to the suspension of uranium enrichment activities .
in return , britain , france and germany , promised to help develop technology for a civil atomic energy plant .
but last week , the european union abandoned its policy of " constructive engagement , " after the bloc 's big three joined forces with the united states and decided to issue a deadline for tehran to comply with international demands dispel concerns about nuclear activities .
" the eu calls on iran to heed the content of the resolution adopted by iaea 's board of governors , in particular with regard to the necessity to suspend fully all its enrichment related activities , " the head of the dutch delegation told a meeting of members of the iaea on behalf of the eu .
tehran insists it abided by the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and allowed spot inspections proving the intention behind its nuclear program was civilian in nature .
officials in tehran also point out that the suspension of enrichment was not a legal requirement but a voluntary measure .
in november , the iaea board of governors will meet to review iran 's alleged nuclear weapons program .
the country has until then to answer all outstanding questions . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us , eu agree to resolution on iran on thursday , the us and key eu allies agreed on a draft resolution calling on iran to end its nuclear program .
by allowing some tough wording , the eu is backing away from its previous policy of constructive engagement .

17 , 2004 -rrb- iran said to be close to nuclear deal ahead of a meeting of the un 's nuclear watchdog next week , diplomats said iran has agreed in principle to freeze some of its nuclear activities .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 20.09.2004 iran rejects un nuclear demands großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran could face un sanctions for its nuclear program iran 's chief nuclear negotiator hassan rohani referred to demands from the international atomic energy agency to freeze all work on uranium enrichment as " illegal " . " iran will not accept any obligation regarding the suspension of uranium enrichment , " rohani said at a news conference on sunday .
" no international body can force iran to do so . "
over the weekend , the united nations ' nuclear watchdog , iaea , had unanimously adopted a joint us-european resolution giving iran two months to stop producing enriched uranium or face referral to the security council .
iran digs its heels in according to reuters news agency , the resolution agreed to by the iaea 's board of governors called on iran to freeze all activities related to uranium enrichment and to grant full and prompt access to the iaea 's inspectors , as well as provide them with any further information needed , by nov .
25 .
iran responded by saying that if the issue were referred to the security council for possible sanctions , it would respond by blocking snap checks of its atomic facilities .
hassan rohani , head of iran 's supreme national security council , added that were the case to go to the security council , iran would also consider withdrawing from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , which it signed in 2003 .
" if they want to send iran to the security council , it is not wise , and we will stop implementing the additional protocol , " he said .
the additional protocol to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty calls for snap nuclear checks by iaea inspectors .
a " peaceful " nuclear program tehran has said it wants to secure its own source of fuel for power stations so that it is not dependent on other countries and stresses that iran has a legal right to develop nuclear power .
rohani insisted that no institution had the authority to deprive a country of a peaceful nuclear energy program .
but experts also say that enrichment is an integral step in the production of atomic weapons , and washington has long harbored suspicions about the islamic country 's aims for developing its nuclear capacity .
the us believes that oil-rich iran , which the bush administration described as a member of the " axis of evil , " has no need for nuclear reactors , even for civilian programs .
criticism from eu the threatening posture from tehran marks a turn-around from last october , when the country agreed to more stringent inspections and signed the additional protocol .
at the time , iran also consented to the suspension of uranium enrichment activities .
in return , britain , france and germany , promised to help develop technology for a civil atomic energy plant .
but last week , the european union abandoned its policy of " constructive engagement , " after the bloc 's big three joined forces with the united states and decided to issue a deadline for tehran to comply with international demands dispel concerns about nuclear activities .
" the eu calls on iran to heed the content of the resolution adopted by iaea 's board of governors , in particular with regard to the necessity to suspend fully all its enrichment related activities , " the head of the dutch delegation told a meeting of members of the iaea on behalf of the eu .
tehran insists it abided by the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and allowed spot inspections proving the intention behind its nuclear program was civilian in nature .
officials in tehran also point out that the suspension of enrichment was not a legal requirement but a voluntary measure .
in november , the iaea board of governors will meet to review iran 's alleged nuclear weapons program .
the country has until then to answer all outstanding questions . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us , eu agree to resolution on iran on thursday , the us and key eu allies agreed on a draft resolution calling on iran to end its nuclear program .
by allowing some tough wording , the eu is backing away from its previous policy of constructive engagement .

17 , 2004 -rrb- iran said to be close to nuclear deal ahead of a meeting of the un 's nuclear watchdog next week , diplomats said iran has agreed in principle to freeze some of its nuclear activities .

the most revealing file is likely to belong to neelie kroes , the eu 's new competition chief , according to the financial times .
the former dutch transport minister , who used to be a board member at several european companies , may have some of her judgements queried because of previous business interests , according to an internal commission legal opinion obtained by the newspaper .
in an unprecedented move , kroes has vowed that she will not return to private business after leaving brussels . incoming agriculture commissioner mariann fischer boel , who kept a secret stake in a russian pig farm , will also face conflict of interest questions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : fires , films and fashion german-turkish film " head-on " wins berlinale the yearning for kraut art " tainted art " controversy surrounds berlin exhibition lagerfeld causes cheap chic craze culture & lifestyle -pipe- 20.09.2004 the party 's over - life after moma großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what 's next after moma in berlin ?
in a city reeling from sweeping cuts to the arts , moma 's overwhelming success marks a new twist in berlin 's ongoing culture wars . as the museum of modern art exhibition drew to a close this weekend , berlin was left wondering exactly what to make of the media circus that 's been rocking the city over the last seven months .
" moma helped art reach a wider public , " dr. matthias henkel from the berlin national museums told dw-world .
but that 's almost an under-statement .
one survey showed that 15 percent of the visitors , who endured waits of up to ten hours outside the neue nationalgalerie , had never even been to a museum before .
much to the indignation of the city 's art establishment , the success of the temporary exhibit of works from the new york-based moma prompted german president horst köhler to call for a " super museum " showcasing the best of berlin 's existing collections .
taking stock bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the last days of the exhibit , visitors often waited up to 10 hours to get a ticket .
it 's hardly surprising that cash-strapped berlin is keen to capitalize on the moma phenomenon .
in a city of 3.4 million , the visiting exhibition attracted over one million visitors , some 750,000 of whom came from out of town .
with such impressive figures , people have realized there are cultural and economic lessons to be learned .
klaus wowereit , berlin 's media-savvy mayor , welcomed the president 's idea and suggested the city 's museums pool their respective pièces de resistance in a temporary exhibition with moma-style pulling-power .
" it 's a charming proposal and i 'm sure a berlin exhibition would complement the moma exhibition very well , " he said .
" when you 've understood how to turn art into an event you can reach a vast public , and moreover , you 've whetted the public 's appetite for -lrb- the city 's -rrb- many museums and galleries . "
professor peter raue , president of the friends of the nationalgalerie , confirmed this .
" all of berlin 's museums recorded an increase in visitor numbers by 100 percent , " he told dw-world .
the superficial sheen of ' postcard ' museums but not everyone was enamored with the moma-effect .
the show might have been embraced by the public and the politicians , but the art establishment has been largely hostile - and not just because of a perceived us imperialism on the part of the curators .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georg baselitz " art that 's easy to consume can be counter-productive , " insisted jörn merkert from the berlinische galerie , set to re-open in october after a seven-year absence .
as director of a museum boasting work by renowned 20th-century german artists including otto dix , ernst ludwig kirchner and georg baselitz -lrb- photo -rrb- , one of merkert 's priorities is to anchor his gallery firmly within the community by offering children 's workshops and facilities for the disabled , for example .
" it 's all very well promoting art as an event , but it 's also important to strengthen the profile of museums and their collections , " he told dw-world .
" from a marketing point of view , it should n't be about individual works with ' post-card ' potential , " he said dismissively .
" no one needs ' post-card ' museums . "
as far as merkert is concerned , berlin seldom sees sensational public interest in an exhibition because the capital 's museums have to work with " negligible marketing and advertising budgets due to the catastrophic state of berlin 's finances . "
" moma had a marketing budget of € 1 million , " he pointed out .
" for our new gallery , we had just € 50,000 at our disposal , most of which we scraped together out of private funds . "
tine nehler , press-spokesperson at the pinakothek der moderne in munich , agreed .
" in terms of publicity and marketing , moma showed what could be possible , " she told dw-world .
but she also felt germany 's president missed the point when he called for the creation of a super museum .
" it would n't make sense to centralize the country 's art collections , " she said .
" there 's simply no need for it . "
not only is it superfluous , argued dr. henkel of the berlin national museums , such a proposal would be positively detrimental .
" sifting off the ' crown jewels ' would only weaken individual collections , " he said .
selling berlin short the problem is n't only financial .
" germany suffers from a major deficit when it comes to making museums attractive to visitors , " says jörn merkert .
" it 's a question of changing people 's consciousness , " he stressed .
" berlin completely fails to advertise its quality collections .
it has 165 museums and at least 40 of them are world-class , " he said .
" the gemäldegalerie , for example , owns the world 's largest collection of rembrandts . "
christina weiss , state secretary for media and culture , also said the city had enough high-profile collections .
" berlin already has ' super museums ' .
the 17 berlin national museums attracted 3.2 million visitors last year . "
and moma is by no means the only exhibition making headlines in the capital this year .
the hamburger bahnhof museum , redesigned in 1996 by architect josef paul kleihues and home to works by andy warhol , anselm kiefer and joseph beuys , is now set to host the highly controversial friedrich christian flick collection .

sensational as they are , the reverberations of moma ca n't be equated with the ' bilbao effect ' - the economic boom experienced in the spanish city after the frank gehry-designed guggenheim foundation opened in 1997 .
natascha kompatzki from berlin tourism marketing pointed out that the 11.33 million visitors to berlin last year made it the city 's record year for tourism , but she attributed the trend primarily to berlin 's newly-acquired status as a low-budget airlines destination .
" the number of visitors who came to berlin for moma were only the icing on the cake in what 's a more general development , " she told dw-world , and added the show was first and foremost a boost to berlin 's image .

in a city reeling from sweeping cuts to the arts , moma 's overwhelming success marks a new twist in berlin 's ongoing culture wars . as the museum of modern art exhibition drew to a close this weekend , berlin was left wondering exactly what to make of the media circus that 's been rocking the city over the last seven months .
" moma helped art reach a wider public , " dr. matthias henkel from the berlin national museums told dw-world .
but that 's almost an under-statement .
one survey showed that 15 percent of the visitors , who endured waits of up to ten hours outside the neue nationalgalerie , had never even been to a museum before .
much to the indignation of the city 's art establishment , the success of the temporary exhibit of works from the new york-based moma prompted german president horst köhler to call for a " super museum " showcasing the best of berlin 's existing collections .
taking stock bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the last days of the exhibit , visitors often waited up to 10 hours to get a ticket .
it 's hardly surprising that cash-strapped berlin is keen to capitalize on the moma phenomenon .
in a city of 3.4 million , the visiting exhibition attracted over one million visitors , some 750,000 of whom came from out of town .
with such impressive figures , people have realized there are cultural and economic lessons to be learned .
klaus wowereit , berlin 's media-savvy mayor , welcomed the president 's idea and suggested the city 's museums pool their respective pièces de resistance in a temporary exhibition with moma-style pulling-power .
" it 's a charming proposal and i 'm sure a berlin exhibition would complement the moma exhibition very well , " he said .
" when you 've understood how to turn art into an event you can reach a vast public , and moreover , you 've whetted the public 's appetite for -lrb- the city 's -rrb- many museums and galleries . "
professor peter raue , president of the friends of the nationalgalerie , confirmed this .
" all of berlin 's museums recorded an increase in visitor numbers by 100 percent , " he told dw-world .
the superficial sheen of ' postcard ' museums but not everyone was enamored with the moma-effect .
the show might have been embraced by the public and the politicians , but the art establishment has been largely hostile - and not just because of a perceived us imperialism on the part of the curators .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georg baselitz " art that 's easy to consume can be counter-productive , " insisted jörn merkert from the berlinische galerie , set to re-open in october after a seven-year absence .
as director of a museum boasting work by renowned 20th-century german artists including otto dix , ernst ludwig kirchner and georg baselitz -lrb- photo -rrb- , one of merkert 's priorities is to anchor his gallery firmly within the community by offering children 's workshops and facilities for the disabled , for example .
" it 's all very well promoting art as an event , but it 's also important to strengthen the profile of museums and their collections , " he told dw-world .
" from a marketing point of view , it should n't be about individual works with ' post-card ' potential , " he said dismissively .

in a city reeling from sweeping cuts to the arts , moma 's overwhelming success marks a new twist in berlin 's ongoing culture wars . as the museum of modern art exhibition drew to a close this weekend , berlin was left wondering exactly what to make of the media circus that 's been rocking the city over the last seven months .
" moma helped art reach a wider public , " dr. matthias henkel from the berlin national museums told dw-world .
but that 's almost an under-statement .
one survey showed that 15 percent of the visitors , who endured waits of up to ten hours outside the neue nationalgalerie , had never even been to a museum before .
much to the indignation of the city 's art establishment , the success of the temporary exhibit of works from the new york-based moma prompted german president horst köhler to call for a " super museum " showcasing the best of berlin 's existing collections .
taking stock bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the last days of the exhibit , visitors often waited up to 10 hours to get a ticket .
it 's hardly surprising that cash-strapped berlin is keen to capitalize on the moma phenomenon .
in a city of 3.4 million , the visiting exhibition attracted over one million visitors , some 750,000 of whom came from out of town .
with such impressive figures , people have realized there are cultural and economic lessons to be learned .
klaus wowereit , berlin 's media-savvy mayor , welcomed the president 's idea and suggested the city 's museums pool their respective pièces de resistance in a temporary exhibition with moma-style pulling-power .
" it 's a charming proposal and i 'm sure a berlin exhibition would complement the moma exhibition very well , " he said .
" when you 've understood how to turn art into an event you can reach a vast public , and moreover , you 've whetted the public 's appetite for -lrb- the city 's -rrb- many museums and galleries . "
professor peter raue , president of the friends of the nationalgalerie , confirmed this .
" all of berlin 's museums recorded an increase in visitor numbers by 100 percent , " he told dw-world .
the superficial sheen of ' postcard ' museums but not everyone was enamored with the moma-effect .
the show might have been embraced by the public and the politicians , but the art establishment has been largely hostile - and not just because of a perceived us imperialism on the part of the curators .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georg baselitz " art that 's easy to consume can be counter-productive , " insisted jörn merkert from the berlinische galerie , set to re-open in october after a seven-year absence .
as director of a museum boasting work by renowned 20th-century german artists including otto dix , ernst ludwig kirchner and georg baselitz -lrb- photo -rrb- , one of merkert 's priorities is to anchor his gallery firmly within the community by offering children 's workshops and facilities for the disabled , for example .
" it 's all very well promoting art as an event , but it 's also important to strengthen the profile of museums and their collections , " he told dw-world .
" from a marketing point of view , it should n't be about individual works with ' post-card ' potential , " he said dismissively .
" no one needs ' post-card ' museums . "
as far as merkert is concerned , berlin seldom sees sensational public interest in an exhibition because the capital 's museums have to work with " negligible marketing and advertising budgets due to the catastrophic state of berlin 's finances . "
" moma had a marketing budget of € 1 million , " he pointed out .
" for our new gallery , we had just € 50,000 at our disposal , most of which we scraped together out of private funds . "
tine nehler , press-spokesperson at the pinakothek der moderne in munich , agreed .
" in terms of publicity and marketing , moma showed what could be possible , " she told dw-world .
but she also felt germany 's president missed the point when he called for the creation of a super museum .
" it would n't make sense to centralize the country 's art collections , " she said .
" there 's simply no need for it . "
not only is it superfluous , argued dr. henkel of the berlin national museums , such a proposal would be positively detrimental .

in a city reeling from sweeping cuts to the arts , moma 's overwhelming success marks a new twist in berlin 's ongoing culture wars . as the museum of modern art exhibition drew to a close this weekend , berlin was left wondering exactly what to make of the media circus that 's been rocking the city over the last seven months .
" moma helped art reach a wider public , " dr. matthias henkel from the berlin national museums told dw-world .
but that 's almost an under-statement .
one survey showed that 15 percent of the visitors , who endured waits of up to ten hours outside the neue nationalgalerie , had never even been to a museum before .
much to the indignation of the city 's art establishment , the success of the temporary exhibit of works from the new york-based moma prompted german president horst köhler to call for a " super museum " showcasing the best of berlin 's existing collections .
taking stock bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the last days of the exhibit , visitors often waited up to 10 hours to get a ticket .
it 's hardly surprising that cash-strapped berlin is keen to capitalize on the moma phenomenon .
in a city of 3.4 million , the visiting exhibition attracted over one million visitors , some 750,000 of whom came from out of town .
with such impressive figures , people have realized there are cultural and economic lessons to be learned .
klaus wowereit , berlin 's media-savvy mayor , welcomed the president 's idea and suggested the city 's museums pool their respective pièces de resistance in a temporary exhibition with moma-style pulling-power .
" it 's a charming proposal and i 'm sure a berlin exhibition would complement the moma exhibition very well , " he said .
" when you 've understood how to turn art into an event you can reach a vast public , and moreover , you 've whetted the public 's appetite for -lrb- the city 's -rrb- many museums and galleries . "
professor peter raue , president of the friends of the nationalgalerie , confirmed this .
" all of berlin 's museums recorded an increase in visitor numbers by 100 percent , " he told dw-world .
the superficial sheen of ' postcard ' museums but not everyone was enamored with the moma-effect .
the show might have been embraced by the public and the politicians , but the art establishment has been largely hostile - and not just because of a perceived us imperialism on the part of the curators .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georg baselitz " art that 's easy to consume can be counter-productive , " insisted jörn merkert from the berlinische galerie , set to re-open in october after a seven-year absence .
as director of a museum boasting work by renowned 20th-century german artists including otto dix , ernst ludwig kirchner and georg baselitz -lrb- photo -rrb- , one of merkert 's priorities is to anchor his gallery firmly within the community by offering children 's workshops and facilities for the disabled , for example .
" it 's all very well promoting art as an event , but it 's also important to strengthen the profile of museums and their collections , " he told dw-world .
" from a marketing point of view , it should n't be about individual works with ' post-card ' potential , " he said dismissively .
" no one needs ' post-card ' museums . "
as far as merkert is concerned , berlin seldom sees sensational public interest in an exhibition because the capital 's museums have to work with " negligible marketing and advertising budgets due to the catastrophic state of berlin 's finances . "
" moma had a marketing budget of € 1 million , " he pointed out .
" for our new gallery , we had just € 50,000 at our disposal , most of which we scraped together out of private funds . "
tine nehler , press-spokesperson at the pinakothek der moderne in munich , agreed .
" in terms of publicity and marketing , moma showed what could be possible , " she told dw-world .
but she also felt germany 's president missed the point when he called for the creation of a super museum .
" it would n't make sense to centralize the country 's art collections , " she said .
" there 's simply no need for it . "
not only is it superfluous , argued dr. henkel of the berlin national museums , such a proposal would be positively detrimental .
" sifting off the ' crown jewels ' would only weaken individual collections , " he said .
selling berlin short the problem is n't only financial .
" germany suffers from a major deficit when it comes to making museums attractive to visitors , " says jörn merkert .
" it 's a question of changing people 's consciousness , " he stressed .
" berlin completely fails to advertise its quality collections .
it has 165 museums and at least 40 of them are world-class , " he said .
" the gemäldegalerie , for example , owns the world 's largest collection of rembrandts . "
christina weiss , state secretary for media and culture , also said the city had enough high-profile collections .
" berlin already has ' super museums ' .
the 17 berlin national museums attracted 3.2 million visitors last year . "
and moma is by no means the only exhibition making headlines in the capital this year .
the hamburger bahnhof museum , redesigned in 1996 by architect josef paul kleihues and home to works by andy warhol , anselm kiefer and joseph beuys , is now set to host the highly controversial friedrich christian flick collection .
opening just two days after moma closes , the show has already generated reams of publicity .

while there he will try to make case for a permanent german seat on the un security council . world leaders will gather at the united nations for their annual debate on tuesday with the aftershocks of the iraq war , sudan 's darfur region , aids and world poverty at the top of the international agenda . also to be discussed is the issue of reform of the un itself .
during his address to the united nations general assembly on thursday , fischer is expected to push for a permanent seat for germany in any revamp of the un security council . while in new york , fischer will meet with the representatives of three other nations to discuss making a joint effort for an expansion of the security council .
germany , japan , brazil and india , dubbed the g4 , all hope to become permanent members of the important world body . un secretary general kofi annan has made it a matter of urgency to reform the un security council , and has appointed a high-level panel to come up with proposals by december that he would like to present at next year 's session . " quite honestly , i do not believe that anyone will consider the un reform complete without security council reform bringing it into line with today 's realities , " he said earlier this month . among the industrialized nations , both japan and germany , the world 's second and third largest economies , are both natural contenders since they pay a large chunk of the un 's membership dues .
brazil and india are large and important developing nations that would expand the regional coverage of the security council . " we have to assume that every decision made by the security council has not only political , but also economic implications , " un expert klaus hüfner told dw-world .
" therefore it 's very important to germany that decisions taken there are not to its disadvantage . " unified push brazil , germany , india and japan are planning to use their time in new york to make a unified push for all four nations to join an expanded council when or if any reform of the current structure can be agreed .
but egypt has already indicated it will fight for a permanent muslim seat on the council and the reform issue , which has already been talked about in un corridors for years without concrete action , looks to remain as tricky as ever . meanwhile even supporters of the united nations have been tempted to point to its handling of another crisis besides iraq - the catastrophe in darfur - as proof that the world body is too ineffective . an estimated 50,000 people have died in sudan 's darfur region since february 2003 in what even un officials have termed a brutal campaign of ethnic cleansing , if not the genocide that washington has called it . the security council passed a resolution on saturday threatening sanctions on sudan if it did not bring an end to the bloodshed , but four council nations abstained in the vote after days of laborious debate .
one of the key passages in the resolution pointed out that sudan had failed to heed a similar resolution adopted almost two months before . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german hopes for un security council seat dampened until this week , the possibility of germany gaining a permanent seat on the un security council looked good .
now , a plan to reform the international organization could put the brakes on that ambition .

while there he will try to make case for a permanent german seat on the un security council . world leaders will gather at the united nations for their annual debate on tuesday with the aftershocks of the iraq war , sudan 's darfur region , aids and world poverty at the top of the international agenda . also to be discussed is the issue of reform of the un itself .
during his address to the united nations general assembly on thursday , fischer is expected to push for a permanent seat for germany in any revamp of the un security council . while in new york , fischer will meet with the representatives of three other nations to discuss making a joint effort for an expansion of the security council .
germany , japan , brazil and india , dubbed the g4 , all hope to become permanent members of the important world body . un secretary general kofi annan has made it a matter of urgency to reform the un security council , and has appointed a high-level panel to come up with proposals by december that he would like to present at next year 's session . " quite honestly , i do not believe that anyone will consider the un reform complete without security council reform bringing it into line with today 's realities , " he said earlier this month . among the industrialized nations , both japan and germany , the world 's second and third largest economies , are both natural contenders since they pay a large chunk of the un 's membership dues .
brazil and india are large and important developing nations that would expand the regional coverage of the security council . " we have to assume that every decision made by the security council has not only political , but also economic implications , " un expert klaus hüfner told dw-world .
" therefore it 's very important to germany that decisions taken there are not to its disadvantage . " unified push brazil , germany , india and japan are planning to use their time in new york to make a unified push for all four nations to join an expanded council when or if any reform of the current structure can be agreed .
but egypt has already indicated it will fight for a permanent muslim seat on the council and the reform issue , which has already been talked about in un corridors for years without concrete action , looks to remain as tricky as ever . meanwhile even supporters of the united nations have been tempted to point to its handling of another crisis besides iraq - the catastrophe in darfur - as proof that the world body is too ineffective . an estimated 50,000 people have died in sudan 's darfur region since february 2003 in what even un officials have termed a brutal campaign of ethnic cleansing , if not the genocide that washington has called it . the security council passed a resolution on saturday threatening sanctions on sudan if it did not bring an end to the bloodshed , but four council nations abstained in the vote after days of laborious debate .
one of the key passages in the resolution pointed out that sudan had failed to heed a similar resolution adopted almost two months before . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german hopes for un security council seat dampened until this week , the possibility of germany gaining a permanent seat on the un security council looked good .

the chief defendant , a 51-year-old bar owner identified as christa w. , was accused of charging her clients the equivalent of € 10 -lrb- $ 12 -rrb- each to sexually assault the child , whose body has never been found . she was also alleged to have filmed and photographed the acts .
prosecution lawyers told the court that the boy , known as pascal , was thought to have been lured into the bar on sept .
30 , 2001 and to have died the same day .
but investigators who searched a quarry near the french village of forbach , about 10 kilometers -lrb- six miles -rrb- away from the german border , failed to find his corpse and said they were unsure exactly how and when he died .
court sources said that some of the defendants had admitted to raping or killing pascal several months ago .
four men and a second woman were charged as principals and seven as accomplices .
all the defendants were in their 40s or 50s .
court sources said that seven of them had previously been charged with sex offences against two other children .
in october last year , a 49-year man , described as mentally retarded and an alcoholic , was jailed for seven years and ordered to be detained in a psychiatric hospital after being convicted of sexually assaulting pascal .

" greeted the right-wing npd success in saxony germany woke up to fears that the political tremors sparked by state elections in saxony and brandenburg on sunday could lead to deeper division within their country and scare off investors . observers say the success of the party of democratic socialism , the successor to east germany 's communist party , and the extreme right national party of germany -lrb- npd -rrb- and german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- in sunday 's elections show how angry east germans are at the reality they face 14 years after reunification . the pds rode a wave of discontent over chancellor gerhard schröder 's tough social reforms to 28 percent of the vote , making them second-strongest party in brandenburg , behind schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- . the governing spd and conservative christian democratic union " got a serious slap in the face , " said lothar bisky , the brandenburg parliamentary head for the pds , a party that most analysts left for dead after their failure in the last federal election . left-wingers " divide " the country , says schily though the party will most likely be excluded from a coalition government - the spd is more likely to pick the conservative christian democratic union - their success has nevertheless sent the government in berlin a message , and one they do n't like to hear .
by making themselves , as a regional party , the " mouthpiece of a part of germany " they are deepening the divide between east and west , interior minister otto schily said of the party , which has only found success so far in the east . the same goes for the npd , which schily tried and failed to ban two years ago .
based on their sunday success , the right wing party can claim 12 seats in saxony 's parliament .
the 9.2 percent they won was almost as much as the 9.8 percent of the social democratic party , the party of germany 's chancellor .
right wing candidate ignored on television " today is a fantastic day for all germans that still want to be bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holger apfel -lrb- in brown -rrb- , celebrates with npd functionaries germans , " the npd 's top candidate , holger apfel , said during a round of candidate interviews in german station zdf 's studios .
soon after his comment , the other candidates walked off the set and the reporter broke off apfel 's diatribe . political scientists say the miserable economic climate and the anger of young east germans that fuelled the npd 's sunday success could spark a worrying trend .
" if some sort of economic miracle doesn ’ t take place in the east , our society 's potential for supporting right wing politics could reach high levels , " said political scientist jürgen felter on the german talk show sabine christiansen , sunday night ..
he estimated the potential at 15 percent across germany . saxony state officials fear the presence of right- wing extremists in the state parliament will scare off the international investors that have made saxony one of the few economic bright spots in the east .
in recent years , the state has been able to profile itself as a center for bio-technology and microchip production while enjoying an increase in tourism . ahead of the elections , saxony 's premier , georg milbradt , said that should the npd make it into the parliament , he need n't bother going to america anymore to promote his state . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder 's social democrats suffer fresh losses german chancellor schröder 's social democrats lost major ground in elections on sunday in two former communist states as parties from the extreme right and far left posted electoral gains .

in a city reeling from sweeping cuts to the arts , moma 's overwhelming success marks a new twist in berlin 's ongoing culture wars . as the museum of modern art exhibition drew to a close this weekend , berlin was left wondering exactly what to make of the media circus that 's been rocking the city over the last seven months .
" moma helped art reach a wider public , " dr. matthias henkel from the berlin national museums told dw-world .
but that 's almost an under-statement .
one survey showed that 15 percent of the visitors , who endured waits of up to ten hours outside the neue nationalgalerie , had never even been to a museum before .
much to the indignation of the city 's art establishment , the success of the temporary exhibit of works from the new york-based moma prompted german president horst köhler to call for a " super museum " showcasing the best of berlin 's existing collections .
taking stock bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the last days of the exhibit , visitors often waited up to 10 hours to get a ticket .
it 's hardly surprising that cash-strapped berlin is keen to capitalize on the moma phenomenon .
in a city of 3.4 million , the visiting exhibition attracted over one million visitors , some 750,000 of whom came from out of town .
with such impressive figures , people have realized there are cultural and economic lessons to be learned .
klaus wowereit , berlin 's media-savvy mayor , welcomed the president 's idea and suggested the city 's museums pool their respective pièces de resistance in a temporary exhibition with moma-style pulling-power .
" it 's a charming proposal and i 'm sure a berlin exhibition would complement the moma exhibition very well , " he said .
" when you 've understood how to turn art into an event you can reach a vast public , and moreover , you 've whetted the public 's appetite for -lrb- the city 's -rrb- many museums and galleries . "
professor peter raue , president of the friends of the nationalgalerie , confirmed this .
" all of berlin 's museums recorded an increase in visitor numbers by 100 percent , " he told dw-world .
the superficial sheen of ' postcard ' museums but not everyone was enamored with the moma-effect .
the show might have been embraced by the public and the politicians , but the art establishment has been largely hostile - and not just because of a perceived us imperialism on the part of the curators .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georg baselitz " art that 's easy to consume can be counter-productive , " insisted jörn merkert from the berlinische galerie , set to re-open in october after a seven-year absence .
as director of a museum boasting work by renowned 20th-century german artists including otto dix , ernst ludwig kirchner and georg baselitz -lrb- photo -rrb- , one of merkert 's priorities is to anchor his gallery firmly within the community by offering children 's workshops and facilities for the disabled , for example .
" it 's all very well promoting art as an event , but it 's also important to strengthen the profile of museums and their collections , " he told dw-world .
" from a marketing point of view , it should n't be about individual works with ' post-card ' potential , " he said dismissively .
" no one needs ' post-card ' museums . "
as far as merkert is concerned , berlin seldom sees sensational public interest in an exhibition because the capital 's museums have to work with " negligible marketing and advertising budgets due to the catastrophic state of berlin 's finances . "
" moma had a marketing budget of € 1 million , " he pointed out .
" for our new gallery , we had just € 50,000 at our disposal , most of which we scraped together out of private funds . "
tine nehler , press-spokesperson at the pinakothek der moderne in munich , agreed .
" in terms of publicity and marketing , moma showed what could be possible , " she told dw-world .
but she also felt germany 's president missed the point when he called for the creation of a super museum .
" it would n't make sense to centralize the country 's art collections , " she said .
" there 's simply no need for it . "
not only is it superfluous , argued dr. henkel of the berlin national museums , such a proposal would be positively detrimental .
" sifting off the ' crown jewels ' would only weaken individual collections , " he said .
selling berlin short the problem is n't only financial .
" germany suffers from a major deficit when it comes to making museums attractive to visitors , " says jörn merkert .
" it 's a question of changing people 's consciousness , " he stressed .
" berlin completely fails to advertise its quality collections .
it has 165 museums and at least 40 of them are world-class , " he said .
" the gemäldegalerie , for example , owns the world 's largest collection of rembrandts . "
christina weiss , state secretary for media and culture , also said the city had enough high-profile collections .
" berlin already has ' super museums ' .
the 17 berlin national museums attracted 3.2 million visitors last year . "
and moma is by no means the only exhibition making headlines in the capital this year .
the hamburger bahnhof museum , redesigned in 1996 by architect josef paul kleihues and home to works by andy warhol , anselm kiefer and joseph beuys , is now set to host the highly controversial friedrich christian flick collection .
opening just two days after moma closes , the show has already generated reams of publicity .
day-to-day realities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guggenheim museum in bilbao , spain .
sensational as they are , the reverberations of moma ca n't be equated with the ' bilbao effect ' - the economic boom experienced in the spanish city after the frank gehry-designed guggenheim foundation opened in 1997 .
natascha kompatzki from berlin tourism marketing pointed out that the 11.33 million visitors to berlin last year made it the city 's record year for tourism , but she attributed the trend primarily to berlin 's newly-acquired status as a low-budget airlines destination .
" the number of visitors who came to berlin for moma were only the icing on the cake in what 's a more general development , " she told dw-world , and added the show was first and foremost a boost to berlin 's image .
according to jörn merkert , germany 's politicans are making a mistake in seeing moma 's success as a yardstick for future exhibitions .

in a city reeling from sweeping cuts to the arts , moma 's overwhelming success marks a new twist in berlin 's ongoing culture wars . as the museum of modern art exhibition drew to a close this weekend , berlin was left wondering exactly what to make of the media circus that 's been rocking the city over the last seven months .
" moma helped art reach a wider public , " dr. matthias henkel from the berlin national museums told dw-world .
but that 's almost an under-statement .
one survey showed that 15 percent of the visitors , who endured waits of up to ten hours outside the neue nationalgalerie , had never even been to a museum before .
much to the indignation of the city 's art establishment , the success of the temporary exhibit of works from the new york-based moma prompted german president horst köhler to call for a " super museum " showcasing the best of berlin 's existing collections .
taking stock bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the last days of the exhibit , visitors often waited up to 10 hours to get a ticket .
it 's hardly surprising that cash-strapped berlin is keen to capitalize on the moma phenomenon .
in a city of 3.4 million , the visiting exhibition attracted over one million visitors , some 750,000 of whom came from out of town .
with such impressive figures , people have realized there are cultural and economic lessons to be learned .
klaus wowereit , berlin 's media-savvy mayor , welcomed the president 's idea and suggested the city 's museums pool their respective pièces de resistance in a temporary exhibition with moma-style pulling-power .
" it 's a charming proposal and i 'm sure a berlin exhibition would complement the moma exhibition very well , " he said .
" when you 've understood how to turn art into an event you can reach a vast public , and moreover , you 've whetted the public 's appetite for -lrb- the city 's -rrb- many museums and galleries . "
professor peter raue , president of the friends of the nationalgalerie , confirmed this .
" all of berlin 's museums recorded an increase in visitor numbers by 100 percent , " he told dw-world .
the superficial sheen of ' postcard ' museums but not everyone was enamored with the moma-effect .
the show might have been embraced by the public and the politicians , but the art establishment has been largely hostile - and not just because of a perceived us imperialism on the part of the curators .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georg baselitz " art that 's easy to consume can be counter-productive , " insisted jörn merkert from the berlinische galerie , set to re-open in october after a seven-year absence .
as director of a museum boasting work by renowned 20th-century german artists including otto dix , ernst ludwig kirchner and georg baselitz -lrb- photo -rrb- , one of merkert 's priorities is to anchor his gallery firmly within the community by offering children 's workshops and facilities for the disabled , for example .
" it 's all very well promoting art as an event , but it 's also important to strengthen the profile of museums and their collections , " he told dw-world .
" from a marketing point of view , it should n't be about individual works with ' post-card ' potential , " he said dismissively .
" no one needs ' post-card ' museums . "
as far as merkert is concerned , berlin seldom sees sensational public interest in an exhibition because the capital 's museums have to work with " negligible marketing and advertising budgets due to the catastrophic state of berlin 's finances . "
" moma had a marketing budget of € 1 million , " he pointed out .
" for our new gallery , we had just € 50,000 at our disposal , most of which we scraped together out of private funds . "
tine nehler , press-spokesperson at the pinakothek der moderne in munich , agreed .
" in terms of publicity and marketing , moma showed what could be possible , " she told dw-world .
but she also felt germany 's president missed the point when he called for the creation of a super museum .
" it would n't make sense to centralize the country 's art collections , " she said .
" there 's simply no need for it . "
not only is it superfluous , argued dr. henkel of the berlin national museums , such a proposal would be positively detrimental .
" sifting off the ' crown jewels ' would only weaken individual collections , " he said .
selling berlin short the problem is n't only financial .
" germany suffers from a major deficit when it comes to making museums attractive to visitors , " says jörn merkert .
" it 's a question of changing people 's consciousness , " he stressed .
" berlin completely fails to advertise its quality collections .
it has 165 museums and at least 40 of them are world-class , " he said .
" the gemäldegalerie , for example , owns the world 's largest collection of rembrandts . "
christina weiss , state secretary for media and culture , also said the city had enough high-profile collections .
" berlin already has ' super museums ' .
the 17 berlin national museums attracted 3.2 million visitors last year . "
and moma is by no means the only exhibition making headlines in the capital this year .
the hamburger bahnhof museum , redesigned in 1996 by architect josef paul kleihues and home to works by andy warhol , anselm kiefer and joseph beuys , is now set to host the highly controversial friedrich christian flick collection .

sensational as they are , the reverberations of moma ca n't be equated with the ' bilbao effect ' - the economic boom experienced in the spanish city after the frank gehry-designed guggenheim foundation opened in 1997 .
natascha kompatzki from berlin tourism marketing pointed out that the 11.33 million visitors to berlin last year made it the city 's record year for tourism , but she attributed the trend primarily to berlin 's newly-acquired status as a low-budget airlines destination .
" the number of visitors who came to berlin for moma were only the icing on the cake in what 's a more general development , " she told dw-world , and added the show was first and foremost a boost to berlin 's image .
according to jörn merkert , germany 's politicans are making a mistake in seeing moma 's success as a yardstick for future exhibitions .

" greeted the right-wing npd success in saxony germany woke up to fears that the political tremors sparked by state elections in saxony and brandenburg on sunday could lead to deeper division within their country and scare off investors . observers say the success of the party of democratic socialism , the successor to east germany 's communist party , and the extreme right national party of germany -lrb- npd -rrb- and german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- in sunday 's elections show how angry east germans are at the reality they face 14 years after reunification . the pds rode a wave of discontent over chancellor gerhard schröder 's tough social reforms to 28 percent of the vote , making them second-strongest party in brandenburg , behind schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- . the governing spd and conservative christian democratic union " got a serious slap in the face , " said lothar bisky , the brandenburg parliamentary head for the pds , a party that most analysts left for dead after their failure in the last federal election . left-wingers " divide " the country , says schily though the party will most likely be excluded from a coalition government - the spd is more likely to pick the conservative christian democratic union - their success has nevertheless sent the government in berlin a message , and one they do n't like to hear .
by making themselves , as a regional party , the " mouthpiece of a part of germany " they are deepening the divide between east and west , interior minister otto schily said of the party , which has only found success so far in the east . the same goes for the npd , which schily tried and failed to ban two years ago .
based on their sunday success , the right wing party can claim 12 seats in saxony 's parliament .
the 9.2 percent they won was almost as much as the 9.8 percent of the social democratic party , the party of germany 's chancellor .
right wing candidate ignored on television " today is a fantastic day for all germans that still want to be bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holger apfel -lrb- in brown -rrb- , celebrates with npd functionaries germans , " the npd 's top candidate , holger apfel , said during a round of candidate interviews in german station zdf 's studios .
soon after his comment , the other candidates walked off the set and the reporter broke off apfel 's diatribe . political scientists say the miserable economic climate and the anger of young east germans that fuelled the npd 's sunday success could spark a worrying trend .
" if some sort of economic miracle doesn ’ t take place in the east , our society 's potential for supporting right wing politics could reach high levels , " said political scientist jürgen felter on the german talk show sabine christiansen , sunday night ..
he estimated the potential at 15 percent across germany . saxony state officials fear the presence of right- wing extremists in the state parliament will scare off the international investors that have made saxony one of the few economic bright spots in the east .
in recent years , the state has been able to profile itself as a center for bio-technology and microchip production while enjoying an increase in tourism . ahead of the elections , saxony 's premier , georg milbradt , said that should the npd make it into the parliament , he need n't bother going to america anymore to promote his state . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder 's social democrats suffer fresh losses german chancellor schröder 's social democrats lost major ground in elections on sunday in two former communist states as parties from the extreme right and far left posted electoral gains .

while there he will try to make case for a permanent german seat on the un security council . world leaders will gather at the united nations for their annual debate on tuesday with the aftershocks of the iraq war , sudan 's darfur region , aids and world poverty at the top of the international agenda . also to be discussed is the issue of reform of the un itself .
during his address to the united nations general assembly on thursday , fischer is expected to push for a permanent seat for germany in any revamp of the un security council . while in new york , fischer will meet with the representatives of three other nations to discuss making a joint effort for an expansion of the security council .
germany , japan , brazil and india , dubbed the g4 , all hope to become permanent members of the important world body . un secretary general kofi annan has made it a matter of urgency to reform the un security council , and has appointed a high-level panel to come up with proposals by december that he would like to present at next year 's session . " quite honestly , i do not believe that anyone will consider the un reform complete without security council reform bringing it into line with today 's realities , " he said earlier this month . among the industrialized nations , both japan and germany , the world 's second and third largest economies , are both natural contenders since they pay a large chunk of the un 's membership dues .
brazil and india are large and important developing nations that would expand the regional coverage of the security council . " we have to assume that every decision made by the security council has not only political , but also economic implications , " un expert klaus hüfner told dw-world .
" therefore it 's very important to germany that decisions taken there are not to its disadvantage . " unified push brazil , germany , india and japan are planning to use their time in new york to make a unified push for all four nations to join an expanded council when or if any reform of the current structure can be agreed .
but egypt has already indicated it will fight for a permanent muslim seat on the council and the reform issue , which has already been talked about in un corridors for years without concrete action , looks to remain as tricky as ever . meanwhile even supporters of the united nations have been tempted to point to its handling of another crisis besides iraq - the catastrophe in darfur - as proof that the world body is too ineffective . an estimated 50,000 people have died in sudan 's darfur region since february 2003 in what even un officials have termed a brutal campaign of ethnic cleansing , if not the genocide that washington has called it . the security council passed a resolution on saturday threatening sanctions on sudan if it did not bring an end to the bloodshed , but four council nations abstained in the vote after days of laborious debate .
one of the key passages in the resolution pointed out that sudan had failed to heed a similar resolution adopted almost two months before . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german hopes for un security council seat dampened until this week , the possibility of germany gaining a permanent seat on the un security council looked good .

" iran will not accept any obligation regarding the suspension of uranium enrichment , " rohani said at a news conference on sunday .
" no international body can force iran to do so . "
over the weekend , the united nations ' nuclear watchdog , iaea , had unanimously adopted a joint us-european resolution giving iran two months to stop producing enriched uranium or face referral to the security council .
iran digs its heels in according to reuters news agency , the resolution agreed to by the iaea 's board of governors called on iran to freeze all activities related to uranium enrichment and to grant full and prompt access to the iaea 's inspectors , as well as provide them with any further information needed , by nov .
25 .
iran responded by saying that if the issue were referred to the security council for possible sanctions , it would respond by blocking snap checks of its atomic facilities .
hassan rohani , head of iran 's supreme national security council , added that were the case to go to the security council , iran would also consider withdrawing from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , which it signed in 2003 .
" if they want to send iran to the security council , it is not wise , and we will stop implementing the additional protocol , " he said .
the additional protocol to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty calls for snap nuclear checks by iaea inspectors .
a " peaceful " nuclear program tehran has said it wants to secure its own source of fuel for power stations so that it is not dependent on other countries and stresses that iran has a legal right to develop nuclear power .
rohani insisted that no institution had the authority to deprive a country of a peaceful nuclear energy program .
but experts also say that enrichment is an integral step in the production of atomic weapons , and washington has long harbored suspicions about the islamic country 's aims for developing its nuclear capacity .
the us believes that oil-rich iran , which the bush administration described as a member of the " axis of evil , " has no need for nuclear reactors , even for civilian programs .
criticism from eu the threatening posture from tehran marks a turn-around from last october , when the country agreed to more stringent inspections and signed the additional protocol .
at the time , iran also consented to the suspension of uranium enrichment activities .
in return , britain , france and germany , promised to help develop technology for a civil atomic energy plant .
but last week , the european union abandoned its policy of " constructive engagement , " after the bloc 's big three joined forces with the united states and decided to issue a deadline for tehran to comply with international demands dispel concerns about nuclear activities .
" the eu calls on iran to heed the content of the resolution adopted by iaea 's board of governors , in particular with regard to the necessity to suspend fully all its enrichment related activities , " the head of the dutch delegation told a meeting of members of the iaea on behalf of the eu .
tehran insists it abided by the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and allowed spot inspections proving the intention behind its nuclear program was civilian in nature .
officials in tehran also point out that the suspension of enrichment was not a legal requirement but a voluntary measure .
in november , the iaea board of governors will meet to review iran 's alleged nuclear weapons program .

" greeted the right-wing npd success in saxony germany woke up to fears that the political tremors sparked by state elections in saxony and brandenburg on sunday could lead to deeper division within their country and scare off investors . observers say the success of the party of democratic socialism , the successor to east germany 's communist party , and the extreme right national party of germany -lrb- npd -rrb- and german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- in sunday 's elections show how angry east germans are at the reality they face 14 years after reunification . the pds rode a wave of discontent over chancellor gerhard schröder 's tough social reforms to 28 percent of the vote , making them second-strongest party in brandenburg , behind schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- . the governing spd and conservative christian democratic union " got a serious slap in the face , " said lothar bisky , the brandenburg parliamentary head for the pds , a party that most analysts left for dead after their failure in the last federal election . left-wingers " divide " the country , says schily though the party will most likely be excluded from a coalition government - the spd is more likely to pick the conservative christian democratic union - their success has nevertheless sent the government in berlin a message , and one they do n't like to hear .
by making themselves , as a regional party , the " mouthpiece of a part of germany " they are deepening the divide between east and west , interior minister otto schily said of the party , which has only found success so far in the east . the same goes for the npd , which schily tried and failed to ban two years ago .
based on their sunday success , the right wing party can claim 12 seats in saxony 's parliament .
the 9.2 percent they won was almost as much as the 9.8 percent of the social democratic party , the party of germany 's chancellor .
right wing candidate ignored on television " today is a fantastic day for all germans that still want to be bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holger apfel -lrb- in brown -rrb- , celebrates with npd functionaries germans , " the npd 's top candidate , holger apfel , said during a round of candidate interviews in german station zdf 's studios .
soon after his comment , the other candidates walked off the set and the reporter broke off apfel 's diatribe . political scientists say the miserable economic climate and the anger of young east germans that fuelled the npd 's sunday success could spark a worrying trend .
" if some sort of economic miracle doesn ’ t take place in the east , our society 's potential for supporting right wing politics could reach high levels , " said political scientist jürgen felter on the german talk show sabine christiansen , sunday night ..
he estimated the potential at 15 percent across germany . saxony state officials fear the presence of right- wing extremists in the state parliament will scare off the international investors that have made saxony one of the few economic bright spots in the east .
in recent years , the state has been able to profile itself as a center for bio-technology and microchip production while enjoying an increase in tourism . ahead of the elections , saxony 's premier , georg milbradt , said that should the npd make it into the parliament , he need n't bother going to america anymore to promote his state . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder 's social democrats suffer fresh losses german chancellor schröder 's social democrats lost major ground in elections on sunday in two former communist states as parties from the extreme right and far left posted electoral gains .

while there he will try to make case for a permanent german seat on the un security council . world leaders will gather at the united nations for their annual debate on tuesday with the aftershocks of the iraq war , sudan 's darfur region , aids and world poverty at the top of the international agenda . also to be discussed is the issue of reform of the un itself .
during his address to the united nations general assembly on thursday , fischer is expected to push for a permanent seat for germany in any revamp of the un security council . while in new york , fischer will meet with the representatives of three other nations to discuss making a joint effort for an expansion of the security council .
germany , japan , brazil and india , dubbed the g4 , all hope to become permanent members of the important world body . un secretary general kofi annan has made it a matter of urgency to reform the un security council , and has appointed a high-level panel to come up with proposals by december that he would like to present at next year 's session . " quite honestly , i do not believe that anyone will consider the un reform complete without security council reform bringing it into line with today 's realities , " he said earlier this month . among the industrialized nations , both japan and germany , the world 's second and third largest economies , are both natural contenders since they pay a large chunk of the un 's membership dues .
brazil and india are large and important developing nations that would expand the regional coverage of the security council . " we have to assume that every decision made by the security council has not only political , but also economic implications , " un expert klaus hüfner told dw-world .
" therefore it 's very important to germany that decisions taken there are not to its disadvantage . " unified push brazil , germany , india and japan are planning to use their time in new york to make a unified push for all four nations to join an expanded council when or if any reform of the current structure can be agreed .
but egypt has already indicated it will fight for a permanent muslim seat on the council and the reform issue , which has already been talked about in un corridors for years without concrete action , looks to remain as tricky as ever . meanwhile even supporters of the united nations have been tempted to point to its handling of another crisis besides iraq - the catastrophe in darfur - as proof that the world body is too ineffective . an estimated 50,000 people have died in sudan 's darfur region since february 2003 in what even un officials have termed a brutal campaign of ethnic cleansing , if not the genocide that washington has called it . the security council passed a resolution on saturday threatening sanctions on sudan if it did not bring an end to the bloodshed , but four council nations abstained in the vote after days of laborious debate .
one of the key passages in the resolution pointed out that sudan had failed to heed a similar resolution adopted almost two months before . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german hopes for un security council seat dampened until this week , the possibility of germany gaining a permanent seat on the un security council looked good .
now , a plan to reform the international organization could put the brakes on that ambition .

while there he will try to make case for a permanent german seat on the un security council . world leaders will gather at the united nations for their annual debate on tuesday with the aftershocks of the iraq war , sudan 's darfur region , aids and world poverty at the top of the international agenda . also to be discussed is the issue of reform of the un itself .
during his address to the united nations general assembly on thursday , fischer is expected to push for a permanent seat for germany in any revamp of the un security council . while in new york , fischer will meet with the representatives of three other nations to discuss making a joint effort for an expansion of the security council .
germany , japan , brazil and india , dubbed the g4 , all hope to become permanent members of the important world body . un secretary general kofi annan has made it a matter of urgency to reform the un security council , and has appointed a high-level panel to come up with proposals by december that he would like to present at next year 's session . " quite honestly , i do not believe that anyone will consider the un reform complete without security council reform bringing it into line with today 's realities , " he said earlier this month . among the industrialized nations , both japan and germany , the world 's second and third largest economies , are both natural contenders since they pay a large chunk of the un 's membership dues .
brazil and india are large and important developing nations that would expand the regional coverage of the security council . " we have to assume that every decision made by the security council has not only political , but also economic implications , " un expert klaus hüfner told dw-world .
" therefore it 's very important to germany that decisions taken there are not to its disadvantage . " unified push brazil , germany , india and japan are planning to use their time in new york to make a unified push for all four nations to join an expanded council when or if any reform of the current structure can be agreed .
but egypt has already indicated it will fight for a permanent muslim seat on the council and the reform issue , which has already been talked about in un corridors for years without concrete action , looks to remain as tricky as ever . meanwhile even supporters of the united nations have been tempted to point to its handling of another crisis besides iraq - the catastrophe in darfur - as proof that the world body is too ineffective . an estimated 50,000 people have died in sudan 's darfur region since february 2003 in what even un officials have termed a brutal campaign of ethnic cleansing , if not the genocide that washington has called it . the security council passed a resolution on saturday threatening sanctions on sudan if it did not bring an end to the bloodshed , but four council nations abstained in the vote after days of laborious debate .
one of the key passages in the resolution pointed out that sudan had failed to heed a similar resolution adopted almost two months before . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german hopes for un security council seat dampened until this week , the possibility of germany gaining a permanent seat on the un security council looked good .

prosecution lawyers told the court that the boy , known as pascal , was thought to have been lured into the bar on sept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 20.09.2004 iran rejects un nuclear demands großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran could face un sanctions for its nuclear program iran 's chief nuclear negotiator hassan rohani referred to demands from the international atomic energy agency to freeze all work on uranium enrichment as " illegal " . " iran will not accept any obligation regarding the suspension of uranium enrichment , " rohani said at a news conference on sunday .
" no international body can force iran to do so . "
over the weekend , the united nations ' nuclear watchdog , iaea , had unanimously adopted a joint us-european resolution giving iran two months to stop producing enriched uranium or face referral to the security council .
iran digs its heels in according to reuters news agency , the resolution agreed to by the iaea 's board of governors called on iran to freeze all activities related to uranium enrichment and to grant full and prompt access to the iaea 's inspectors , as well as provide them with any further information needed , by nov .
25 .
iran responded by saying that if the issue were referred to the security council for possible sanctions , it would respond by blocking snap checks of its atomic facilities .
hassan rohani , head of iran 's supreme national security council , added that were the case to go to the security council , iran would also consider withdrawing from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , which it signed in 2003 .
" if they want to send iran to the security council , it is not wise , and we will stop implementing the additional protocol , " he said .
the additional protocol to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty calls for snap nuclear checks by iaea inspectors .
a " peaceful " nuclear program tehran has said it wants to secure its own source of fuel for power stations so that it is not dependent on other countries and stresses that iran has a legal right to develop nuclear power .
rohani insisted that no institution had the authority to deprive a country of a peaceful nuclear energy program .
but experts also say that enrichment is an integral step in the production of atomic weapons , and washington has long harbored suspicions about the islamic country 's aims for developing its nuclear capacity .
the us believes that oil-rich iran , which the bush administration described as a member of the " axis of evil , " has no need for nuclear reactors , even for civilian programs .
criticism from eu the threatening posture from tehran marks a turn-around from last october , when the country agreed to more stringent inspections and signed the additional protocol .
at the time , iran also consented to the suspension of uranium enrichment activities .
in return , britain , france and germany , promised to help develop technology for a civil atomic energy plant .
but last week , the european union abandoned its policy of " constructive engagement , " after the bloc 's big three joined forces with the united states and decided to issue a deadline for tehran to comply with international demands dispel concerns about nuclear activities .
" the eu calls on iran to heed the content of the resolution adopted by iaea 's board of governors , in particular with regard to the necessity to suspend fully all its enrichment related activities , " the head of the dutch delegation told a meeting of members of the iaea on behalf of the eu .
tehran insists it abided by the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and allowed spot inspections proving the intention behind its nuclear program was civilian in nature .
officials in tehran also point out that the suspension of enrichment was not a legal requirement but a voluntary measure .
in november , the iaea board of governors will meet to review iran 's alleged nuclear weapons program .
the country has until then to answer all outstanding questions . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us , eu agree to resolution on iran on thursday , the us and key eu allies agreed on a draft resolution calling on iran to end its nuclear program .
by allowing some tough wording , the eu is backing away from its previous policy of constructive engagement .

" iran will not accept any obligation regarding the suspension of uranium enrichment , " rohani said at a news conference on sunday .
" no international body can force iran to do so . "
over the weekend , the united nations ' nuclear watchdog , iaea , had unanimously adopted a joint us-european resolution giving iran two months to stop producing enriched uranium or face referral to the security council .
iran digs its heels in according to reuters news agency , the resolution agreed to by the iaea 's board of governors called on iran to freeze all activities related to uranium enrichment and to grant full and prompt access to the iaea 's inspectors , as well as provide them with any further information needed , by nov .
25 .
iran responded by saying that if the issue were referred to the security council for possible sanctions , it would respond by blocking snap checks of its atomic facilities .
hassan rohani , head of iran 's supreme national security council , added that were the case to go to the security council , iran would also consider withdrawing from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , which it signed in 2003 .
" if they want to send iran to the security council , it is not wise , and we will stop implementing the additional protocol , " he said .
the additional protocol to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty calls for snap nuclear checks by iaea inspectors .
a " peaceful " nuclear program tehran has said it wants to secure its own source of fuel for power stations so that it is not dependent on other countries and stresses that iran has a legal right to develop nuclear power .
rohani insisted that no institution had the authority to deprive a country of a peaceful nuclear energy program .
but experts also say that enrichment is an integral step in the production of atomic weapons , and washington has long harbored suspicions about the islamic country 's aims for developing its nuclear capacity .
the us believes that oil-rich iran , which the bush administration described as a member of the " axis of evil , " has no need for nuclear reactors , even for civilian programs .
criticism from eu the threatening posture from tehran marks a turn-around from last october , when the country agreed to more stringent inspections and signed the additional protocol .
at the time , iran also consented to the suspension of uranium enrichment activities .
in return , britain , france and germany , promised to help develop technology for a civil atomic energy plant .
but last week , the european union abandoned its policy of " constructive engagement , " after the bloc 's big three joined forces with the united states and decided to issue a deadline for tehran to comply with international demands dispel concerns about nuclear activities .
" the eu calls on iran to heed the content of the resolution adopted by iaea 's board of governors , in particular with regard to the necessity to suspend fully all its enrichment related activities , " the head of the dutch delegation told a meeting of members of the iaea on behalf of the eu .
tehran insists it abided by the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and allowed spot inspections proving the intention behind its nuclear program was civilian in nature .
officials in tehran also point out that the suspension of enrichment was not a legal requirement but a voluntary measure .

" iran will not accept any obligation regarding the suspension of uranium enrichment , " rohani said at a news conference on sunday .
" no international body can force iran to do so . "
over the weekend , the united nations ' nuclear watchdog , iaea , had unanimously adopted a joint us-european resolution giving iran two months to stop producing enriched uranium or face referral to the security council .
iran digs its heels in according to reuters news agency , the resolution agreed to by the iaea 's board of governors called on iran to freeze all activities related to uranium enrichment and to grant full and prompt access to the iaea 's inspectors , as well as provide them with any further information needed , by nov .

iran responded by saying that if the issue were referred to the security council for possible sanctions , it would respond by blocking snap checks of its atomic facilities .
hassan rohani , head of iran 's supreme national security council , added that were the case to go to the security council , iran would also consider withdrawing from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , which it signed in 2003 .
" if they want to send iran to the security council , it is not wise , and we will stop implementing the additional protocol , " he said .
the additional protocol to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty calls for snap nuclear checks by iaea inspectors .
a " peaceful " nuclear program tehran has said it wants to secure its own source of fuel for power stations so that it is not dependent on other countries and stresses that iran has a legal right to develop nuclear power .
rohani insisted that no institution had the authority to deprive a country of a peaceful nuclear energy program .
but experts also say that enrichment is an integral step in the production of atomic weapons , and washington has long harbored suspicions about the islamic country 's aims for developing its nuclear capacity .
the us believes that oil-rich iran , which the bush administration described as a member of the " axis of evil , " has no need for nuclear reactors , even for civilian programs .
criticism from eu the threatening posture from tehran marks a turn-around from last october , when the country agreed to more stringent inspections and signed the additional protocol .
at the time , iran also consented to the suspension of uranium enrichment activities .
in return , britain , france and germany , promised to help develop technology for a civil atomic energy plant .
but last week , the european union abandoned its policy of " constructive engagement , " after the bloc 's big three joined forces with the united states and decided to issue a deadline for tehran to comply with international demands dispel concerns about nuclear activities .
" the eu calls on iran to heed the content of the resolution adopted by iaea 's board of governors , in particular with regard to the necessity to suspend fully all its enrichment related activities , " the head of the dutch delegation told a meeting of members of the iaea on behalf of the eu .
tehran insists it abided by the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and allowed spot inspections proving the intention behind its nuclear program was civilian in nature .
officials in tehran also point out that the suspension of enrichment was not a legal requirement but a voluntary measure .

in a city reeling from sweeping cuts to the arts , moma 's overwhelming success marks a new twist in berlin 's ongoing culture wars . as the museum of modern art exhibition drew to a close this weekend , berlin was left wondering exactly what to make of the media circus that 's been rocking the city over the last seven months .
" moma helped art reach a wider public , " dr. matthias henkel from the berlin national museums told dw-world .
but that 's almost an under-statement .
one survey showed that 15 percent of the visitors , who endured waits of up to ten hours outside the neue nationalgalerie , had never even been to a museum before .
much to the indignation of the city 's art establishment , the success of the temporary exhibit of works from the new york-based moma prompted german president horst köhler to call for a " super museum " showcasing the best of berlin 's existing collections .
taking stock bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the last days of the exhibit , visitors often waited up to 10 hours to get a ticket .
it 's hardly surprising that cash-strapped berlin is keen to capitalize on the moma phenomenon .
in a city of 3.4 million , the visiting exhibition attracted over one million visitors , some 750,000 of whom came from out of town .
with such impressive figures , people have realized there are cultural and economic lessons to be learned .
klaus wowereit , berlin 's media-savvy mayor , welcomed the president 's idea and suggested the city 's museums pool their respective pièces de resistance in a temporary exhibition with moma-style pulling-power .
" it 's a charming proposal and i 'm sure a berlin exhibition would complement the moma exhibition very well , " he said .
" when you 've understood how to turn art into an event you can reach a vast public , and moreover , you 've whetted the public 's appetite for -lrb- the city 's -rrb- many museums and galleries . "
professor peter raue , president of the friends of the nationalgalerie , confirmed this .
" all of berlin 's museums recorded an increase in visitor numbers by 100 percent , " he told dw-world .
the superficial sheen of ' postcard ' museums but not everyone was enamored with the moma-effect .
the show might have been embraced by the public and the politicians , but the art establishment has been largely hostile - and not just because of a perceived us imperialism on the part of the curators .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georg baselitz " art that 's easy to consume can be counter-productive , " insisted jörn merkert from the berlinische galerie , set to re-open in october after a seven-year absence .
as director of a museum boasting work by renowned 20th-century german artists including otto dix , ernst ludwig kirchner and georg baselitz -lrb- photo -rrb- , one of merkert 's priorities is to anchor his gallery firmly within the community by offering children 's workshops and facilities for the disabled , for example .
" it 's all very well promoting art as an event , but it 's also important to strengthen the profile of museums and their collections , " he told dw-world .
" from a marketing point of view , it should n't be about individual works with ' post-card ' potential , " he said dismissively .
" no one needs ' post-card ' museums . "
as far as merkert is concerned , berlin seldom sees sensational public interest in an exhibition because the capital 's museums have to work with " negligible marketing and advertising budgets due to the catastrophic state of berlin 's finances . "
" moma had a marketing budget of € 1 million , " he pointed out .
" for our new gallery , we had just € 50,000 at our disposal , most of which we scraped together out of private funds . "
tine nehler , press-spokesperson at the pinakothek der moderne in munich , agreed .
" in terms of publicity and marketing , moma showed what could be possible , " she told dw-world .
but she also felt germany 's president missed the point when he called for the creation of a super museum .
" it would n't make sense to centralize the country 's art collections , " she said .
" there 's simply no need for it . "
not only is it superfluous , argued dr. henkel of the berlin national museums , such a proposal would be positively detrimental .
" sifting off the ' crown jewels ' would only weaken individual collections , " he said .
selling berlin short the problem is n't only financial .
" germany suffers from a major deficit when it comes to making museums attractive to visitors , " says jörn merkert .
" it 's a question of changing people 's consciousness , " he stressed .
" berlin completely fails to advertise its quality collections .
it has 165 museums and at least 40 of them are world-class , " he said .
" the gemäldegalerie , for example , owns the world 's largest collection of rembrandts . "
christina weiss , state secretary for media and culture , also said the city had enough high-profile collections .
" berlin already has ' super museums ' .
the 17 berlin national museums attracted 3.2 million visitors last year . "
and moma is by no means the only exhibition making headlines in the capital this year .
the hamburger bahnhof museum , redesigned in 1996 by architect josef paul kleihues and home to works by andy warhol , anselm kiefer and joseph beuys , is now set to host the highly controversial friedrich christian flick collection .
opening just two days after moma closes , the show has already generated reams of publicity .
day-to-day realities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guggenheim museum in bilbao , spain .
sensational as they are , the reverberations of moma ca n't be equated with the ' bilbao effect ' - the economic boom experienced in the spanish city after the frank gehry-designed guggenheim foundation opened in 1997 .
natascha kompatzki from berlin tourism marketing pointed out that the 11.33 million visitors to berlin last year made it the city 's record year for tourism , but she attributed the trend primarily to berlin 's newly-acquired status as a low-budget airlines destination .
" the number of visitors who came to berlin for moma were only the icing on the cake in what 's a more general development , " she told dw-world , and added the show was first and foremost a boost to berlin 's image .
according to jörn merkert , germany 's politicans are making a mistake in seeing moma 's success as a yardstick for future exhibitions .
" museums have to deal with day-to-day realities , " he said .
" they need to be more than spectacular fireworks that explode and then disappear .

" it 's all very well promoting art as an event , but it 's also important to strengthen the profile of museums and their collections , " he told dw-world .
" from a marketing point of view , it should n't be about individual works with ' post-card ' potential , " he said dismissively .
" no one needs ' post-card ' museums . "
as far as merkert is concerned , berlin seldom sees sensational public interest in an exhibition because the capital 's museums have to work with " negligible marketing and advertising budgets due to the catastrophic state of berlin 's finances . "
" moma had a marketing budget of € 1 million , " he pointed out .
" for our new gallery , we had just € 50,000 at our disposal , most of which we scraped together out of private funds . "
tine nehler , press-spokesperson at the pinakothek der moderne in munich , agreed .
" in terms of publicity and marketing , moma showed what could be possible , " she told dw-world .
but she also felt germany 's president missed the point when he called for the creation of a super museum .
" it would n't make sense to centralize the country 's art collections , " she said .
" there 's simply no need for it . "
not only is it superfluous , argued dr. henkel of the berlin national museums , such a proposal would be positively detrimental .
" sifting off the ' crown jewels ' would only weaken individual collections , " he said .
selling berlin short the problem is n't only financial .
" germany suffers from a major deficit when it comes to making museums attractive to visitors , " says jörn merkert .
" it 's a question of changing people 's consciousness , " he stressed .
" berlin completely fails to advertise its quality collections .
it has 165 museums and at least 40 of them are world-class , " he said .
" the gemäldegalerie , for example , owns the world 's largest collection of rembrandts . "
christina weiss , state secretary for media and culture , also said the city had enough high-profile collections .
" berlin already has ' super museums ' .
the 17 berlin national museums attracted 3.2 million visitors last year . "
and moma is by no means the only exhibition making headlines in the capital this year .
the hamburger bahnhof museum , redesigned in 1996 by architect josef paul kleihues and home to works by andy warhol , anselm kiefer and joseph beuys , is now set to host the highly controversial friedrich christian flick collection .
opening just two days after moma closes , the show has already generated reams of publicity .
day-to-day realities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guggenheim museum in bilbao , spain .
sensational as they are , the reverberations of moma ca n't be equated with the ' bilbao effect ' - the economic boom experienced in the spanish city after the frank gehry-designed guggenheim foundation opened in 1997 .
natascha kompatzki from berlin tourism marketing pointed out that the 11.33 million visitors to berlin last year made it the city 's record year for tourism , but she attributed the trend primarily to berlin 's newly-acquired status as a low-budget airlines destination .
" the number of visitors who came to berlin for moma were only the icing on the cake in what 's a more general development , " she told dw-world , and added the show was first and foremost a boost to berlin 's image .
according to jörn merkert , germany 's politicans are making a mistake in seeing moma 's success as a yardstick for future exhibitions .

in a city reeling from sweeping cuts to the arts , moma 's overwhelming success marks a new twist in berlin 's ongoing culture wars . as the museum of modern art exhibition drew to a close this weekend , berlin was left wondering exactly what to make of the media circus that 's been rocking the city over the last seven months .
" moma helped art reach a wider public , " dr. matthias henkel from the berlin national museums told dw-world .
but that 's almost an under-statement .
one survey showed that 15 percent of the visitors , who endured waits of up to ten hours outside the neue nationalgalerie , had never even been to a museum before .
much to the indignation of the city 's art establishment , the success of the temporary exhibit of works from the new york-based moma prompted german president horst köhler to call for a " super museum " showcasing the best of berlin 's existing collections .
taking stock bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the last days of the exhibit , visitors often waited up to 10 hours to get a ticket .
it 's hardly surprising that cash-strapped berlin is keen to capitalize on the moma phenomenon .
in a city of 3.4 million , the visiting exhibition attracted over one million visitors , some 750,000 of whom came from out of town .
with such impressive figures , people have realized there are cultural and economic lessons to be learned .
klaus wowereit , berlin 's media-savvy mayor , welcomed the president 's idea and suggested the city 's museums pool their respective pièces de resistance in a temporary exhibition with moma-style pulling-power .
" it 's a charming proposal and i 'm sure a berlin exhibition would complement the moma exhibition very well , " he said .
" when you 've understood how to turn art into an event you can reach a vast public , and moreover , you 've whetted the public 's appetite for -lrb- the city 's -rrb- many museums and galleries . "
professor peter raue , president of the friends of the nationalgalerie , confirmed this .
" all of berlin 's museums recorded an increase in visitor numbers by 100 percent , " he told dw-world .
the superficial sheen of ' postcard ' museums but not everyone was enamored with the moma-effect .
the show might have been embraced by the public and the politicians , but the art establishment has been largely hostile - and not just because of a perceived us imperialism on the part of the curators .

tine nehler , press-spokesperson at the pinakothek der moderne in munich , agreed .
" in terms of publicity and marketing , moma showed what could be possible , " she told dw-world .
but she also felt germany 's president missed the point when he called for the creation of a super museum .
" it would n't make sense to centralize the country 's art collections , " she said .

not only is it superfluous , argued dr. henkel of the berlin national museums , such a proposal would be positively detrimental .
" sifting off the ' crown jewels ' would only weaken individual collections , " he said .

" germany suffers from a major deficit when it comes to making museums attractive to visitors , " says jörn merkert .
" it 's a question of changing people 's consciousness , " he stressed .
" berlin completely fails to advertise its quality collections .
it has 165 museums and at least 40 of them are world-class , " he said .

christina weiss , state secretary for media and culture , also said the city had enough high-profile collections .
" berlin already has ' super museums ' .
the 17 berlin national museums attracted 3.2 million visitors last year . "
and moma is by no means the only exhibition making headlines in the capital this year .
the hamburger bahnhof museum , redesigned in 1996 by architect josef paul kleihues and home to works by andy warhol , anselm kiefer and joseph beuys , is now set to host the highly controversial friedrich christian flick collection .

sensational as they are , the reverberations of moma ca n't be equated with the ' bilbao effect ' - the economic boom experienced in the spanish city after the frank gehry-designed guggenheim foundation opened in 1997 .
natascha kompatzki from berlin tourism marketing pointed out that the 11.33 million visitors to berlin last year made it the city 's record year for tourism , but she attributed the trend primarily to berlin 's newly-acquired status as a low-budget airlines destination .

in a city reeling from sweeping cuts to the arts , moma 's overwhelming success marks a new twist in berlin 's ongoing culture wars . as the museum of modern art exhibition drew to a close this weekend , berlin was left wondering exactly what to make of the media circus that 's been rocking the city over the last seven months .
" moma helped art reach a wider public , " dr. matthias henkel from the berlin national museums told dw-world .
but that 's almost an under-statement .
one survey showed that 15 percent of the visitors , who endured waits of up to ten hours outside the neue nationalgalerie , had never even been to a museum before .
much to the indignation of the city 's art establishment , the success of the temporary exhibit of works from the new york-based moma prompted german president horst köhler to call for a " super museum " showcasing the best of berlin 's existing collections .
taking stock bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the last days of the exhibit , visitors often waited up to 10 hours to get a ticket .
it 's hardly surprising that cash-strapped berlin is keen to capitalize on the moma phenomenon .
in a city of 3.4 million , the visiting exhibition attracted over one million visitors , some 750,000 of whom came from out of town .
with such impressive figures , people have realized there are cultural and economic lessons to be learned .
klaus wowereit , berlin 's media-savvy mayor , welcomed the president 's idea and suggested the city 's museums pool their respective pièces de resistance in a temporary exhibition with moma-style pulling-power .
" it 's a charming proposal and i 'm sure a berlin exhibition would complement the moma exhibition very well , " he said .
" when you 've understood how to turn art into an event you can reach a vast public , and moreover , you 've whetted the public 's appetite for -lrb- the city 's -rrb- many museums and galleries . "
professor peter raue , president of the friends of the nationalgalerie , confirmed this .
" all of berlin 's museums recorded an increase in visitor numbers by 100 percent , " he told dw-world .
the superficial sheen of ' postcard ' museums but not everyone was enamored with the moma-effect .
the show might have been embraced by the public and the politicians , but the art establishment has been largely hostile - and not just because of a perceived us imperialism on the part of the curators .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georg baselitz " art that 's easy to consume can be counter-productive , " insisted jörn merkert from the berlinische galerie , set to re-open in october after a seven-year absence .
as director of a museum boasting work by renowned 20th-century german artists including otto dix , ernst ludwig kirchner and georg baselitz -lrb- photo -rrb- , one of merkert 's priorities is to anchor his gallery firmly within the community by offering children 's workshops and facilities for the disabled , for example .
" it 's all very well promoting art as an event , but it 's also important to strengthen the profile of museums and their collections , " he told dw-world .
" from a marketing point of view , it should n't be about individual works with ' post-card ' potential , " he said dismissively .
" no one needs ' post-card ' museums . "
as far as merkert is concerned , berlin seldom sees sensational public interest in an exhibition because the capital 's museums have to work with " negligible marketing and advertising budgets due to the catastrophic state of berlin 's finances . "
" moma had a marketing budget of € 1 million , " he pointed out .
" for our new gallery , we had just € 50,000 at our disposal , most of which we scraped together out of private funds . "
tine nehler , press-spokesperson at the pinakothek der moderne in munich , agreed .

" greeted the right-wing npd success in saxony germany woke up to fears that the political tremors sparked by state elections in saxony and brandenburg on sunday could lead to deeper division within their country and scare off investors . observers say the success of the party of democratic socialism , the successor to east germany 's communist party , and the extreme right national party of germany -lrb- npd -rrb- and german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- in sunday 's elections show how angry east germans are at the reality they face 14 years after reunification . the pds rode a wave of discontent over chancellor gerhard schröder 's tough social reforms to 28 percent of the vote , making them second-strongest party in brandenburg , behind schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- . the governing spd and conservative christian democratic union " got a serious slap in the face , " said lothar bisky , the brandenburg parliamentary head for the pds , a party that most analysts left for dead after their failure in the last federal election . left-wingers " divide " the country , says schily though the party will most likely be excluded from a coalition government - the spd is more likely to pick the conservative christian democratic union - their success has nevertheless sent the government in berlin a message , and one they do n't like to hear .
by making themselves , as a regional party , the " mouthpiece of a part of germany " they are deepening the divide between east and west , interior minister otto schily said of the party , which has only found success so far in the east . the same goes for the npd , which schily tried and failed to ban two years ago .
based on their sunday success , the right wing party can claim 12 seats in saxony 's parliament .
the 9.2 percent they won was almost as much as the 9.8 percent of the social democratic party , the party of germany 's chancellor .
right wing candidate ignored on television " today is a fantastic day for all germans that still want to be bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holger apfel -lrb- in brown -rrb- , celebrates with npd functionaries germans , " the npd 's top candidate , holger apfel , said during a round of candidate interviews in german station zdf 's studios .
soon after his comment , the other candidates walked off the set and the reporter broke off apfel 's diatribe . political scientists say the miserable economic climate and the anger of young east germans that fuelled the npd 's sunday success could spark a worrying trend .
" if some sort of economic miracle doesn ’ t take place in the east , our society 's potential for supporting right wing politics could reach high levels , " said political scientist jürgen felter on the german talk show sabine christiansen , sunday night ..
he estimated the potential at 15 percent across germany . saxony state officials fear the presence of right- wing extremists in the state parliament will scare off the international investors that have made saxony one of the few economic bright spots in the east .
in recent years , the state has been able to profile itself as a center for bio-technology and microchip production while enjoying an increase in tourism . ahead of the elections , saxony 's premier , georg milbradt , said that should the npd make it into the parliament , he need n't bother going to america anymore to promote his state . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder 's social democrats suffer fresh losses german chancellor schröder 's social democrats lost major ground in elections on sunday in two former communist states as parties from the extreme right and far left posted electoral gains .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : fires , films and fashion german-turkish film " head-on " wins berlinale the yearning for kraut art " tainted art " controversy surrounds berlin exhibition lagerfeld causes cheap chic craze culture & lifestyle -pipe- 20.09.2004 the party 's over - life after moma großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what 's next after moma in berlin ?
in a city reeling from sweeping cuts to the arts , moma 's overwhelming success marks a new twist in berlin 's ongoing culture wars . as the museum of modern art exhibition drew to a close this weekend , berlin was left wondering exactly what to make of the media circus that 's been rocking the city over the last seven months .
" moma helped art reach a wider public , " dr. matthias henkel from the berlin national museums told dw-world .
but that 's almost an under-statement .
one survey showed that 15 percent of the visitors , who endured waits of up to ten hours outside the neue nationalgalerie , had never even been to a museum before .
much to the indignation of the city 's art establishment , the success of the temporary exhibit of works from the new york-based moma prompted german president horst köhler to call for a " super museum " showcasing the best of berlin 's existing collections .
taking stock bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the last days of the exhibit , visitors often waited up to 10 hours to get a ticket .
it 's hardly surprising that cash-strapped berlin is keen to capitalize on the moma phenomenon .
in a city of 3.4 million , the visiting exhibition attracted over one million visitors , some 750,000 of whom came from out of town .
with such impressive figures , people have realized there are cultural and economic lessons to be learned .
klaus wowereit , berlin 's media-savvy mayor , welcomed the president 's idea and suggested the city 's museums pool their respective pièces de resistance in a temporary exhibition with moma-style pulling-power .
" it 's a charming proposal and i 'm sure a berlin exhibition would complement the moma exhibition very well , " he said .
" when you 've understood how to turn art into an event you can reach a vast public , and moreover , you 've whetted the public 's appetite for -lrb- the city 's -rrb- many museums and galleries . "
professor peter raue , president of the friends of the nationalgalerie , confirmed this .
" all of berlin 's museums recorded an increase in visitor numbers by 100 percent , " he told dw-world .
the superficial sheen of ' postcard ' museums but not everyone was enamored with the moma-effect .
the show might have been embraced by the public and the politicians , but the art establishment has been largely hostile - and not just because of a perceived us imperialism on the part of the curators .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georg baselitz " art that 's easy to consume can be counter-productive , " insisted jörn merkert from the berlinische galerie , set to re-open in october after a seven-year absence .
as director of a museum boasting work by renowned 20th-century german artists including otto dix , ernst ludwig kirchner and georg baselitz -lrb- photo -rrb- , one of merkert 's priorities is to anchor his gallery firmly within the community by offering children 's workshops and facilities for the disabled , for example .
" it 's all very well promoting art as an event , but it 's also important to strengthen the profile of museums and their collections , " he told dw-world .
" from a marketing point of view , it should n't be about individual works with ' post-card ' potential , " he said dismissively .
" no one needs ' post-card ' museums . "
as far as merkert is concerned , berlin seldom sees sensational public interest in an exhibition because the capital 's museums have to work with " negligible marketing and advertising budgets due to the catastrophic state of berlin 's finances . "
" moma had a marketing budget of € 1 million , " he pointed out .
" for our new gallery , we had just € 50,000 at our disposal , most of which we scraped together out of private funds . "
tine nehler , press-spokesperson at the pinakothek der moderne in munich , agreed .
" in terms of publicity and marketing , moma showed what could be possible , " she told dw-world .
but she also felt germany 's president missed the point when he called for the creation of a super museum .
" it would n't make sense to centralize the country 's art collections , " she said .
" there 's simply no need for it . "
not only is it superfluous , argued dr. henkel of the berlin national museums , such a proposal would be positively detrimental .

in a city reeling from sweeping cuts to the arts , moma 's overwhelming success marks a new twist in berlin 's ongoing culture wars . as the museum of modern art exhibition drew to a close this weekend , berlin was left wondering exactly what to make of the media circus that 's been rocking the city over the last seven months .
" moma helped art reach a wider public , " dr. matthias henkel from the berlin national museums told dw-world .
but that 's almost an under-statement .
one survey showed that 15 percent of the visitors , who endured waits of up to ten hours outside the neue nationalgalerie , had never even been to a museum before .
much to the indignation of the city 's art establishment , the success of the temporary exhibit of works from the new york-based moma prompted german president horst köhler to call for a " super museum " showcasing the best of berlin 's existing collections .
taking stock bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the last days of the exhibit , visitors often waited up to 10 hours to get a ticket .
it 's hardly surprising that cash-strapped berlin is keen to capitalize on the moma phenomenon .
in a city of 3.4 million , the visiting exhibition attracted over one million visitors , some 750,000 of whom came from out of town .
with such impressive figures , people have realized there are cultural and economic lessons to be learned .
klaus wowereit , berlin 's media-savvy mayor , welcomed the president 's idea and suggested the city 's museums pool their respective pièces de resistance in a temporary exhibition with moma-style pulling-power .
" it 's a charming proposal and i 'm sure a berlin exhibition would complement the moma exhibition very well , " he said .
" when you 've understood how to turn art into an event you can reach a vast public , and moreover , you 've whetted the public 's appetite for -lrb- the city 's -rrb- many museums and galleries . "
professor peter raue , president of the friends of the nationalgalerie , confirmed this .
" all of berlin 's museums recorded an increase in visitor numbers by 100 percent , " he told dw-world .
the superficial sheen of ' postcard ' museums but not everyone was enamored with the moma-effect .
the show might have been embraced by the public and the politicians , but the art establishment has been largely hostile - and not just because of a perceived us imperialism on the part of the curators .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georg baselitz " art that 's easy to consume can be counter-productive , " insisted jörn merkert from the berlinische galerie , set to re-open in october after a seven-year absence .
as director of a museum boasting work by renowned 20th-century german artists including otto dix , ernst ludwig kirchner and georg baselitz -lrb- photo -rrb- , one of merkert 's priorities is to anchor his gallery firmly within the community by offering children 's workshops and facilities for the disabled , for example .
" it 's all very well promoting art as an event , but it 's also important to strengthen the profile of museums and their collections , " he told dw-world .
" from a marketing point of view , it should n't be about individual works with ' post-card ' potential , " he said dismissively .
" no one needs ' post-card ' museums . "
as far as merkert is concerned , berlin seldom sees sensational public interest in an exhibition because the capital 's museums have to work with " negligible marketing and advertising budgets due to the catastrophic state of berlin 's finances . "
" moma had a marketing budget of € 1 million , " he pointed out .
" for our new gallery , we had just € 50,000 at our disposal , most of which we scraped together out of private funds . "
tine nehler , press-spokesperson at the pinakothek der moderne in munich , agreed .
" in terms of publicity and marketing , moma showed what could be possible , " she told dw-world .
but she also felt germany 's president missed the point when he called for the creation of a super museum .
" it would n't make sense to centralize the country 's art collections , " she said .
" there 's simply no need for it . "
not only is it superfluous , argued dr. henkel of the berlin national museums , such a proposal would be positively detrimental .
" sifting off the ' crown jewels ' would only weaken individual collections , " he said .

in a city reeling from sweeping cuts to the arts , moma 's overwhelming success marks a new twist in berlin 's ongoing culture wars . as the museum of modern art exhibition drew to a close this weekend , berlin was left wondering exactly what to make of the media circus that 's been rocking the city over the last seven months .
" moma helped art reach a wider public , " dr. matthias henkel from the berlin national museums told dw-world .
but that 's almost an under-statement .
one survey showed that 15 percent of the visitors , who endured waits of up to ten hours outside the neue nationalgalerie , had never even been to a museum before .
much to the indignation of the city 's art establishment , the success of the temporary exhibit of works from the new york-based moma prompted german president horst köhler to call for a " super museum " showcasing the best of berlin 's existing collections .
taking stock bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the last days of the exhibit , visitors often waited up to 10 hours to get a ticket .
it 's hardly surprising that cash-strapped berlin is keen to capitalize on the moma phenomenon .
in a city of 3.4 million , the visiting exhibition attracted over one million visitors , some 750,000 of whom came from out of town .
with such impressive figures , people have realized there are cultural and economic lessons to be learned .
klaus wowereit , berlin 's media-savvy mayor , welcomed the president 's idea and suggested the city 's museums pool their respective pièces de resistance in a temporary exhibition with moma-style pulling-power .
" it 's a charming proposal and i 'm sure a berlin exhibition would complement the moma exhibition very well , " he said .
" when you 've understood how to turn art into an event you can reach a vast public , and moreover , you 've whetted the public 's appetite for -lrb- the city 's -rrb- many museums and galleries . "
professor peter raue , president of the friends of the nationalgalerie , confirmed this .
" all of berlin 's museums recorded an increase in visitor numbers by 100 percent , " he told dw-world .
the superficial sheen of ' postcard ' museums but not everyone was enamored with the moma-effect .
the show might have been embraced by the public and the politicians , but the art establishment has been largely hostile - and not just because of a perceived us imperialism on the part of the curators .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georg baselitz " art that 's easy to consume can be counter-productive , " insisted jörn merkert from the berlinische galerie , set to re-open in october after a seven-year absence .
as director of a museum boasting work by renowned 20th-century german artists including otto dix , ernst ludwig kirchner and georg baselitz -lrb- photo -rrb- , one of merkert 's priorities is to anchor his gallery firmly within the community by offering children 's workshops and facilities for the disabled , for example .
" it 's all very well promoting art as an event , but it 's also important to strengthen the profile of museums and their collections , " he told dw-world .
" from a marketing point of view , it should n't be about individual works with ' post-card ' potential , " he said dismissively .
" no one needs ' post-card ' museums . "
as far as merkert is concerned , berlin seldom sees sensational public interest in an exhibition because the capital 's museums have to work with " negligible marketing and advertising budgets due to the catastrophic state of berlin 's finances . "
" moma had a marketing budget of € 1 million , " he pointed out .
" for our new gallery , we had just € 50,000 at our disposal , most of which we scraped together out of private funds . "
tine nehler , press-spokesperson at the pinakothek der moderne in munich , agreed .
" in terms of publicity and marketing , moma showed what could be possible , " she told dw-world .
but she also felt germany 's president missed the point when he called for the creation of a super museum .
" it would n't make sense to centralize the country 's art collections , " she said .
" there 's simply no need for it . "
not only is it superfluous , argued dr. henkel of the berlin national museums , such a proposal would be positively detrimental .
" sifting off the ' crown jewels ' would only weaken individual collections , " he said .
selling berlin short the problem is n't only financial .
" germany suffers from a major deficit when it comes to making museums attractive to visitors , " says jörn merkert .
" it 's a question of changing people 's consciousness , " he stressed .
" berlin completely fails to advertise its quality collections .
it has 165 museums and at least 40 of them are world-class , " he said .
" the gemäldegalerie , for example , owns the world 's largest collection of rembrandts . "
christina weiss , state secretary for media and culture , also said the city had enough high-profile collections .
" berlin already has ' super museums ' .
the 17 berlin national museums attracted 3.2 million visitors last year . "
and moma is by no means the only exhibition making headlines in the capital this year .
the hamburger bahnhof museum , redesigned in 1996 by architect josef paul kleihues and home to works by andy warhol , anselm kiefer and joseph beuys , is now set to host the highly controversial friedrich christian flick collection .

" iran will not accept any obligation regarding the suspension of uranium enrichment , " rohani said at a news conference on sunday .
" no international body can force iran to do so . "
over the weekend , the united nations ' nuclear watchdog , iaea , had unanimously adopted a joint us-european resolution giving iran two months to stop producing enriched uranium or face referral to the security council .
iran digs its heels in according to reuters news agency , the resolution agreed to by the iaea 's board of governors called on iran to freeze all activities related to uranium enrichment and to grant full and prompt access to the iaea 's inspectors , as well as provide them with any further information needed , by nov .
25 .
iran responded by saying that if the issue were referred to the security council for possible sanctions , it would respond by blocking snap checks of its atomic facilities .
hassan rohani , head of iran 's supreme national security council , added that were the case to go to the security council , iran would also consider withdrawing from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , which it signed in 2003 .
" if they want to send iran to the security council , it is not wise , and we will stop implementing the additional protocol , " he said .
the additional protocol to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty calls for snap nuclear checks by iaea inspectors .
a " peaceful " nuclear program tehran has said it wants to secure its own source of fuel for power stations so that it is not dependent on other countries and stresses that iran has a legal right to develop nuclear power .
rohani insisted that no institution had the authority to deprive a country of a peaceful nuclear energy program .
but experts also say that enrichment is an integral step in the production of atomic weapons , and washington has long harbored suspicions about the islamic country 's aims for developing its nuclear capacity .
the us believes that oil-rich iran , which the bush administration described as a member of the " axis of evil , " has no need for nuclear reactors , even for civilian programs .
criticism from eu the threatening posture from tehran marks a turn-around from last october , when the country agreed to more stringent inspections and signed the additional protocol .
at the time , iran also consented to the suspension of uranium enrichment activities .
in return , britain , france and germany , promised to help develop technology for a civil atomic energy plant .
but last week , the european union abandoned its policy of " constructive engagement , " after the bloc 's big three joined forces with the united states and decided to issue a deadline for tehran to comply with international demands dispel concerns about nuclear activities .
" the eu calls on iran to heed the content of the resolution adopted by iaea 's board of governors , in particular with regard to the necessity to suspend fully all its enrichment related activities , " the head of the dutch delegation told a meeting of members of the iaea on behalf of the eu .
tehran insists it abided by the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and allowed spot inspections proving the intention behind its nuclear program was civilian in nature .
officials in tehran also point out that the suspension of enrichment was not a legal requirement but a voluntary measure .
in november , the iaea board of governors will meet to review iran 's alleged nuclear weapons program .
the country has until then to answer all outstanding questions . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us , eu agree to resolution on iran on thursday , the us and key eu allies agreed on a draft resolution calling on iran to end its nuclear program .

17 , 2004 -rrb- iran said to be close to nuclear deal ahead of a meeting of the un 's nuclear watchdog next week , diplomats said iran has agreed in principle to freeze some of its nuclear activities .

" greeted the right-wing npd success in saxony germany woke up to fears that the political tremors sparked by state elections in saxony and brandenburg on sunday could lead to deeper division within their country and scare off investors . observers say the success of the party of democratic socialism , the successor to east germany 's communist party , and the extreme right national party of germany -lrb- npd -rrb- and german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- in sunday 's elections show how angry east germans are at the reality they face 14 years after reunification . the pds rode a wave of discontent over chancellor gerhard schröder 's tough social reforms to 28 percent of the vote , making them second-strongest party in brandenburg , behind schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- . the governing spd and conservative christian democratic union " got a serious slap in the face , " said lothar bisky , the brandenburg parliamentary head for the pds , a party that most analysts left for dead after their failure in the last federal election . left-wingers " divide " the country , says schily though the party will most likely be excluded from a coalition government - the spd is more likely to pick the conservative christian democratic union - their success has nevertheless sent the government in berlin a message , and one they do n't like to hear .
by making themselves , as a regional party , the " mouthpiece of a part of germany " they are deepening the divide between east and west , interior minister otto schily said of the party , which has only found success so far in the east . the same goes for the npd , which schily tried and failed to ban two years ago .
based on their sunday success , the right wing party can claim 12 seats in saxony 's parliament .
the 9.2 percent they won was almost as much as the 9.8 percent of the social democratic party , the party of germany 's chancellor .
right wing candidate ignored on television " today is a fantastic day for all germans that still want to be bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holger apfel -lrb- in brown -rrb- , celebrates with npd functionaries germans , " the npd 's top candidate , holger apfel , said during a round of candidate interviews in german station zdf 's studios .
soon after his comment , the other candidates walked off the set and the reporter broke off apfel 's diatribe . political scientists say the miserable economic climate and the anger of young east germans that fuelled the npd 's sunday success could spark a worrying trend .
" if some sort of economic miracle doesn ’ t take place in the east , our society 's potential for supporting right wing politics could reach high levels , " said political scientist jürgen felter on the german talk show sabine christiansen , sunday night ..
he estimated the potential at 15 percent across germany . saxony state officials fear the presence of right- wing extremists in the state parliament will scare off the international investors that have made saxony one of the few economic bright spots in the east .
in recent years , the state has been able to profile itself as a center for bio-technology and microchip production while enjoying an increase in tourism . ahead of the elections , saxony 's premier , georg milbradt , said that should the npd make it into the parliament , he need n't bother going to america anymore to promote his state . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder 's social democrats suffer fresh losses german chancellor schröder 's social democrats lost major ground in elections on sunday in two former communist states as parties from the extreme right and far left posted electoral gains .

while there he will try to make case for a permanent german seat on the un security council . world leaders will gather at the united nations for their annual debate on tuesday with the aftershocks of the iraq war , sudan 's darfur region , aids and world poverty at the top of the international agenda . also to be discussed is the issue of reform of the un itself .
during his address to the united nations general assembly on thursday , fischer is expected to push for a permanent seat for germany in any revamp of the un security council . while in new york , fischer will meet with the representatives of three other nations to discuss making a joint effort for an expansion of the security council .
germany , japan , brazil and india , dubbed the g4 , all hope to become permanent members of the important world body . un secretary general kofi annan has made it a matter of urgency to reform the un security council , and has appointed a high-level panel to come up with proposals by december that he would like to present at next year 's session . " quite honestly , i do not believe that anyone will consider the un reform complete without security council reform bringing it into line with today 's realities , " he said earlier this month . among the industrialized nations , both japan and germany , the world 's second and third largest economies , are both natural contenders since they pay a large chunk of the un 's membership dues .
brazil and india are large and important developing nations that would expand the regional coverage of the security council . " we have to assume that every decision made by the security council has not only political , but also economic implications , " un expert klaus hüfner told dw-world .
" therefore it 's very important to germany that decisions taken there are not to its disadvantage . " unified push brazil , germany , india and japan are planning to use their time in new york to make a unified push for all four nations to join an expanded council when or if any reform of the current structure can be agreed .
but egypt has already indicated it will fight for a permanent muslim seat on the council and the reform issue , which has already been talked about in un corridors for years without concrete action , looks to remain as tricky as ever . meanwhile even supporters of the united nations have been tempted to point to its handling of another crisis besides iraq - the catastrophe in darfur - as proof that the world body is too ineffective . an estimated 50,000 people have died in sudan 's darfur region since february 2003 in what even un officials have termed a brutal campaign of ethnic cleansing , if not the genocide that washington has called it . the security council passed a resolution on saturday threatening sanctions on sudan if it did not bring an end to the bloodshed , but four council nations abstained in the vote after days of laborious debate .
one of the key passages in the resolution pointed out that sudan had failed to heed a similar resolution adopted almost two months before . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german hopes for un security council seat dampened until this week , the possibility of germany gaining a permanent seat on the un security council looked good .
now , a plan to reform the international organization could put the brakes on that ambition .

the chief defendant , a 51-year-old bar owner identified as christa w. , was accused of charging her clients the equivalent of € 10 -lrb- $ 12 -rrb- each to sexually assault the child , whose body has never been found . she was also alleged to have filmed and photographed the acts .
prosecution lawyers told the court that the boy , known as pascal , was thought to have been lured into the bar on sept .
30 , 2001 and to have died the same day .
but investigators who searched a quarry near the french village of forbach , about 10 kilometers -lrb- six miles -rrb- away from the german border , failed to find his corpse and said they were unsure exactly how and when he died .
court sources said that some of the defendants had admitted to raping or killing pascal several months ago .
four men and a second woman were charged as principals and seven as accomplices .
all the defendants were in their 40s or 50s .
court sources said that seven of them had previously been charged with sex offences against two other children .
in october last year , a 49-year man , described as mentally retarded and an alcoholic , was jailed for seven years and ordered to be detained in a psychiatric hospital after being convicted of sexually assaulting pascal .

in a city reeling from sweeping cuts to the arts , moma 's overwhelming success marks a new twist in berlin 's ongoing culture wars . as the museum of modern art exhibition drew to a close this weekend , berlin was left wondering exactly what to make of the media circus that 's been rocking the city over the last seven months .
" moma helped art reach a wider public , " dr. matthias henkel from the berlin national museums told dw-world .
but that 's almost an under-statement .
one survey showed that 15 percent of the visitors , who endured waits of up to ten hours outside the neue nationalgalerie , had never even been to a museum before .
much to the indignation of the city 's art establishment , the success of the temporary exhibit of works from the new york-based moma prompted german president horst köhler to call for a " super museum " showcasing the best of berlin 's existing collections .
taking stock bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the last days of the exhibit , visitors often waited up to 10 hours to get a ticket .
it 's hardly surprising that cash-strapped berlin is keen to capitalize on the moma phenomenon .
in a city of 3.4 million , the visiting exhibition attracted over one million visitors , some 750,000 of whom came from out of town .
with such impressive figures , people have realized there are cultural and economic lessons to be learned .
klaus wowereit , berlin 's media-savvy mayor , welcomed the president 's idea and suggested the city 's museums pool their respective pièces de resistance in a temporary exhibition with moma-style pulling-power .
" it 's a charming proposal and i 'm sure a berlin exhibition would complement the moma exhibition very well , " he said .
" when you 've understood how to turn art into an event you can reach a vast public , and moreover , you 've whetted the public 's appetite for -lrb- the city 's -rrb- many museums and galleries . "
professor peter raue , president of the friends of the nationalgalerie , confirmed this .
" all of berlin 's museums recorded an increase in visitor numbers by 100 percent , " he told dw-world .
the superficial sheen of ' postcard ' museums but not everyone was enamored with the moma-effect .
the show might have been embraced by the public and the politicians , but the art establishment has been largely hostile - and not just because of a perceived us imperialism on the part of the curators .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georg baselitz " art that 's easy to consume can be counter-productive , " insisted jörn merkert from the berlinische galerie , set to re-open in october after a seven-year absence .
as director of a museum boasting work by renowned 20th-century german artists including otto dix , ernst ludwig kirchner and georg baselitz -lrb- photo -rrb- , one of merkert 's priorities is to anchor his gallery firmly within the community by offering children 's workshops and facilities for the disabled , for example .
" it 's all very well promoting art as an event , but it 's also important to strengthen the profile of museums and their collections , " he told dw-world .
" from a marketing point of view , it should n't be about individual works with ' post-card ' potential , " he said dismissively .
" no one needs ' post-card ' museums . "
as far as merkert is concerned , berlin seldom sees sensational public interest in an exhibition because the capital 's museums have to work with " negligible marketing and advertising budgets due to the catastrophic state of berlin 's finances . "
" moma had a marketing budget of € 1 million , " he pointed out .
" for our new gallery , we had just € 50,000 at our disposal , most of which we scraped together out of private funds . "
tine nehler , press-spokesperson at the pinakothek der moderne in munich , agreed .
" in terms of publicity and marketing , moma showed what could be possible , " she told dw-world .
but she also felt germany 's president missed the point when he called for the creation of a super museum .
" it would n't make sense to centralize the country 's art collections , " she said .
" there 's simply no need for it . "
not only is it superfluous , argued dr. henkel of the berlin national museums , such a proposal would be positively detrimental .
" sifting off the ' crown jewels ' would only weaken individual collections , " he said .
selling berlin short the problem is n't only financial .
" germany suffers from a major deficit when it comes to making museums attractive to visitors , " says jörn merkert .
" it 's a question of changing people 's consciousness , " he stressed .
" berlin completely fails to advertise its quality collections .
it has 165 museums and at least 40 of them are world-class , " he said .
" the gemäldegalerie , for example , owns the world 's largest collection of rembrandts . "
christina weiss , state secretary for media and culture , also said the city had enough high-profile collections .
" berlin already has ' super museums ' .
the 17 berlin national museums attracted 3.2 million visitors last year . "
and moma is by no means the only exhibition making headlines in the capital this year .
the hamburger bahnhof museum , redesigned in 1996 by architect josef paul kleihues and home to works by andy warhol , anselm kiefer and joseph beuys , is now set to host the highly controversial friedrich christian flick collection .

in a city reeling from sweeping cuts to the arts , moma 's overwhelming success marks a new twist in berlin 's ongoing culture wars . as the museum of modern art exhibition drew to a close this weekend , berlin was left wondering exactly what to make of the media circus that 's been rocking the city over the last seven months .
" moma helped art reach a wider public , " dr. matthias henkel from the berlin national museums told dw-world .
but that 's almost an under-statement .
one survey showed that 15 percent of the visitors , who endured waits of up to ten hours outside the neue nationalgalerie , had never even been to a museum before .
much to the indignation of the city 's art establishment , the success of the temporary exhibit of works from the new york-based moma prompted german president horst köhler to call for a " super museum " showcasing the best of berlin 's existing collections .
taking stock bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the last days of the exhibit , visitors often waited up to 10 hours to get a ticket .
it 's hardly surprising that cash-strapped berlin is keen to capitalize on the moma phenomenon .
in a city of 3.4 million , the visiting exhibition attracted over one million visitors , some 750,000 of whom came from out of town .
with such impressive figures , people have realized there are cultural and economic lessons to be learned .
klaus wowereit , berlin 's media-savvy mayor , welcomed the president 's idea and suggested the city 's museums pool their respective pièces de resistance in a temporary exhibition with moma-style pulling-power .
" it 's a charming proposal and i 'm sure a berlin exhibition would complement the moma exhibition very well , " he said .
" when you 've understood how to turn art into an event you can reach a vast public , and moreover , you 've whetted the public 's appetite for -lrb- the city 's -rrb- many museums and galleries . "
professor peter raue , president of the friends of the nationalgalerie , confirmed this .
" all of berlin 's museums recorded an increase in visitor numbers by 100 percent , " he told dw-world .
the superficial sheen of ' postcard ' museums but not everyone was enamored with the moma-effect .
the show might have been embraced by the public and the politicians , but the art establishment has been largely hostile - and not just because of a perceived us imperialism on the part of the curators .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georg baselitz " art that 's easy to consume can be counter-productive , " insisted jörn merkert from the berlinische galerie , set to re-open in october after a seven-year absence .
as director of a museum boasting work by renowned 20th-century german artists including otto dix , ernst ludwig kirchner and georg baselitz -lrb- photo -rrb- , one of merkert 's priorities is to anchor his gallery firmly within the community by offering children 's workshops and facilities for the disabled , for example .
" it 's all very well promoting art as an event , but it 's also important to strengthen the profile of museums and their collections , " he told dw-world .
" from a marketing point of view , it should n't be about individual works with ' post-card ' potential , " he said dismissively .
" no one needs ' post-card ' museums . "
as far as merkert is concerned , berlin seldom sees sensational public interest in an exhibition because the capital 's museums have to work with " negligible marketing and advertising budgets due to the catastrophic state of berlin 's finances . "
" moma had a marketing budget of € 1 million , " he pointed out .
" for our new gallery , we had just € 50,000 at our disposal , most of which we scraped together out of private funds . "
tine nehler , press-spokesperson at the pinakothek der moderne in munich , agreed .
" in terms of publicity and marketing , moma showed what could be possible , " she told dw-world .
but she also felt germany 's president missed the point when he called for the creation of a super museum .
" it would n't make sense to centralize the country 's art collections , " she said .
" there 's simply no need for it . "
not only is it superfluous , argued dr. henkel of the berlin national museums , such a proposal would be positively detrimental .
" sifting off the ' crown jewels ' would only weaken individual collections , " he said .
selling berlin short the problem is n't only financial .
" germany suffers from a major deficit when it comes to making museums attractive to visitors , " says jörn merkert .
" it 's a question of changing people 's consciousness , " he stressed .
" berlin completely fails to advertise its quality collections .
it has 165 museums and at least 40 of them are world-class , " he said .
" the gemäldegalerie , for example , owns the world 's largest collection of rembrandts . "
christina weiss , state secretary for media and culture , also said the city had enough high-profile collections .
" berlin already has ' super museums ' .
the 17 berlin national museums attracted 3.2 million visitors last year . "
and moma is by no means the only exhibition making headlines in the capital this year .
the hamburger bahnhof museum , redesigned in 1996 by architect josef paul kleihues and home to works by andy warhol , anselm kiefer and joseph beuys , is now set to host the highly controversial friedrich christian flick collection .

in a city reeling from sweeping cuts to the arts , moma 's overwhelming success marks a new twist in berlin 's ongoing culture wars . as the museum of modern art exhibition drew to a close this weekend , berlin was left wondering exactly what to make of the media circus that 's been rocking the city over the last seven months .
" moma helped art reach a wider public , " dr. matthias henkel from the berlin national museums told dw-world .
but that 's almost an under-statement .
one survey showed that 15 percent of the visitors , who endured waits of up to ten hours outside the neue nationalgalerie , had never even been to a museum before .
much to the indignation of the city 's art establishment , the success of the temporary exhibit of works from the new york-based moma prompted german president horst köhler to call for a " super museum " showcasing the best of berlin 's existing collections .
taking stock bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the last days of the exhibit , visitors often waited up to 10 hours to get a ticket .
it 's hardly surprising that cash-strapped berlin is keen to capitalize on the moma phenomenon .
in a city of 3.4 million , the visiting exhibition attracted over one million visitors , some 750,000 of whom came from out of town .
with such impressive figures , people have realized there are cultural and economic lessons to be learned .
klaus wowereit , berlin 's media-savvy mayor , welcomed the president 's idea and suggested the city 's museums pool their respective pièces de resistance in a temporary exhibition with moma-style pulling-power .
" it 's a charming proposal and i 'm sure a berlin exhibition would complement the moma exhibition very well , " he said .
" when you 've understood how to turn art into an event you can reach a vast public , and moreover , you 've whetted the public 's appetite for -lrb- the city 's -rrb- many museums and galleries . "
professor peter raue , president of the friends of the nationalgalerie , confirmed this .
" all of berlin 's museums recorded an increase in visitor numbers by 100 percent , " he told dw-world .
the superficial sheen of ' postcard ' museums but not everyone was enamored with the moma-effect .
the show might have been embraced by the public and the politicians , but the art establishment has been largely hostile - and not just because of a perceived us imperialism on the part of the curators .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georg baselitz " art that 's easy to consume can be counter-productive , " insisted jörn merkert from the berlinische galerie , set to re-open in october after a seven-year absence .
as director of a museum boasting work by renowned 20th-century german artists including otto dix , ernst ludwig kirchner and georg baselitz -lrb- photo -rrb- , one of merkert 's priorities is to anchor his gallery firmly within the community by offering children 's workshops and facilities for the disabled , for example .
" it 's all very well promoting art as an event , but it 's also important to strengthen the profile of museums and their collections , " he told dw-world .
" from a marketing point of view , it should n't be about individual works with ' post-card ' potential , " he said dismissively .
" no one needs ' post-card ' museums . "
as far as merkert is concerned , berlin seldom sees sensational public interest in an exhibition because the capital 's museums have to work with " negligible marketing and advertising budgets due to the catastrophic state of berlin 's finances . "
" moma had a marketing budget of € 1 million , " he pointed out .
" for our new gallery , we had just € 50,000 at our disposal , most of which we scraped together out of private funds . "
tine nehler , press-spokesperson at the pinakothek der moderne in munich , agreed .
" in terms of publicity and marketing , moma showed what could be possible , " she told dw-world .
but she also felt germany 's president missed the point when he called for the creation of a super museum .
" it would n't make sense to centralize the country 's art collections , " she said .
" there 's simply no need for it . "
not only is it superfluous , argued dr. henkel of the berlin national museums , such a proposal would be positively detrimental .
" sifting off the ' crown jewels ' would only weaken individual collections , " he said .
selling berlin short the problem is n't only financial .
" germany suffers from a major deficit when it comes to making museums attractive to visitors , " says jörn merkert .
" it 's a question of changing people 's consciousness , " he stressed .
" berlin completely fails to advertise its quality collections .
it has 165 museums and at least 40 of them are world-class , " he said .
" the gemäldegalerie , for example , owns the world 's largest collection of rembrandts . "
christina weiss , state secretary for media and culture , also said the city had enough high-profile collections .
" berlin already has ' super museums ' .
the 17 berlin national museums attracted 3.2 million visitors last year . "
and moma is by no means the only exhibition making headlines in the capital this year .
the hamburger bahnhof museum , redesigned in 1996 by architect josef paul kleihues and home to works by andy warhol , anselm kiefer and joseph beuys , is now set to host the highly controversial friedrich christian flick collection .
opening just two days after moma closes , the show has already generated reams of publicity .
day-to-day realities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guggenheim museum in bilbao , spain .
sensational as they are , the reverberations of moma ca n't be equated with the ' bilbao effect ' - the economic boom experienced in the spanish city after the frank gehry-designed guggenheim foundation opened in 1997 .
natascha kompatzki from berlin tourism marketing pointed out that the 11.33 million visitors to berlin last year made it the city 's record year for tourism , but she attributed the trend primarily to berlin 's newly-acquired status as a low-budget airlines destination .
" the number of visitors who came to berlin for moma were only the icing on the cake in what 's a more general development , " she told dw-world , and added the show was first and foremost a boost to berlin 's image .
according to jörn merkert , germany 's politicans are making a mistake in seeing moma 's success as a yardstick for future exhibitions .
" museums have to deal with day-to-day realities , " he said .
" they need to be more than spectacular fireworks that explode and then disappear .

the 9.2 percent they won was almost as much as the 9.8 percent of the social democratic party , the party of germany 's chancellor .
right wing candidate ignored on television " today is a fantastic day for all germans that still want to be bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holger apfel -lrb- in brown -rrb- , celebrates with npd functionaries germans , " the npd 's top candidate , holger apfel , said during a round of candidate interviews in german station zdf 's studios .
soon after his comment , the other candidates walked off the set and the reporter broke off apfel 's diatribe . political scientists say the miserable economic climate and the anger of young east germans that fuelled the npd 's sunday success could spark a worrying trend .
" if some sort of economic miracle doesn ’ t take place in the east , our society 's potential for supporting right wing politics could reach high levels , " said political scientist jürgen felter on the german talk show sabine christiansen , sunday night ..
he estimated the potential at 15 percent across germany . saxony state officials fear the presence of right- wing extremists in the state parliament will scare off the international investors that have made saxony one of the few economic bright spots in the east .
in recent years , the state has been able to profile itself as a center for bio-technology and microchip production while enjoying an increase in tourism . ahead of the elections , saxony 's premier , georg milbradt , said that should the npd make it into the parliament , he need n't bother going to america anymore to promote his state . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder 's social democrats suffer fresh losses german chancellor schröder 's social democrats lost major ground in elections on sunday in two former communist states as parties from the extreme right and far left posted electoral gains .

" iran will not accept any obligation regarding the suspension of uranium enrichment , " rohani said at a news conference on sunday .
" no international body can force iran to do so . "
over the weekend , the united nations ' nuclear watchdog , iaea , had unanimously adopted a joint us-european resolution giving iran two months to stop producing enriched uranium or face referral to the security council .
iran digs its heels in according to reuters news agency , the resolution agreed to by the iaea 's board of governors called on iran to freeze all activities related to uranium enrichment and to grant full and prompt access to the iaea 's inspectors , as well as provide them with any further information needed , by nov .
25 .
iran responded by saying that if the issue were referred to the security council for possible sanctions , it would respond by blocking snap checks of its atomic facilities .
hassan rohani , head of iran 's supreme national security council , added that were the case to go to the security council , iran would also consider withdrawing from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , which it signed in 2003 .
" if they want to send iran to the security council , it is not wise , and we will stop implementing the additional protocol , " he said .
the additional protocol to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty calls for snap nuclear checks by iaea inspectors .
a " peaceful " nuclear program tehran has said it wants to secure its own source of fuel for power stations so that it is not dependent on other countries and stresses that iran has a legal right to develop nuclear power .
rohani insisted that no institution had the authority to deprive a country of a peaceful nuclear energy program .
but experts also say that enrichment is an integral step in the production of atomic weapons , and washington has long harbored suspicions about the islamic country 's aims for developing its nuclear capacity .
the us believes that oil-rich iran , which the bush administration described as a member of the " axis of evil , " has no need for nuclear reactors , even for civilian programs .
criticism from eu the threatening posture from tehran marks a turn-around from last october , when the country agreed to more stringent inspections and signed the additional protocol .
at the time , iran also consented to the suspension of uranium enrichment activities .
in return , britain , france and germany , promised to help develop technology for a civil atomic energy plant .
but last week , the european union abandoned its policy of " constructive engagement , " after the bloc 's big three joined forces with the united states and decided to issue a deadline for tehran to comply with international demands dispel concerns about nuclear activities .
" the eu calls on iran to heed the content of the resolution adopted by iaea 's board of governors , in particular with regard to the necessity to suspend fully all its enrichment related activities , " the head of the dutch delegation told a meeting of members of the iaea on behalf of the eu .
tehran insists it abided by the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and allowed spot inspections proving the intention behind its nuclear program was civilian in nature .
officials in tehran also point out that the suspension of enrichment was not a legal requirement but a voluntary measure .
in november , the iaea board of governors will meet to review iran 's alleged nuclear weapons program .
the country has until then to answer all outstanding questions . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us , eu agree to resolution on iran on thursday , the us and key eu allies agreed on a draft resolution calling on iran to end its nuclear program .
by allowing some tough wording , the eu is backing away from its previous policy of constructive engagement .

17 , 2004 -rrb- iran said to be close to nuclear deal ahead of a meeting of the un 's nuclear watchdog next week , diplomats said iran has agreed in principle to freeze some of its nuclear activities .
the eu has been calling on tehran to cooperate more closely with the un .

but it ticks , in its own way .
in fact , it marks time with a more subtle system than the best rolex , because it adjusts your body to your environment : for example , to the amount of light outside .
unlike any mechanical clock , your biological clock automatically gives you energy when you should wake up , and takes energy away at bedtime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biologische uhr - struktur copyright max-planck institut " inside " your clock there are two genes , named per and tim .
-lrb- the clock itself is located – where else ? – in your brain ; professor doyle will tell you exactly where , when you hear the audio below in a minute . -rrb-
per and tim co-operate with two proteins , in a loop like in the picture to the left - click on the magnifying glass to blow it up .
when the sun comes out in the day , per and tim sense that sunlight .
they set the proteins free , and as they work together with cells and organs , this gives you the natural high you need .
but when you take a plane from stuttgart to santa barbara – well , per and tim get confused .
that ’ s jetlag .
but what ’ s amazing about per and tim is , they can adjust to jetlag .
sooner or later , you get over it .
even though thousands of years ago , when nature made the biological clock , lufthansa didn ’ t exist .
how do they do it ?
the trick is , per and tim are a well-coordinated pair .
for a long time , scientists didn ’ t understand why there were two genes – per and tim .
why wasn ’ t it just per , or just tim , alone setting the alarm ?
your biological clock seemed unnecessarily complex .
but that complexity , it turns out , may help you deal with jetlag .
researchers at the max-planck institute in magdeburg , germany , have now used computer models and fruit flies to explain the circadian rhythm genetic circuit .
click the audio and dr. joerg stelling , and dr. frank doyle , whom the humboldt foundation helped to join in the research in germany , will give you a look at the gears of your biological clock . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german science weekly highlight - 3 what you can see that a chicken ca n't german science weekly highlight - 2 shedding light on the smallest of things german science weekly highlight - 1 the secret history of barley erik campano www-links max-planck society for the advancement of science for more on this and other research , visit the english homepage of the max-planck society 9799 dw-tv europe live politik direkt we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

" iran will not accept any obligation regarding the suspension of uranium enrichment , " rohani said at a news conference on sunday .
" no international body can force iran to do so . "
over the weekend , the united nations ' nuclear watchdog , iaea , had unanimously adopted a joint us-european resolution giving iran two months to stop producing enriched uranium or face referral to the security council .
iran digs its heels in according to reuters news agency , the resolution agreed to by the iaea 's board of governors called on iran to freeze all activities related to uranium enrichment and to grant full and prompt access to the iaea 's inspectors , as well as provide them with any further information needed , by nov .

iran responded by saying that if the issue were referred to the security council for possible sanctions , it would respond by blocking snap checks of its atomic facilities .
hassan rohani , head of iran 's supreme national security council , added that were the case to go to the security council , iran would also consider withdrawing from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , which it signed in 2003 .
" if they want to send iran to the security council , it is not wise , and we will stop implementing the additional protocol , " he said .
the additional protocol to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty calls for snap nuclear checks by iaea inspectors .
a " peaceful " nuclear program tehran has said it wants to secure its own source of fuel for power stations so that it is not dependent on other countries and stresses that iran has a legal right to develop nuclear power .

criticism from eu the threatening posture from tehran marks a turn-around from last october , when the country agreed to more stringent inspections and signed the additional protocol .
at the time , iran also consented to the suspension of uranium enrichment activities .
in return , britain , france and germany , promised to help develop technology for a civil atomic energy plant .
but last week , the european union abandoned its policy of " constructive engagement , " after the bloc 's big three joined forces with the united states and decided to issue a deadline for tehran to comply with international demands dispel concerns about nuclear activities .
" the eu calls on iran to heed the content of the resolution adopted by iaea 's board of governors , in particular with regard to the necessity to suspend fully all its enrichment related activities , " the head of the dutch delegation told a meeting of members of the iaea on behalf of the eu .
tehran insists it abided by the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and allowed spot inspections proving the intention behind its nuclear program was civilian in nature .

" iran will not accept any obligation regarding the suspension of uranium enrichment , " rohani said at a news conference on sunday .
" no international body can force iran to do so . "
over the weekend , the united nations ' nuclear watchdog , iaea , had unanimously adopted a joint us-european resolution giving iran two months to stop producing enriched uranium or face referral to the security council .
iran digs its heels in according to reuters news agency , the resolution agreed to by the iaea 's board of governors called on iran to freeze all activities related to uranium enrichment and to grant full and prompt access to the iaea 's inspectors , as well as provide them with any further information needed , by nov .
25 .
iran responded by saying that if the issue were referred to the security council for possible sanctions , it would respond by blocking snap checks of its atomic facilities .
hassan rohani , head of iran 's supreme national security council , added that were the case to go to the security council , iran would also consider withdrawing from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , which it signed in 2003 .
" if they want to send iran to the security council , it is not wise , and we will stop implementing the additional protocol , " he said .
the additional protocol to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty calls for snap nuclear checks by iaea inspectors .
a " peaceful " nuclear program tehran has said it wants to secure its own source of fuel for power stations so that it is not dependent on other countries and stresses that iran has a legal right to develop nuclear power .
rohani insisted that no institution had the authority to deprive a country of a peaceful nuclear energy program .
but experts also say that enrichment is an integral step in the production of atomic weapons , and washington has long harbored suspicions about the islamic country 's aims for developing its nuclear capacity .
the us believes that oil-rich iran , which the bush administration described as a member of the " axis of evil , " has no need for nuclear reactors , even for civilian programs .
criticism from eu the threatening posture from tehran marks a turn-around from last october , when the country agreed to more stringent inspections and signed the additional protocol .
at the time , iran also consented to the suspension of uranium enrichment activities .
in return , britain , france and germany , promised to help develop technology for a civil atomic energy plant .
but last week , the european union abandoned its policy of " constructive engagement , " after the bloc 's big three joined forces with the united states and decided to issue a deadline for tehran to comply with international demands dispel concerns about nuclear activities .
" the eu calls on iran to heed the content of the resolution adopted by iaea 's board of governors , in particular with regard to the necessity to suspend fully all its enrichment related activities , " the head of the dutch delegation told a meeting of members of the iaea on behalf of the eu .
tehran insists it abided by the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and allowed spot inspections proving the intention behind its nuclear program was civilian in nature .
officials in tehran also point out that the suspension of enrichment was not a legal requirement but a voluntary measure .
in november , the iaea board of governors will meet to review iran 's alleged nuclear weapons program .
the country has until then to answer all outstanding questions . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us , eu agree to resolution on iran on thursday , the us and key eu allies agreed on a draft resolution calling on iran to end its nuclear program .
by allowing some tough wording , the eu is backing away from its previous policy of constructive engagement .

the chief defendant , a 51-year-old bar owner identified as christa w. , was accused of charging her clients the equivalent of € 10 -lrb- $ 12 -rrb- each to sexually assault the child , whose body has never been found . she was also alleged to have filmed and photographed the acts .
prosecution lawyers told the court that the boy , known as pascal , was thought to have been lured into the bar on sept .
30 , 2001 and to have died the same day .
but investigators who searched a quarry near the french village of forbach , about 10 kilometers -lrb- six miles -rrb- away from the german border , failed to find his corpse and said they were unsure exactly how and when he died .
court sources said that some of the defendants had admitted to raping or killing pascal several months ago .
four men and a second woman were charged as principals and seven as accomplices .
all the defendants were in their 40s or 50s .
court sources said that seven of them had previously been charged with sex offences against two other children .
in october last year , a 49-year man , described as mentally retarded and an alcoholic , was jailed for seven years and ordered to be detained in a psychiatric hospital after being convicted of sexually assaulting pascal .

in a city reeling from sweeping cuts to the arts , moma 's overwhelming success marks a new twist in berlin 's ongoing culture wars . as the museum of modern art exhibition drew to a close this weekend , berlin was left wondering exactly what to make of the media circus that 's been rocking the city over the last seven months .
" moma helped art reach a wider public , " dr. matthias henkel from the berlin national museums told dw-world .
but that 's almost an under-statement .
one survey showed that 15 percent of the visitors , who endured waits of up to ten hours outside the neue nationalgalerie , had never even been to a museum before .
much to the indignation of the city 's art establishment , the success of the temporary exhibit of works from the new york-based moma prompted german president horst köhler to call for a " super museum " showcasing the best of berlin 's existing collections .
taking stock bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the last days of the exhibit , visitors often waited up to 10 hours to get a ticket .
it 's hardly surprising that cash-strapped berlin is keen to capitalize on the moma phenomenon .
in a city of 3.4 million , the visiting exhibition attracted over one million visitors , some 750,000 of whom came from out of town .
with such impressive figures , people have realized there are cultural and economic lessons to be learned .
klaus wowereit , berlin 's media-savvy mayor , welcomed the president 's idea and suggested the city 's museums pool their respective pièces de resistance in a temporary exhibition with moma-style pulling-power .
" it 's a charming proposal and i 'm sure a berlin exhibition would complement the moma exhibition very well , " he said .
" when you 've understood how to turn art into an event you can reach a vast public , and moreover , you 've whetted the public 's appetite for -lrb- the city 's -rrb- many museums and galleries . "
professor peter raue , president of the friends of the nationalgalerie , confirmed this .
" all of berlin 's museums recorded an increase in visitor numbers by 100 percent , " he told dw-world .
the superficial sheen of ' postcard ' museums but not everyone was enamored with the moma-effect .
the show might have been embraced by the public and the politicians , but the art establishment has been largely hostile - and not just because of a perceived us imperialism on the part of the curators .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georg baselitz " art that 's easy to consume can be counter-productive , " insisted jörn merkert from the berlinische galerie , set to re-open in october after a seven-year absence .
as director of a museum boasting work by renowned 20th-century german artists including otto dix , ernst ludwig kirchner and georg baselitz -lrb- photo -rrb- , one of merkert 's priorities is to anchor his gallery firmly within the community by offering children 's workshops and facilities for the disabled , for example .
" it 's all very well promoting art as an event , but it 's also important to strengthen the profile of museums and their collections , " he told dw-world .
" from a marketing point of view , it should n't be about individual works with ' post-card ' potential , " he said dismissively .
" no one needs ' post-card ' museums . "
as far as merkert is concerned , berlin seldom sees sensational public interest in an exhibition because the capital 's museums have to work with " negligible marketing and advertising budgets due to the catastrophic state of berlin 's finances . "
" moma had a marketing budget of € 1 million , " he pointed out .
" for our new gallery , we had just € 50,000 at our disposal , most of which we scraped together out of private funds . "
tine nehler , press-spokesperson at the pinakothek der moderne in munich , agreed .
" in terms of publicity and marketing , moma showed what could be possible , " she told dw-world .
but she also felt germany 's president missed the point when he called for the creation of a super museum .
" it would n't make sense to centralize the country 's art collections , " she said .
" there 's simply no need for it . "
not only is it superfluous , argued dr. henkel of the berlin national museums , such a proposal would be positively detrimental .
" sifting off the ' crown jewels ' would only weaken individual collections , " he said .
selling berlin short the problem is n't only financial .
" germany suffers from a major deficit when it comes to making museums attractive to visitors , " says jörn merkert .
" it 's a question of changing people 's consciousness , " he stressed .
" berlin completely fails to advertise its quality collections .
it has 165 museums and at least 40 of them are world-class , " he said .
" the gemäldegalerie , for example , owns the world 's largest collection of rembrandts . "
christina weiss , state secretary for media and culture , also said the city had enough high-profile collections .
" berlin already has ' super museums ' .
the 17 berlin national museums attracted 3.2 million visitors last year . "
and moma is by no means the only exhibition making headlines in the capital this year .
the hamburger bahnhof museum , redesigned in 1996 by architect josef paul kleihues and home to works by andy warhol , anselm kiefer and joseph beuys , is now set to host the highly controversial friedrich christian flick collection .
opening just two days after moma closes , the show has already generated reams of publicity .
day-to-day realities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guggenheim museum in bilbao , spain .
sensational as they are , the reverberations of moma ca n't be equated with the ' bilbao effect ' - the economic boom experienced in the spanish city after the frank gehry-designed guggenheim foundation opened in 1997 .
natascha kompatzki from berlin tourism marketing pointed out that the 11.33 million visitors to berlin last year made it the city 's record year for tourism , but she attributed the trend primarily to berlin 's newly-acquired status as a low-budget airlines destination .
" the number of visitors who came to berlin for moma were only the icing on the cake in what 's a more general development , " she told dw-world , and added the show was first and foremost a boost to berlin 's image .
according to jörn merkert , germany 's politicans are making a mistake in seeing moma 's success as a yardstick for future exhibitions .

" it 's a charming proposal and i 'm sure a berlin exhibition would complement the moma exhibition very well , " he said .
" when you 've understood how to turn art into an event you can reach a vast public , and moreover , you 've whetted the public 's appetite for -lrb- the city 's -rrb- many museums and galleries . "
professor peter raue , president of the friends of the nationalgalerie , confirmed this .
" all of berlin 's museums recorded an increase in visitor numbers by 100 percent , " he told dw-world .
the superficial sheen of ' postcard ' museums but not everyone was enamored with the moma-effect .
the show might have been embraced by the public and the politicians , but the art establishment has been largely hostile - and not just because of a perceived us imperialism on the part of the curators .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georg baselitz " art that 's easy to consume can be counter-productive , " insisted jörn merkert from the berlinische galerie , set to re-open in october after a seven-year absence .
as director of a museum boasting work by renowned 20th-century german artists including otto dix , ernst ludwig kirchner and georg baselitz -lrb- photo -rrb- , one of merkert 's priorities is to anchor his gallery firmly within the community by offering children 's workshops and facilities for the disabled , for example .
" it 's all very well promoting art as an event , but it 's also important to strengthen the profile of museums and their collections , " he told dw-world .
" from a marketing point of view , it should n't be about individual works with ' post-card ' potential , " he said dismissively .
" no one needs ' post-card ' museums . "
as far as merkert is concerned , berlin seldom sees sensational public interest in an exhibition because the capital 's museums have to work with " negligible marketing and advertising budgets due to the catastrophic state of berlin 's finances . "
" moma had a marketing budget of € 1 million , " he pointed out .
" for our new gallery , we had just € 50,000 at our disposal , most of which we scraped together out of private funds . "
tine nehler , press-spokesperson at the pinakothek der moderne in munich , agreed .
" in terms of publicity and marketing , moma showed what could be possible , " she told dw-world .
but she also felt germany 's president missed the point when he called for the creation of a super museum .
" it would n't make sense to centralize the country 's art collections , " she said .
" there 's simply no need for it . "
not only is it superfluous , argued dr. henkel of the berlin national museums , such a proposal would be positively detrimental .
" sifting off the ' crown jewels ' would only weaken individual collections , " he said .
selling berlin short the problem is n't only financial .
" germany suffers from a major deficit when it comes to making museums attractive to visitors , " says jörn merkert .
" it 's a question of changing people 's consciousness , " he stressed .
" berlin completely fails to advertise its quality collections .
it has 165 museums and at least 40 of them are world-class , " he said .
" the gemäldegalerie , for example , owns the world 's largest collection of rembrandts . "
christina weiss , state secretary for media and culture , also said the city had enough high-profile collections .
" berlin already has ' super museums ' .
the 17 berlin national museums attracted 3.2 million visitors last year . "
and moma is by no means the only exhibition making headlines in the capital this year .
the hamburger bahnhof museum , redesigned in 1996 by architect josef paul kleihues and home to works by andy warhol , anselm kiefer and joseph beuys , is now set to host the highly controversial friedrich christian flick collection .
opening just two days after moma closes , the show has already generated reams of publicity .
day-to-day realities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guggenheim museum in bilbao , spain .
sensational as they are , the reverberations of moma ca n't be equated with the ' bilbao effect ' - the economic boom experienced in the spanish city after the frank gehry-designed guggenheim foundation opened in 1997 .
natascha kompatzki from berlin tourism marketing pointed out that the 11.33 million visitors to berlin last year made it the city 's record year for tourism , but she attributed the trend primarily to berlin 's newly-acquired status as a low-budget airlines destination .
" the number of visitors who came to berlin for moma were only the icing on the cake in what 's a more general development , " she told dw-world , and added the show was first and foremost a boost to berlin 's image .
according to jörn merkert , germany 's politicans are making a mistake in seeing moma 's success as a yardstick for future exhibitions .

in a city reeling from sweeping cuts to the arts , moma 's overwhelming success marks a new twist in berlin 's ongoing culture wars . as the museum of modern art exhibition drew to a close this weekend , berlin was left wondering exactly what to make of the media circus that 's been rocking the city over the last seven months .
" moma helped art reach a wider public , " dr. matthias henkel from the berlin national museums told dw-world .
but that 's almost an under-statement .
one survey showed that 15 percent of the visitors , who endured waits of up to ten hours outside the neue nationalgalerie , had never even been to a museum before .
much to the indignation of the city 's art establishment , the success of the temporary exhibit of works from the new york-based moma prompted german president horst köhler to call for a " super museum " showcasing the best of berlin 's existing collections .
taking stock bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the last days of the exhibit , visitors often waited up to 10 hours to get a ticket .
it 's hardly surprising that cash-strapped berlin is keen to capitalize on the moma phenomenon .
in a city of 3.4 million , the visiting exhibition attracted over one million visitors , some 750,000 of whom came from out of town .
with such impressive figures , people have realized there are cultural and economic lessons to be learned .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georg baselitz " art that 's easy to consume can be counter-productive , " insisted jörn merkert from the berlinische galerie , set to re-open in october after a seven-year absence .
as director of a museum boasting work by renowned 20th-century german artists including otto dix , ernst ludwig kirchner and georg baselitz -lrb- photo -rrb- , one of merkert 's priorities is to anchor his gallery firmly within the community by offering children 's workshops and facilities for the disabled , for example .
" it 's all very well promoting art as an event , but it 's also important to strengthen the profile of museums and their collections , " he told dw-world .
" from a marketing point of view , it should n't be about individual works with ' post-card ' potential , " he said dismissively .
" no one needs ' post-card ' museums . "
as far as merkert is concerned , berlin seldom sees sensational public interest in an exhibition because the capital 's museums have to work with " negligible marketing and advertising budgets due to the catastrophic state of berlin 's finances . "
" moma had a marketing budget of € 1 million , " he pointed out .
" for our new gallery , we had just € 50,000 at our disposal , most of which we scraped together out of private funds . "
tine nehler , press-spokesperson at the pinakothek der moderne in munich , agreed .
" in terms of publicity and marketing , moma showed what could be possible , " she told dw-world .
but she also felt germany 's president missed the point when he called for the creation of a super museum .
" it would n't make sense to centralize the country 's art collections , " she said .
" there 's simply no need for it . "
not only is it superfluous , argued dr. henkel of the berlin national museums , such a proposal would be positively detrimental .
" sifting off the ' crown jewels ' would only weaken individual collections , " he said .
selling berlin short the problem is n't only financial .
" germany suffers from a major deficit when it comes to making museums attractive to visitors , " says jörn merkert .
" it 's a question of changing people 's consciousness , " he stressed .
" berlin completely fails to advertise its quality collections .
it has 165 museums and at least 40 of them are world-class , " he said .
" the gemäldegalerie , for example , owns the world 's largest collection of rembrandts . "
christina weiss , state secretary for media and culture , also said the city had enough high-profile collections .
" berlin already has ' super museums ' .
the 17 berlin national museums attracted 3.2 million visitors last year . "
and moma is by no means the only exhibition making headlines in the capital this year .
the hamburger bahnhof museum , redesigned in 1996 by architect josef paul kleihues and home to works by andy warhol , anselm kiefer and joseph beuys , is now set to host the highly controversial friedrich christian flick collection .
opening just two days after moma closes , the show has already generated reams of publicity .
day-to-day realities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guggenheim museum in bilbao , spain .
sensational as they are , the reverberations of moma ca n't be equated with the ' bilbao effect ' - the economic boom experienced in the spanish city after the frank gehry-designed guggenheim foundation opened in 1997 .
natascha kompatzki from berlin tourism marketing pointed out that the 11.33 million visitors to berlin last year made it the city 's record year for tourism , but she attributed the trend primarily to berlin 's newly-acquired status as a low-budget airlines destination .
" the number of visitors who came to berlin for moma were only the icing on the cake in what 's a more general development , " she told dw-world , and added the show was first and foremost a boost to berlin 's image .
according to jörn merkert , germany 's politicans are making a mistake in seeing moma 's success as a yardstick for future exhibitions .
" museums have to deal with day-to-day realities , " he said .
" they need to be more than spectacular fireworks that explode and then disappear . " jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de moma berlin exhibition slammed unhappy with the long entrance lines , art fans are directing criticism at the organizers of berlin 's moma exhibition .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.09.2004 gains by extremist parties trouble germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cries of " nazis out ! " greeted the right-wing npd success in saxony germany woke up to fears that the political tremors sparked by state elections in saxony and brandenburg on sunday could lead to deeper division within their country and scare off investors . observers say the success of the party of democratic socialism , the successor to east germany 's communist party , and the extreme right national party of germany -lrb- npd -rrb- and german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- in sunday 's elections show how angry east germans are at the reality they face 14 years after reunification . the pds rode a wave of discontent over chancellor gerhard schröder 's tough social reforms to 28 percent of the vote , making them second-strongest party in brandenburg , behind schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- . the governing spd and conservative christian democratic union " got a serious slap in the face , " said lothar bisky , the brandenburg parliamentary head for the pds , a party that most analysts left for dead after their failure in the last federal election . left-wingers " divide " the country , says schily though the party will most likely be excluded from a coalition government - the spd is more likely to pick the conservative christian democratic union - their success has nevertheless sent the government in berlin a message , and one they do n't like to hear .
by making themselves , as a regional party , the " mouthpiece of a part of germany " they are deepening the divide between east and west , interior minister otto schily said of the party , which has only found success so far in the east . the same goes for the npd , which schily tried and failed to ban two years ago .
based on their sunday success , the right wing party can claim 12 seats in saxony 's parliament .
the 9.2 percent they won was almost as much as the 9.8 percent of the social democratic party , the party of germany 's chancellor .
right wing candidate ignored on television " today is a fantastic day for all germans that still want to be bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holger apfel -lrb- in brown -rrb- , celebrates with npd functionaries germans , " the npd 's top candidate , holger apfel , said during a round of candidate interviews in german station zdf 's studios .
soon after his comment , the other candidates walked off the set and the reporter broke off apfel 's diatribe . political scientists say the miserable economic climate and the anger of young east germans that fuelled the npd 's sunday success could spark a worrying trend .
" if some sort of economic miracle doesn ’ t take place in the east , our society 's potential for supporting right wing politics could reach high levels , " said political scientist jürgen felter on the german talk show sabine christiansen , sunday night ..
he estimated the potential at 15 percent across germany . saxony state officials fear the presence of right- wing extremists in the state parliament will scare off the international investors that have made saxony one of the few economic bright spots in the east .
in recent years , the state has been able to profile itself as a center for bio-technology and microchip production while enjoying an increase in tourism . ahead of the elections , saxony 's premier , georg milbradt , said that should the npd make it into the parliament , he need n't bother going to america anymore to promote his state . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder 's social democrats suffer fresh losses german chancellor schröder 's social democrats lost major ground in elections on sunday in two former communist states as parties from the extreme right and far left posted electoral gains .

the decision ends a two-year effort by the airlines to fight off low-cost carriers by combining forces .
both countries ' competition watchdogs had rejected the deal , arguing that the reduction in consumer choice had outweighed the benefits .
although the parties have 20 days to appeal , qantas said it now wanted to " move on " .
the decision " ignores major structural changes " in the industry worldwide , said the australian airline 's chief executive , geoff dixon .
" today 's decision ... contrasts with the marked trend toward consolidation . "
it is disappointing that air nz and qantas were not allowed to introduce some rationality into a market that has been anything but rational air new zealand klm and air france had been allowed to merge , he pointed out , while british airways had sold its 18 % stake in his company earlier in september so as to ease its participation in europe 's " inevitable consolidation " .
the deal would have given qantas a 22.5 % stake in air nz in exchange for nz $ 550m -lrb- us $ 363m ; £ 202m -rrb- , and led to co-operation on routes between the countries and within new zealand .
threat both air nz and qantas have experienced the same pressure from budget carriers as their peers elsewhere in the world .
virgin blue and emirates air , among others , are flying many australasian routes .
qantas has launched two low-cost carriers of its own to help it hang onto its market .
for air nz , the final collapse of the proposed deal threatened its long-term survival , the airline said .
" it is disappointing ... that the court has not allowed air nz and qantas to take this opportunity to introduce some rationality into a market that in recent years has been anything but rational , " it said in a statement .
' detriments ' but the commerce commission in new zealand had disagreed , finding negative effects of between nz $ 195m and nz $ 466m .
the court concurred .
" the appellants have not shown the commission to have erred in concluding that the likely public benefits of the proposed alliance would not outweigh the likely efficiency detriments , " it said .

the eye of the storm passed within 30 miles -lrb- 48km -rrb- of grand cayman - one of three islands of the british dependency - leaving it devastated .
a british expatriate living on grand cayman told bbc news online how both islanders and expats are beginning to rebuild their lives after the hurricane .
samuel howard works in the wine industry and lives in west bay , grand cayman .
the island has reacted with outrageous spirit .
i hear rumours of looting - i can absolutely , categorically say i have n't seen any signs of it , there are no armed men with machetes running around as people have said .
there is a curfew , but i feel incredibly safe .
we have gone back to the old bargain system .
we are the fifth largest financial centre in the world , but money is absolutely useless .
petrol and water are far more in demand so everyone helps with vehicles .
when their car dies they are given the batteries to start the motor .
water queues there has been one reported death and one very serious injury - a firefighter .
looking at the devastation , if we got away with just two deaths i would be absolutely amazed .
my colleagues are still here .
south african airways chartered a plane of south african citizens out of the island - air canada and air jamaica did so too , and even air colombia .
british airways put the prices up by about fourfold on flights going out of the island .
i phoned the foreign office to find out what was going on and they said they had no intention of evacuating citizens .
buildings were destroyed and power cabled ripped down they sent hms richmond over , which is here in the ocean , and apparently the navy are helping with the patrolling on the streets .
they are not allowed to carry weapons on cayman soil but we do n't really need that anyway .
they are just helping with water queues and things .
seven mile beach is on the other side of the road from here .
every single power cable along the beach is down , so the national grid needs to be rebuilt .
they reckon it will take three to six months to get most of the island sorted , six to eight to be fully up and running .
regarding the water , two-thirds of the island runs off reservoirs , and one-third is a desalination plant .
the reservoirs are completely shut , there 's seawater in them and sewage and everything else .
the desalination plant means that yesterday and today we 've had 20 minutes of water .
they do n't announce it - it 's a nice way of rationing it , so you just wait for your toilets to fill up .
but it 's not in short supply because they have many tankers and stuff .
and bottled water is readily available and i do n't think they are charging for it .
panic before the hurricane people were very calm .
caymanians did n't panic in supermarkets - i 've seen more chaos on boxing day in england and when we have half an inch of snow than what i 've seen here .
there has been no price hikes - nobody charges you eight dollars for a bag of ice .
the only thing we were let down on was the meteorologists .
they must know what a category five hurricane is like , but nobody told us it was going to destroy all the buildings .
if they had said that , people would have been more prepared .
they were expecting strong wind and power off for a day or two , but they were n't prepared for this .
i suppose the authorities did n't want to cause panic before the event .

the eye of the storm passed within 30 miles -lrb- 48km -rrb- of grand cayman - one of three islands of the british dependency - leaving it devastated .
a british expatriate living on grand cayman told bbc news online how both islanders and expats are beginning to rebuild their lives after the hurricane .
samuel howard works in the wine industry and lives in west bay , grand cayman .
the island has reacted with outrageous spirit .
i hear rumours of looting - i can absolutely , categorically say i have n't seen any signs of it , there are no armed men with machetes running around as people have said .
there is a curfew , but i feel incredibly safe .
we have gone back to the old bargain system .
we are the fifth largest financial centre in the world , but money is absolutely useless .
petrol and water are far more in demand so everyone helps with vehicles .
when their car dies they are given the batteries to start the motor .
water queues there has been one reported death and one very serious injury - a firefighter .
looking at the devastation , if we got away with just two deaths i would be absolutely amazed .
my colleagues are still here .
south african airways chartered a plane of south african citizens out of the island - air canada and air jamaica did so too , and even air colombia .
british airways put the prices up by about fourfold on flights going out of the island .
i phoned the foreign office to find out what was going on and they said they had no intention of evacuating citizens .
buildings were destroyed and power cabled ripped down they sent hms richmond over , which is here in the ocean , and apparently the navy are helping with the patrolling on the streets .
they are not allowed to carry weapons on cayman soil but we do n't really need that anyway .
they are just helping with water queues and things .
seven mile beach is on the other side of the road from here .
every single power cable along the beach is down , so the national grid needs to be rebuilt .
they reckon it will take three to six months to get most of the island sorted , six to eight to be fully up and running .
regarding the water , two-thirds of the island runs off reservoirs , and one-third is a desalination plant .
the reservoirs are completely shut , there 's seawater in them and sewage and everything else .
the desalination plant means that yesterday and today we 've had 20 minutes of water .
they do n't announce it - it 's a nice way of rationing it , so you just wait for your toilets to fill up .
but it 's not in short supply because they have many tankers and stuff .
and bottled water is readily available and i do n't think they are charging for it .
panic before the hurricane people were very calm .
caymanians did n't panic in supermarkets - i 've seen more chaos on boxing day in england and when we have half an inch of snow than what i 've seen here .
there has been no price hikes - nobody charges you eight dollars for a bag of ice .
the only thing we were let down on was the meteorologists .
they must know what a category five hurricane is like , but nobody told us it was going to destroy all the buildings .
if they had said that , people would have been more prepared .

the eye of the storm passed within 30 miles -lrb- 48km -rrb- of grand cayman - one of three islands of the british dependency - leaving it devastated .
a british expatriate living on grand cayman told bbc news online how both islanders and expats are beginning to rebuild their lives after the hurricane .
samuel howard works in the wine industry and lives in west bay , grand cayman .
the island has reacted with outrageous spirit .
i hear rumours of looting - i can absolutely , categorically say i have n't seen any signs of it , there are no armed men with machetes running around as people have said .
there is a curfew , but i feel incredibly safe .
we have gone back to the old bargain system .
we are the fifth largest financial centre in the world , but money is absolutely useless .
petrol and water are far more in demand so everyone helps with vehicles .
when their car dies they are given the batteries to start the motor .
water queues there has been one reported death and one very serious injury - a firefighter .
looking at the devastation , if we got away with just two deaths i would be absolutely amazed .
my colleagues are still here .
south african airways chartered a plane of south african citizens out of the island - air canada and air jamaica did so too , and even air colombia .
british airways put the prices up by about fourfold on flights going out of the island .
i phoned the foreign office to find out what was going on and they said they had no intention of evacuating citizens .
buildings were destroyed and power cabled ripped down they sent hms richmond over , which is here in the ocean , and apparently the navy are helping with the patrolling on the streets .
they are not allowed to carry weapons on cayman soil but we do n't really need that anyway .
they are just helping with water queues and things .
seven mile beach is on the other side of the road from here .
every single power cable along the beach is down , so the national grid needs to be rebuilt .
they reckon it will take three to six months to get most of the island sorted , six to eight to be fully up and running .
regarding the water , two-thirds of the island runs off reservoirs , and one-third is a desalination plant .
the reservoirs are completely shut , there 's seawater in them and sewage and everything else .
the desalination plant means that yesterday and today we 've had 20 minutes of water .
they do n't announce it - it 's a nice way of rationing it , so you just wait for your toilets to fill up .
but it 's not in short supply because they have many tankers and stuff .
and bottled water is readily available and i do n't think they are charging for it .
panic before the hurricane people were very calm .
caymanians did n't panic in supermarkets - i 've seen more chaos on boxing day in england and when we have half an inch of snow than what i 've seen here .
there has been no price hikes - nobody charges you eight dollars for a bag of ice .
the only thing we were let down on was the meteorologists .
they must know what a category five hurricane is like , but nobody told us it was going to destroy all the buildings .
if they had said that , people would have been more prepared .
they were expecting strong wind and power off for a day or two , but they were n't prepared for this .
i suppose the authorities did n't want to cause panic before the event .

the firm said memory chips were in for a slowdown , with prices for flash memory set to fall as much as 40 % in the three months to september .
the news echoes previous gyrations in the chip market , which often swings from glut to dearth and back .
samsung 's warning came as it announced that it expected an increase in sales in the third quarter .
samsung electronics semiconductor business 's president , hwang chang-gyu , told reporters that sales would probably exceed the $ 3.2bn -lrb- £ 1.8bn -rrb- seen in the three months to june .
overall , he said , chip sales growth would slow to 10 % a year in 2005 from 20 % this year .
but the memory chip market , particularly for the flash memory chips vital in small devices such as mobile phones , was set to slump to 5 % growth from 60 % in 2004 .
hynix troubles meanwhile , samsung competitor hynix is being investigated for alleged accounting fraud and could face a fine , it was revealed .
hynix , which is the fourth-largest memory chipmaker in the world , was accused by korea 's financial supervisory service of whether it mis-stated its accounts to the tune of almost 2 trillion won -lrb- $ 1.7bn ; £ 970m -rrb- in 1999 .
since then the firm - which is 81 % owned by its creditors thanks to huge debts , and made a 625bn won profit in the three months to june - has cleaned up its books , the fss said .
" we are investigating how much hynix secured loans using false accounting , and whether it supported its affiliates unfairly or embezzled corporate money , " a prosecutor told reporters .
hynix said it had corrected all the " controversial " items , and blamed its former management for the situation .

the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- - which the government has tried to ban - surged to 9 % in saxony , well above the 5 % needed to enter parliament there .
in neighbouring brandenburg , the german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- polled about 6 % .
the results reflect anger at welfare cuts and disillusionment with persistently low living standards , says the bbc 's ray furlong in berlin .
the ex-communists of the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- also did well in brandenburg , but the mainstream parties still won in both states holding votes .
voters in eastern germany appear to have expressed their concern at the high unemployment they blame on chancellor gerhard schroeder 's social democrats .
it 's a great day for germans who still want to be germans holger apfel npd leader in saxony analysis : eastern discontent extremist vote worries press our correspondent says the results are being seen widely as a no-confidence vote in mr schroeder , who brought in the welfare cuts with the blessing of the conservative christian democrats .
fifteen years after reunification , east germans still receive lower wages , benefits , and pensions than compatriots in the west of the country , and almost one in five is out of work .
breakthrough in dresden , the capital of saxony , police clashed with demonstrators protesting against the far-right success .
the npd 's 9 % in saxony means that the party has gained seats in a german state assembly for the first time since 1968 .
mr schroeder 's economic reforms have angered some voters " it 's a great day for germans who still want to be germans , " said holger apfel , the npd 's leading candidate in saxony .
despite having their majority eroded , germany 's two mainstream parties remained ahead in both states , the early results suggested .
the ruling social democrats scored around 32 % in brandenburg , while the conservative christian democrats won 41 % of the total vote in saxony , the results showed .
average unemployment in east germany has been stuck at about 20 % - nearly twice the national average .
some six million people were eligible to vote in sunday 's elections in saxony and brandenburg .
germany 's government has described the npd as a latter-day version of hitler 's nazi party and tried to ban it last year - a move rejected by the constitutional court .
the pds scored their best election result ever , with 28 % in brandenburg .
however , they are unlikely to form a government in the state , which is ruled by a coalition of the christian democrats and social democrats .

north of workington , wind turbines stride for miles along the unlovely stretch of industrialised coastline , looming over shops and houses .
" i hated the sight of them at first , " says a resident of senhouse street in siddick , where the turbine blades seem to graze the rooftops .
" but then i got used to them , and now i hardly notice them at all . "
countryside alliance the british wind energy association -lrb- bwea -rrb- reckons this sort of phlegmatic attitude is widespread .
in a survey released this week , it suggests that 70 % of the population would welcome a wind farm in their area .
but the industry 's apparent confidence is only skin-deep ; the bwea is girding up for a publicity campaign to counter a well-organised and growing protest movement , comprising an unlikely coalition of ecologists , economists , rural conservatives and worried homeowners .
the anti-wind farm campaign is capable of generating great heat at the local level .
ric outhwaite , head of planning at allerdale borough council , which includes workington , says he has already received more than 1,000 letters of protest to each of the two applications he is currently considering .
lapwings in a flutter the antis oppose wind farms on a raft of counts .
environmentalists worry about the effect on wildlife , in particular on the bird population .
" we 're just starting to see the return of rare species - the lapwing , the skylark , bats and hares , " says avril hemsley-rose , who is campaigning against a proposed wind farm at bolton low houses , 20 miles inland from workington .
" how can any kind of industrial development be good for them ? "
rural dwellers worry about noise - turbines emit a low but persistent thrumming - and the effect on tourism .
the bolton low houses proposal , for three 75-metre turbines , promises to dominate the view from catlands hill , a local beauty-spot .
while a landowner receives generous payment for playing host to a windfarm , usually £ 8,000-10,000 per turbine per year , neighbours get nothing .
fuelled by subsidies economists have their own reasons for disliking wind power .
the inputs may be free , but wind generation is relatively inefficient : variable wind speeds mean that most turbines operate at only about one-third capacity .
a recent study from the royal academy of engineering calculated that onshore wind farming cost more than twice as much per kilowatt-hour as most fossil fuels .
as a result , the wind business is reliant on subsidy , which provides close to three-quarters of the revenue for a typical new development .
wind farms sell electricity to the grid like any other producer , but earn most of their cash by selling so-called renewable obligation certificates -lrb- rocs -rrb- to fossil-fuel generators .
these rocs allow traditional generators that are likely to miss their renewables-use targets - in other words , all of them - to purchase eco-friendly capacity without re-tooling their own plants .
this form of subsidy costs the british taxpayer £ 500m a year , roughly half of all subsidies for renewable energy .
blowing hot and cold the wind power industry calls most of this superstitious rubbish .
study after study , groans chris tomlinson of the bwea , has failed to turn up serious evidence of environmental damage from wind farms .
" hardly any birds fly into windfarms ; millions fly into car windscreens , but no one campaigns against them . "
wind farms are also more efficient than they may at first appear : the usual 30 % capacity use was actually more like 50 % in gusty 2003 .
that figure puts the wind sector pretty close to the fossil fuel competition .
and while no one denies the industry relies on subsidies , so too do many other areas of the power industry .
the apparently low generation costs of gas , coal and nuclear do not even begin to factor in the potentially astronomical costs of decomissioning defunct plants .
wind farms , by contrast , are easily tidied away .
" when our turbines give out , we can just cart them away , " says annette heslop , a board member of baywind , which operates two wind farms in southwest cumbria .
" we re-seed the grass , and a week later you 'd never know they 'd been there . "
labour pains if , ultimately , this sparring is inconclusive , it is easier to point an accusing finger at government policy .
wind farms look a lot less nasty when the community owns a share last year , the uk government threw its weight behind a huge expansion of wind power , with the aim of generating 10 % of the country 's electricity from renewable sources by 2010 .
and this august , it loosened planning requirements for wind farms , hoping to speed up the process - currently at least a year - needed to approve a project .
but while almost everyone prefers offshore wind farms , which are both less objectionable and vastly more productive , the roc subsidy regime makes them uneconomic .
onshore and offshore projects attract the same subsidies , but offshore development is much more expensive .
as a result , the uk now has just two offshore windfarms , with a total of 32 turbines ; to achieve the 2010 renewables target , the bwea calculates it needs at least 1,500 offshore turbines .
upsetting the balance the government 's attempts to ginger up planning have also annoyed local authorities .
the new guidance sets renewable energy targets for municipalities , and generally advises them to view wind-power projects favourably .
as far as ric outhwaite at allerdale council is concerned , that undermines his authority to direct planning .
" we would like to be able to designate areas where wind farms can be built , but we ca n't do that " he says .
" the new advice makes it very difficult to achieve the usual balance between public opinion and the rights of developers . "
other people 's jobs things might be different if wind power promised an influx of jobs to west cumbria , a region of high unemployment .
but it does n't .
although the government predicts the industry could sustain up to 35,000 jobs by 2020 , there is no reason why those workers need be in the same areas as the wind farms , which are operated remotely and maintained sparingly .
in cumbria , the site of many of britain 's forays into nuclear technology , there is considerable resentment at having wind farms foisted on them .
the latest regional plan evisages a tenfold increase in wind capacity in cumbria ; neighbouring lancashire , which currently has as much capacity as cumbria , is asked only for a 50 % increase .
" some might say we 've done enough in providing electricity for the rest of the uk , " says mr outhwaite .
working together luckily , a less clunky model for the industry is gaining ground .
baywind is a cooperative , owned by 1,300 members , who have put in between £ 300 and £ 20,000 , and many of whom live in the surrounding area .
since its launch in 1996 , baywind has remained profitable - with a gross rate of return of about 6 % - and has set aside a portion of its income for educational work and grants for energy saving .
unlike some multinational wind-power firms , many of which have become chippy under the barrage of criticism , baywind makes a point of being cosily community-focused : neighbourhood schoolchildren , for example , were asked to come up with names for its six harlock hill turbines .
last year , baywind set up a management arm , energy4all , to encourage the development of cooperatives around britain and overseas .
so far , it has four projects ready to go , and others in the pipeline , including deals in devon , wales and ireland .
the turbines outside your window do n't look so nasty , it seems , when they 're paying you a healthy rate of interest .

candy atherton is part of a defra committee which will try to change the european commission 's decision not to ban pair trawling .
the commission said the scientific data presented by the uk government did not justify an immediate ban .
but ms atherton says the fishery should be closed .
pair trawling , where a large net is attached to two boats and trawled through the water , is blamed for thousands of dolphin deaths each year .
the method is mainly used by foreign boats .
more than 300 cetacean carcasses were found dead on beaches in the region in the year 2002-2003 .
the mp for falmouth and camborne who chaired a parliamentary select committee which reported on dolphin deaths , said : " we are taking this fight to the heart of europe .
" we must change european public opinion , so the maximum pressure is put on politicians in other countries .
" the fishery should be closed . "
the british request for a ban was made by fisheries minister , exeter mp ben bradshaw .
campaigners are warning the uk dolphin population could be wiped out .
it is estimated that about 10,000 dolphins and porpoises die each around uk and french coasts , many of them after being caught up in bass nets .

the method is mainly used by foreign boats .
more than 300 cetacean carcasses were found dead on beaches in the region in the year 2002-2003 .
the mp for falmouth and camborne who chaired a parliamentary select committee which reported on dolphin deaths , said : " we are taking this fight to the heart of europe .
