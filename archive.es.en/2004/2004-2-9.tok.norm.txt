as nature awakes from the harsh winter and blossoms begin to change the barren land , the opium poppy sleeps on .
a few months later , the fields will be full with beautiful red flowers . then the harvest begins ; the poppies are mowed and in the weeks that follow , the product that these plants hold within will hit the streets of western cities in the form of powder sold in small plastic bags . in an attempt to stop the tide of afghan heroin flooding european cities , politicians and representatives of international organizations have been meeting in kabul to discuss strategies to counter the country ’ s drug cultivation industry . britain and us favor burning fields bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but while the experts are united in their cause to stamp out the scourge of afghan heroin crossing their borders , there are conflicting views on what the best action is .
britain , which was given the role of stamping out afghanistan ’ s drug output at the bonn conference shortly after the fall of the taliban regime , is in favor of burning the poppy fields and destroying the drug labs . considered harsh by many , the united states supports such a " slash and burn " tactic . however , german experts wish to pursue alternative solutions .
“ these repressive measures do not correspond to our plan of lasting development , ” said christoph berg , project manager of the drugs and development scheme of the german society for technical cooperation -lrb- gtz -rrb- , in an interview with deutsche welle .
“ we want to show the farmers that there are alternatives to opium growing . ” farmers would prefer alternative income bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the warlords control their own areas and profit from the local crop .
research carried out by the gtz shows that the cultivation of wheat , wine , fruit or spices could well replace the production of heroin as a source of making a living for afghans .
" we have spoken with farmers .
many would stop growing opium if they could survive by producing other products , ” said berg , adding that all production of opium is illegal in afghanistan . the gtz experts in kabul form a part of a project investigating " drug control connected to development , " an eu supported initiative which is being funded by the bloc to the tune of € 9 million over the next three years .
the project intends to start the process of replacing the drug economy at the very roots by working with schools and health centers in the eastern provinces of laghman , kunar and nangarhar and to set up and strengthen alternative agricultural cooperatives . gtz must convince profiting warlords bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr soldiers on patrol in afghanistan .
the project will last for at least 10 to 15 years , according to berg , and it will take at least that long before the first successes becomes visible in the fight against drugs .
not everybody is so eager to cooperate .
“ we must also try to include the local warlords and work constructively with them , ” said berg .
the warlords profit from the drug business and the afghan economy relies heavily on it while there is little alternative .
convincing some of the benefits of other crops will take time . but the german focus is on a peaceful and progressive campaign against the drug trade emanating from afghanistan .
the military has also taken a non-aggressive stance on the opium business , especially as the bundeswehr attempts to win over the hearts and minds of the afghan people through its reconstruction efforts . germany rules out military intervention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heroin is a problem in most european cities .
the soldiers of the regional reconstruction team -lrb- prt -rrb- in the northern afghan city of kunduz are operating in one of the most opium rich areas of the country .
however , the german parliament only agreed the deployment of the force outside the relative safety of the international assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- mission in kabul on the condition that the 220 soldiers of the prt keep out of the fight with the drug barons . but despite the plans of the gtz and the resolution of the bundeswehr , the fight against the poppy growers and cultivators will go on as british and u.s. forces continue to target a way of life that not only provides their enemies with funds to fight on but also takes the war to the streets of their home nations . harvests improving every year according to the united nations , 2003 saw afghanistan ’ s second-best harvest ever registered : 3,600 metric tons of opium , material for 360 metric tons of heroin was produced last year .
this number is second only to the bumper crop of 1999 from which 4,600 metric tons were collected . # b # this year , a good harvest is expected once again , adding to afghanistan ’ s reputation as the world market leader in the production of the drug .
the drug cultivation and drug trafficking makes up half of the afghan domestic product , three quarters of the world production in opium comes from the hindu kush and drug experts estimate that 90 percent of the raw afghan opium makes it to europe in the form of refined heroin . dw-staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de struck says afghanistan still not safe german defense minister peter struck has wrapped up a visit to the northern afghan city of kunduz , saying the country still is n't " stable " and has ruled out helping the afghans fight the drug trade .
-lrb- january 31 , 2004 -rrb- opium : the prescription for survival in afghanistan afghanistan is the world ’ s largest raw opium producer according to the latest un drug report .
opium cultivation is forbidden in the country , but there ’ s no denying it ’ s a lucrative business for impoverished farmers .

german general götz gliemeroth handed over command of the nato-led peacekeeping force in afghanistan to canada on monday amid fresh security concerns following an emergence of suicide bomb attacks . after a year of steering the 6,420-strong multinational international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- charged with overseeing security in the afghan capital , german nato general goetz gliemeroth handed over the reins to canadian general rick hillier on monday .
the canadian troops with 2,000 soldiers make up the largest contingent of the nato-led isaf force .
it ’ s unclear how long they will remain in afghanistan .
the canadian contingent is expected to end its deployment in august , but canadian prime minister paul martin has said 500 soldiers will stay on after that period .
security fears rise after attacks the festive hand-over ceremony was marked by tight security following a recent wave of suicide bomb attacks which killed a canadian soldier in kabul last month and a british peacekeeper a day later .
the attacks , claimed by the taliban , came on the heels of a december suicide bombing in which five afghan security officials were killed in kabul .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaap de hoop scheffer earlier , jaap de hoop scheffer -lrb- photo -rrb- expressed concerns that the emergence of suicide bomb attacks on kabul peacekeepers showed that the capital was far from secure .
he called on the international community not to lose its focus on a nation still racked by violence , poverty and a booming drug trade .
" the situation is fragile , " de hoop scheffer told reporters aboard a u.s. military plane on his way to kabul .
" it ’ s extremely difficult to have a 100 percent defence against these horrible suicide attacks . ”
de hoop scheffer also underlined afghanistan ’ s importance for the military alliance .
" we now know that our future security , no matter where we are , is dependant on afghanistan ’ s security , " he said during the hand-over ceremony and warned that the international community needed to stay involved in afghanistan .
" the u.n. , the european union , japan and other important donors should stay fully committed to this country , " de hoop scheffer said .

11 , 2003 .
nato took command of the 5,000-strong international peacekeeping force in the afghan capital on monday , a historic move that marks the alliance 's first operation outside europe since it was created 54 years ago .
-lrb- ap photo / apichart weerawong -rrb- taking stock of germany ’ s isaf year , german general götz gliemeroth -lrb- photo -rrb- stressed that germany had notched up successes during its command of the isaf , most notably the smooth running of the loya jirga or the grand assembly that agreed on a new constitution for afghanistan in december .
he also said considerable progress was made in the program towards disarming some 10,000 militia in the country under germany ’ s leadership .
at the same time gliemeroth warned that the nexus between the local warlords who ran provincial private armies and the wealthy druglords posed one of the biggest threats to afghanistan ’ s future .
" deplorably we ’ re seeing a connection between this so-called warlordism , which means commanders who maintain armies for political reasons to exert pressure , and the funds that come from the drugs trade , " gliemeroth said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poppy farmer mohammad agha in afghanistan the general , who has suggested in the past that nato should tackle the issue even it meant violent conflicts with the drug mafia , insisted that cracking down on the flourishing drug trade should be made a priority .
" it ’ s a challenge that the international community must urgently take up .
i can only add that soldiers are the least appropriate means to combat the planting of opium and drug transport .
rather we need to set up the right structures in afghanistan and shore them with funds , " he said .
continuing commitment to afghanistan needed gliemeroth urged continuing engagement in the civil-military area .
he pointed towards the success of the first provincial reconstruction team -lrb- prt -rrb- in kunduz in northern afghanistan .
nato controls that area and the prt is involved in the reconstruction of hundreds of schools , hospitals , fountains and irrigation projects .
" i think our alliance partners have realized the central importance of such prts for the further development of afghanistan , " he said .
nato currently runs one prt , while the u.s-led force of 10,600 controls the remainder .
prts , whose members range from a few dozen to more than 200 , combine military and reconstruction roles in far-flung areas .
by next month there will be 13 prts across afghanistan .
nato ’ s peacekeeping force aims to set up five new teams over the next six months .
gliemeroth however warned that the situation in iraq shouldn ’ t be allowed to divert attention from afghanistan .
" currently , in all fairness to the situation in iraq , it has to be said that afghanistan has been largely overshadowed by the development there , " gliemeroth said .

khan , who was the chief developer of pakistan 's atomic bomb , claimed full responsibility , but observers allege that khan could not have acted without the military 's knowledge . at least four germans , including two former employees of the company leybold-heraeus , are suspected of taking part in illicit deals with khan , the spiegel newsmagazine has reported .

after his resignation as social democratic party chairman on friday , german chancellor gerhard schröder on saturday named his likely successors , who he hopes will bring the party together on difficult reforms . these are days of surprise in the corridors of the germany ’ s governing party , the social democrats .
few had any idea on friday morning that chancellor gerhard schröder would resign from his post as head of the social democratic party and hand the reins over to franz müntefering , the party ’ s parliamentary group chairman .
then , on saturday , he named a successor for the party 's luckless general secretary , olaf scholz .
" on march 21 , the spd is going to call a special party conference , " schröder told reporters saturday .
" the party executive will unanimously nominate franz müntefering as its new party chairman .
and the party executive will also nominate klaus uwe benneter as the spd ’ s new general secretary with the same number of votes . "
a new deputy 56-year-old lawyer benneter , also a member of the german parliament , the bundestag , is also a close friend of schröder .
during the turbulent 70s , the two were active together in the spd ’ s young socialists at a time when the spd ’ s youth group had taken an extreme left political course .
at one point , benneter was even temporarily banned from the party because he had spoken out in favor of cooperation with communists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus-uwe benneter today ’ s an altogether different story .
these days , benneter -lrb- photo -rrb- calls for deep cuts into germany ’ s social system , for reforms of the labor market and public healthcare system – all initiatives that have drawn heavy criticism from the social democrats ’ party base and voters .
together , benneter and müntefering are expected to bring the party ’ s traditional leftist core into line with the government ’ s planned reforms .
müntefering calls for broad party debate on reforms müntefering said saturday he wanted to speak clear language about " equitableness , " one of the core principles of european social democratic movements . " that ’ s not just a saying , " müntefering said , " rather , it is something that has always been a deep part of this party ’ s history .
whoever speaks of ‘ equitableness ’ has to start with equal opportunities .
and they have to start with the fact that that is not functioning in the scope that we desire .
we ’ ve spoken of our solid determination to create a situation where young people in this country aren ’ t able to fall from school desk to the unemployment rolls .
the situation can ’ t stay as it is . "
speaking on a handful of german public broadcasting stations on saturday , müntefering said he wants to involve the party in the government ’ s reform policies more than in the past , admitting to ard that the reform policy negotiations within the party had been " suboptimal . "
in the future , he said reforms needed to be prepared more " cautiously . "
in an interview with zdf , he said he intended to open an intensive debate within the party about planned reforms while at the same time standing shoulder to shoulder with the government .
a deft political move ?
the first reactions coming out of the party this weekend suggest schröder made a deft political move by resigning from his position as party chairman .
the chancellor made clear on saturday that the party reins would soon be tightened , and that even in his cabinet there was no breathing room left for error .
in other words : controversial members of the cabinet , like transport minister manfred stolpe who has overseen the trouble-plagued implementation of tolls for heavy trucks and transports on germany highways , are now on probation . indeed , in recent weeks the pages of germany 's top newspapers and magazines have been filled with speculation of a possible shakeup of schröder 's cabinet .
schröder said the party needed to put its collective energy toward the different tasks required for safeguarding and implementing the reform process .
opposition : spd falling apart the minority opposition , neo-liberal free democratic party immediately criticized benneter ’ s nomination , lambasting the move as a signal that the spd is shifting to the left .
and dieter althaus of the christian democratic union said that the decision by the spd to appoint a relatively unknown politician to the position of general secretary showed how difficult it had become for the party to find leaders .
earlier , cdu chairwoman angela merkel and the head of the cdu ’ s bavarian sister party , the christian social union , edmund stoiber , both said schröder ’ s resignation marked the " beginning of the end " of the party . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder leaves an unloved post by quitting as the head of the social democratic party on friday , gerhard schröder left an office he hardly loved .
besides , his likely successor could help build party support for schröder 's equally unloved reforms .

during the turbulent 70s , the two were active together in the spd ’ s young socialists at a time when the spd ’ s youth group had taken an extreme left political course .
at one point , benneter was even temporarily banned from the party because he had spoken out in favor of cooperation with communists .

these days , benneter -lrb- photo -rrb- calls for deep cuts into germany ’ s social system , for reforms of the labor market and public healthcare system – all initiatives that have drawn heavy criticism from the social democrats ’ party base and voters .

müntefering calls for broad party debate on reforms müntefering said saturday he wanted to speak clear language about " equitableness , " one of the core principles of european social democratic movements .

the situation can ’ t stay as it is . "
speaking on a handful of german public broadcasting stations on saturday , müntefering said he wants to involve the party in the government ’ s reform policies more than in the past , admitting to ard that the reform policy negotiations within the party had been " suboptimal . "
in the future , he said reforms needed to be prepared more " cautiously . "
in an interview with zdf , he said he intended to open an intensive debate within the party about planned reforms while at the same time standing shoulder to shoulder with the government .
a deft political move ?
the first reactions coming out of the party this weekend suggest schröder made a deft political move by resigning from his position as party chairman .
the chancellor made clear on saturday that the party reins would soon be tightened , and that even in his cabinet there was no breathing room left for error .
in other words : controversial members of the cabinet , like transport minister manfred stolpe who has overseen the trouble-plagued implementation of tolls for heavy trucks and transports on germany highways , are now on probation . indeed , in recent weeks the pages of germany 's top newspapers and magazines have been filled with speculation of a possible shakeup of schröder 's cabinet .
schröder said the party needed to put its collective energy toward the different tasks required for safeguarding and implementing the reform process .
opposition : spd falling apart the minority opposition , neo-liberal free democratic party immediately criticized benneter ’ s nomination , lambasting the move as a signal that the spd is shifting to the left .
and dieter althaus of the christian democratic union said that the decision by the spd to appoint a relatively unknown politician to the position of general secretary showed how difficult it had become for the party to find leaders .

after his resignation as social democratic party chairman on friday , german chancellor gerhard schröder on saturday named his likely successors , who he hopes will bring the party together on difficult reforms . these are days of surprise in the corridors of the germany ’ s governing party , the social democrats .
few had any idea on friday morning that chancellor gerhard schröder would resign from his post as head of the social democratic party and hand the reins over to franz müntefering , the party ’ s parliamentary group chairman .
then , on saturday , he named a successor for the party 's luckless general secretary , olaf scholz .
" on march 21 , the spd is going to call a special party conference , " schröder told reporters saturday .
" the party executive will unanimously nominate franz müntefering as its new party chairman .
and the party executive will also nominate klaus uwe benneter as the spd ’ s new general secretary with the same number of votes . "
a new deputy 56-year-old lawyer benneter , also a member of the german parliament , the bundestag , is also a close friend of schröder .

"
and as a result , after spending several weeks at number one , the song became the anthem of some of those struggling to reconcile the broken nation . even as the hammers began to fall on the symbol of division , hasselhoff ’ s music was omnipresent ; the album of the same name was also germany ’ s best selling long player of the time , keeping less important records off the top spot for three months . freedom found bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " david , we love you !

mikhail gorbachev … helmut kohl … david hasselhoff .
no , do not adjust your screens .
the list of those who contributed to the fall of the berlin wall and the end of communism has long been missing one name … until now . it was one of the defining moments of the twentieth century .
not only did it come to represent the collapse of the soviet union , the end of the communist dream and the concluding drama of the cold war , the fall of the berlin wall must also be remembered as the moment a nation that had been divided for 28 years came together .
thank you , david hasselhoff . excuse me ?
david hasselhoff ?
the man who made talking cars every small boy ’ s dream and scantily-clad , surgically enhanced beauties running in slow motion every teenage boy ’ s fantasy ?
surely the actor-slash-singer responsible for immortalizing such screen idols as michael knight and mitch buchannon can ’ t be accredited with bringing down a superpower and reuniting germany . well , according to the man himself , hasselhoff does indeed feel that he played his part in bringing about the fall of the berlin wall and aiding the reunification of east and west germany .
and not through some heroic spy chase across communist berlin at the wheel of his trusty car kitt or a daring rescue involving pamela anderson and a defecting russian diplomat in a thong .
no , hasselhoff believes his contribution came about through the unifying and healing power of his music . cover version caught the moment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after recording an english language cover version of the 1970s german hit , “ auf der strasse nach suden ” and renaming it “ looking for freedom , ” hasselhoff raced up the charts in the late summer of 1989 , just as a tide of revolution began rolling through eastern europe . the soft rock god had sublimely caught the moment by crooning the stirring lyrics : " i 've been lookin ' for freedom ; i 've been lookin ' so long ; i 've been lookin ' for freedom ; still the search goes on . "
and as a result , after spending several weeks at number one , the song became the anthem of some of those struggling to reconcile the broken nation . even as the hammers began to fall on the symbol of division , hasselhoff ’ s music was omnipresent ; the album of the same name was also germany ’ s best selling long player of the time , keeping less important records off the top spot for three months . freedom found bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " david , we love you ! "
at last , all those germans who had been looking for freedom eventually found it as the wall finally crumbled on november 9 , 1989 , allowing thousands of east germans to flood into west berlin to be reunited with loved ones and to buy long-forbidden albums from hasselhoff ’ s musical back catalogue . there was even a moment when the reunited country joined together to thank the man who had provided the soundtrack to such historic change .
after being invited to headline a new year ’ s eve concert at the brandenburg gate by former german chancellor helmut kohl , the people ’ s champion finally got his chance to deliver his song in person to an audience of almost a million reunited germans . playing to an audience of united germans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it was the first time germany had been unified , and close to a million east and west german fans stood together in the freezing cold at midnight watching me perform .
i was overcome with emotion , " he recalled in an interview with german magazine tv spielfilm . but official recognition evaded him .
“ i am a little bit sad that no photo of me hangs in the checkpoint charlie museum in berlin , ” he added with regret after his contribution to reunification failed to make it into the berlin wall commemorative exhibition at the former border crossing . museum missing hero 's portrait bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : checkpoint charlie .
but how can this be ?
surely a man who mobilized a divided nation , a man whose voice was the catalyst for revolution , should be honoured for his role in changing the world as many knew it back then . but the checkpoint charlie museum in berlin is n't quite convinced of the singer 's historical significance .

after his resignation as social democratic party chairman on friday , german chancellor gerhard schröder on saturday named his likely successors , who he hopes will bring the party together on difficult reforms . these are days of surprise in the corridors of the germany ’ s governing party , the social democrats .
few had any idea on friday morning that chancellor gerhard schröder would resign from his post as head of the social democratic party and hand the reins over to franz müntefering , the party ’ s parliamentary group chairman .
then , on saturday , he named a successor for the party 's luckless general secretary , olaf scholz .
" on march 21 , the spd is going to call a special party conference , " schröder told reporters saturday .
" the party executive will unanimously nominate franz müntefering as its new party chairman .
and the party executive will also nominate klaus uwe benneter as the spd ’ s new general secretary with the same number of votes . "
a new deputy 56-year-old lawyer benneter , also a member of the german parliament , the bundestag , is also a close friend of schröder .
during the turbulent 70s , the two were active together in the spd ’ s young socialists at a time when the spd ’ s youth group had taken an extreme left political course .
at one point , benneter was even temporarily banned from the party because he had spoken out in favor of cooperation with communists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus-uwe benneter today ’ s an altogether different story .
these days , benneter -lrb- photo -rrb- calls for deep cuts into germany ’ s social system , for reforms of the labor market and public healthcare system – all initiatives that have drawn heavy criticism from the social democrats ’ party base and voters .
together , benneter and müntefering are expected to bring the party ’ s traditional leftist core into line with the government ’ s planned reforms .
müntefering calls for broad party debate on reforms müntefering said saturday he wanted to speak clear language about " equitableness , " one of the core principles of european social democratic movements . " that ’ s not just a saying , " müntefering said , " rather , it is something that has always been a deep part of this party ’ s history .
whoever speaks of ‘ equitableness ’ has to start with equal opportunities .
and they have to start with the fact that that is not functioning in the scope that we desire .
we ’ ve spoken of our solid determination to create a situation where young people in this country aren ’ t able to fall from school desk to the unemployment rolls .
the situation can ’ t stay as it is . "
speaking on a handful of german public broadcasting stations on saturday , müntefering said he wants to involve the party in the government ’ s reform policies more than in the past , admitting to ard that the reform policy negotiations within the party had been " suboptimal . "
in the future , he said reforms needed to be prepared more " cautiously . "
in an interview with zdf , he said he intended to open an intensive debate within the party about planned reforms while at the same time standing shoulder to shoulder with the government .
a deft political move ?
the first reactions coming out of the party this weekend suggest schröder made a deft political move by resigning from his position as party chairman .
the chancellor made clear on saturday that the party reins would soon be tightened , and that even in his cabinet there was no breathing room left for error .
in other words : controversial members of the cabinet , like transport minister manfred stolpe who has overseen the trouble-plagued implementation of tolls for heavy trucks and transports on germany highways , are now on probation . indeed , in recent weeks the pages of germany 's top newspapers and magazines have been filled with speculation of a possible shakeup of schröder 's cabinet .
schröder said the party needed to put its collective energy toward the different tasks required for safeguarding and implementing the reform process .
opposition : spd falling apart the minority opposition , neo-liberal free democratic party immediately criticized benneter ’ s nomination , lambasting the move as a signal that the spd is shifting to the left .
and dieter althaus of the christian democratic union said that the decision by the spd to appoint a relatively unknown politician to the position of general secretary showed how difficult it had become for the party to find leaders .
earlier , cdu chairwoman angela merkel and the head of the cdu ’ s bavarian sister party , the christian social union , edmund stoiber , both said schröder ’ s resignation marked the " beginning of the end " of the party . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder leaves an unloved post by quitting as the head of the social democratic party on friday , gerhard schröder left an office he hardly loved .

after the parmalat fiasco , the italian government has taken steps to reform the country 's regulatory system .
but do the reforms go far enough , and how do they compare to those elsewhere in europe , including germany ? the italian cabinet has approved a draft law aimed at reforming italy 's regulatory system .
the law , which is still subject to parliamentary approval , is the first step towards changing a system which , in the eyes of many , failed to prevent the multi-billion dollar parmalat scandal .
but after months of political wrangling , the tough original version of the bill was watered down - and may be further diluted before it gets final parliamentary approval sometime in the next three months - raising doubts about the current italian government 's ability to impose better corporate governance and soothe investor anxieties .
elsewhere in europe , including germany , steps have been taken to prevent a parmalat or enron-style meltdown .
but are the safeguards sufficient ?
italian economy minister hopes for radical reform the law approved by the italian government last week was very different from the one proposed by italy 's economy minister giulio tremonti .
shortly after parmalat first made the news in december , tremonti called for shifting oversight authority away from the bank of italy and giving more power to the anti-trust authority and consab , the italian equivalent of the united states ' federal exchange commission -lrb- fec -rrb- .
those found guilty of financial fraud would also face longer prison terms .
in short , tremonti hoped to consolidate italy 's complicated regulatory system , which is comprised of five parts , each devoted to different types of business , into a three-pronged system .
italian politicians reluctant to make big changes but tremonti faced tough opposition from the country 's business-mogul prime minister silvio berlusconi and his allies , who feared that a harsh response would be bad for business .
" we do n't need to turn an exceptional event into a witch hunt , which would make the running of an insurance or financial company difficult , " said berlusconi .
as it turned out the draft law did not , as some had hoped , consolidate the various authorities .
instead it strengthened consob with greater sanctioning powers and the authority to oversee corporate bond issues .
not everyone , including tremonti , was convinced .
" we would have liked a radical reform , and now we risk introducing a reform that is n't very incisive , " he said .
the german path to reform in an interview with deutsche welle , marco becht , the executive director of the european corporate governance institute and a professor of finance and economics at the university of brussels , points to the complexity of the issue .
" sometimes it is a case of management without enough shareholder oversight , as was the case with enron , and sometimes it is a case of a very powerful shareholder getting up to something , as was the case with parmalat , " he said .
" the tools you need in each of these situations is slightly different , " he added .
given the complexity of the task at hand , and the increasing complexity of multi-national corporations engaged in different types of business , what 's a government - say the one in berlin - to do ?
tremonti 's approach , consolidating various oversight authorities into a more cooperative powerful single entity , is an approach that has proven popular elsewhere in europe , according to ernst maug , a professor of business administration at humboldt university in berlin .
germany did so in 2002 , consolidating various regulatory agencies into bafin , the federal agency responsible for overseeing the entire financial sector .
" this seems to be the trend and makes a lot of sense to me , " maug told deutsche welle .
" it does n't make sense to have different regulatory agencies overseeing different sectors just because one security is called a stock and another a bond ; when you have one authority you have a better chance of catching things . "
what 's more , also in 2002 , the german corporate governance code , also known as the " kodex , " was implemented .
this code of " best practices " is not legally binding , but companies are now required to disclose in their annual reports the extent to which they comply with the code and explain opt-outs .
a german parmalat ?
these measures by no means guarantee that a corporate scandal like parmalat or enron wo n't happen in germany .
" could it happen here - yes , " says maug .
you will never have a system where everyone complies with the law all the time , he points out , and reducing these scandals to zero is not an option , since the resulting regulation could prove too costly for business .
brecht concurs .
" there is always a trade-off in trying to prevent the next parmalat from happening and restricting executives from being able to do business , " he says .
" with regulation , you have to do a cost-benefit analysis . "
in the meantime , governments in europe and the world over continue to debate how to strike the best balance . kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de how to say " enron " in italian casting new doubt on european corporate governance , leading italian food group parmalat announced last week the firm had a € 4-billion discrepancy in its books .

meeting near berlin on monday , german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac said they want an agreement on a new european union constitution before the end of the irish eu presidency in june . the french and german leaders revived hopes for the european union ’ s stalled constitution on monday after they said they want an agreement on it before the six-month irish presidency of the eu runs out at the end of june .
meeting in genshagen , south of berlin , schröder and chirac were unanimous that the future of the eu had to be dealt with soon .
" we agreed that it 's our joint wish that the constitution issue should be resolved by the end of june during the irish presidency , " chirac said at a joint news conference with schröder .
" if this does not happen then in any case we must try to find an accord by the end of the dutch presidency at the end of 2004 , " he added .
warming franco-german ties the move is a further sign of deepening franco-german ties .
the two leaders have forged a close political relationship since last year when they both opposed the iraq war and have seen eye to eye on hotly-debated issues such as a post-war iraqi order , the eu constitution and european security and defense policy .
" our positions on european union themes are identical , " chirac said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish premier bertie ahern schröder was to head to dublin later on monday for talks with irish prime minister bertie ahern -lrb- photo -rrb- , who currently holds the rotating eu presidency .
ireland has been trying to broker an agreement on the eu constitution when it took over the presidency on jan 1 .
bedevilled eu constitution the new constitution is supposed to prepare the eu for may , when it expands from 15 to 25 members .
most observers consider the bloc ’ s current institutional set-up as too unwieldy and inefficient .
besides ending the rotation of the eu presidency amongst the national governments , the draft constitution aims to streamline the eu commission and decision-making .
eu constitution talks broke down last december after poland and spain refused to accept newly weighted voting rights in the draft text , which would greatly curtail their voting rights in the eu council of ministers .
the two countries were the main beneficiaries of the 2000 nice treaty , which gave them just two votes less than the much more populous france and germany .
the issue has pitted france and germany against spain and poland , a future eu member .
not willing to compromise schröder however said on monday that berlin and paris did not want agreement on the constitution " at any cost . "
" we must stick to the principle of double majority , " he told reporters in berlin .
" we want progress on the issue of majority voting and we also think that the question of the efficiency of the work of the commission must be better secured than is currently the case . "
chirac added : " we want a smaller commission that in the future can work efficiently .
it is also our wish that the work of the european council does not become bogged down by excessive demands for agreement . "
schröder and chirac also said they were sticking with demands for a freeze on the eu budget until 2013 .
france , germany , britain , the netherlands , sweden and austria - all of which are net contributors to the eu – made the budget freeze demand last december in an open letter .
with a little bit of british help the franco-german duo hopes their efforts will be given additional clout by the british prime minister tony blair who is expected to join in a trilateral summit in berlin next week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's prime minister tony blair both schröder and chirac hope that the franco-german motor , ideally beefed up a bit with the help of britain ’ s tony blair -lrb- photo -rrb- , will create new momentum for a breakthrough in talks on the future of europe . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ireland puts eu constitution at the top of its agenda after a rocky shot at the helm of the eu presidency , italy handed the reins to ireland on january 1st .

german general götz gliemeroth handed over command of the nato-led peacekeeping force in afghanistan to canada on monday amid fresh security concerns following an emergence of suicide bomb attacks . after a year of steering the 6,420-strong multinational international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- charged with overseeing security in the afghan capital , german nato general goetz gliemeroth handed over the reins to canadian general rick hillier on monday .
the canadian troops with 2,000 soldiers make up the largest contingent of the nato-led isaf force .
it ’ s unclear how long they will remain in afghanistan .
the canadian contingent is expected to end its deployment in august , but canadian prime minister paul martin has said 500 soldiers will stay on after that period .
security fears rise after attacks the festive hand-over ceremony was marked by tight security following a recent wave of suicide bomb attacks which killed a canadian soldier in kabul last month and a british peacekeeper a day later .
the attacks , claimed by the taliban , came on the heels of a december suicide bombing in which five afghan security officials were killed in kabul .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaap de hoop scheffer earlier , jaap de hoop scheffer -lrb- photo -rrb- expressed concerns that the emergence of suicide bomb attacks on kabul peacekeepers showed that the capital was far from secure .
he called on the international community not to lose its focus on a nation still racked by violence , poverty and a booming drug trade .
" the situation is fragile , " de hoop scheffer told reporters aboard a u.s. military plane on his way to kabul .
" it ’ s extremely difficult to have a 100 percent defence against these horrible suicide attacks . ”
de hoop scheffer also underlined afghanistan ’ s importance for the military alliance .
" we now know that our future security , no matter where we are , is dependant on afghanistan ’ s security , " he said during the hand-over ceremony and warned that the international community needed to stay involved in afghanistan .
" the u.n. , the european union , japan and other important donors should stay fully committed to this country , " de hoop scheffer said .
" nato can provide security and stability , but the afghan people need housing and schooling and roofs over their heads . "

-lrb- ap photo / apichart weerawong -rrb- taking stock of germany ’ s isaf year , german general götz gliemeroth -lrb- photo -rrb- stressed that germany had notched up successes during its command of the isaf , most notably the smooth running of the loya jirga or the grand assembly that agreed on a new constitution for afghanistan in december .
he also said considerable progress was made in the program towards disarming some 10,000 militia in the country under germany ’ s leadership .
at the same time gliemeroth warned that the nexus between the local warlords who ran provincial private armies and the wealthy druglords posed one of the biggest threats to afghanistan ’ s future .
" deplorably we ’ re seeing a connection between this so-called warlordism , which means commanders who maintain armies for political reasons to exert pressure , and the funds that come from the drugs trade , " gliemeroth said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poppy farmer mohammad agha in afghanistan the general , who has suggested in the past that nato should tackle the issue even it meant violent conflicts with the drug mafia , insisted that cracking down on the flourishing drug trade should be made a priority .
" it ’ s a challenge that the international community must urgently take up .
i can only add that soldiers are the least appropriate means to combat the planting of opium and drug transport .
rather we need to set up the right structures in afghanistan and shore them with funds , " he said .
continuing commitment to afghanistan needed gliemeroth urged continuing engagement in the civil-military area .
he pointed towards the success of the first provincial reconstruction team -lrb- prt -rrb- in kunduz in northern afghanistan .
nato controls that area and the prt is involved in the reconstruction of hundreds of schools , hospitals , fountains and irrigation projects .
" i think our alliance partners have realized the central importance of such prts for the further development of afghanistan , " he said .
nato currently runs one prt , while the u.s-led force of 10,600 controls the remainder .
prts , whose members range from a few dozen to more than 200 , combine military and reconstruction roles in far-flung areas .
by next month there will be 13 prts across afghanistan .
nato ’ s peacekeeping force aims to set up five new teams over the next six months .
gliemeroth however warned that the situation in iraq shouldn ’ t be allowed to divert attention from afghanistan .
" currently , in all fairness to the situation in iraq , it has to be said that afghanistan has been largely overshadowed by the development there , " gliemeroth said .
" but i think the international community owes this land -lrb- afghanistan -rrb- a great deal .

meeting near berlin on monday , german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac said they want an agreement on a new european union constitution before the end of the irish eu presidency in june . the french and german leaders revived hopes for the european union ’ s stalled constitution on monday after they said they want an agreement on it before the six-month irish presidency of the eu runs out at the end of june .
meeting in genshagen , south of berlin , schröder and chirac were unanimous that the future of the eu had to be dealt with soon .
" we agreed that it 's our joint wish that the constitution issue should be resolved by the end of june during the irish presidency , " chirac said at a joint news conference with schröder .
" if this does not happen then in any case we must try to find an accord by the end of the dutch presidency at the end of 2004 , " he added .
warming franco-german ties the move is a further sign of deepening franco-german ties .
the two leaders have forged a close political relationship since last year when they both opposed the iraq war and have seen eye to eye on hotly-debated issues such as a post-war iraqi order , the eu constitution and european security and defense policy .
" our positions on european union themes are identical , " chirac said .

ireland has been trying to broker an agreement on the eu constitution when it took over the presidency on jan 1 .
bedevilled eu constitution the new constitution is supposed to prepare the eu for may , when it expands from 15 to 25 members .
most observers consider the bloc ’ s current institutional set-up as too unwieldy and inefficient .
besides ending the rotation of the eu presidency amongst the national governments , the draft constitution aims to streamline the eu commission and decision-making .
eu constitution talks broke down last december after poland and spain refused to accept newly weighted voting rights in the draft text , which would greatly curtail their voting rights in the eu council of ministers .
the two countries were the main beneficiaries of the 2000 nice treaty , which gave them just two votes less than the much more populous france and germany .
the issue has pitted france and germany against spain and poland , a future eu member .
not willing to compromise schröder however said on monday that berlin and paris did not want agreement on the constitution " at any cost . "
" we must stick to the principle of double majority , " he told reporters in berlin .
" we want progress on the issue of majority voting and we also think that the question of the efficiency of the work of the commission must be better secured than is currently the case . "
chirac added : " we want a smaller commission that in the future can work efficiently .
it is also our wish that the work of the european council does not become bogged down by excessive demands for agreement . "
schröder and chirac also said they were sticking with demands for a freeze on the eu budget until 2013 .
france , germany , britain , the netherlands , sweden and austria - all of which are net contributors to the eu – made the budget freeze demand last december in an open letter .

meeting near berlin on monday , german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac said they want an agreement on a new european union constitution before the end of the irish eu presidency in june . the french and german leaders revived hopes for the european union ’ s stalled constitution on monday after they said they want an agreement on it before the six-month irish presidency of the eu runs out at the end of june .
meeting in genshagen , south of berlin , schröder and chirac were unanimous that the future of the eu had to be dealt with soon .
" we agreed that it 's our joint wish that the constitution issue should be resolved by the end of june during the irish presidency , " chirac said at a joint news conference with schröder .
" if this does not happen then in any case we must try to find an accord by the end of the dutch presidency at the end of 2004 , " he added .
warming franco-german ties the move is a further sign of deepening franco-german ties .
the two leaders have forged a close political relationship since last year when they both opposed the iraq war and have seen eye to eye on hotly-debated issues such as a post-war iraqi order , the eu constitution and european security and defense policy .
" our positions on european union themes are identical , " chirac said .

ireland has been trying to broker an agreement on the eu constitution when it took over the presidency on jan 1 .
bedevilled eu constitution the new constitution is supposed to prepare the eu for may , when it expands from 15 to 25 members .
most observers consider the bloc ’ s current institutional set-up as too unwieldy and inefficient .
besides ending the rotation of the eu presidency amongst the national governments , the draft constitution aims to streamline the eu commission and decision-making .
eu constitution talks broke down last december after poland and spain refused to accept newly weighted voting rights in the draft text , which would greatly curtail their voting rights in the eu council of ministers .
the two countries were the main beneficiaries of the 2000 nice treaty , which gave them just two votes less than the much more populous france and germany .
the issue has pitted france and germany against spain and poland , a future eu member .
not willing to compromise schröder however said on monday that berlin and paris did not want agreement on the constitution " at any cost . "
" we must stick to the principle of double majority , " he told reporters in berlin .
" we want progress on the issue of majority voting and we also think that the question of the efficiency of the work of the commission must be better secured than is currently the case . "
chirac added : " we want a smaller commission that in the future can work efficiently .
it is also our wish that the work of the european council does not become bogged down by excessive demands for agreement . "
schröder and chirac also said they were sticking with demands for a freeze on the eu budget until 2013 .
france , germany , britain , the netherlands , sweden and austria - all of which are net contributors to the eu – made the budget freeze demand last december in an open letter .

while german participants familiarize themselves with new methods , theories and teaching aids , the fruits of their labors continue to abandon ship .
after investing tens of thousands in education and training costs , germany is losing its best qualified professionals to better paid positions elsewhere , economists complain .
and the growing brain drain is compounding germany 's economic woes through the loss of skilled labor and human resources .
nearly 118,000 people packed up and left the country in 2002 for jobs abroad , the german statistical office reported .
mathis malchow is one of those who , along with his girlfriend , left germany for better prospects abroad .
" we just decided that we would try our luck in london , because it 's the only city that has the potential for growth , " the architect told deutsche welle .
malchow has indeed been lucky .
he has a job with the renowned british architect sir norman foster .
the highlight so far has been working on one of london 's most conspicuous new landmarks , the swiss re building , affectionately dubbed the " erotic gherkin " by locals .
malchow does n't regret leaving germany .
" it 's definitely been an enriching experience , " he said .
helping them to go , then urging them to come back besides the young professionals and academics who leave germany for work , young germans who have completed vocational training also have good chances of finding a job abroad .
eva-elisabeth weber , a job counselor at the central employment agency in bonn , noted that hoteliers , chefs , managers and mechanical engineers , in particular , have good career opportunities beyond germany .
each year the agency locates jobs for some 6,000 skilled laborers , professionals and managers outside of the country .
it also tries to coax them back home when germany needs them .
" there are many doctors who we have found jobs for abroad , and now we have a shortage of qualified doctors here in germany .
we are now trying to encourage those german doctors and nurses spread across the european union to come back , " weber said .
science suffers every seventh person with a doctorate in science leaves germany for the united states , the scientist magazine has reported .
three of the four german nobel prize winners work in the united states .
" the trouble is that we are losing our highest achievers , " christoph anz of the confederation of german employers associations told the scientist .
" we have reached the point where we will no longer be able to compete in the booming biotechnology sector . "
gerd kempermann , a researcher in molecular medicine who has worked in the united states , says the work structure in other countries is often more attractive than in germany .
" the rules -lrb- in germany -rrb- do n't always fit everyone .
when someone realizes that they do n't fit into a certain formula then they begin to search for where their potential can be realized - where employers look to see what they can offer good employees . "
the most common complaints are that german research and development is under-funded and that institutes and universities are plagued by unwieldy bureaucracy .
" american universities offer scientists better pay conditions , more time for research and less time spent teaching , " said peter doermann , a research group leader at the max planck institute for molecular plant physiology near berlin .
some estimates say that scientists can earn three times as much money working in the united states compared to germany .
harming those who stay the brain drain can also hurt scientists working at home , doermann told deutsche welle .
" for me it 's a problem of collaboration , since the major players are in the u.s. there are some germans who were quite promising , and all of them went to the u.s. if you are below a critical number of people in a certain research area , you encounter problems applying for joint grants and european grants .
the german research foundation insists on only german research scientists , and if people leave there are n't enough left to collaborate , " he explained .
in an effort to reverse the trend , the german government last year said it would devote an extra € 100 million -lrb- $ 127 million -rrb- over the next four years to stimulate research and development in biotechnology in addition to the € 110 million already spent in the last three years .
announcing the package at the biotechnology day in leipzig in october , education and research minister edelgard bulmahn said the extra money would be directed to small- and medium-sized biotechnology companies .
gerd kempermann , for one , recently returned to germany to work at a local research clinic , but not because the conditions were better he said .
" they were for soft reasons , private reasons .
one ends up returning to where one comes from , " he explained .
kempermann is optimistic that despite the critical unemployment situation in the country - where 4.6 million people are registered jobless - the wealth of talent should encourage the public and private sector to invest in the human capital .
" i think that the motivation and the optimism will return quite quickly if a few fundamental conditions are changed .
if the government would support general research then we could have a flourishing landscape in no time . " margret steffen , dw staff -lrb- jsm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de are german universities losing their luster ?

german general götz gliemeroth handed over command of the nato-led peacekeeping force in afghanistan to canada on monday amid fresh security concerns following an emergence of suicide bomb attacks . after a year of steering the 6,420-strong multinational international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- charged with overseeing security in the afghan capital , german nato general goetz gliemeroth handed over the reins to canadian general rick hillier on monday .
the canadian troops with 2,000 soldiers make up the largest contingent of the nato-led isaf force .
it ’ s unclear how long they will remain in afghanistan .
the canadian contingent is expected to end its deployment in august , but canadian prime minister paul martin has said 500 soldiers will stay on after that period .
security fears rise after attacks the festive hand-over ceremony was marked by tight security following a recent wave of suicide bomb attacks which killed a canadian soldier in kabul last month and a british peacekeeper a day later .
the attacks , claimed by the taliban , came on the heels of a december suicide bombing in which five afghan security officials were killed in kabul .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaap de hoop scheffer earlier , jaap de hoop scheffer -lrb- photo -rrb- expressed concerns that the emergence of suicide bomb attacks on kabul peacekeepers showed that the capital was far from secure .
he called on the international community not to lose its focus on a nation still racked by violence , poverty and a booming drug trade .
" the situation is fragile , " de hoop scheffer told reporters aboard a u.s. military plane on his way to kabul .
" it ’ s extremely difficult to have a 100 percent defence against these horrible suicide attacks . ”
de hoop scheffer also underlined afghanistan ’ s importance for the military alliance .
" we now know that our future security , no matter where we are , is dependant on afghanistan ’ s security , " he said during the hand-over ceremony and warned that the international community needed to stay involved in afghanistan .
" the u.n. , the european union , japan and other important donors should stay fully committed to this country , " de hoop scheffer said .
" nato can provide security and stability , but the afghan people need housing and schooling and roofs over their heads . "
successes and challenges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lt-gen .
goetz f.e. gliemeroth , new commander of isaf , salutes as he arrives for the handover ceremony of commanding force from isaf to nato in kabul , afghanistan monday , aug .
11 , 2003 .
nato took command of the 5,000-strong international peacekeeping force in the afghan capital on monday , a historic move that marks the alliance 's first operation outside europe since it was created 54 years ago .
-lrb- ap photo / apichart weerawong -rrb- taking stock of germany ’ s isaf year , german general götz gliemeroth -lrb- photo -rrb- stressed that germany had notched up successes during its command of the isaf , most notably the smooth running of the loya jirga or the grand assembly that agreed on a new constitution for afghanistan in december .
he also said considerable progress was made in the program towards disarming some 10,000 militia in the country under germany ’ s leadership .
at the same time gliemeroth warned that the nexus between the local warlords who ran provincial private armies and the wealthy druglords posed one of the biggest threats to afghanistan ’ s future .
" deplorably we ’ re seeing a connection between this so-called warlordism , which means commanders who maintain armies for political reasons to exert pressure , and the funds that come from the drugs trade , " gliemeroth said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poppy farmer mohammad agha in afghanistan the general , who has suggested in the past that nato should tackle the issue even it meant violent conflicts with the drug mafia , insisted that cracking down on the flourishing drug trade should be made a priority .
" it ’ s a challenge that the international community must urgently take up .
i can only add that soldiers are the least appropriate means to combat the planting of opium and drug transport .
rather we need to set up the right structures in afghanistan and shore them with funds , " he said .
continuing commitment to afghanistan needed gliemeroth urged continuing engagement in the civil-military area .
he pointed towards the success of the first provincial reconstruction team -lrb- prt -rrb- in kunduz in northern afghanistan .
nato controls that area and the prt is involved in the reconstruction of hundreds of schools , hospitals , fountains and irrigation projects .
" i think our alliance partners have realized the central importance of such prts for the further development of afghanistan , " he said .
nato currently runs one prt , while the u.s-led force of 10,600 controls the remainder .
prts , whose members range from a few dozen to more than 200 , combine military and reconstruction roles in far-flung areas .
by next month there will be 13 prts across afghanistan .
nato ’ s peacekeeping force aims to set up five new teams over the next six months .
gliemeroth however warned that the situation in iraq shouldn ’ t be allowed to divert attention from afghanistan .
" currently , in all fairness to the situation in iraq , it has to be said that afghanistan has been largely overshadowed by the development there , " gliemeroth said .

it also tries to coax them back home when germany needs them .
" there are many doctors who we have found jobs for abroad , and now we have a shortage of qualified doctors here in germany .
we are now trying to encourage those german doctors and nurses spread across the european union to come back , " weber said .
science suffers every seventh person with a doctorate in science leaves germany for the united states , the scientist magazine has reported .
three of the four german nobel prize winners work in the united states .
" the trouble is that we are losing our highest achievers , " christoph anz of the confederation of german employers associations told the scientist .
" we have reached the point where we will no longer be able to compete in the booming biotechnology sector . "
gerd kempermann , a researcher in molecular medicine who has worked in the united states , says the work structure in other countries is often more attractive than in germany .
" the rules -lrb- in germany -rrb- do n't always fit everyone .
when someone realizes that they do n't fit into a certain formula then they begin to search for where their potential can be realized - where employers look to see what they can offer good employees . "
the most common complaints are that german research and development is under-funded and that institutes and universities are plagued by unwieldy bureaucracy .
" american universities offer scientists better pay conditions , more time for research and less time spent teaching , " said peter doermann , a research group leader at the max planck institute for molecular plant physiology near berlin .
some estimates say that scientists can earn three times as much money working in the united states compared to germany .
harming those who stay the brain drain can also hurt scientists working at home , doermann told deutsche welle .
" for me it 's a problem of collaboration , since the major players are in the u.s. there are some germans who were quite promising , and all of them went to the u.s. if you are below a critical number of people in a certain research area , you encounter problems applying for joint grants and european grants .
the german research foundation insists on only german research scientists , and if people leave there are n't enough left to collaborate , " he explained .
in an effort to reverse the trend , the german government last year said it would devote an extra € 100 million -lrb- $ 127 million -rrb- over the next four years to stimulate research and development in biotechnology in addition to the € 110 million already spent in the last three years .
announcing the package at the biotechnology day in leipzig in october , education and research minister edelgard bulmahn said the extra money would be directed to small- and medium-sized biotechnology companies .
gerd kempermann , for one , recently returned to germany to work at a local research clinic , but not because the conditions were better he said .
" they were for soft reasons , private reasons .
one ends up returning to where one comes from , " he explained .
kempermann is optimistic that despite the critical unemployment situation in the country - where 4.6 million people are registered jobless - the wealth of talent should encourage the public and private sector to invest in the human capital .
" i think that the motivation and the optimism will return quite quickly if a few fundamental conditions are changed .

" for me it 's a problem of collaboration , since the major players are in the u.s. there are some germans who were quite promising , and all of them went to the u.s. if you are below a critical number of people in a certain research area , you encounter problems applying for joint grants and european grants .
the german research foundation insists on only german research scientists , and if people leave there are n't enough left to collaborate , " he explained .
in an effort to reverse the trend , the german government last year said it would devote an extra € 100 million -lrb- $ 127 million -rrb- over the next four years to stimulate research and development in biotechnology in addition to the € 110 million already spent in the last three years .
announcing the package at the biotechnology day in leipzig in october , education and research minister edelgard bulmahn said the extra money would be directed to small- and medium-sized biotechnology companies .
gerd kempermann , for one , recently returned to germany to work at a local research clinic , but not because the conditions were better he said .
" they were for soft reasons , private reasons .
one ends up returning to where one comes from , " he explained .
kempermann is optimistic that despite the critical unemployment situation in the country - where 4.6 million people are registered jobless - the wealth of talent should encourage the public and private sector to invest in the human capital .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.02.2004 brain drain hurting germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these frankfurt students have n't left germany - yet germany 's brightest and best qualified young professionals are leaving the country in droves and securing lucrative positions abroad . educators are converging on cologne for europe 's largest education and training trade fair , which opened monday .
while german participants familiarize themselves with new methods , theories and teaching aids , the fruits of their labors continue to abandon ship .
after investing tens of thousands in education and training costs , germany is losing its best qualified professionals to better paid positions elsewhere , economists complain .
and the growing brain drain is compounding germany 's economic woes through the loss of skilled labor and human resources .
nearly 118,000 people packed up and left the country in 2002 for jobs abroad , the german statistical office reported .
mathis malchow is one of those who , along with his girlfriend , left germany for better prospects abroad .
" we just decided that we would try our luck in london , because it 's the only city that has the potential for growth , " the architect told deutsche welle .
malchow has indeed been lucky .
he has a job with the renowned british architect sir norman foster .
the highlight so far has been working on one of london 's most conspicuous new landmarks , the swiss re building , affectionately dubbed the " erotic gherkin " by locals .
malchow does n't regret leaving germany .
" it 's definitely been an enriching experience , " he said .
helping them to go , then urging them to come back besides the young professionals and academics who leave germany for work , young germans who have completed vocational training also have good chances of finding a job abroad .
eva-elisabeth weber , a job counselor at the central employment agency in bonn , noted that hoteliers , chefs , managers and mechanical engineers , in particular , have good career opportunities beyond germany .
each year the agency locates jobs for some 6,000 skilled laborers , professionals and managers outside of the country .
it also tries to coax them back home when germany needs them .
" there are many doctors who we have found jobs for abroad , and now we have a shortage of qualified doctors here in germany .
we are now trying to encourage those german doctors and nurses spread across the european union to come back , " weber said .
science suffers every seventh person with a doctorate in science leaves germany for the united states , the scientist magazine has reported .
three of the four german nobel prize winners work in the united states .
" the trouble is that we are losing our highest achievers , " christoph anz of the confederation of german employers associations told the scientist .
" we have reached the point where we will no longer be able to compete in the booming biotechnology sector . "
gerd kempermann , a researcher in molecular medicine who has worked in the united states , says the work structure in other countries is often more attractive than in germany .
" the rules -lrb- in germany -rrb- do n't always fit everyone .
when someone realizes that they do n't fit into a certain formula then they begin to search for where their potential can be realized - where employers look to see what they can offer good employees . "
the most common complaints are that german research and development is under-funded and that institutes and universities are plagued by unwieldy bureaucracy .
" american universities offer scientists better pay conditions , more time for research and less time spent teaching , " said peter doermann , a research group leader at the max planck institute for molecular plant physiology near berlin .
some estimates say that scientists can earn three times as much money working in the united states compared to germany .
harming those who stay the brain drain can also hurt scientists working at home , doermann told deutsche welle .
" for me it 's a problem of collaboration , since the major players are in the u.s. there are some germans who were quite promising , and all of them went to the u.s. if you are below a critical number of people in a certain research area , you encounter problems applying for joint grants and european grants .

after the parmalat fiasco , the italian government has taken steps to reform the country 's regulatory system .
but do the reforms go far enough , and how do they compare to those elsewhere in europe , including germany ? the italian cabinet has approved a draft law aimed at reforming italy 's regulatory system .
the law , which is still subject to parliamentary approval , is the first step towards changing a system which , in the eyes of many , failed to prevent the multi-billion dollar parmalat scandal .
but after months of political wrangling , the tough original version of the bill was watered down - and may be further diluted before it gets final parliamentary approval sometime in the next three months - raising doubts about the current italian government 's ability to impose better corporate governance and soothe investor anxieties .
elsewhere in europe , including germany , steps have been taken to prevent a parmalat or enron-style meltdown .
but are the safeguards sufficient ?
italian economy minister hopes for radical reform the law approved by the italian government last week was very different from the one proposed by italy 's economy minister giulio tremonti .
shortly after parmalat first made the news in december , tremonti called for shifting oversight authority away from the bank of italy and giving more power to the anti-trust authority and consab , the italian equivalent of the united states ' federal exchange commission -lrb- fec -rrb- .
those found guilty of financial fraud would also face longer prison terms .
in short , tremonti hoped to consolidate italy 's complicated regulatory system , which is comprised of five parts , each devoted to different types of business , into a three-pronged system .
italian politicians reluctant to make big changes but tremonti faced tough opposition from the country 's business-mogul prime minister silvio berlusconi and his allies , who feared that a harsh response would be bad for business .
" we do n't need to turn an exceptional event into a witch hunt , which would make the running of an insurance or financial company difficult , " said berlusconi .
as it turned out the draft law did not , as some had hoped , consolidate the various authorities .
instead it strengthened consob with greater sanctioning powers and the authority to oversee corporate bond issues .
not everyone , including tremonti , was convinced .
" we would have liked a radical reform , and now we risk introducing a reform that is n't very incisive , " he said .
the german path to reform in an interview with deutsche welle , marco becht , the executive director of the european corporate governance institute and a professor of finance and economics at the university of brussels , points to the complexity of the issue .
" sometimes it is a case of management without enough shareholder oversight , as was the case with enron , and sometimes it is a case of a very powerful shareholder getting up to something , as was the case with parmalat , " he said .
" the tools you need in each of these situations is slightly different , " he added .
given the complexity of the task at hand , and the increasing complexity of multi-national corporations engaged in different types of business , what 's a government - say the one in berlin - to do ?
tremonti 's approach , consolidating various oversight authorities into a more cooperative powerful single entity , is an approach that has proven popular elsewhere in europe , according to ernst maug , a professor of business administration at humboldt university in berlin .
germany did so in 2002 , consolidating various regulatory agencies into bafin , the federal agency responsible for overseeing the entire financial sector .
" this seems to be the trend and makes a lot of sense to me , " maug told deutsche welle .
" it does n't make sense to have different regulatory agencies overseeing different sectors just because one security is called a stock and another a bond ; when you have one authority you have a better chance of catching things . "
what 's more , also in 2002 , the german corporate governance code , also known as the " kodex , " was implemented .
this code of " best practices " is not legally binding , but companies are now required to disclose in their annual reports the extent to which they comply with the code and explain opt-outs .
a german parmalat ?
these measures by no means guarantee that a corporate scandal like parmalat or enron wo n't happen in germany .
" could it happen here - yes , " says maug .
you will never have a system where everyone complies with the law all the time , he points out , and reducing these scandals to zero is not an option , since the resulting regulation could prove too costly for business .
brecht concurs .
" there is always a trade-off in trying to prevent the next parmalat from happening and restricting executives from being able to do business , " he says .
" with regulation , you have to do a cost-benefit analysis . "
in the meantime , governments in europe and the world over continue to debate how to strike the best balance . kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de how to say " enron " in italian casting new doubt on european corporate governance , leading italian food group parmalat announced last week the firm had a € 4-billion discrepancy in its books .

after the parmalat fiasco , the italian government has taken steps to reform the country 's regulatory system .
but do the reforms go far enough , and how do they compare to those elsewhere in europe , including germany ? the italian cabinet has approved a draft law aimed at reforming italy 's regulatory system .
the law , which is still subject to parliamentary approval , is the first step towards changing a system which , in the eyes of many , failed to prevent the multi-billion dollar parmalat scandal .
but after months of political wrangling , the tough original version of the bill was watered down - and may be further diluted before it gets final parliamentary approval sometime in the next three months - raising doubts about the current italian government 's ability to impose better corporate governance and soothe investor anxieties .
elsewhere in europe , including germany , steps have been taken to prevent a parmalat or enron-style meltdown .
but are the safeguards sufficient ?
italian economy minister hopes for radical reform the law approved by the italian government last week was very different from the one proposed by italy 's economy minister giulio tremonti .
shortly after parmalat first made the news in december , tremonti called for shifting oversight authority away from the bank of italy and giving more power to the anti-trust authority and consab , the italian equivalent of the united states ' federal exchange commission -lrb- fec -rrb- .
those found guilty of financial fraud would also face longer prison terms .
in short , tremonti hoped to consolidate italy 's complicated regulatory system , which is comprised of five parts , each devoted to different types of business , into a three-pronged system .
italian politicians reluctant to make big changes but tremonti faced tough opposition from the country 's business-mogul prime minister silvio berlusconi and his allies , who feared that a harsh response would be bad for business .
" we do n't need to turn an exceptional event into a witch hunt , which would make the running of an insurance or financial company difficult , " said berlusconi .
as it turned out the draft law did not , as some had hoped , consolidate the various authorities .
instead it strengthened consob with greater sanctioning powers and the authority to oversee corporate bond issues .
not everyone , including tremonti , was convinced .
" we would have liked a radical reform , and now we risk introducing a reform that is n't very incisive , " he said .
the german path to reform in an interview with deutsche welle , marco becht , the executive director of the european corporate governance institute and a professor of finance and economics at the university of brussels , points to the complexity of the issue .
" sometimes it is a case of management without enough shareholder oversight , as was the case with enron , and sometimes it is a case of a very powerful shareholder getting up to something , as was the case with parmalat , " he said .
" the tools you need in each of these situations is slightly different , " he added .
given the complexity of the task at hand , and the increasing complexity of multi-national corporations engaged in different types of business , what 's a government - say the one in berlin - to do ?
tremonti 's approach , consolidating various oversight authorities into a more cooperative powerful single entity , is an approach that has proven popular elsewhere in europe , according to ernst maug , a professor of business administration at humboldt university in berlin .
germany did so in 2002 , consolidating various regulatory agencies into bafin , the federal agency responsible for overseeing the entire financial sector .
" this seems to be the trend and makes a lot of sense to me , " maug told deutsche welle .
" it does n't make sense to have different regulatory agencies overseeing different sectors just because one security is called a stock and another a bond ; when you have one authority you have a better chance of catching things . "
what 's more , also in 2002 , the german corporate governance code , also known as the " kodex , " was implemented .
this code of " best practices " is not legally binding , but companies are now required to disclose in their annual reports the extent to which they comply with the code and explain opt-outs .
a german parmalat ?
these measures by no means guarantee that a corporate scandal like parmalat or enron wo n't happen in germany .
" could it happen here - yes , " says maug .
you will never have a system where everyone complies with the law all the time , he points out , and reducing these scandals to zero is not an option , since the resulting regulation could prove too costly for business .
brecht concurs .
" there is always a trade-off in trying to prevent the next parmalat from happening and restricting executives from being able to do business , " he says .

german general götz gliemeroth handed over command of the nato-led peacekeeping force in afghanistan to canada on monday amid fresh security concerns following an emergence of suicide bomb attacks . after a year of steering the 6,420-strong multinational international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- charged with overseeing security in the afghan capital , german nato general goetz gliemeroth handed over the reins to canadian general rick hillier on monday .
the canadian troops with 2,000 soldiers make up the largest contingent of the nato-led isaf force .
it ’ s unclear how long they will remain in afghanistan .
the canadian contingent is expected to end its deployment in august , but canadian prime minister paul martin has said 500 soldiers will stay on after that period .
security fears rise after attacks the festive hand-over ceremony was marked by tight security following a recent wave of suicide bomb attacks which killed a canadian soldier in kabul last month and a british peacekeeper a day later .
the attacks , claimed by the taliban , came on the heels of a december suicide bombing in which five afghan security officials were killed in kabul .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaap de hoop scheffer earlier , jaap de hoop scheffer -lrb- photo -rrb- expressed concerns that the emergence of suicide bomb attacks on kabul peacekeepers showed that the capital was far from secure .
he called on the international community not to lose its focus on a nation still racked by violence , poverty and a booming drug trade .
" the situation is fragile , " de hoop scheffer told reporters aboard a u.s. military plane on his way to kabul .
" it ’ s extremely difficult to have a 100 percent defence against these horrible suicide attacks . ”
de hoop scheffer also underlined afghanistan ’ s importance for the military alliance .
" we now know that our future security , no matter where we are , is dependant on afghanistan ’ s security , " he said during the hand-over ceremony and warned that the international community needed to stay involved in afghanistan .
" the u.n. , the european union , japan and other important donors should stay fully committed to this country , " de hoop scheffer said .
" nato can provide security and stability , but the afghan people need housing and schooling and roofs over their heads . "

goetz f.e. gliemeroth , new commander of isaf , salutes as he arrives for the handover ceremony of commanding force from isaf to nato in kabul , afghanistan monday , aug .
11 , 2003 .
nato took command of the 5,000-strong international peacekeeping force in the afghan capital on monday , a historic move that marks the alliance 's first operation outside europe since it was created 54 years ago .
-lrb- ap photo / apichart weerawong -rrb- taking stock of germany ’ s isaf year , german general götz gliemeroth -lrb- photo -rrb- stressed that germany had notched up successes during its command of the isaf , most notably the smooth running of the loya jirga or the grand assembly that agreed on a new constitution for afghanistan in december .
he also said considerable progress was made in the program towards disarming some 10,000 militia in the country under germany ’ s leadership .
at the same time gliemeroth warned that the nexus between the local warlords who ran provincial private armies and the wealthy druglords posed one of the biggest threats to afghanistan ’ s future .
" deplorably we ’ re seeing a connection between this so-called warlordism , which means commanders who maintain armies for political reasons to exert pressure , and the funds that come from the drugs trade , " gliemeroth said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poppy farmer mohammad agha in afghanistan the general , who has suggested in the past that nato should tackle the issue even it meant violent conflicts with the drug mafia , insisted that cracking down on the flourishing drug trade should be made a priority .
" it ’ s a challenge that the international community must urgently take up .
i can only add that soldiers are the least appropriate means to combat the planting of opium and drug transport .
rather we need to set up the right structures in afghanistan and shore them with funds , " he said .
continuing commitment to afghanistan needed gliemeroth urged continuing engagement in the civil-military area .
he pointed towards the success of the first provincial reconstruction team -lrb- prt -rrb- in kunduz in northern afghanistan .
nato controls that area and the prt is involved in the reconstruction of hundreds of schools , hospitals , fountains and irrigation projects .
" i think our alliance partners have realized the central importance of such prts for the further development of afghanistan , " he said .
nato currently runs one prt , while the u.s-led force of 10,600 controls the remainder .
prts , whose members range from a few dozen to more than 200 , combine military and reconstruction roles in far-flung areas .
by next month there will be 13 prts across afghanistan .
nato ’ s peacekeeping force aims to set up five new teams over the next six months .
gliemeroth however warned that the situation in iraq shouldn ’ t be allowed to divert attention from afghanistan .
" currently , in all fairness to the situation in iraq , it has to be said that afghanistan has been largely overshadowed by the development there , " gliemeroth said .
" but i think the international community owes this land -lrb- afghanistan -rrb- a great deal .

nato took command of the 5,000-strong international peacekeeping force in the afghan capital on monday , a historic move that marks the alliance 's first operation outside europe since it was created 54 years ago .

he also said considerable progress was made in the program towards disarming some 10,000 militia in the country under germany ’ s leadership .
at the same time gliemeroth warned that the nexus between the local warlords who ran provincial private armies and the wealthy druglords posed one of the biggest threats to afghanistan ’ s future .

german general götz gliemeroth handed over command of the nato-led peacekeeping force in afghanistan to canada on monday amid fresh security concerns following an emergence of suicide bomb attacks . after a year of steering the 6,420-strong multinational international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- charged with overseeing security in the afghan capital , german nato general goetz gliemeroth handed over the reins to canadian general rick hillier on monday .
the canadian troops with 2,000 soldiers make up the largest contingent of the nato-led isaf force .
it ’ s unclear how long they will remain in afghanistan .
the canadian contingent is expected to end its deployment in august , but canadian prime minister paul martin has said 500 soldiers will stay on after that period .
security fears rise after attacks the festive hand-over ceremony was marked by tight security following a recent wave of suicide bomb attacks which killed a canadian soldier in kabul last month and a british peacekeeper a day later .
the attacks , claimed by the taliban , came on the heels of a december suicide bombing in which five afghan security officials were killed in kabul .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaap de hoop scheffer earlier , jaap de hoop scheffer -lrb- photo -rrb- expressed concerns that the emergence of suicide bomb attacks on kabul peacekeepers showed that the capital was far from secure .
he called on the international community not to lose its focus on a nation still racked by violence , poverty and a booming drug trade .
" the situation is fragile , " de hoop scheffer told reporters aboard a u.s. military plane on his way to kabul .
" it ’ s extremely difficult to have a 100 percent defence against these horrible suicide attacks . ”
de hoop scheffer also underlined afghanistan ’ s importance for the military alliance .
" we now know that our future security , no matter where we are , is dependant on afghanistan ’ s security , " he said during the hand-over ceremony and warned that the international community needed to stay involved in afghanistan .
" the u.n. , the european union , japan and other important donors should stay fully committed to this country , " de hoop scheffer said .
" nato can provide security and stability , but the afghan people need housing and schooling and roofs over their heads . "

as nature awakes from the harsh winter and blossoms begin to change the barren land , the opium poppy sleeps on .
a few months later , the fields will be full with beautiful red flowers . then the harvest begins ; the poppies are mowed and in the weeks that follow , the product that these plants hold within will hit the streets of western cities in the form of powder sold in small plastic bags . in an attempt to stop the tide of afghan heroin flooding european cities , politicians and representatives of international organizations have been meeting in kabul to discuss strategies to counter the country ’ s drug cultivation industry . britain and us favor burning fields bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but while the experts are united in their cause to stamp out the scourge of afghan heroin crossing their borders , there are conflicting views on what the best action is .
britain , which was given the role of stamping out afghanistan ’ s drug output at the bonn conference shortly after the fall of the taliban regime , is in favor of burning the poppy fields and destroying the drug labs . considered harsh by many , the united states supports such a " slash and burn " tactic . however , german experts wish to pursue alternative solutions .
“ these repressive measures do not correspond to our plan of lasting development , ” said christoph berg , project manager of the drugs and development scheme of the german society for technical cooperation -lrb- gtz -rrb- , in an interview with deutsche welle .
“ we want to show the farmers that there are alternatives to opium growing . ” farmers would prefer alternative income bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the warlords control their own areas and profit from the local crop .
research carried out by the gtz shows that the cultivation of wheat , wine , fruit or spices could well replace the production of heroin as a source of making a living for afghans .
" we have spoken with farmers .
many would stop growing opium if they could survive by producing other products , ” said berg , adding that all production of opium is illegal in afghanistan . the gtz experts in kabul form a part of a project investigating " drug control connected to development , " an eu supported initiative which is being funded by the bloc to the tune of € 9 million over the next three years .
the project intends to start the process of replacing the drug economy at the very roots by working with schools and health centers in the eastern provinces of laghman , kunar and nangarhar and to set up and strengthen alternative agricultural cooperatives . gtz must convince profiting warlords bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr soldiers on patrol in afghanistan .
the project will last for at least 10 to 15 years , according to berg , and it will take at least that long before the first successes becomes visible in the fight against drugs .
not everybody is so eager to cooperate .
“ we must also try to include the local warlords and work constructively with them , ” said berg .
the warlords profit from the drug business and the afghan economy relies heavily on it while there is little alternative .
convincing some of the benefits of other crops will take time . but the german focus is on a peaceful and progressive campaign against the drug trade emanating from afghanistan .
the military has also taken a non-aggressive stance on the opium business , especially as the bundeswehr attempts to win over the hearts and minds of the afghan people through its reconstruction efforts . germany rules out military intervention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heroin is a problem in most european cities .
the soldiers of the regional reconstruction team -lrb- prt -rrb- in the northern afghan city of kunduz are operating in one of the most opium rich areas of the country .
however , the german parliament only agreed the deployment of the force outside the relative safety of the international assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- mission in kabul on the condition that the 220 soldiers of the prt keep out of the fight with the drug barons . but despite the plans of the gtz and the resolution of the bundeswehr , the fight against the poppy growers and cultivators will go on as british and u.s. forces continue to target a way of life that not only provides their enemies with funds to fight on but also takes the war to the streets of their home nations . harvests improving every year according to the united nations , 2003 saw afghanistan ’ s second-best harvest ever registered : 3,600 metric tons of opium , material for 360 metric tons of heroin was produced last year .

as nature awakes from the harsh winter and blossoms begin to change the barren land , the opium poppy sleeps on .
a few months later , the fields will be full with beautiful red flowers . then the harvest begins ; the poppies are mowed and in the weeks that follow , the product that these plants hold within will hit the streets of western cities in the form of powder sold in small plastic bags . in an attempt to stop the tide of afghan heroin flooding european cities , politicians and representatives of international organizations have been meeting in kabul to discuss strategies to counter the country ’ s drug cultivation industry . britain and us favor burning fields bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but while the experts are united in their cause to stamp out the scourge of afghan heroin crossing their borders , there are conflicting views on what the best action is .
britain , which was given the role of stamping out afghanistan ’ s drug output at the bonn conference shortly after the fall of the taliban regime , is in favor of burning the poppy fields and destroying the drug labs . considered harsh by many , the united states supports such a " slash and burn " tactic . however , german experts wish to pursue alternative solutions .
“ these repressive measures do not correspond to our plan of lasting development , ” said christoph berg , project manager of the drugs and development scheme of the german society for technical cooperation -lrb- gtz -rrb- , in an interview with deutsche welle .
“ we want to show the farmers that there are alternatives to opium growing . ” farmers would prefer alternative income bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the warlords control their own areas and profit from the local crop .
research carried out by the gtz shows that the cultivation of wheat , wine , fruit or spices could well replace the production of heroin as a source of making a living for afghans .
" we have spoken with farmers .
many would stop growing opium if they could survive by producing other products , ” said berg , adding that all production of opium is illegal in afghanistan . the gtz experts in kabul form a part of a project investigating " drug control connected to development , " an eu supported initiative which is being funded by the bloc to the tune of € 9 million over the next three years .
the project intends to start the process of replacing the drug economy at the very roots by working with schools and health centers in the eastern provinces of laghman , kunar and nangarhar and to set up and strengthen alternative agricultural cooperatives . gtz must convince profiting warlords bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr soldiers on patrol in afghanistan .
the project will last for at least 10 to 15 years , according to berg , and it will take at least that long before the first successes becomes visible in the fight against drugs .
not everybody is so eager to cooperate .
“ we must also try to include the local warlords and work constructively with them , ” said berg .
the warlords profit from the drug business and the afghan economy relies heavily on it while there is little alternative .
convincing some of the benefits of other crops will take time . but the german focus is on a peaceful and progressive campaign against the drug trade emanating from afghanistan .

after the parmalat fiasco , the italian government has taken steps to reform the country 's regulatory system .
but do the reforms go far enough , and how do they compare to those elsewhere in europe , including germany ? the italian cabinet has approved a draft law aimed at reforming italy 's regulatory system .
the law , which is still subject to parliamentary approval , is the first step towards changing a system which , in the eyes of many , failed to prevent the multi-billion dollar parmalat scandal .
but after months of political wrangling , the tough original version of the bill was watered down - and may be further diluted before it gets final parliamentary approval sometime in the next three months - raising doubts about the current italian government 's ability to impose better corporate governance and soothe investor anxieties .
elsewhere in europe , including germany , steps have been taken to prevent a parmalat or enron-style meltdown .
but are the safeguards sufficient ?
italian economy minister hopes for radical reform the law approved by the italian government last week was very different from the one proposed by italy 's economy minister giulio tremonti .
shortly after parmalat first made the news in december , tremonti called for shifting oversight authority away from the bank of italy and giving more power to the anti-trust authority and consab , the italian equivalent of the united states ' federal exchange commission -lrb- fec -rrb- .
those found guilty of financial fraud would also face longer prison terms .
in short , tremonti hoped to consolidate italy 's complicated regulatory system , which is comprised of five parts , each devoted to different types of business , into a three-pronged system .
italian politicians reluctant to make big changes but tremonti faced tough opposition from the country 's business-mogul prime minister silvio berlusconi and his allies , who feared that a harsh response would be bad for business .
" we do n't need to turn an exceptional event into a witch hunt , which would make the running of an insurance or financial company difficult , " said berlusconi .
as it turned out the draft law did not , as some had hoped , consolidate the various authorities .
instead it strengthened consob with greater sanctioning powers and the authority to oversee corporate bond issues .
not everyone , including tremonti , was convinced .
" we would have liked a radical reform , and now we risk introducing a reform that is n't very incisive , " he said .
the german path to reform in an interview with deutsche welle , marco becht , the executive director of the european corporate governance institute and a professor of finance and economics at the university of brussels , points to the complexity of the issue .
" sometimes it is a case of management without enough shareholder oversight , as was the case with enron , and sometimes it is a case of a very powerful shareholder getting up to something , as was the case with parmalat , " he said .
" the tools you need in each of these situations is slightly different , " he added .
given the complexity of the task at hand , and the increasing complexity of multi-national corporations engaged in different types of business , what 's a government - say the one in berlin - to do ?
tremonti 's approach , consolidating various oversight authorities into a more cooperative powerful single entity , is an approach that has proven popular elsewhere in europe , according to ernst maug , a professor of business administration at humboldt university in berlin .
germany did so in 2002 , consolidating various regulatory agencies into bafin , the federal agency responsible for overseeing the entire financial sector .
" this seems to be the trend and makes a lot of sense to me , " maug told deutsche welle .
" it does n't make sense to have different regulatory agencies overseeing different sectors just because one security is called a stock and another a bond ; when you have one authority you have a better chance of catching things . "
what 's more , also in 2002 , the german corporate governance code , also known as the " kodex , " was implemented .
this code of " best practices " is not legally binding , but companies are now required to disclose in their annual reports the extent to which they comply with the code and explain opt-outs .
a german parmalat ?
these measures by no means guarantee that a corporate scandal like parmalat or enron wo n't happen in germany .
" could it happen here - yes , " says maug .
you will never have a system where everyone complies with the law all the time , he points out , and reducing these scandals to zero is not an option , since the resulting regulation could prove too costly for business .
brecht concurs .
" there is always a trade-off in trying to prevent the next parmalat from happening and restricting executives from being able to do business , " he says .
" with regulation , you have to do a cost-benefit analysis . "

" it does n't make sense to have different regulatory agencies overseeing different sectors just because one security is called a stock and another a bond ; when you have one authority you have a better chance of catching things . "
what 's more , also in 2002 , the german corporate governance code , also known as the " kodex , " was implemented .
this code of " best practices " is not legally binding , but companies are now required to disclose in their annual reports the extent to which they comply with the code and explain opt-outs .
a german parmalat ?
these measures by no means guarantee that a corporate scandal like parmalat or enron wo n't happen in germany .
" could it happen here - yes , " says maug .
you will never have a system where everyone complies with the law all the time , he points out , and reducing these scandals to zero is not an option , since the resulting regulation could prove too costly for business .
brecht concurs .
" there is always a trade-off in trying to prevent the next parmalat from happening and restricting executives from being able to do business , " he says .
" with regulation , you have to do a cost-benefit analysis . "
in the meantime , governments in europe and the world over continue to debate how to strike the best balance . kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de how to say " enron " in italian casting new doubt on european corporate governance , leading italian food group parmalat announced last week the firm had a € 4-billion discrepancy in its books .

after his resignation as social democratic party chairman on friday , german chancellor gerhard schröder on saturday named his likely successors , who he hopes will bring the party together on difficult reforms . these are days of surprise in the corridors of the germany ’ s governing party , the social democrats .
few had any idea on friday morning that chancellor gerhard schröder would resign from his post as head of the social democratic party and hand the reins over to franz müntefering , the party ’ s parliamentary group chairman .
then , on saturday , he named a successor for the party 's luckless general secretary , olaf scholz .
" on march 21 , the spd is going to call a special party conference , " schröder told reporters saturday .
" the party executive will unanimously nominate franz müntefering as its new party chairman .
and the party executive will also nominate klaus uwe benneter as the spd ’ s new general secretary with the same number of votes . "
a new deputy 56-year-old lawyer benneter , also a member of the german parliament , the bundestag , is also a close friend of schröder .
during the turbulent 70s , the two were active together in the spd ’ s young socialists at a time when the spd ’ s youth group had taken an extreme left political course .
at one point , benneter was even temporarily banned from the party because he had spoken out in favor of cooperation with communists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus-uwe benneter today ’ s an altogether different story .
these days , benneter -lrb- photo -rrb- calls for deep cuts into germany ’ s social system , for reforms of the labor market and public healthcare system – all initiatives that have drawn heavy criticism from the social democrats ’ party base and voters .
together , benneter and müntefering are expected to bring the party ’ s traditional leftist core into line with the government ’ s planned reforms .
müntefering calls for broad party debate on reforms müntefering said saturday he wanted to speak clear language about " equitableness , " one of the core principles of european social democratic movements . " that ’ s not just a saying , " müntefering said , " rather , it is something that has always been a deep part of this party ’ s history .
whoever speaks of ‘ equitableness ’ has to start with equal opportunities .
and they have to start with the fact that that is not functioning in the scope that we desire .
we ’ ve spoken of our solid determination to create a situation where young people in this country aren ’ t able to fall from school desk to the unemployment rolls .
the situation can ’ t stay as it is . "
speaking on a handful of german public broadcasting stations on saturday , müntefering said he wants to involve the party in the government ’ s reform policies more than in the past , admitting to ard that the reform policy negotiations within the party had been " suboptimal . "
in the future , he said reforms needed to be prepared more " cautiously . "
in an interview with zdf , he said he intended to open an intensive debate within the party about planned reforms while at the same time standing shoulder to shoulder with the government .
a deft political move ?
the first reactions coming out of the party this weekend suggest schröder made a deft political move by resigning from his position as party chairman .
the chancellor made clear on saturday that the party reins would soon be tightened , and that even in his cabinet there was no breathing room left for error .
in other words : controversial members of the cabinet , like transport minister manfred stolpe who has overseen the trouble-plagued implementation of tolls for heavy trucks and transports on germany highways , are now on probation . indeed , in recent weeks the pages of germany 's top newspapers and magazines have been filled with speculation of a possible shakeup of schröder 's cabinet .
schröder said the party needed to put its collective energy toward the different tasks required for safeguarding and implementing the reform process .
opposition : spd falling apart the minority opposition , neo-liberal free democratic party immediately criticized benneter ’ s nomination , lambasting the move as a signal that the spd is shifting to the left .
and dieter althaus of the christian democratic union said that the decision by the spd to appoint a relatively unknown politician to the position of general secretary showed how difficult it had become for the party to find leaders .
earlier , cdu chairwoman angela merkel and the head of the cdu ’ s bavarian sister party , the christian social union , edmund stoiber , both said schröder ’ s resignation marked the " beginning of the end " of the party . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder leaves an unloved post by quitting as the head of the social democratic party on friday , gerhard schröder left an office he hardly loved .

after his resignation as social democratic party chairman on friday , german chancellor gerhard schröder on saturday named his likely successors , who he hopes will bring the party together on difficult reforms . these are days of surprise in the corridors of the germany ’ s governing party , the social democrats .
few had any idea on friday morning that chancellor gerhard schröder would resign from his post as head of the social democratic party and hand the reins over to franz müntefering , the party ’ s parliamentary group chairman .
then , on saturday , he named a successor for the party 's luckless general secretary , olaf scholz .
" on march 21 , the spd is going to call a special party conference , " schröder told reporters saturday .
" the party executive will unanimously nominate franz müntefering as its new party chairman .
and the party executive will also nominate klaus uwe benneter as the spd ’ s new general secretary with the same number of votes . "
a new deputy 56-year-old lawyer benneter , also a member of the german parliament , the bundestag , is also a close friend of schröder .
during the turbulent 70s , the two were active together in the spd ’ s young socialists at a time when the spd ’ s youth group had taken an extreme left political course .

as nature awakes from the harsh winter and blossoms begin to change the barren land , the opium poppy sleeps on .
a few months later , the fields will be full with beautiful red flowers . then the harvest begins ; the poppies are mowed and in the weeks that follow , the product that these plants hold within will hit the streets of western cities in the form of powder sold in small plastic bags . in an attempt to stop the tide of afghan heroin flooding european cities , politicians and representatives of international organizations have been meeting in kabul to discuss strategies to counter the country ’ s drug cultivation industry . britain and us favor burning fields bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but while the experts are united in their cause to stamp out the scourge of afghan heroin crossing their borders , there are conflicting views on what the best action is .
britain , which was given the role of stamping out afghanistan ’ s drug output at the bonn conference shortly after the fall of the taliban regime , is in favor of burning the poppy fields and destroying the drug labs . considered harsh by many , the united states supports such a " slash and burn " tactic . however , german experts wish to pursue alternative solutions .
“ these repressive measures do not correspond to our plan of lasting development , ” said christoph berg , project manager of the drugs and development scheme of the german society for technical cooperation -lrb- gtz -rrb- , in an interview with deutsche welle .
“ we want to show the farmers that there are alternatives to opium growing . ” farmers would prefer alternative income bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the warlords control their own areas and profit from the local crop .
research carried out by the gtz shows that the cultivation of wheat , wine , fruit or spices could well replace the production of heroin as a source of making a living for afghans .
" we have spoken with farmers .
many would stop growing opium if they could survive by producing other products , ” said berg , adding that all production of opium is illegal in afghanistan . the gtz experts in kabul form a part of a project investigating " drug control connected to development , " an eu supported initiative which is being funded by the bloc to the tune of € 9 million over the next three years .
the project intends to start the process of replacing the drug economy at the very roots by working with schools and health centers in the eastern provinces of laghman , kunar and nangarhar and to set up and strengthen alternative agricultural cooperatives . gtz must convince profiting warlords bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr soldiers on patrol in afghanistan .

not everybody is so eager to cooperate .
“ we must also try to include the local warlords and work constructively with them , ” said berg .
the warlords profit from the drug business and the afghan economy relies heavily on it while there is little alternative .
convincing some of the benefits of other crops will take time . but the german focus is on a peaceful and progressive campaign against the drug trade emanating from afghanistan .

the soldiers of the regional reconstruction team -lrb- prt -rrb- in the northern afghan city of kunduz are operating in one of the most opium rich areas of the country .
however , the german parliament only agreed the deployment of the force outside the relative safety of the international assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- mission in kabul on the condition that the 220 soldiers of the prt keep out of the fight with the drug barons . but despite the plans of the gtz and the resolution of the bundeswehr , the fight against the poppy growers and cultivators will go on as british and u.s. forces continue to target a way of life that not only provides their enemies with funds to fight on but also takes the war to the streets of their home nations . harvests improving every year according to the united nations , 2003 saw afghanistan ’ s second-best harvest ever registered : 3,600 metric tons of opium , material for 360 metric tons of heroin was produced last year .

britain , which was given the role of stamping out afghanistan ’ s drug output at the bonn conference shortly after the fall of the taliban regime , is in favor of burning the poppy fields and destroying the drug labs . considered harsh by many , the united states supports such a " slash and burn " tactic . however , german experts wish to pursue alternative solutions .
“ these repressive measures do not correspond to our plan of lasting development , ” said christoph berg , project manager of the drugs and development scheme of the german society for technical cooperation -lrb- gtz -rrb- , in an interview with deutsche welle .

not everybody is so eager to cooperate .
“ we must also try to include the local warlords and work constructively with them , ” said berg .
the warlords profit from the drug business and the afghan economy relies heavily on it while there is little alternative .
convincing some of the benefits of other crops will take time . but the german focus is on a peaceful and progressive campaign against the drug trade emanating from afghanistan .

the soldiers of the regional reconstruction team -lrb- prt -rrb- in the northern afghan city of kunduz are operating in one of the most opium rich areas of the country .
however , the german parliament only agreed the deployment of the force outside the relative safety of the international assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- mission in kabul on the condition that the 220 soldiers of the prt keep out of the fight with the drug barons . but despite the plans of the gtz and the resolution of the bundeswehr , the fight against the poppy growers and cultivators will go on as british and u.s. forces continue to target a way of life that not only provides their enemies with funds to fight on but also takes the war to the streets of their home nations . harvests improving every year according to the united nations , 2003 saw afghanistan ’ s second-best harvest ever registered : 3,600 metric tons of opium , material for 360 metric tons of heroin was produced last year .

mikhail gorbachev … helmut kohl … david hasselhoff .
no , do not adjust your screens .
the list of those who contributed to the fall of the berlin wall and the end of communism has long been missing one name … until now . it was one of the defining moments of the twentieth century .
not only did it come to represent the collapse of the soviet union , the end of the communist dream and the concluding drama of the cold war , the fall of the berlin wall must also be remembered as the moment a nation that had been divided for 28 years came together .
thank you , david hasselhoff . excuse me ?
david hasselhoff ?
the man who made talking cars every small boy ’ s dream and scantily-clad , surgically enhanced beauties running in slow motion every teenage boy ’ s fantasy ?
surely the actor-slash-singer responsible for immortalizing such screen idols as michael knight and mitch buchannon can ’ t be accredited with bringing down a superpower and reuniting germany . well , according to the man himself , hasselhoff does indeed feel that he played his part in bringing about the fall of the berlin wall and aiding the reunification of east and west germany .
and not through some heroic spy chase across communist berlin at the wheel of his trusty car kitt or a daring rescue involving pamela anderson and a defecting russian diplomat in a thong .
no , hasselhoff believes his contribution came about through the unifying and healing power of his music . cover version caught the moment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after recording an english language cover version of the 1970s german hit , “ auf der strasse nach suden ” and renaming it “ looking for freedom , ” hasselhoff raced up the charts in the late summer of 1989 , just as a tide of revolution began rolling through eastern europe . the soft rock god had sublimely caught the moment by crooning the stirring lyrics : " i 've been lookin ' for freedom ; i 've been lookin ' so long ; i 've been lookin ' for freedom ; still the search goes on . "
and as a result , after spending several weeks at number one , the song became the anthem of some of those struggling to reconcile the broken nation . even as the hammers began to fall on the symbol of division , hasselhoff ’ s music was omnipresent ; the album of the same name was also germany ’ s best selling long player of the time , keeping less important records off the top spot for three months . freedom found bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " david , we love you ! "
at last , all those germans who had been looking for freedom eventually found it as the wall finally crumbled on november 9 , 1989 , allowing thousands of east germans to flood into west berlin to be reunited with loved ones and to buy long-forbidden albums from hasselhoff ’ s musical back catalogue . there was even a moment when the reunited country joined together to thank the man who had provided the soundtrack to such historic change .
after being invited to headline a new year ’ s eve concert at the brandenburg gate by former german chancellor helmut kohl , the people ’ s champion finally got his chance to deliver his song in person to an audience of almost a million reunited germans . playing to an audience of united germans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it was the first time germany had been unified , and close to a million east and west german fans stood together in the freezing cold at midnight watching me perform .
i was overcome with emotion , " he recalled in an interview with german magazine tv spielfilm . but official recognition evaded him .
“ i am a little bit sad that no photo of me hangs in the checkpoint charlie museum in berlin , ” he added with regret after his contribution to reunification failed to make it into the berlin wall commemorative exhibition at the former border crossing . museum missing hero 's portrait bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : checkpoint charlie .
but how can this be ?
surely a man who mobilized a divided nation , a man whose voice was the catalyst for revolution , should be honoured for his role in changing the world as many knew it back then . but the checkpoint charlie museum in berlin is n't quite convinced of the singer 's historical significance .
“ what did he do ? ” wondered the museum 's spokesperson when dw-world questioned why hasselhoff was not included in the hall of fame .
“ we didn ’ t know the song was that important .
we like mr. hasselhoff but there are no documents that record his role in the fall of the berlin wall . ” “ we do have a picture of roger moore as james bond though , ” the spokesperson offered up as a gesture to international stardom . and so , while a fictional spy is lauded for his work in promoting berlin , david hasselhoff must be content with making the next generation of germans whole again through his music . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de where 's the berlin wall ?
in the past few years , berlin has rushed to preserve the remaining remants of its wall - the ultimate cold war symbol - for the sake of history and curious tourists .

not only did it come to represent the collapse of the soviet union , the end of the communist dream and the concluding drama of the cold war , the fall of the berlin wall must also be remembered as the moment a nation that had been divided for 28 years came together .
thank you , david hasselhoff . excuse me ?
david hasselhoff ?
the man who made talking cars every small boy ’ s dream and scantily-clad , surgically enhanced beauties running in slow motion every teenage boy ’ s fantasy ?
surely the actor-slash-singer responsible for immortalizing such screen idols as michael knight and mitch buchannon can ’ t be accredited with bringing down a superpower and reuniting germany . well , according to the man himself , hasselhoff does indeed feel that he played his part in bringing about the fall of the berlin wall and aiding the reunification of east and west germany .
and not through some heroic spy chase across communist berlin at the wheel of his trusty car kitt or a daring rescue involving pamela anderson and a defecting russian diplomat in a thong .
no , hasselhoff believes his contribution came about through the unifying and healing power of his music . cover version caught the moment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after recording an english language cover version of the 1970s german hit , “ auf der strasse nach suden ” and renaming it “ looking for freedom , ” hasselhoff raced up the charts in the late summer of 1989 , just as a tide of revolution began rolling through eastern europe . the soft rock god had sublimely caught the moment by crooning the stirring lyrics : " i 've been lookin ' for freedom ; i 've been lookin ' so long ; i 've been lookin ' for freedom ; still the search goes on . "
and as a result , after spending several weeks at number one , the song became the anthem of some of those struggling to reconcile the broken nation . even as the hammers began to fall on the symbol of division , hasselhoff ’ s music was omnipresent ; the album of the same name was also germany ’ s best selling long player of the time , keeping less important records off the top spot for three months . freedom found bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " david , we love you ! "
at last , all those germans who had been looking for freedom eventually found it as the wall finally crumbled on november 9 , 1989 , allowing thousands of east germans to flood into west berlin to be reunited with loved ones and to buy long-forbidden albums from hasselhoff ’ s musical back catalogue . there was even a moment when the reunited country joined together to thank the man who had provided the soundtrack to such historic change .
after being invited to headline a new year ’ s eve concert at the brandenburg gate by former german chancellor helmut kohl , the people ’ s champion finally got his chance to deliver his song in person to an audience of almost a million reunited germans . playing to an audience of united germans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it was the first time germany had been unified , and close to a million east and west german fans stood together in the freezing cold at midnight watching me perform .

no , hasselhoff believes his contribution came about through the unifying and healing power of his music . cover version caught the moment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after recording an english language cover version of the 1970s german hit , “ auf der strasse nach suden ” and renaming it “ looking for freedom , ” hasselhoff raced up the charts in the late summer of 1989 , just as a tide of revolution began rolling through eastern europe . the soft rock god had sublimely caught the moment by crooning the stirring lyrics : " i 've been lookin ' for freedom ; i 've been lookin ' so long ; i 've been lookin ' for freedom ; still the search goes on . "
and as a result , after spending several weeks at number one , the song became the anthem of some of those struggling to reconcile the broken nation . even as the hammers began to fall on the symbol of division , hasselhoff ’ s music was omnipresent ; the album of the same name was also germany ’ s best selling long player of the time , keeping less important records off the top spot for three months . freedom found bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " david , we love you ! "
at last , all those germans who had been looking for freedom eventually found it as the wall finally crumbled on november 9 , 1989 , allowing thousands of east germans to flood into west berlin to be reunited with loved ones and to buy long-forbidden albums from hasselhoff ’ s musical back catalogue . there was even a moment when the reunited country joined together to thank the man who had provided the soundtrack to such historic change .
after being invited to headline a new year ’ s eve concert at the brandenburg gate by former german chancellor helmut kohl , the people ’ s champion finally got his chance to deliver his song in person to an audience of almost a million reunited germans . playing to an audience of united germans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it was the first time germany had been unified , and close to a million east and west german fans stood together in the freezing cold at midnight watching me perform .
i was overcome with emotion , " he recalled in an interview with german magazine tv spielfilm . but official recognition evaded him .
“ i am a little bit sad that no photo of me hangs in the checkpoint charlie museum in berlin , ” he added with regret after his contribution to reunification failed to make it into the berlin wall commemorative exhibition at the former border crossing . museum missing hero 's portrait bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : checkpoint charlie .
but how can this be ?
surely a man who mobilized a divided nation , a man whose voice was the catalyst for revolution , should be honoured for his role in changing the world as many knew it back then . but the checkpoint charlie museum in berlin is n't quite convinced of the singer 's historical significance .
“ what did he do ? ” wondered the museum 's spokesperson when dw-world questioned why hasselhoff was not included in the hall of fame .
“ we didn ’ t know the song was that important .
we like mr. hasselhoff but there are no documents that record his role in the fall of the berlin wall . ” “ we do have a picture of roger moore as james bond though , ” the spokesperson offered up as a gesture to international stardom . and so , while a fictional spy is lauded for his work in promoting berlin , david hasselhoff must be content with making the next generation of germans whole again through his music . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de where 's the berlin wall ?
in the past few years , berlin has rushed to preserve the remaining remants of its wall - the ultimate cold war symbol - for the sake of history and curious tourists .

german general götz gliemeroth handed over command of the nato-led peacekeeping force in afghanistan to canada on monday amid fresh security concerns following an emergence of suicide bomb attacks . after a year of steering the 6,420-strong multinational international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- charged with overseeing security in the afghan capital , german nato general goetz gliemeroth handed over the reins to canadian general rick hillier on monday .
the canadian troops with 2,000 soldiers make up the largest contingent of the nato-led isaf force .
it ’ s unclear how long they will remain in afghanistan .
the canadian contingent is expected to end its deployment in august , but canadian prime minister paul martin has said 500 soldiers will stay on after that period .
security fears rise after attacks the festive hand-over ceremony was marked by tight security following a recent wave of suicide bomb attacks which killed a canadian soldier in kabul last month and a british peacekeeper a day later .
the attacks , claimed by the taliban , came on the heels of a december suicide bombing in which five afghan security officials were killed in kabul .

he called on the international community not to lose its focus on a nation still racked by violence , poverty and a booming drug trade .
" the situation is fragile , " de hoop scheffer told reporters aboard a u.s. military plane on his way to kabul .
" it ’ s extremely difficult to have a 100 percent defence against these horrible suicide attacks . ”
de hoop scheffer also underlined afghanistan ’ s importance for the military alliance .
" we now know that our future security , no matter where we are , is dependant on afghanistan ’ s security , " he said during the hand-over ceremony and warned that the international community needed to stay involved in afghanistan .
" the u.n. , the european union , japan and other important donors should stay fully committed to this country , " de hoop scheffer said .

nato took command of the 5,000-strong international peacekeeping force in the afghan capital on monday , a historic move that marks the alliance 's first operation outside europe since it was created 54 years ago .
-lrb- ap photo / apichart weerawong -rrb- taking stock of germany ’ s isaf year , german general götz gliemeroth -lrb- photo -rrb- stressed that germany had notched up successes during its command of the isaf , most notably the smooth running of the loya jirga or the grand assembly that agreed on a new constitution for afghanistan in december .
he also said considerable progress was made in the program towards disarming some 10,000 militia in the country under germany ’ s leadership .
at the same time gliemeroth warned that the nexus between the local warlords who ran provincial private armies and the wealthy druglords posed one of the biggest threats to afghanistan ’ s future .
" deplorably we ’ re seeing a connection between this so-called warlordism , which means commanders who maintain armies for political reasons to exert pressure , and the funds that come from the drugs trade , " gliemeroth said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poppy farmer mohammad agha in afghanistan the general , who has suggested in the past that nato should tackle the issue even it meant violent conflicts with the drug mafia , insisted that cracking down on the flourishing drug trade should be made a priority .
" it ’ s a challenge that the international community must urgently take up .
i can only add that soldiers are the least appropriate means to combat the planting of opium and drug transport .
rather we need to set up the right structures in afghanistan and shore them with funds , " he said .
continuing commitment to afghanistan needed gliemeroth urged continuing engagement in the civil-military area .
he pointed towards the success of the first provincial reconstruction team -lrb- prt -rrb- in kunduz in northern afghanistan .
nato controls that area and the prt is involved in the reconstruction of hundreds of schools , hospitals , fountains and irrigation projects .
" i think our alliance partners have realized the central importance of such prts for the further development of afghanistan , " he said .
nato currently runs one prt , while the u.s-led force of 10,600 controls the remainder .

" it ’ s extremely difficult to have a 100 percent defence against these horrible suicide attacks . ”

nato took command of the 5,000-strong international peacekeeping force in the afghan capital on monday , a historic move that marks the alliance 's first operation outside europe since it was created 54 years ago .
-lrb- ap photo / apichart weerawong -rrb- taking stock of germany ’ s isaf year , german general götz gliemeroth -lrb- photo -rrb- stressed that germany had notched up successes during its command of the isaf , most notably the smooth running of the loya jirga or the grand assembly that agreed on a new constitution for afghanistan in december .
he also said considerable progress was made in the program towards disarming some 10,000 militia in the country under germany ’ s leadership .
at the same time gliemeroth warned that the nexus between the local warlords who ran provincial private armies and the wealthy druglords posed one of the biggest threats to afghanistan ’ s future .
" deplorably we ’ re seeing a connection between this so-called warlordism , which means commanders who maintain armies for political reasons to exert pressure , and the funds that come from the drugs trade , " gliemeroth said .

german general götz gliemeroth handed over command of the nato-led peacekeeping force in afghanistan to canada on monday amid fresh security concerns following an emergence of suicide bomb attacks . after a year of steering the 6,420-strong multinational international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- charged with overseeing security in the afghan capital , german nato general goetz gliemeroth handed over the reins to canadian general rick hillier on monday .

meeting near berlin on monday , german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac said they want an agreement on a new european union constitution before the end of the irish eu presidency in june . the french and german leaders revived hopes for the european union ’ s stalled constitution on monday after they said they want an agreement on it before the six-month irish presidency of the eu runs out at the end of june .
meeting in genshagen , south of berlin , schröder and chirac were unanimous that the future of the eu had to be dealt with soon .
" we agreed that it 's our joint wish that the constitution issue should be resolved by the end of june during the irish presidency , " chirac said at a joint news conference with schröder .
" if this does not happen then in any case we must try to find an accord by the end of the dutch presidency at the end of 2004 , " he added .
warming franco-german ties the move is a further sign of deepening franco-german ties .
the two leaders have forged a close political relationship since last year when they both opposed the iraq war and have seen eye to eye on hotly-debated issues such as a post-war iraqi order , the eu constitution and european security and defense policy .
" our positions on european union themes are identical , " chirac said .

eu constitution talks broke down last december after poland and spain refused to accept newly weighted voting rights in the draft text , which would greatly curtail their voting rights in the eu council of ministers .
the two countries were the main beneficiaries of the 2000 nice treaty , which gave them just two votes less than the much more populous france and germany .
the issue has pitted france and germany against spain and poland , a future eu member .
not willing to compromise schröder however said on monday that berlin and paris did not want agreement on the constitution " at any cost . "
" we must stick to the principle of double majority , " he told reporters in berlin .
" we want progress on the issue of majority voting and we also think that the question of the efficiency of the work of the commission must be better secured than is currently the case . "
chirac added : " we want a smaller commission that in the future can work efficiently .
it is also our wish that the work of the european council does not become bogged down by excessive demands for agreement . "
schröder and chirac also said they were sticking with demands for a freeze on the eu budget until 2013 .
france , germany , britain , the netherlands , sweden and austria - all of which are net contributors to the eu – made the budget freeze demand last december in an open letter .

meeting near berlin on monday , german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac said they want an agreement on a new european union constitution before the end of the irish eu presidency in june . the french and german leaders revived hopes for the european union ’ s stalled constitution on monday after they said they want an agreement on it before the six-month irish presidency of the eu runs out at the end of june .
meeting in genshagen , south of berlin , schröder and chirac were unanimous that the future of the eu had to be dealt with soon .
" we agreed that it 's our joint wish that the constitution issue should be resolved by the end of june during the irish presidency , " chirac said at a joint news conference with schröder .
" if this does not happen then in any case we must try to find an accord by the end of the dutch presidency at the end of 2004 , " he added .
warming franco-german ties the move is a further sign of deepening franco-german ties .
the two leaders have forged a close political relationship since last year when they both opposed the iraq war and have seen eye to eye on hotly-debated issues such as a post-war iraqi order , the eu constitution and european security and defense policy .
" our positions on european union themes are identical , " chirac said .

ireland has been trying to broker an agreement on the eu constitution when it took over the presidency on jan 1 .
bedevilled eu constitution the new constitution is supposed to prepare the eu for may , when it expands from 15 to 25 members .
most observers consider the bloc ’ s current institutional set-up as too unwieldy and inefficient .
besides ending the rotation of the eu presidency amongst the national governments , the draft constitution aims to streamline the eu commission and decision-making .
eu constitution talks broke down last december after poland and spain refused to accept newly weighted voting rights in the draft text , which would greatly curtail their voting rights in the eu council of ministers .
the two countries were the main beneficiaries of the 2000 nice treaty , which gave them just two votes less than the much more populous france and germany .
the issue has pitted france and germany against spain and poland , a future eu member .
not willing to compromise schröder however said on monday that berlin and paris did not want agreement on the constitution " at any cost . "
" we must stick to the principle of double majority , " he told reporters in berlin .
" we want progress on the issue of majority voting and we also think that the question of the efficiency of the work of the commission must be better secured than is currently the case . "
chirac added : " we want a smaller commission that in the future can work efficiently .
it is also our wish that the work of the european council does not become bogged down by excessive demands for agreement . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.02.2004 brain drain hurting germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these frankfurt students have n't left germany - yet germany 's brightest and best qualified young professionals are leaving the country in droves and securing lucrative positions abroad . educators are converging on cologne for europe 's largest education and training trade fair , which opened monday .
while german participants familiarize themselves with new methods , theories and teaching aids , the fruits of their labors continue to abandon ship .
after investing tens of thousands in education and training costs , germany is losing its best qualified professionals to better paid positions elsewhere , economists complain .
and the growing brain drain is compounding germany 's economic woes through the loss of skilled labor and human resources .
nearly 118,000 people packed up and left the country in 2002 for jobs abroad , the german statistical office reported .
mathis malchow is one of those who , along with his girlfriend , left germany for better prospects abroad .
" we just decided that we would try our luck in london , because it 's the only city that has the potential for growth , " the architect told deutsche welle .
malchow has indeed been lucky .
he has a job with the renowned british architect sir norman foster .
the highlight so far has been working on one of london 's most conspicuous new landmarks , the swiss re building , affectionately dubbed the " erotic gherkin " by locals .
malchow does n't regret leaving germany .
" it 's definitely been an enriching experience , " he said .
helping them to go , then urging them to come back besides the young professionals and academics who leave germany for work , young germans who have completed vocational training also have good chances of finding a job abroad .
eva-elisabeth weber , a job counselor at the central employment agency in bonn , noted that hoteliers , chefs , managers and mechanical engineers , in particular , have good career opportunities beyond germany .
each year the agency locates jobs for some 6,000 skilled laborers , professionals and managers outside of the country .
it also tries to coax them back home when germany needs them .
" there are many doctors who we have found jobs for abroad , and now we have a shortage of qualified doctors here in germany .
we are now trying to encourage those german doctors and nurses spread across the european union to come back , " weber said .
science suffers every seventh person with a doctorate in science leaves germany for the united states , the scientist magazine has reported .
three of the four german nobel prize winners work in the united states .
" the trouble is that we are losing our highest achievers , " christoph anz of the confederation of german employers associations told the scientist .
" we have reached the point where we will no longer be able to compete in the booming biotechnology sector . "
gerd kempermann , a researcher in molecular medicine who has worked in the united states , says the work structure in other countries is often more attractive than in germany .
" the rules -lrb- in germany -rrb- do n't always fit everyone .
when someone realizes that they do n't fit into a certain formula then they begin to search for where their potential can be realized - where employers look to see what they can offer good employees . "
the most common complaints are that german research and development is under-funded and that institutes and universities are plagued by unwieldy bureaucracy .
" american universities offer scientists better pay conditions , more time for research and less time spent teaching , " said peter doermann , a research group leader at the max planck institute for molecular plant physiology near berlin .
some estimates say that scientists can earn three times as much money working in the united states compared to germany .
harming those who stay the brain drain can also hurt scientists working at home , doermann told deutsche welle .
" for me it 's a problem of collaboration , since the major players are in the u.s. there are some germans who were quite promising , and all of them went to the u.s. if you are below a critical number of people in a certain research area , you encounter problems applying for joint grants and european grants .
the german research foundation insists on only german research scientists , and if people leave there are n't enough left to collaborate , " he explained .
in an effort to reverse the trend , the german government last year said it would devote an extra € 100 million -lrb- $ 127 million -rrb- over the next four years to stimulate research and development in biotechnology in addition to the € 110 million already spent in the last three years .
announcing the package at the biotechnology day in leipzig in october , education and research minister edelgard bulmahn said the extra money would be directed to small- and medium-sized biotechnology companies .
gerd kempermann , for one , recently returned to germany to work at a local research clinic , but not because the conditions were better he said .
" they were for soft reasons , private reasons .
one ends up returning to where one comes from , " he explained .
kempermann is optimistic that despite the critical unemployment situation in the country - where 4.6 million people are registered jobless - the wealth of talent should encourage the public and private sector to invest in the human capital .
" i think that the motivation and the optimism will return quite quickly if a few fundamental conditions are changed .
if the government would support general research then we could have a flourishing landscape in no time . " margret steffen , dw staff -lrb- jsm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de are german universities losing their luster ?
chancellor schröder wants to reform the education system this year and the media is awash with talk of “ elite universities . ”
but many are already in dire straits , a far cry from the country ’ s legendary academic yore .

while german participants familiarize themselves with new methods , theories and teaching aids , the fruits of their labors continue to abandon ship .
after investing tens of thousands in education and training costs , germany is losing its best qualified professionals to better paid positions elsewhere , economists complain .
and the growing brain drain is compounding germany 's economic woes through the loss of skilled labor and human resources .
nearly 118,000 people packed up and left the country in 2002 for jobs abroad , the german statistical office reported .
mathis malchow is one of those who , along with his girlfriend , left germany for better prospects abroad .
" we just decided that we would try our luck in london , because it 's the only city that has the potential for growth , " the architect told deutsche welle .
malchow has indeed been lucky .
he has a job with the renowned british architect sir norman foster .
the highlight so far has been working on one of london 's most conspicuous new landmarks , the swiss re building , affectionately dubbed the " erotic gherkin " by locals .
malchow does n't regret leaving germany .
" it 's definitely been an enriching experience , " he said .
helping them to go , then urging them to come back besides the young professionals and academics who leave germany for work , young germans who have completed vocational training also have good chances of finding a job abroad .
eva-elisabeth weber , a job counselor at the central employment agency in bonn , noted that hoteliers , chefs , managers and mechanical engineers , in particular , have good career opportunities beyond germany .
each year the agency locates jobs for some 6,000 skilled laborers , professionals and managers outside of the country .
it also tries to coax them back home when germany needs them .
" there are many doctors who we have found jobs for abroad , and now we have a shortage of qualified doctors here in germany .
we are now trying to encourage those german doctors and nurses spread across the european union to come back , " weber said .
science suffers every seventh person with a doctorate in science leaves germany for the united states , the scientist magazine has reported .
three of the four german nobel prize winners work in the united states .
" the trouble is that we are losing our highest achievers , " christoph anz of the confederation of german employers associations told the scientist .
" we have reached the point where we will no longer be able to compete in the booming biotechnology sector . "
gerd kempermann , a researcher in molecular medicine who has worked in the united states , says the work structure in other countries is often more attractive than in germany .
" the rules -lrb- in germany -rrb- do n't always fit everyone .
when someone realizes that they do n't fit into a certain formula then they begin to search for where their potential can be realized - where employers look to see what they can offer good employees . "
the most common complaints are that german research and development is under-funded and that institutes and universities are plagued by unwieldy bureaucracy .
" american universities offer scientists better pay conditions , more time for research and less time spent teaching , " said peter doermann , a research group leader at the max planck institute for molecular plant physiology near berlin .
some estimates say that scientists can earn three times as much money working in the united states compared to germany .
harming those who stay the brain drain can also hurt scientists working at home , doermann told deutsche welle .
" for me it 's a problem of collaboration , since the major players are in the u.s. there are some germans who were quite promising , and all of them went to the u.s. if you are below a critical number of people in a certain research area , you encounter problems applying for joint grants and european grants .
the german research foundation insists on only german research scientists , and if people leave there are n't enough left to collaborate , " he explained .
in an effort to reverse the trend , the german government last year said it would devote an extra € 100 million -lrb- $ 127 million -rrb- over the next four years to stimulate research and development in biotechnology in addition to the € 110 million already spent in the last three years .
announcing the package at the biotechnology day in leipzig in october , education and research minister edelgard bulmahn said the extra money would be directed to small- and medium-sized biotechnology companies .
gerd kempermann , for one , recently returned to germany to work at a local research clinic , but not because the conditions were better he said .
" they were for soft reasons , private reasons .
one ends up returning to where one comes from , " he explained .
kempermann is optimistic that despite the critical unemployment situation in the country - where 4.6 million people are registered jobless - the wealth of talent should encourage the public and private sector to invest in the human capital .
" i think that the motivation and the optimism will return quite quickly if a few fundamental conditions are changed .
if the government would support general research then we could have a flourishing landscape in no time . " margret steffen , dw staff -lrb- jsm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de are german universities losing their luster ?

after the parmalat fiasco , the italian government has taken steps to reform the country 's regulatory system .
but do the reforms go far enough , and how do they compare to those elsewhere in europe , including germany ? the italian cabinet has approved a draft law aimed at reforming italy 's regulatory system .
the law , which is still subject to parliamentary approval , is the first step towards changing a system which , in the eyes of many , failed to prevent the multi-billion dollar parmalat scandal .
but after months of political wrangling , the tough original version of the bill was watered down - and may be further diluted before it gets final parliamentary approval sometime in the next three months - raising doubts about the current italian government 's ability to impose better corporate governance and soothe investor anxieties .
elsewhere in europe , including germany , steps have been taken to prevent a parmalat or enron-style meltdown .
but are the safeguards sufficient ?
italian economy minister hopes for radical reform the law approved by the italian government last week was very different from the one proposed by italy 's economy minister giulio tremonti .
shortly after parmalat first made the news in december , tremonti called for shifting oversight authority away from the bank of italy and giving more power to the anti-trust authority and consab , the italian equivalent of the united states ' federal exchange commission -lrb- fec -rrb- .
those found guilty of financial fraud would also face longer prison terms .
in short , tremonti hoped to consolidate italy 's complicated regulatory system , which is comprised of five parts , each devoted to different types of business , into a three-pronged system .
italian politicians reluctant to make big changes but tremonti faced tough opposition from the country 's business-mogul prime minister silvio berlusconi and his allies , who feared that a harsh response would be bad for business .
" we do n't need to turn an exceptional event into a witch hunt , which would make the running of an insurance or financial company difficult , " said berlusconi .
as it turned out the draft law did not , as some had hoped , consolidate the various authorities .
instead it strengthened consob with greater sanctioning powers and the authority to oversee corporate bond issues .
not everyone , including tremonti , was convinced .
" we would have liked a radical reform , and now we risk introducing a reform that is n't very incisive , " he said .
the german path to reform in an interview with deutsche welle , marco becht , the executive director of the european corporate governance institute and a professor of finance and economics at the university of brussels , points to the complexity of the issue .
" sometimes it is a case of management without enough shareholder oversight , as was the case with enron , and sometimes it is a case of a very powerful shareholder getting up to something , as was the case with parmalat , " he said .
" the tools you need in each of these situations is slightly different , " he added .
given the complexity of the task at hand , and the increasing complexity of multi-national corporations engaged in different types of business , what 's a government - say the one in berlin - to do ?
tremonti 's approach , consolidating various oversight authorities into a more cooperative powerful single entity , is an approach that has proven popular elsewhere in europe , according to ernst maug , a professor of business administration at humboldt university in berlin .
germany did so in 2002 , consolidating various regulatory agencies into bafin , the federal agency responsible for overseeing the entire financial sector .
" this seems to be the trend and makes a lot of sense to me , " maug told deutsche welle .
" it does n't make sense to have different regulatory agencies overseeing different sectors just because one security is called a stock and another a bond ; when you have one authority you have a better chance of catching things . "
what 's more , also in 2002 , the german corporate governance code , also known as the " kodex , " was implemented .
this code of " best practices " is not legally binding , but companies are now required to disclose in their annual reports the extent to which they comply with the code and explain opt-outs .
a german parmalat ?
these measures by no means guarantee that a corporate scandal like parmalat or enron wo n't happen in germany .
" could it happen here - yes , " says maug .
you will never have a system where everyone complies with the law all the time , he points out , and reducing these scandals to zero is not an option , since the resulting regulation could prove too costly for business .
brecht concurs .
" there is always a trade-off in trying to prevent the next parmalat from happening and restricting executives from being able to do business , " he says .
" with regulation , you have to do a cost-benefit analysis . "

germany did so in 2002 , consolidating various regulatory agencies into bafin , the federal agency responsible for overseeing the entire financial sector .
" this seems to be the trend and makes a lot of sense to me , " maug told deutsche welle .
" it does n't make sense to have different regulatory agencies overseeing different sectors just because one security is called a stock and another a bond ; when you have one authority you have a better chance of catching things . "
what 's more , also in 2002 , the german corporate governance code , also known as the " kodex , " was implemented .
this code of " best practices " is not legally binding , but companies are now required to disclose in their annual reports the extent to which they comply with the code and explain opt-outs .
a german parmalat ?
these measures by no means guarantee that a corporate scandal like parmalat or enron wo n't happen in germany .
" could it happen here - yes , " says maug .
you will never have a system where everyone complies with the law all the time , he points out , and reducing these scandals to zero is not an option , since the resulting regulation could prove too costly for business .
brecht concurs .
" there is always a trade-off in trying to prevent the next parmalat from happening and restricting executives from being able to do business , " he says .

after the parmalat fiasco , the italian government has taken steps to reform the country 's regulatory system .
but do the reforms go far enough , and how do they compare to those elsewhere in europe , including germany ? the italian cabinet has approved a draft law aimed at reforming italy 's regulatory system .
the law , which is still subject to parliamentary approval , is the first step towards changing a system which , in the eyes of many , failed to prevent the multi-billion dollar parmalat scandal .
but after months of political wrangling , the tough original version of the bill was watered down - and may be further diluted before it gets final parliamentary approval sometime in the next three months - raising doubts about the current italian government 's ability to impose better corporate governance and soothe investor anxieties .
elsewhere in europe , including germany , steps have been taken to prevent a parmalat or enron-style meltdown .
but are the safeguards sufficient ?
italian economy minister hopes for radical reform the law approved by the italian government last week was very different from the one proposed by italy 's economy minister giulio tremonti .
shortly after parmalat first made the news in december , tremonti called for shifting oversight authority away from the bank of italy and giving more power to the anti-trust authority and consab , the italian equivalent of the united states ' federal exchange commission -lrb- fec -rrb- .
those found guilty of financial fraud would also face longer prison terms .
in short , tremonti hoped to consolidate italy 's complicated regulatory system , which is comprised of five parts , each devoted to different types of business , into a three-pronged system .
italian politicians reluctant to make big changes but tremonti faced tough opposition from the country 's business-mogul prime minister silvio berlusconi and his allies , who feared that a harsh response would be bad for business .
" we do n't need to turn an exceptional event into a witch hunt , which would make the running of an insurance or financial company difficult , " said berlusconi .
as it turned out the draft law did not , as some had hoped , consolidate the various authorities .
instead it strengthened consob with greater sanctioning powers and the authority to oversee corporate bond issues .
not everyone , including tremonti , was convinced .
" we would have liked a radical reform , and now we risk introducing a reform that is n't very incisive , " he said .
the german path to reform in an interview with deutsche welle , marco becht , the executive director of the european corporate governance institute and a professor of finance and economics at the university of brussels , points to the complexity of the issue .
" sometimes it is a case of management without enough shareholder oversight , as was the case with enron , and sometimes it is a case of a very powerful shareholder getting up to something , as was the case with parmalat , " he said .
" the tools you need in each of these situations is slightly different , " he added .
given the complexity of the task at hand , and the increasing complexity of multi-national corporations engaged in different types of business , what 's a government - say the one in berlin - to do ?

while german participants familiarize themselves with new methods , theories and teaching aids , the fruits of their labors continue to abandon ship .
after investing tens of thousands in education and training costs , germany is losing its best qualified professionals to better paid positions elsewhere , economists complain .
and the growing brain drain is compounding germany 's economic woes through the loss of skilled labor and human resources .
nearly 118,000 people packed up and left the country in 2002 for jobs abroad , the german statistical office reported .
mathis malchow is one of those who , along with his girlfriend , left germany for better prospects abroad .
" we just decided that we would try our luck in london , because it 's the only city that has the potential for growth , " the architect told deutsche welle .
malchow has indeed been lucky .
he has a job with the renowned british architect sir norman foster .
the highlight so far has been working on one of london 's most conspicuous new landmarks , the swiss re building , affectionately dubbed the " erotic gherkin " by locals .
malchow does n't regret leaving germany .
" it 's definitely been an enriching experience , " he said .
helping them to go , then urging them to come back besides the young professionals and academics who leave germany for work , young germans who have completed vocational training also have good chances of finding a job abroad .
eva-elisabeth weber , a job counselor at the central employment agency in bonn , noted that hoteliers , chefs , managers and mechanical engineers , in particular , have good career opportunities beyond germany .
each year the agency locates jobs for some 6,000 skilled laborers , professionals and managers outside of the country .
it also tries to coax them back home when germany needs them .
" there are many doctors who we have found jobs for abroad , and now we have a shortage of qualified doctors here in germany .
we are now trying to encourage those german doctors and nurses spread across the european union to come back , " weber said .
science suffers every seventh person with a doctorate in science leaves germany for the united states , the scientist magazine has reported .
three of the four german nobel prize winners work in the united states .
" the trouble is that we are losing our highest achievers , " christoph anz of the confederation of german employers associations told the scientist .
" we have reached the point where we will no longer be able to compete in the booming biotechnology sector . "
gerd kempermann , a researcher in molecular medicine who has worked in the united states , says the work structure in other countries is often more attractive than in germany .
" the rules -lrb- in germany -rrb- do n't always fit everyone .
when someone realizes that they do n't fit into a certain formula then they begin to search for where their potential can be realized - where employers look to see what they can offer good employees . "
the most common complaints are that german research and development is under-funded and that institutes and universities are plagued by unwieldy bureaucracy .
" american universities offer scientists better pay conditions , more time for research and less time spent teaching , " said peter doermann , a research group leader at the max planck institute for molecular plant physiology near berlin .
some estimates say that scientists can earn three times as much money working in the united states compared to germany .
harming those who stay the brain drain can also hurt scientists working at home , doermann told deutsche welle .
" for me it 's a problem of collaboration , since the major players are in the u.s. there are some germans who were quite promising , and all of them went to the u.s. if you are below a critical number of people in a certain research area , you encounter problems applying for joint grants and european grants .
the german research foundation insists on only german research scientists , and if people leave there are n't enough left to collaborate , " he explained .
in an effort to reverse the trend , the german government last year said it would devote an extra € 100 million -lrb- $ 127 million -rrb- over the next four years to stimulate research and development in biotechnology in addition to the € 110 million already spent in the last three years .
announcing the package at the biotechnology day in leipzig in october , education and research minister edelgard bulmahn said the extra money would be directed to small- and medium-sized biotechnology companies .
gerd kempermann , for one , recently returned to germany to work at a local research clinic , but not because the conditions were better he said .
" they were for soft reasons , private reasons .
one ends up returning to where one comes from , " he explained .
kempermann is optimistic that despite the critical unemployment situation in the country - where 4.6 million people are registered jobless - the wealth of talent should encourage the public and private sector to invest in the human capital .
" i think that the motivation and the optimism will return quite quickly if a few fundamental conditions are changed .

while german participants familiarize themselves with new methods , theories and teaching aids , the fruits of their labors continue to abandon ship .
after investing tens of thousands in education and training costs , germany is losing its best qualified professionals to better paid positions elsewhere , economists complain .
and the growing brain drain is compounding germany 's economic woes through the loss of skilled labor and human resources .
nearly 118,000 people packed up and left the country in 2002 for jobs abroad , the german statistical office reported .
mathis malchow is one of those who , along with his girlfriend , left germany for better prospects abroad .
" we just decided that we would try our luck in london , because it 's the only city that has the potential for growth , " the architect told deutsche welle .
malchow has indeed been lucky .
he has a job with the renowned british architect sir norman foster .
the highlight so far has been working on one of london 's most conspicuous new landmarks , the swiss re building , affectionately dubbed the " erotic gherkin " by locals .
malchow does n't regret leaving germany .
" it 's definitely been an enriching experience , " he said .
helping them to go , then urging them to come back besides the young professionals and academics who leave germany for work , young germans who have completed vocational training also have good chances of finding a job abroad .
eva-elisabeth weber , a job counselor at the central employment agency in bonn , noted that hoteliers , chefs , managers and mechanical engineers , in particular , have good career opportunities beyond germany .
each year the agency locates jobs for some 6,000 skilled laborers , professionals and managers outside of the country .
it also tries to coax them back home when germany needs them .
" there are many doctors who we have found jobs for abroad , and now we have a shortage of qualified doctors here in germany .
we are now trying to encourage those german doctors and nurses spread across the european union to come back , " weber said .
science suffers every seventh person with a doctorate in science leaves germany for the united states , the scientist magazine has reported .
three of the four german nobel prize winners work in the united states .
" the trouble is that we are losing our highest achievers , " christoph anz of the confederation of german employers associations told the scientist .
" we have reached the point where we will no longer be able to compete in the booming biotechnology sector . "
gerd kempermann , a researcher in molecular medicine who has worked in the united states , says the work structure in other countries is often more attractive than in germany .
" the rules -lrb- in germany -rrb- do n't always fit everyone .
when someone realizes that they do n't fit into a certain formula then they begin to search for where their potential can be realized - where employers look to see what they can offer good employees . "
the most common complaints are that german research and development is under-funded and that institutes and universities are plagued by unwieldy bureaucracy .
" american universities offer scientists better pay conditions , more time for research and less time spent teaching , " said peter doermann , a research group leader at the max planck institute for molecular plant physiology near berlin .
some estimates say that scientists can earn three times as much money working in the united states compared to germany .
harming those who stay the brain drain can also hurt scientists working at home , doermann told deutsche welle .
" for me it 's a problem of collaboration , since the major players are in the u.s. there are some germans who were quite promising , and all of them went to the u.s. if you are below a critical number of people in a certain research area , you encounter problems applying for joint grants and european grants .
the german research foundation insists on only german research scientists , and if people leave there are n't enough left to collaborate , " he explained .
in an effort to reverse the trend , the german government last year said it would devote an extra € 100 million -lrb- $ 127 million -rrb- over the next four years to stimulate research and development in biotechnology in addition to the € 110 million already spent in the last three years .
announcing the package at the biotechnology day in leipzig in october , education and research minister edelgard bulmahn said the extra money would be directed to small- and medium-sized biotechnology companies .
gerd kempermann , for one , recently returned to germany to work at a local research clinic , but not because the conditions were better he said .
" they were for soft reasons , private reasons .
one ends up returning to where one comes from , " he explained .
kempermann is optimistic that despite the critical unemployment situation in the country - where 4.6 million people are registered jobless - the wealth of talent should encourage the public and private sector to invest in the human capital .
" i think that the motivation and the optimism will return quite quickly if a few fundamental conditions are changed .
if the government would support general research then we could have a flourishing landscape in no time . " margret steffen , dw staff -lrb- jsm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de are german universities losing their luster ?
chancellor schröder wants to reform the education system this year and the media is awash with talk of “ elite universities . ”

no , do not adjust your screens .
the list of those who contributed to the fall of the berlin wall and the end of communism has long been missing one name … until now . it was one of the defining moments of the twentieth century .
not only did it come to represent the collapse of the soviet union , the end of the communist dream and the concluding drama of the cold war , the fall of the berlin wall must also be remembered as the moment a nation that had been divided for 28 years came together .
thank you , david hasselhoff . excuse me ?
david hasselhoff ?
the man who made talking cars every small boy ’ s dream and scantily-clad , surgically enhanced beauties running in slow motion every teenage boy ’ s fantasy ?
surely the actor-slash-singer responsible for immortalizing such screen idols as michael knight and mitch buchannon can ’ t be accredited with bringing down a superpower and reuniting germany . well , according to the man himself , hasselhoff does indeed feel that he played his part in bringing about the fall of the berlin wall and aiding the reunification of east and west germany .
and not through some heroic spy chase across communist berlin at the wheel of his trusty car kitt or a daring rescue involving pamela anderson and a defecting russian diplomat in a thong .
no , hasselhoff believes his contribution came about through the unifying and healing power of his music . cover version caught the moment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after recording an english language cover version of the 1970s german hit , “ auf der strasse nach suden ” and renaming it “ looking for freedom , ” hasselhoff raced up the charts in the late summer of 1989 , just as a tide of revolution began rolling through eastern europe . the soft rock god had sublimely caught the moment by crooning the stirring lyrics : " i 've been lookin ' for freedom ; i 've been lookin ' so long ; i 've been lookin ' for freedom ; still the search goes on . "
and as a result , after spending several weeks at number one , the song became the anthem of some of those struggling to reconcile the broken nation . even as the hammers began to fall on the symbol of division , hasselhoff ’ s music was omnipresent ; the album of the same name was also germany ’ s best selling long player of the time , keeping less important records off the top spot for three months . freedom found bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " david , we love you ! "
at last , all those germans who had been looking for freedom eventually found it as the wall finally crumbled on november 9 , 1989 , allowing thousands of east germans to flood into west berlin to be reunited with loved ones and to buy long-forbidden albums from hasselhoff ’ s musical back catalogue . there was even a moment when the reunited country joined together to thank the man who had provided the soundtrack to such historic change .
after being invited to headline a new year ’ s eve concert at the brandenburg gate by former german chancellor helmut kohl , the people ’ s champion finally got his chance to deliver his song in person to an audience of almost a million reunited germans . playing to an audience of united germans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it was the first time germany had been unified , and close to a million east and west german fans stood together in the freezing cold at midnight watching me perform .
i was overcome with emotion , " he recalled in an interview with german magazine tv spielfilm . but official recognition evaded him .

surely a man who mobilized a divided nation , a man whose voice was the catalyst for revolution , should be honoured for his role in changing the world as many knew it back then . but the checkpoint charlie museum in berlin is n't quite convinced of the singer 's historical significance .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 09.02.2004 preventing the next parmalat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parmalat - could it happen in germany ?
after the parmalat fiasco , the italian government has taken steps to reform the country 's regulatory system .
but do the reforms go far enough , and how do they compare to those elsewhere in europe , including germany ? the italian cabinet has approved a draft law aimed at reforming italy 's regulatory system .
the law , which is still subject to parliamentary approval , is the first step towards changing a system which , in the eyes of many , failed to prevent the multi-billion dollar parmalat scandal .
but after months of political wrangling , the tough original version of the bill was watered down - and may be further diluted before it gets final parliamentary approval sometime in the next three months - raising doubts about the current italian government 's ability to impose better corporate governance and soothe investor anxieties .
elsewhere in europe , including germany , steps have been taken to prevent a parmalat or enron-style meltdown .
but are the safeguards sufficient ?
italian economy minister hopes for radical reform the law approved by the italian government last week was very different from the one proposed by italy 's economy minister giulio tremonti .
shortly after parmalat first made the news in december , tremonti called for shifting oversight authority away from the bank of italy and giving more power to the anti-trust authority and consab , the italian equivalent of the united states ' federal exchange commission -lrb- fec -rrb- .
those found guilty of financial fraud would also face longer prison terms .
in short , tremonti hoped to consolidate italy 's complicated regulatory system , which is comprised of five parts , each devoted to different types of business , into a three-pronged system .
italian politicians reluctant to make big changes but tremonti faced tough opposition from the country 's business-mogul prime minister silvio berlusconi and his allies , who feared that a harsh response would be bad for business .
" we do n't need to turn an exceptional event into a witch hunt , which would make the running of an insurance or financial company difficult , " said berlusconi .
as it turned out the draft law did not , as some had hoped , consolidate the various authorities .
instead it strengthened consob with greater sanctioning powers and the authority to oversee corporate bond issues .
not everyone , including tremonti , was convinced .
" we would have liked a radical reform , and now we risk introducing a reform that is n't very incisive , " he said .
the german path to reform in an interview with deutsche welle , marco becht , the executive director of the european corporate governance institute and a professor of finance and economics at the university of brussels , points to the complexity of the issue .
" sometimes it is a case of management without enough shareholder oversight , as was the case with enron , and sometimes it is a case of a very powerful shareholder getting up to something , as was the case with parmalat , " he said .
" the tools you need in each of these situations is slightly different , " he added .
given the complexity of the task at hand , and the increasing complexity of multi-national corporations engaged in different types of business , what 's a government - say the one in berlin - to do ?
tremonti 's approach , consolidating various oversight authorities into a more cooperative powerful single entity , is an approach that has proven popular elsewhere in europe , according to ernst maug , a professor of business administration at humboldt university in berlin .
germany did so in 2002 , consolidating various regulatory agencies into bafin , the federal agency responsible for overseeing the entire financial sector .
" this seems to be the trend and makes a lot of sense to me , " maug told deutsche welle .
" it does n't make sense to have different regulatory agencies overseeing different sectors just because one security is called a stock and another a bond ; when you have one authority you have a better chance of catching things . "
what 's more , also in 2002 , the german corporate governance code , also known as the " kodex , " was implemented .
this code of " best practices " is not legally binding , but companies are now required to disclose in their annual reports the extent to which they comply with the code and explain opt-outs .
a german parmalat ?
these measures by no means guarantee that a corporate scandal like parmalat or enron wo n't happen in germany .
" could it happen here - yes , " says maug .
you will never have a system where everyone complies with the law all the time , he points out , and reducing these scandals to zero is not an option , since the resulting regulation could prove too costly for business .
brecht concurs .
" there is always a trade-off in trying to prevent the next parmalat from happening and restricting executives from being able to do business , " he says .
" with regulation , you have to do a cost-benefit analysis . "
in the meantime , governments in europe and the world over continue to debate how to strike the best balance . kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de how to say " enron " in italian casting new doubt on european corporate governance , leading italian food group parmalat announced last week the firm had a € 4-billion discrepancy in its books .

italian politicians reluctant to make big changes but tremonti faced tough opposition from the country 's business-mogul prime minister silvio berlusconi and his allies , who feared that a harsh response would be bad for business .
" we do n't need to turn an exceptional event into a witch hunt , which would make the running of an insurance or financial company difficult , " said berlusconi .
as it turned out the draft law did not , as some had hoped , consolidate the various authorities .
instead it strengthened consob with greater sanctioning powers and the authority to oversee corporate bond issues .
not everyone , including tremonti , was convinced .
" we would have liked a radical reform , and now we risk introducing a reform that is n't very incisive , " he said .
the german path to reform in an interview with deutsche welle , marco becht , the executive director of the european corporate governance institute and a professor of finance and economics at the university of brussels , points to the complexity of the issue .
" sometimes it is a case of management without enough shareholder oversight , as was the case with enron , and sometimes it is a case of a very powerful shareholder getting up to something , as was the case with parmalat , " he said .
" the tools you need in each of these situations is slightly different , " he added .
given the complexity of the task at hand , and the increasing complexity of multi-national corporations engaged in different types of business , what 's a government - say the one in berlin - to do ?
tremonti 's approach , consolidating various oversight authorities into a more cooperative powerful single entity , is an approach that has proven popular elsewhere in europe , according to ernst maug , a professor of business administration at humboldt university in berlin .
germany did so in 2002 , consolidating various regulatory agencies into bafin , the federal agency responsible for overseeing the entire financial sector .
" this seems to be the trend and makes a lot of sense to me , " maug told deutsche welle .
" it does n't make sense to have different regulatory agencies overseeing different sectors just because one security is called a stock and another a bond ; when you have one authority you have a better chance of catching things . "
what 's more , also in 2002 , the german corporate governance code , also known as the " kodex , " was implemented .
this code of " best practices " is not legally binding , but companies are now required to disclose in their annual reports the extent to which they comply with the code and explain opt-outs .
a german parmalat ?
these measures by no means guarantee that a corporate scandal like parmalat or enron wo n't happen in germany .
" could it happen here - yes , " says maug .
you will never have a system where everyone complies with the law all the time , he points out , and reducing these scandals to zero is not an option , since the resulting regulation could prove too costly for business .
brecht concurs .
" there is always a trade-off in trying to prevent the next parmalat from happening and restricting executives from being able to do business , " he says .

after the parmalat fiasco , the italian government has taken steps to reform the country 's regulatory system .
but do the reforms go far enough , and how do they compare to those elsewhere in europe , including germany ? the italian cabinet has approved a draft law aimed at reforming italy 's regulatory system .
the law , which is still subject to parliamentary approval , is the first step towards changing a system which , in the eyes of many , failed to prevent the multi-billion dollar parmalat scandal .
but after months of political wrangling , the tough original version of the bill was watered down - and may be further diluted before it gets final parliamentary approval sometime in the next three months - raising doubts about the current italian government 's ability to impose better corporate governance and soothe investor anxieties .
elsewhere in europe , including germany , steps have been taken to prevent a parmalat or enron-style meltdown .
but are the safeguards sufficient ?
italian economy minister hopes for radical reform the law approved by the italian government last week was very different from the one proposed by italy 's economy minister giulio tremonti .
shortly after parmalat first made the news in december , tremonti called for shifting oversight authority away from the bank of italy and giving more power to the anti-trust authority and consab , the italian equivalent of the united states ' federal exchange commission -lrb- fec -rrb- .
those found guilty of financial fraud would also face longer prison terms .

german general götz gliemeroth handed over command of the nato-led peacekeeping force in afghanistan to canada on monday amid fresh security concerns following an emergence of suicide bomb attacks . after a year of steering the 6,420-strong multinational international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- charged with overseeing security in the afghan capital , german nato general goetz gliemeroth handed over the reins to canadian general rick hillier on monday .
the canadian troops with 2,000 soldiers make up the largest contingent of the nato-led isaf force .
it ’ s unclear how long they will remain in afghanistan .
the canadian contingent is expected to end its deployment in august , but canadian prime minister paul martin has said 500 soldiers will stay on after that period .
security fears rise after attacks the festive hand-over ceremony was marked by tight security following a recent wave of suicide bomb attacks which killed a canadian soldier in kabul last month and a british peacekeeper a day later .
the attacks , claimed by the taliban , came on the heels of a december suicide bombing in which five afghan security officials were killed in kabul .

" the situation is fragile , " de hoop scheffer told reporters aboard a u.s. military plane on his way to kabul .
" it ’ s extremely difficult to have a 100 percent defence against these horrible suicide attacks . ”
de hoop scheffer also underlined afghanistan ’ s importance for the military alliance .
" we now know that our future security , no matter where we are , is dependant on afghanistan ’ s security , " he said during the hand-over ceremony and warned that the international community needed to stay involved in afghanistan .

nato took command of the 5,000-strong international peacekeeping force in the afghan capital on monday , a historic move that marks the alliance 's first operation outside europe since it was created 54 years ago .
-lrb- ap photo / apichart weerawong -rrb- taking stock of germany ’ s isaf year , german general götz gliemeroth -lrb- photo -rrb- stressed that germany had notched up successes during its command of the isaf , most notably the smooth running of the loya jirga or the grand assembly that agreed on a new constitution for afghanistan in december .
he also said considerable progress was made in the program towards disarming some 10,000 militia in the country under germany ’ s leadership .
at the same time gliemeroth warned that the nexus between the local warlords who ran provincial private armies and the wealthy druglords posed one of the biggest threats to afghanistan ’ s future .
" deplorably we ’ re seeing a connection between this so-called warlordism , which means commanders who maintain armies for political reasons to exert pressure , and the funds that come from the drugs trade , " gliemeroth said .

nato controls that area and the prt is involved in the reconstruction of hundreds of schools , hospitals , fountains and irrigation projects .

nato currently runs one prt , while the u.s-led force of 10,600 controls the remainder .

german general götz gliemeroth handed over command of the nato-led peacekeeping force in afghanistan to canada on monday amid fresh security concerns following an emergence of suicide bomb attacks . after a year of steering the 6,420-strong multinational international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- charged with overseeing security in the afghan capital , german nato general goetz gliemeroth handed over the reins to canadian general rick hillier on monday .
the canadian troops with 2,000 soldiers make up the largest contingent of the nato-led isaf force .
it ’ s unclear how long they will remain in afghanistan .
the canadian contingent is expected to end its deployment in august , but canadian prime minister paul martin has said 500 soldiers will stay on after that period .
security fears rise after attacks the festive hand-over ceremony was marked by tight security following a recent wave of suicide bomb attacks which killed a canadian soldier in kabul last month and a british peacekeeper a day later .
the attacks , claimed by the taliban , came on the heels of a december suicide bombing in which five afghan security officials were killed in kabul .

he called on the international community not to lose its focus on a nation still racked by violence , poverty and a booming drug trade .
" the situation is fragile , " de hoop scheffer told reporters aboard a u.s. military plane on his way to kabul .
" it ’ s extremely difficult to have a 100 percent defence against these horrible suicide attacks . ”
de hoop scheffer also underlined afghanistan ’ s importance for the military alliance .
" we now know that our future security , no matter where we are , is dependant on afghanistan ’ s security , " he said during the hand-over ceremony and warned that the international community needed to stay involved in afghanistan .
" the u.n. , the european union , japan and other important donors should stay fully committed to this country , " de hoop scheffer said .

nato took command of the 5,000-strong international peacekeeping force in the afghan capital on monday , a historic move that marks the alliance 's first operation outside europe since it was created 54 years ago .
-lrb- ap photo / apichart weerawong -rrb- taking stock of germany ’ s isaf year , german general götz gliemeroth -lrb- photo -rrb- stressed that germany had notched up successes during its command of the isaf , most notably the smooth running of the loya jirga or the grand assembly that agreed on a new constitution for afghanistan in december .
he also said considerable progress was made in the program towards disarming some 10,000 militia in the country under germany ’ s leadership .
at the same time gliemeroth warned that the nexus between the local warlords who ran provincial private armies and the wealthy druglords posed one of the biggest threats to afghanistan ’ s future .
" deplorably we ’ re seeing a connection between this so-called warlordism , which means commanders who maintain armies for political reasons to exert pressure , and the funds that come from the drugs trade , " gliemeroth said .

while german participants familiarize themselves with new methods , theories and teaching aids , the fruits of their labors continue to abandon ship .
after investing tens of thousands in education and training costs , germany is losing its best qualified professionals to better paid positions elsewhere , economists complain .
and the growing brain drain is compounding germany 's economic woes through the loss of skilled labor and human resources .
nearly 118,000 people packed up and left the country in 2002 for jobs abroad , the german statistical office reported .
mathis malchow is one of those who , along with his girlfriend , left germany for better prospects abroad .
" we just decided that we would try our luck in london , because it 's the only city that has the potential for growth , " the architect told deutsche welle .
malchow has indeed been lucky .
he has a job with the renowned british architect sir norman foster .
the highlight so far has been working on one of london 's most conspicuous new landmarks , the swiss re building , affectionately dubbed the " erotic gherkin " by locals .
malchow does n't regret leaving germany .
" it 's definitely been an enriching experience , " he said .
helping them to go , then urging them to come back besides the young professionals and academics who leave germany for work , young germans who have completed vocational training also have good chances of finding a job abroad .
eva-elisabeth weber , a job counselor at the central employment agency in bonn , noted that hoteliers , chefs , managers and mechanical engineers , in particular , have good career opportunities beyond germany .
each year the agency locates jobs for some 6,000 skilled laborers , professionals and managers outside of the country .
it also tries to coax them back home when germany needs them .
" there are many doctors who we have found jobs for abroad , and now we have a shortage of qualified doctors here in germany .
we are now trying to encourage those german doctors and nurses spread across the european union to come back , " weber said .
science suffers every seventh person with a doctorate in science leaves germany for the united states , the scientist magazine has reported .
three of the four german nobel prize winners work in the united states .
" the trouble is that we are losing our highest achievers , " christoph anz of the confederation of german employers associations told the scientist .
" we have reached the point where we will no longer be able to compete in the booming biotechnology sector . "
gerd kempermann , a researcher in molecular medicine who has worked in the united states , says the work structure in other countries is often more attractive than in germany .
" the rules -lrb- in germany -rrb- do n't always fit everyone .
when someone realizes that they do n't fit into a certain formula then they begin to search for where their potential can be realized - where employers look to see what they can offer good employees . "
the most common complaints are that german research and development is under-funded and that institutes and universities are plagued by unwieldy bureaucracy .
" american universities offer scientists better pay conditions , more time for research and less time spent teaching , " said peter doermann , a research group leader at the max planck institute for molecular plant physiology near berlin .
some estimates say that scientists can earn three times as much money working in the united states compared to germany .
harming those who stay the brain drain can also hurt scientists working at home , doermann told deutsche welle .
" for me it 's a problem of collaboration , since the major players are in the u.s. there are some germans who were quite promising , and all of them went to the u.s. if you are below a critical number of people in a certain research area , you encounter problems applying for joint grants and european grants .
the german research foundation insists on only german research scientists , and if people leave there are n't enough left to collaborate , " he explained .
in an effort to reverse the trend , the german government last year said it would devote an extra € 100 million -lrb- $ 127 million -rrb- over the next four years to stimulate research and development in biotechnology in addition to the € 110 million already spent in the last three years .
announcing the package at the biotechnology day in leipzig in october , education and research minister edelgard bulmahn said the extra money would be directed to small- and medium-sized biotechnology companies .
gerd kempermann , for one , recently returned to germany to work at a local research clinic , but not because the conditions were better he said .
" they were for soft reasons , private reasons .
one ends up returning to where one comes from , " he explained .
kempermann is optimistic that despite the critical unemployment situation in the country - where 4.6 million people are registered jobless - the wealth of talent should encourage the public and private sector to invest in the human capital .

while german participants familiarize themselves with new methods , theories and teaching aids , the fruits of their labors continue to abandon ship .
after investing tens of thousands in education and training costs , germany is losing its best qualified professionals to better paid positions elsewhere , economists complain .
and the growing brain drain is compounding germany 's economic woes through the loss of skilled labor and human resources .
nearly 118,000 people packed up and left the country in 2002 for jobs abroad , the german statistical office reported .
mathis malchow is one of those who , along with his girlfriend , left germany for better prospects abroad .
" we just decided that we would try our luck in london , because it 's the only city that has the potential for growth , " the architect told deutsche welle .
malchow has indeed been lucky .
he has a job with the renowned british architect sir norman foster .
the highlight so far has been working on one of london 's most conspicuous new landmarks , the swiss re building , affectionately dubbed the " erotic gherkin " by locals .
malchow does n't regret leaving germany .
" it 's definitely been an enriching experience , " he said .
helping them to go , then urging them to come back besides the young professionals and academics who leave germany for work , young germans who have completed vocational training also have good chances of finding a job abroad .
eva-elisabeth weber , a job counselor at the central employment agency in bonn , noted that hoteliers , chefs , managers and mechanical engineers , in particular , have good career opportunities beyond germany .
each year the agency locates jobs for some 6,000 skilled laborers , professionals and managers outside of the country .
it also tries to coax them back home when germany needs them .
" there are many doctors who we have found jobs for abroad , and now we have a shortage of qualified doctors here in germany .
we are now trying to encourage those german doctors and nurses spread across the european union to come back , " weber said .
science suffers every seventh person with a doctorate in science leaves germany for the united states , the scientist magazine has reported .
three of the four german nobel prize winners work in the united states .
" the trouble is that we are losing our highest achievers , " christoph anz of the confederation of german employers associations told the scientist .
" we have reached the point where we will no longer be able to compete in the booming biotechnology sector . "
gerd kempermann , a researcher in molecular medicine who has worked in the united states , says the work structure in other countries is often more attractive than in germany .
" the rules -lrb- in germany -rrb- do n't always fit everyone .
when someone realizes that they do n't fit into a certain formula then they begin to search for where their potential can be realized - where employers look to see what they can offer good employees . "
the most common complaints are that german research and development is under-funded and that institutes and universities are plagued by unwieldy bureaucracy .
" american universities offer scientists better pay conditions , more time for research and less time spent teaching , " said peter doermann , a research group leader at the max planck institute for molecular plant physiology near berlin .
some estimates say that scientists can earn three times as much money working in the united states compared to germany .
harming those who stay the brain drain can also hurt scientists working at home , doermann told deutsche welle .
" for me it 's a problem of collaboration , since the major players are in the u.s. there are some germans who were quite promising , and all of them went to the u.s. if you are below a critical number of people in a certain research area , you encounter problems applying for joint grants and european grants .
the german research foundation insists on only german research scientists , and if people leave there are n't enough left to collaborate , " he explained .
in an effort to reverse the trend , the german government last year said it would devote an extra € 100 million -lrb- $ 127 million -rrb- over the next four years to stimulate research and development in biotechnology in addition to the € 110 million already spent in the last three years .
announcing the package at the biotechnology day in leipzig in october , education and research minister edelgard bulmahn said the extra money would be directed to small- and medium-sized biotechnology companies .
gerd kempermann , for one , recently returned to germany to work at a local research clinic , but not because the conditions were better he said .
" they were for soft reasons , private reasons .
one ends up returning to where one comes from , " he explained .

meeting near berlin on monday , german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac said they want an agreement on a new european union constitution before the end of the irish eu presidency in june . the french and german leaders revived hopes for the european union ’ s stalled constitution on monday after they said they want an agreement on it before the six-month irish presidency of the eu runs out at the end of june .
meeting in genshagen , south of berlin , schröder and chirac were unanimous that the future of the eu had to be dealt with soon .
" we agreed that it 's our joint wish that the constitution issue should be resolved by the end of june during the irish presidency , " chirac said at a joint news conference with schröder .
" if this does not happen then in any case we must try to find an accord by the end of the dutch presidency at the end of 2004 , " he added .
warming franco-german ties the move is a further sign of deepening franco-german ties .
the two leaders have forged a close political relationship since last year when they both opposed the iraq war and have seen eye to eye on hotly-debated issues such as a post-war iraqi order , the eu constitution and european security and defense policy .
" our positions on european union themes are identical , " chirac said .

ireland has been trying to broker an agreement on the eu constitution when it took over the presidency on jan 1 .
bedevilled eu constitution the new constitution is supposed to prepare the eu for may , when it expands from 15 to 25 members .
most observers consider the bloc ’ s current institutional set-up as too unwieldy and inefficient .
besides ending the rotation of the eu presidency amongst the national governments , the draft constitution aims to streamline the eu commission and decision-making .
eu constitution talks broke down last december after poland and spain refused to accept newly weighted voting rights in the draft text , which would greatly curtail their voting rights in the eu council of ministers .
the two countries were the main beneficiaries of the 2000 nice treaty , which gave them just two votes less than the much more populous france and germany .
the issue has pitted france and germany against spain and poland , a future eu member .
not willing to compromise schröder however said on monday that berlin and paris did not want agreement on the constitution " at any cost . "
" we must stick to the principle of double majority , " he told reporters in berlin .
" we want progress on the issue of majority voting and we also think that the question of the efficiency of the work of the commission must be better secured than is currently the case . "
chirac added : " we want a smaller commission that in the future can work efficiently .
it is also our wish that the work of the european council does not become bogged down by excessive demands for agreement . "
schröder and chirac also said they were sticking with demands for a freeze on the eu budget until 2013 .
france , germany , britain , the netherlands , sweden and austria - all of which are net contributors to the eu – made the budget freeze demand last december in an open letter .

after his resignation as social democratic party chairman on friday , german chancellor gerhard schröder on saturday named his likely successors , who he hopes will bring the party together on difficult reforms . these are days of surprise in the corridors of the germany ’ s governing party , the social democrats .
few had any idea on friday morning that chancellor gerhard schröder would resign from his post as head of the social democratic party and hand the reins over to franz müntefering , the party ’ s parliamentary group chairman .
then , on saturday , he named a successor for the party 's luckless general secretary , olaf scholz .
" on march 21 , the spd is going to call a special party conference , " schröder told reporters saturday .
" the party executive will unanimously nominate franz müntefering as its new party chairman .
and the party executive will also nominate klaus uwe benneter as the spd ’ s new general secretary with the same number of votes . "
a new deputy 56-year-old lawyer benneter , also a member of the german parliament , the bundestag , is also a close friend of schröder .
during the turbulent 70s , the two were active together in the spd ’ s young socialists at a time when the spd ’ s youth group had taken an extreme left political course .
at one point , benneter was even temporarily banned from the party because he had spoken out in favor of cooperation with communists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus-uwe benneter today ’ s an altogether different story .
these days , benneter -lrb- photo -rrb- calls for deep cuts into germany ’ s social system , for reforms of the labor market and public healthcare system – all initiatives that have drawn heavy criticism from the social democrats ’ party base and voters .
together , benneter and müntefering are expected to bring the party ’ s traditional leftist core into line with the government ’ s planned reforms .
müntefering calls for broad party debate on reforms müntefering said saturday he wanted to speak clear language about " equitableness , " one of the core principles of european social democratic movements . " that ’ s not just a saying , " müntefering said , " rather , it is something that has always been a deep part of this party ’ s history .
whoever speaks of ‘ equitableness ’ has to start with equal opportunities .
and they have to start with the fact that that is not functioning in the scope that we desire .
we ’ ve spoken of our solid determination to create a situation where young people in this country aren ’ t able to fall from school desk to the unemployment rolls .
the situation can ’ t stay as it is . "
speaking on a handful of german public broadcasting stations on saturday , müntefering said he wants to involve the party in the government ’ s reform policies more than in the past , admitting to ard that the reform policy negotiations within the party had been " suboptimal . "
in the future , he said reforms needed to be prepared more " cautiously . "
in an interview with zdf , he said he intended to open an intensive debate within the party about planned reforms while at the same time standing shoulder to shoulder with the government .
a deft political move ?
the first reactions coming out of the party this weekend suggest schröder made a deft political move by resigning from his position as party chairman .
the chancellor made clear on saturday that the party reins would soon be tightened , and that even in his cabinet there was no breathing room left for error .
in other words : controversial members of the cabinet , like transport minister manfred stolpe who has overseen the trouble-plagued implementation of tolls for heavy trucks and transports on germany highways , are now on probation . indeed , in recent weeks the pages of germany 's top newspapers and magazines have been filled with speculation of a possible shakeup of schröder 's cabinet .
schröder said the party needed to put its collective energy toward the different tasks required for safeguarding and implementing the reform process .
opposition : spd falling apart the minority opposition , neo-liberal free democratic party immediately criticized benneter ’ s nomination , lambasting the move as a signal that the spd is shifting to the left .
and dieter althaus of the christian democratic union said that the decision by the spd to appoint a relatively unknown politician to the position of general secretary showed how difficult it had become for the party to find leaders .
earlier , cdu chairwoman angela merkel and the head of the cdu ’ s bavarian sister party , the christian social union , edmund stoiber , both said schröder ’ s resignation marked the " beginning of the end " of the party . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder leaves an unloved post by quitting as the head of the social democratic party on friday , gerhard schröder left an office he hardly loved .
besides , his likely successor could help build party support for schröder 's equally unloved reforms .

after his resignation as social democratic party chairman on friday , german chancellor gerhard schröder on saturday named his likely successors , who he hopes will bring the party together on difficult reforms . these are days of surprise in the corridors of the germany ’ s governing party , the social democrats .
few had any idea on friday morning that chancellor gerhard schröder would resign from his post as head of the social democratic party and hand the reins over to franz müntefering , the party ’ s parliamentary group chairman .
then , on saturday , he named a successor for the party 's luckless general secretary , olaf scholz .
" on march 21 , the spd is going to call a special party conference , " schröder told reporters saturday .
" the party executive will unanimously nominate franz müntefering as its new party chairman .
and the party executive will also nominate klaus uwe benneter as the spd ’ s new general secretary with the same number of votes . "
a new deputy 56-year-old lawyer benneter , also a member of the german parliament , the bundestag , is also a close friend of schröder .
during the turbulent 70s , the two were active together in the spd ’ s young socialists at a time when the spd ’ s youth group had taken an extreme left political course .

as nature awakes from the harsh winter and blossoms begin to change the barren land , the opium poppy sleeps on .
a few months later , the fields will be full with beautiful red flowers . then the harvest begins ; the poppies are mowed and in the weeks that follow , the product that these plants hold within will hit the streets of western cities in the form of powder sold in small plastic bags . in an attempt to stop the tide of afghan heroin flooding european cities , politicians and representatives of international organizations have been meeting in kabul to discuss strategies to counter the country ’ s drug cultivation industry . britain and us favor burning fields bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but while the experts are united in their cause to stamp out the scourge of afghan heroin crossing their borders , there are conflicting views on what the best action is .
britain , which was given the role of stamping out afghanistan ’ s drug output at the bonn conference shortly after the fall of the taliban regime , is in favor of burning the poppy fields and destroying the drug labs . considered harsh by many , the united states supports such a " slash and burn " tactic . however , german experts wish to pursue alternative solutions .
“ these repressive measures do not correspond to our plan of lasting development , ” said christoph berg , project manager of the drugs and development scheme of the german society for technical cooperation -lrb- gtz -rrb- , in an interview with deutsche welle .
“ we want to show the farmers that there are alternatives to opium growing . ” farmers would prefer alternative income bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the warlords control their own areas and profit from the local crop .
research carried out by the gtz shows that the cultivation of wheat , wine , fruit or spices could well replace the production of heroin as a source of making a living for afghans .
" we have spoken with farmers .
many would stop growing opium if they could survive by producing other products , ” said berg , adding that all production of opium is illegal in afghanistan . the gtz experts in kabul form a part of a project investigating " drug control connected to development , " an eu supported initiative which is being funded by the bloc to the tune of € 9 million over the next three years .
the project intends to start the process of replacing the drug economy at the very roots by working with schools and health centers in the eastern provinces of laghman , kunar and nangarhar and to set up and strengthen alternative agricultural cooperatives . gtz must convince profiting warlords bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr soldiers on patrol in afghanistan .
the project will last for at least 10 to 15 years , according to berg , and it will take at least that long before the first successes becomes visible in the fight against drugs .
not everybody is so eager to cooperate .
“ we must also try to include the local warlords and work constructively with them , ” said berg .
the warlords profit from the drug business and the afghan economy relies heavily on it while there is little alternative .
convincing some of the benefits of other crops will take time . but the german focus is on a peaceful and progressive campaign against the drug trade emanating from afghanistan .
the military has also taken a non-aggressive stance on the opium business , especially as the bundeswehr attempts to win over the hearts and minds of the afghan people through its reconstruction efforts . germany rules out military intervention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heroin is a problem in most european cities .
the soldiers of the regional reconstruction team -lrb- prt -rrb- in the northern afghan city of kunduz are operating in one of the most opium rich areas of the country .
however , the german parliament only agreed the deployment of the force outside the relative safety of the international assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- mission in kabul on the condition that the 220 soldiers of the prt keep out of the fight with the drug barons . but despite the plans of the gtz and the resolution of the bundeswehr , the fight against the poppy growers and cultivators will go on as british and u.s. forces continue to target a way of life that not only provides their enemies with funds to fight on but also takes the war to the streets of their home nations . harvests improving every year according to the united nations , 2003 saw afghanistan ’ s second-best harvest ever registered : 3,600 metric tons of opium , material for 360 metric tons of heroin was produced last year .

as nature awakes from the harsh winter and blossoms begin to change the barren land , the opium poppy sleeps on .
a few months later , the fields will be full with beautiful red flowers . then the harvest begins ; the poppies are mowed and in the weeks that follow , the product that these plants hold within will hit the streets of western cities in the form of powder sold in small plastic bags . in an attempt to stop the tide of afghan heroin flooding european cities , politicians and representatives of international organizations have been meeting in kabul to discuss strategies to counter the country ’ s drug cultivation industry . britain and us favor burning fields bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but while the experts are united in their cause to stamp out the scourge of afghan heroin crossing their borders , there are conflicting views on what the best action is .
britain , which was given the role of stamping out afghanistan ’ s drug output at the bonn conference shortly after the fall of the taliban regime , is in favor of burning the poppy fields and destroying the drug labs . considered harsh by many , the united states supports such a " slash and burn " tactic . however , german experts wish to pursue alternative solutions .
“ these repressive measures do not correspond to our plan of lasting development , ” said christoph berg , project manager of the drugs and development scheme of the german society for technical cooperation -lrb- gtz -rrb- , in an interview with deutsche welle .
“ we want to show the farmers that there are alternatives to opium growing . ” farmers would prefer alternative income bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the warlords control their own areas and profit from the local crop .
research carried out by the gtz shows that the cultivation of wheat , wine , fruit or spices could well replace the production of heroin as a source of making a living for afghans .
" we have spoken with farmers .
many would stop growing opium if they could survive by producing other products , ” said berg , adding that all production of opium is illegal in afghanistan . the gtz experts in kabul form a part of a project investigating " drug control connected to development , " an eu supported initiative which is being funded by the bloc to the tune of € 9 million over the next three years .
the project intends to start the process of replacing the drug economy at the very roots by working with schools and health centers in the eastern provinces of laghman , kunar and nangarhar and to set up and strengthen alternative agricultural cooperatives . gtz must convince profiting warlords bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr soldiers on patrol in afghanistan .
the project will last for at least 10 to 15 years , according to berg , and it will take at least that long before the first successes becomes visible in the fight against drugs .
not everybody is so eager to cooperate .
“ we must also try to include the local warlords and work constructively with them , ” said berg .
the warlords profit from the drug business and the afghan economy relies heavily on it while there is little alternative .
convincing some of the benefits of other crops will take time . but the german focus is on a peaceful and progressive campaign against the drug trade emanating from afghanistan .
the military has also taken a non-aggressive stance on the opium business , especially as the bundeswehr attempts to win over the hearts and minds of the afghan people through its reconstruction efforts . germany rules out military intervention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heroin is a problem in most european cities .
the soldiers of the regional reconstruction team -lrb- prt -rrb- in the northern afghan city of kunduz are operating in one of the most opium rich areas of the country .
however , the german parliament only agreed the deployment of the force outside the relative safety of the international assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- mission in kabul on the condition that the 220 soldiers of the prt keep out of the fight with the drug barons . but despite the plans of the gtz and the resolution of the bundeswehr , the fight against the poppy growers and cultivators will go on as british and u.s. forces continue to target a way of life that not only provides their enemies with funds to fight on but also takes the war to the streets of their home nations . harvests improving every year according to the united nations , 2003 saw afghanistan ’ s second-best harvest ever registered : 3,600 metric tons of opium , material for 360 metric tons of heroin was produced last year .
this number is second only to the bumper crop of 1999 from which 4,600 metric tons were collected . # b # this year , a good harvest is expected once again , adding to afghanistan ’ s reputation as the world market leader in the production of the drug .
the drug cultivation and drug trafficking makes up half of the afghan domestic product , three quarters of the world production in opium comes from the hindu kush and drug experts estimate that 90 percent of the raw afghan opium makes it to europe in the form of refined heroin . dw-staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de struck says afghanistan still not safe german defense minister peter struck has wrapped up a visit to the northern afghan city of kunduz , saying the country still is n't " stable " and has ruled out helping the afghans fight the drug trade .

meeting near berlin on monday , german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac said they want an agreement on a new european union constitution before the end of the irish eu presidency in june . the french and german leaders revived hopes for the european union ’ s stalled constitution on monday after they said they want an agreement on it before the six-month irish presidency of the eu runs out at the end of june .
meeting in genshagen , south of berlin , schröder and chirac were unanimous that the future of the eu had to be dealt with soon .
" we agreed that it 's our joint wish that the constitution issue should be resolved by the end of june during the irish presidency , " chirac said at a joint news conference with schröder .
" if this does not happen then in any case we must try to find an accord by the end of the dutch presidency at the end of 2004 , " he added .
warming franco-german ties the move is a further sign of deepening franco-german ties .
the two leaders have forged a close political relationship since last year when they both opposed the iraq war and have seen eye to eye on hotly-debated issues such as a post-war iraqi order , the eu constitution and european security and defense policy .
" our positions on european union themes are identical , " chirac said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish premier bertie ahern schröder was to head to dublin later on monday for talks with irish prime minister bertie ahern -lrb- photo -rrb- , who currently holds the rotating eu presidency .
ireland has been trying to broker an agreement on the eu constitution when it took over the presidency on jan 1 .
bedevilled eu constitution the new constitution is supposed to prepare the eu for may , when it expands from 15 to 25 members .
most observers consider the bloc ’ s current institutional set-up as too unwieldy and inefficient .
besides ending the rotation of the eu presidency amongst the national governments , the draft constitution aims to streamline the eu commission and decision-making .
eu constitution talks broke down last december after poland and spain refused to accept newly weighted voting rights in the draft text , which would greatly curtail their voting rights in the eu council of ministers .
the two countries were the main beneficiaries of the 2000 nice treaty , which gave them just two votes less than the much more populous france and germany .
the issue has pitted france and germany against spain and poland , a future eu member .
not willing to compromise schröder however said on monday that berlin and paris did not want agreement on the constitution " at any cost . "
" we must stick to the principle of double majority , " he told reporters in berlin .
" we want progress on the issue of majority voting and we also think that the question of the efficiency of the work of the commission must be better secured than is currently the case . "
chirac added : " we want a smaller commission that in the future can work efficiently .
it is also our wish that the work of the european council does not become bogged down by excessive demands for agreement . "
schröder and chirac also said they were sticking with demands for a freeze on the eu budget until 2013 .
france , germany , britain , the netherlands , sweden and austria - all of which are net contributors to the eu – made the budget freeze demand last december in an open letter .
with a little bit of british help the franco-german duo hopes their efforts will be given additional clout by the british prime minister tony blair who is expected to join in a trilateral summit in berlin next week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's prime minister tony blair both schröder and chirac hope that the franco-german motor , ideally beefed up a bit with the help of britain ’ s tony blair -lrb- photo -rrb- , will create new momentum for a breakthrough in talks on the future of europe . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ireland puts eu constitution at the top of its agenda after a rocky shot at the helm of the eu presidency , italy handed the reins to ireland on january 1st .

meeting near berlin on monday , german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac said they want an agreement on a new european union constitution before the end of the irish eu presidency in june . the french and german leaders revived hopes for the european union ’ s stalled constitution on monday after they said they want an agreement on it before the six-month irish presidency of the eu runs out at the end of june .
meeting in genshagen , south of berlin , schröder and chirac were unanimous that the future of the eu had to be dealt with soon .
" we agreed that it 's our joint wish that the constitution issue should be resolved by the end of june during the irish presidency , " chirac said at a joint news conference with schröder .
" if this does not happen then in any case we must try to find an accord by the end of the dutch presidency at the end of 2004 , " he added .
warming franco-german ties the move is a further sign of deepening franco-german ties .
the two leaders have forged a close political relationship since last year when they both opposed the iraq war and have seen eye to eye on hotly-debated issues such as a post-war iraqi order , the eu constitution and european security and defense policy .
" our positions on european union themes are identical , " chirac said .

bedevilled eu constitution the new constitution is supposed to prepare the eu for may , when it expands from 15 to 25 members .
most observers consider the bloc ’ s current institutional set-up as too unwieldy and inefficient .
besides ending the rotation of the eu presidency amongst the national governments , the draft constitution aims to streamline the eu commission and decision-making .
eu constitution talks broke down last december after poland and spain refused to accept newly weighted voting rights in the draft text , which would greatly curtail their voting rights in the eu council of ministers .
the two countries were the main beneficiaries of the 2000 nice treaty , which gave them just two votes less than the much more populous france and germany .
the issue has pitted france and germany against spain and poland , a future eu member .
not willing to compromise schröder however said on monday that berlin and paris did not want agreement on the constitution " at any cost . "
" we must stick to the principle of double majority , " he told reporters in berlin .
" we want progress on the issue of majority voting and we also think that the question of the efficiency of the work of the commission must be better secured than is currently the case . "

german general götz gliemeroth handed over command of the nato-led peacekeeping force in afghanistan to canada on monday amid fresh security concerns following an emergence of suicide bomb attacks . after a year of steering the 6,420-strong multinational international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- charged with overseeing security in the afghan capital , german nato general goetz gliemeroth handed over the reins to canadian general rick hillier on monday .
the canadian troops with 2,000 soldiers make up the largest contingent of the nato-led isaf force .
it ’ s unclear how long they will remain in afghanistan .
the canadian contingent is expected to end its deployment in august , but canadian prime minister paul martin has said 500 soldiers will stay on after that period .
security fears rise after attacks the festive hand-over ceremony was marked by tight security following a recent wave of suicide bomb attacks which killed a canadian soldier in kabul last month and a british peacekeeper a day later .
the attacks , claimed by the taliban , came on the heels of a december suicide bombing in which five afghan security officials were killed in kabul .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaap de hoop scheffer earlier , jaap de hoop scheffer -lrb- photo -rrb- expressed concerns that the emergence of suicide bomb attacks on kabul peacekeepers showed that the capital was far from secure .
he called on the international community not to lose its focus on a nation still racked by violence , poverty and a booming drug trade .
" the situation is fragile , " de hoop scheffer told reporters aboard a u.s. military plane on his way to kabul .
" it ’ s extremely difficult to have a 100 percent defence against these horrible suicide attacks . ”
de hoop scheffer also underlined afghanistan ’ s importance for the military alliance .
" we now know that our future security , no matter where we are , is dependant on afghanistan ’ s security , " he said during the hand-over ceremony and warned that the international community needed to stay involved in afghanistan .
" the u.n. , the european union , japan and other important donors should stay fully committed to this country , " de hoop scheffer said .
" nato can provide security and stability , but the afghan people need housing and schooling and roofs over their heads . "
successes and challenges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lt-gen .
goetz f.e. gliemeroth , new commander of isaf , salutes as he arrives for the handover ceremony of commanding force from isaf to nato in kabul , afghanistan monday , aug .
11 , 2003 .
nato took command of the 5,000-strong international peacekeeping force in the afghan capital on monday , a historic move that marks the alliance 's first operation outside europe since it was created 54 years ago .
-lrb- ap photo / apichart weerawong -rrb- taking stock of germany ’ s isaf year , german general götz gliemeroth -lrb- photo -rrb- stressed that germany had notched up successes during its command of the isaf , most notably the smooth running of the loya jirga or the grand assembly that agreed on a new constitution for afghanistan in december .
he also said considerable progress was made in the program towards disarming some 10,000 militia in the country under germany ’ s leadership .
at the same time gliemeroth warned that the nexus between the local warlords who ran provincial private armies and the wealthy druglords posed one of the biggest threats to afghanistan ’ s future .
" deplorably we ’ re seeing a connection between this so-called warlordism , which means commanders who maintain armies for political reasons to exert pressure , and the funds that come from the drugs trade , " gliemeroth said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poppy farmer mohammad agha in afghanistan the general , who has suggested in the past that nato should tackle the issue even it meant violent conflicts with the drug mafia , insisted that cracking down on the flourishing drug trade should be made a priority .
" it ’ s a challenge that the international community must urgently take up .
i can only add that soldiers are the least appropriate means to combat the planting of opium and drug transport .
rather we need to set up the right structures in afghanistan and shore them with funds , " he said .
continuing commitment to afghanistan needed gliemeroth urged continuing engagement in the civil-military area .
he pointed towards the success of the first provincial reconstruction team -lrb- prt -rrb- in kunduz in northern afghanistan .
nato controls that area and the prt is involved in the reconstruction of hundreds of schools , hospitals , fountains and irrigation projects .
" i think our alliance partners have realized the central importance of such prts for the further development of afghanistan , " he said .
nato currently runs one prt , while the u.s-led force of 10,600 controls the remainder .
prts , whose members range from a few dozen to more than 200 , combine military and reconstruction roles in far-flung areas .
by next month there will be 13 prts across afghanistan .
nato ’ s peacekeeping force aims to set up five new teams over the next six months .
gliemeroth however warned that the situation in iraq shouldn ’ t be allowed to divert attention from afghanistan .

german general götz gliemeroth handed over command of the nato-led peacekeeping force in afghanistan to canada on monday amid fresh security concerns following an emergence of suicide bomb attacks . after a year of steering the 6,420-strong multinational international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- charged with overseeing security in the afghan capital , german nato general goetz gliemeroth handed over the reins to canadian general rick hillier on monday .
the canadian troops with 2,000 soldiers make up the largest contingent of the nato-led isaf force .
it ’ s unclear how long they will remain in afghanistan .
the canadian contingent is expected to end its deployment in august , but canadian prime minister paul martin has said 500 soldiers will stay on after that period .
security fears rise after attacks the festive hand-over ceremony was marked by tight security following a recent wave of suicide bomb attacks which killed a canadian soldier in kabul last month and a british peacekeeper a day later .
the attacks , claimed by the taliban , came on the heels of a december suicide bombing in which five afghan security officials were killed in kabul .

he called on the international community not to lose its focus on a nation still racked by violence , poverty and a booming drug trade .
" the situation is fragile , " de hoop scheffer told reporters aboard a u.s. military plane on his way to kabul .
" it ’ s extremely difficult to have a 100 percent defence against these horrible suicide attacks . ”
de hoop scheffer also underlined afghanistan ’ s importance for the military alliance .
" we now know that our future security , no matter where we are , is dependant on afghanistan ’ s security , " he said during the hand-over ceremony and warned that the international community needed to stay involved in afghanistan .
" the u.n. , the european union , japan and other important donors should stay fully committed to this country , " de hoop scheffer said .

nato took command of the 5,000-strong international peacekeeping force in the afghan capital on monday , a historic move that marks the alliance 's first operation outside europe since it was created 54 years ago .
-lrb- ap photo / apichart weerawong -rrb- taking stock of germany ’ s isaf year , german general götz gliemeroth -lrb- photo -rrb- stressed that germany had notched up successes during its command of the isaf , most notably the smooth running of the loya jirga or the grand assembly that agreed on a new constitution for afghanistan in december .
he also said considerable progress was made in the program towards disarming some 10,000 militia in the country under germany ’ s leadership .
at the same time gliemeroth warned that the nexus between the local warlords who ran provincial private armies and the wealthy druglords posed one of the biggest threats to afghanistan ’ s future .
" deplorably we ’ re seeing a connection between this so-called warlordism , which means commanders who maintain armies for political reasons to exert pressure , and the funds that come from the drugs trade , " gliemeroth said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poppy farmer mohammad agha in afghanistan the general , who has suggested in the past that nato should tackle the issue even it meant violent conflicts with the drug mafia , insisted that cracking down on the flourishing drug trade should be made a priority .
" it ’ s a challenge that the international community must urgently take up .
i can only add that soldiers are the least appropriate means to combat the planting of opium and drug transport .
rather we need to set up the right structures in afghanistan and shore them with funds , " he said .

he pointed towards the success of the first provincial reconstruction team -lrb- prt -rrb- in kunduz in northern afghanistan .
nato controls that area and the prt is involved in the reconstruction of hundreds of schools , hospitals , fountains and irrigation projects .
" i think our alliance partners have realized the central importance of such prts for the further development of afghanistan , " he said .
nato currently runs one prt , while the u.s-led force of 10,600 controls the remainder .
prts , whose members range from a few dozen to more than 200 , combine military and reconstruction roles in far-flung areas .

no , do not adjust your screens .
the list of those who contributed to the fall of the berlin wall and the end of communism has long been missing one name … until now . it was one of the defining moments of the twentieth century .
not only did it come to represent the collapse of the soviet union , the end of the communist dream and the concluding drama of the cold war , the fall of the berlin wall must also be remembered as the moment a nation that had been divided for 28 years came together .
thank you , david hasselhoff . excuse me ?
david hasselhoff ?
the man who made talking cars every small boy ’ s dream and scantily-clad , surgically enhanced beauties running in slow motion every teenage boy ’ s fantasy ?
surely the actor-slash-singer responsible for immortalizing such screen idols as michael knight and mitch buchannon can ’ t be accredited with bringing down a superpower and reuniting germany . well , according to the man himself , hasselhoff does indeed feel that he played his part in bringing about the fall of the berlin wall and aiding the reunification of east and west germany .
and not through some heroic spy chase across communist berlin at the wheel of his trusty car kitt or a daring rescue involving pamela anderson and a defecting russian diplomat in a thong .
no , hasselhoff believes his contribution came about through the unifying and healing power of his music . cover version caught the moment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after recording an english language cover version of the 1970s german hit , “ auf der strasse nach suden ” and renaming it “ looking for freedom , ” hasselhoff raced up the charts in the late summer of 1989 , just as a tide of revolution began rolling through eastern europe . the soft rock god had sublimely caught the moment by crooning the stirring lyrics : " i 've been lookin ' for freedom ; i 've been lookin ' so long ; i 've been lookin ' for freedom ; still the search goes on . "
and as a result , after spending several weeks at number one , the song became the anthem of some of those struggling to reconcile the broken nation . even as the hammers began to fall on the symbol of division , hasselhoff ’ s music was omnipresent ; the album of the same name was also germany ’ s best selling long player of the time , keeping less important records off the top spot for three months . freedom found bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " david , we love you ! "
at last , all those germans who had been looking for freedom eventually found it as the wall finally crumbled on november 9 , 1989 , allowing thousands of east germans to flood into west berlin to be reunited with loved ones and to buy long-forbidden albums from hasselhoff ’ s musical back catalogue . there was even a moment when the reunited country joined together to thank the man who had provided the soundtrack to such historic change .
after being invited to headline a new year ’ s eve concert at the brandenburg gate by former german chancellor helmut kohl , the people ’ s champion finally got his chance to deliver his song in person to an audience of almost a million reunited germans . playing to an audience of united germans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it was the first time germany had been unified , and close to a million east and west german fans stood together in the freezing cold at midnight watching me perform .

mikhail gorbachev … helmut kohl … david hasselhoff .
no , do not adjust your screens .
the list of those who contributed to the fall of the berlin wall and the end of communism has long been missing one name … until now . it was one of the defining moments of the twentieth century .
not only did it come to represent the collapse of the soviet union , the end of the communist dream and the concluding drama of the cold war , the fall of the berlin wall must also be remembered as the moment a nation that had been divided for 28 years came together .
thank you , david hasselhoff . excuse me ?
david hasselhoff ?
the man who made talking cars every small boy ’ s dream and scantily-clad , surgically enhanced beauties running in slow motion every teenage boy ’ s fantasy ?
surely the actor-slash-singer responsible for immortalizing such screen idols as michael knight and mitch buchannon can ’ t be accredited with bringing down a superpower and reuniting germany . well , according to the man himself , hasselhoff does indeed feel that he played his part in bringing about the fall of the berlin wall and aiding the reunification of east and west germany .
and not through some heroic spy chase across communist berlin at the wheel of his trusty car kitt or a daring rescue involving pamela anderson and a defecting russian diplomat in a thong .
no , hasselhoff believes his contribution came about through the unifying and healing power of his music . cover version caught the moment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after recording an english language cover version of the 1970s german hit , “ auf der strasse nach suden ” and renaming it “ looking for freedom , ” hasselhoff raced up the charts in the late summer of 1989 , just as a tide of revolution began rolling through eastern europe . the soft rock god had sublimely caught the moment by crooning the stirring lyrics : " i 've been lookin ' for freedom ; i 've been lookin ' so long ; i 've been lookin ' for freedom ; still the search goes on . "
and as a result , after spending several weeks at number one , the song became the anthem of some of those struggling to reconcile the broken nation . even as the hammers began to fall on the symbol of division , hasselhoff ’ s music was omnipresent ; the album of the same name was also germany ’ s best selling long player of the time , keeping less important records off the top spot for three months . freedom found bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " david , we love you ! "
at last , all those germans who had been looking for freedom eventually found it as the wall finally crumbled on november 9 , 1989 , allowing thousands of east germans to flood into west berlin to be reunited with loved ones and to buy long-forbidden albums from hasselhoff ’ s musical back catalogue . there was even a moment when the reunited country joined together to thank the man who had provided the soundtrack to such historic change .
after being invited to headline a new year ’ s eve concert at the brandenburg gate by former german chancellor helmut kohl , the people ’ s champion finally got his chance to deliver his song in person to an audience of almost a million reunited germans . playing to an audience of united germans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it was the first time germany had been unified , and close to a million east and west german fans stood together in the freezing cold at midnight watching me perform .
i was overcome with emotion , " he recalled in an interview with german magazine tv spielfilm . but official recognition evaded him .
“ i am a little bit sad that no photo of me hangs in the checkpoint charlie museum in berlin , ” he added with regret after his contribution to reunification failed to make it into the berlin wall commemorative exhibition at the former border crossing . museum missing hero 's portrait bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : checkpoint charlie .
but how can this be ?
surely a man who mobilized a divided nation , a man whose voice was the catalyst for revolution , should be honoured for his role in changing the world as many knew it back then . but the checkpoint charlie museum in berlin is n't quite convinced of the singer 's historical significance .
“ what did he do ? ” wondered the museum 's spokesperson when dw-world questioned why hasselhoff was not included in the hall of fame .
“ we didn ’ t know the song was that important .
we like mr. hasselhoff but there are no documents that record his role in the fall of the berlin wall . ” “ we do have a picture of roger moore as james bond though , ” the spokesperson offered up as a gesture to international stardom . and so , while a fictional spy is lauded for his work in promoting berlin , david hasselhoff must be content with making the next generation of germans whole again through his music . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de where 's the berlin wall ?
in the past few years , berlin has rushed to preserve the remaining remants of its wall - the ultimate cold war symbol - for the sake of history and curious tourists .

while german participants familiarize themselves with new methods , theories and teaching aids , the fruits of their labors continue to abandon ship .
after investing tens of thousands in education and training costs , germany is losing its best qualified professionals to better paid positions elsewhere , economists complain .
and the growing brain drain is compounding germany 's economic woes through the loss of skilled labor and human resources .
nearly 118,000 people packed up and left the country in 2002 for jobs abroad , the german statistical office reported .
mathis malchow is one of those who , along with his girlfriend , left germany for better prospects abroad .
" we just decided that we would try our luck in london , because it 's the only city that has the potential for growth , " the architect told deutsche welle .
malchow has indeed been lucky .
he has a job with the renowned british architect sir norman foster .
the highlight so far has been working on one of london 's most conspicuous new landmarks , the swiss re building , affectionately dubbed the " erotic gherkin " by locals .
malchow does n't regret leaving germany .
" it 's definitely been an enriching experience , " he said .
helping them to go , then urging them to come back besides the young professionals and academics who leave germany for work , young germans who have completed vocational training also have good chances of finding a job abroad .
eva-elisabeth weber , a job counselor at the central employment agency in bonn , noted that hoteliers , chefs , managers and mechanical engineers , in particular , have good career opportunities beyond germany .
each year the agency locates jobs for some 6,000 skilled laborers , professionals and managers outside of the country .
it also tries to coax them back home when germany needs them .
" there are many doctors who we have found jobs for abroad , and now we have a shortage of qualified doctors here in germany .
we are now trying to encourage those german doctors and nurses spread across the european union to come back , " weber said .
science suffers every seventh person with a doctorate in science leaves germany for the united states , the scientist magazine has reported .
three of the four german nobel prize winners work in the united states .
" the trouble is that we are losing our highest achievers , " christoph anz of the confederation of german employers associations told the scientist .
" we have reached the point where we will no longer be able to compete in the booming biotechnology sector . "
gerd kempermann , a researcher in molecular medicine who has worked in the united states , says the work structure in other countries is often more attractive than in germany .
" the rules -lrb- in germany -rrb- do n't always fit everyone .
when someone realizes that they do n't fit into a certain formula then they begin to search for where their potential can be realized - where employers look to see what they can offer good employees . "
the most common complaints are that german research and development is under-funded and that institutes and universities are plagued by unwieldy bureaucracy .
" american universities offer scientists better pay conditions , more time for research and less time spent teaching , " said peter doermann , a research group leader at the max planck institute for molecular plant physiology near berlin .
some estimates say that scientists can earn three times as much money working in the united states compared to germany .
harming those who stay the brain drain can also hurt scientists working at home , doermann told deutsche welle .
" for me it 's a problem of collaboration , since the major players are in the u.s. there are some germans who were quite promising , and all of them went to the u.s. if you are below a critical number of people in a certain research area , you encounter problems applying for joint grants and european grants .
the german research foundation insists on only german research scientists , and if people leave there are n't enough left to collaborate , " he explained .
in an effort to reverse the trend , the german government last year said it would devote an extra € 100 million -lrb- $ 127 million -rrb- over the next four years to stimulate research and development in biotechnology in addition to the € 110 million already spent in the last three years .
announcing the package at the biotechnology day in leipzig in october , education and research minister edelgard bulmahn said the extra money would be directed to small- and medium-sized biotechnology companies .
gerd kempermann , for one , recently returned to germany to work at a local research clinic , but not because the conditions were better he said .
" they were for soft reasons , private reasons .
one ends up returning to where one comes from , " he explained .
kempermann is optimistic that despite the critical unemployment situation in the country - where 4.6 million people are registered jobless - the wealth of talent should encourage the public and private sector to invest in the human capital .
" i think that the motivation and the optimism will return quite quickly if a few fundamental conditions are changed .
if the government would support general research then we could have a flourishing landscape in no time . " margret steffen , dw staff -lrb- jsm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de are german universities losing their luster ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.02.2004 brain drain hurting germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these frankfurt students have n't left germany - yet germany 's brightest and best qualified young professionals are leaving the country in droves and securing lucrative positions abroad . educators are converging on cologne for europe 's largest education and training trade fair , which opened monday .
while german participants familiarize themselves with new methods , theories and teaching aids , the fruits of their labors continue to abandon ship .
after investing tens of thousands in education and training costs , germany is losing its best qualified professionals to better paid positions elsewhere , economists complain .
and the growing brain drain is compounding germany 's economic woes through the loss of skilled labor and human resources .
nearly 118,000 people packed up and left the country in 2002 for jobs abroad , the german statistical office reported .
mathis malchow is one of those who , along with his girlfriend , left germany for better prospects abroad .
" we just decided that we would try our luck in london , because it 's the only city that has the potential for growth , " the architect told deutsche welle .
malchow has indeed been lucky .
he has a job with the renowned british architect sir norman foster .
the highlight so far has been working on one of london 's most conspicuous new landmarks , the swiss re building , affectionately dubbed the " erotic gherkin " by locals .
malchow does n't regret leaving germany .
" it 's definitely been an enriching experience , " he said .
helping them to go , then urging them to come back besides the young professionals and academics who leave germany for work , young germans who have completed vocational training also have good chances of finding a job abroad .
eva-elisabeth weber , a job counselor at the central employment agency in bonn , noted that hoteliers , chefs , managers and mechanical engineers , in particular , have good career opportunities beyond germany .
each year the agency locates jobs for some 6,000 skilled laborers , professionals and managers outside of the country .
it also tries to coax them back home when germany needs them .
" there are many doctors who we have found jobs for abroad , and now we have a shortage of qualified doctors here in germany .
we are now trying to encourage those german doctors and nurses spread across the european union to come back , " weber said .
science suffers every seventh person with a doctorate in science leaves germany for the united states , the scientist magazine has reported .
three of the four german nobel prize winners work in the united states .
" the trouble is that we are losing our highest achievers , " christoph anz of the confederation of german employers associations told the scientist .
" we have reached the point where we will no longer be able to compete in the booming biotechnology sector . "
gerd kempermann , a researcher in molecular medicine who has worked in the united states , says the work structure in other countries is often more attractive than in germany .
" the rules -lrb- in germany -rrb- do n't always fit everyone .
when someone realizes that they do n't fit into a certain formula then they begin to search for where their potential can be realized - where employers look to see what they can offer good employees . "
the most common complaints are that german research and development is under-funded and that institutes and universities are plagued by unwieldy bureaucracy .
" american universities offer scientists better pay conditions , more time for research and less time spent teaching , " said peter doermann , a research group leader at the max planck institute for molecular plant physiology near berlin .
some estimates say that scientists can earn three times as much money working in the united states compared to germany .
harming those who stay the brain drain can also hurt scientists working at home , doermann told deutsche welle .
" for me it 's a problem of collaboration , since the major players are in the u.s. there are some germans who were quite promising , and all of them went to the u.s. if you are below a critical number of people in a certain research area , you encounter problems applying for joint grants and european grants .
the german research foundation insists on only german research scientists , and if people leave there are n't enough left to collaborate , " he explained .
in an effort to reverse the trend , the german government last year said it would devote an extra € 100 million -lrb- $ 127 million -rrb- over the next four years to stimulate research and development in biotechnology in addition to the € 110 million already spent in the last three years .
announcing the package at the biotechnology day in leipzig in october , education and research minister edelgard bulmahn said the extra money would be directed to small- and medium-sized biotechnology companies .
gerd kempermann , for one , recently returned to germany to work at a local research clinic , but not because the conditions were better he said .
" they were for soft reasons , private reasons .
one ends up returning to where one comes from , " he explained .
kempermann is optimistic that despite the critical unemployment situation in the country - where 4.6 million people are registered jobless - the wealth of talent should encourage the public and private sector to invest in the human capital .
" i think that the motivation and the optimism will return quite quickly if a few fundamental conditions are changed .
if the government would support general research then we could have a flourishing landscape in no time . " margret steffen , dw staff -lrb- jsm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de are german universities losing their luster ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 09.02.2004 german experts offer alternatives in afghan drug war großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan 's opium trade is flourishing while britain proposes a “ slash and burn ” policy in the fight against the afghan opium trade , the germans want to link education and prevention with development in a different type of war . the far-reaching plains of afghanistan hold a deadly secret through the spring .
as nature awakes from the harsh winter and blossoms begin to change the barren land , the opium poppy sleeps on .
a few months later , the fields will be full with beautiful red flowers . then the harvest begins ; the poppies are mowed and in the weeks that follow , the product that these plants hold within will hit the streets of western cities in the form of powder sold in small plastic bags . in an attempt to stop the tide of afghan heroin flooding european cities , politicians and representatives of international organizations have been meeting in kabul to discuss strategies to counter the country ’ s drug cultivation industry . britain and us favor burning fields bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but while the experts are united in their cause to stamp out the scourge of afghan heroin crossing their borders , there are conflicting views on what the best action is .
britain , which was given the role of stamping out afghanistan ’ s drug output at the bonn conference shortly after the fall of the taliban regime , is in favor of burning the poppy fields and destroying the drug labs . considered harsh by many , the united states supports such a " slash and burn " tactic . however , german experts wish to pursue alternative solutions .
“ these repressive measures do not correspond to our plan of lasting development , ” said christoph berg , project manager of the drugs and development scheme of the german society for technical cooperation -lrb- gtz -rrb- , in an interview with deutsche welle .
“ we want to show the farmers that there are alternatives to opium growing . ” farmers would prefer alternative income bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the warlords control their own areas and profit from the local crop .
research carried out by the gtz shows that the cultivation of wheat , wine , fruit or spices could well replace the production of heroin as a source of making a living for afghans .
" we have spoken with farmers .
many would stop growing opium if they could survive by producing other products , ” said berg , adding that all production of opium is illegal in afghanistan . the gtz experts in kabul form a part of a project investigating " drug control connected to development , " an eu supported initiative which is being funded by the bloc to the tune of € 9 million over the next three years .
the project intends to start the process of replacing the drug economy at the very roots by working with schools and health centers in the eastern provinces of laghman , kunar and nangarhar and to set up and strengthen alternative agricultural cooperatives . gtz must convince profiting warlords bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr soldiers on patrol in afghanistan .
the project will last for at least 10 to 15 years , according to berg , and it will take at least that long before the first successes becomes visible in the fight against drugs .
not everybody is so eager to cooperate .
“ we must also try to include the local warlords and work constructively with them , ” said berg .
the warlords profit from the drug business and the afghan economy relies heavily on it while there is little alternative .
convincing some of the benefits of other crops will take time . but the german focus is on a peaceful and progressive campaign against the drug trade emanating from afghanistan .
the military has also taken a non-aggressive stance on the opium business , especially as the bundeswehr attempts to win over the hearts and minds of the afghan people through its reconstruction efforts . germany rules out military intervention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heroin is a problem in most european cities .
the soldiers of the regional reconstruction team -lrb- prt -rrb- in the northern afghan city of kunduz are operating in one of the most opium rich areas of the country .
however , the german parliament only agreed the deployment of the force outside the relative safety of the international assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- mission in kabul on the condition that the 220 soldiers of the prt keep out of the fight with the drug barons . but despite the plans of the gtz and the resolution of the bundeswehr , the fight against the poppy growers and cultivators will go on as british and u.s. forces continue to target a way of life that not only provides their enemies with funds to fight on but also takes the war to the streets of their home nations . harvests improving every year according to the united nations , 2003 saw afghanistan ’ s second-best harvest ever registered : 3,600 metric tons of opium , material for 360 metric tons of heroin was produced last year .

as nature awakes from the harsh winter and blossoms begin to change the barren land , the opium poppy sleeps on .
a few months later , the fields will be full with beautiful red flowers . then the harvest begins ; the poppies are mowed and in the weeks that follow , the product that these plants hold within will hit the streets of western cities in the form of powder sold in small plastic bags . in an attempt to stop the tide of afghan heroin flooding european cities , politicians and representatives of international organizations have been meeting in kabul to discuss strategies to counter the country ’ s drug cultivation industry . britain and us favor burning fields bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but while the experts are united in their cause to stamp out the scourge of afghan heroin crossing their borders , there are conflicting views on what the best action is .
britain , which was given the role of stamping out afghanistan ’ s drug output at the bonn conference shortly after the fall of the taliban regime , is in favor of burning the poppy fields and destroying the drug labs . considered harsh by many , the united states supports such a " slash and burn " tactic . however , german experts wish to pursue alternative solutions .
“ these repressive measures do not correspond to our plan of lasting development , ” said christoph berg , project manager of the drugs and development scheme of the german society for technical cooperation -lrb- gtz -rrb- , in an interview with deutsche welle .
“ we want to show the farmers that there are alternatives to opium growing . ” farmers would prefer alternative income bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the warlords control their own areas and profit from the local crop .
research carried out by the gtz shows that the cultivation of wheat , wine , fruit or spices could well replace the production of heroin as a source of making a living for afghans .
" we have spoken with farmers .
many would stop growing opium if they could survive by producing other products , ” said berg , adding that all production of opium is illegal in afghanistan . the gtz experts in kabul form a part of a project investigating " drug control connected to development , " an eu supported initiative which is being funded by the bloc to the tune of € 9 million over the next three years .
the project intends to start the process of replacing the drug economy at the very roots by working with schools and health centers in the eastern provinces of laghman , kunar and nangarhar and to set up and strengthen alternative agricultural cooperatives . gtz must convince profiting warlords bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr soldiers on patrol in afghanistan .
the project will last for at least 10 to 15 years , according to berg , and it will take at least that long before the first successes becomes visible in the fight against drugs .
not everybody is so eager to cooperate .
“ we must also try to include the local warlords and work constructively with them , ” said berg .
the warlords profit from the drug business and the afghan economy relies heavily on it while there is little alternative .
convincing some of the benefits of other crops will take time . but the german focus is on a peaceful and progressive campaign against the drug trade emanating from afghanistan .
the military has also taken a non-aggressive stance on the opium business , especially as the bundeswehr attempts to win over the hearts and minds of the afghan people through its reconstruction efforts . germany rules out military intervention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heroin is a problem in most european cities .
the soldiers of the regional reconstruction team -lrb- prt -rrb- in the northern afghan city of kunduz are operating in one of the most opium rich areas of the country .
however , the german parliament only agreed the deployment of the force outside the relative safety of the international assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- mission in kabul on the condition that the 220 soldiers of the prt keep out of the fight with the drug barons . but despite the plans of the gtz and the resolution of the bundeswehr , the fight against the poppy growers and cultivators will go on as british and u.s. forces continue to target a way of life that not only provides their enemies with funds to fight on but also takes the war to the streets of their home nations . harvests improving every year according to the united nations , 2003 saw afghanistan ’ s second-best harvest ever registered : 3,600 metric tons of opium , material for 360 metric tons of heroin was produced last year .

while german participants familiarize themselves with new methods , theories and teaching aids , the fruits of their labors continue to abandon ship .
after investing tens of thousands in education and training costs , germany is losing its best qualified professionals to better paid positions elsewhere , economists complain .
and the growing brain drain is compounding germany 's economic woes through the loss of skilled labor and human resources .
nearly 118,000 people packed up and left the country in 2002 for jobs abroad , the german statistical office reported .
mathis malchow is one of those who , along with his girlfriend , left germany for better prospects abroad .
" we just decided that we would try our luck in london , because it 's the only city that has the potential for growth , " the architect told deutsche welle .
malchow has indeed been lucky .
he has a job with the renowned british architect sir norman foster .
the highlight so far has been working on one of london 's most conspicuous new landmarks , the swiss re building , affectionately dubbed the " erotic gherkin " by locals .
malchow does n't regret leaving germany .
" it 's definitely been an enriching experience , " he said .
helping them to go , then urging them to come back besides the young professionals and academics who leave germany for work , young germans who have completed vocational training also have good chances of finding a job abroad .
eva-elisabeth weber , a job counselor at the central employment agency in bonn , noted that hoteliers , chefs , managers and mechanical engineers , in particular , have good career opportunities beyond germany .
each year the agency locates jobs for some 6,000 skilled laborers , professionals and managers outside of the country .
it also tries to coax them back home when germany needs them .
" there are many doctors who we have found jobs for abroad , and now we have a shortage of qualified doctors here in germany .
we are now trying to encourage those german doctors and nurses spread across the european union to come back , " weber said .
science suffers every seventh person with a doctorate in science leaves germany for the united states , the scientist magazine has reported .
three of the four german nobel prize winners work in the united states .
" the trouble is that we are losing our highest achievers , " christoph anz of the confederation of german employers associations told the scientist .
" we have reached the point where we will no longer be able to compete in the booming biotechnology sector . "
gerd kempermann , a researcher in molecular medicine who has worked in the united states , says the work structure in other countries is often more attractive than in germany .
" the rules -lrb- in germany -rrb- do n't always fit everyone .
when someone realizes that they do n't fit into a certain formula then they begin to search for where their potential can be realized - where employers look to see what they can offer good employees . "
the most common complaints are that german research and development is under-funded and that institutes and universities are plagued by unwieldy bureaucracy .
" american universities offer scientists better pay conditions , more time for research and less time spent teaching , " said peter doermann , a research group leader at the max planck institute for molecular plant physiology near berlin .
some estimates say that scientists can earn three times as much money working in the united states compared to germany .
harming those who stay the brain drain can also hurt scientists working at home , doermann told deutsche welle .
" for me it 's a problem of collaboration , since the major players are in the u.s. there are some germans who were quite promising , and all of them went to the u.s. if you are below a critical number of people in a certain research area , you encounter problems applying for joint grants and european grants .
the german research foundation insists on only german research scientists , and if people leave there are n't enough left to collaborate , " he explained .
in an effort to reverse the trend , the german government last year said it would devote an extra € 100 million -lrb- $ 127 million -rrb- over the next four years to stimulate research and development in biotechnology in addition to the € 110 million already spent in the last three years .
announcing the package at the biotechnology day in leipzig in october , education and research minister edelgard bulmahn said the extra money would be directed to small- and medium-sized biotechnology companies .
gerd kempermann , for one , recently returned to germany to work at a local research clinic , but not because the conditions were better he said .
" they were for soft reasons , private reasons .
one ends up returning to where one comes from , " he explained .
kempermann is optimistic that despite the critical unemployment situation in the country - where 4.6 million people are registered jobless - the wealth of talent should encourage the public and private sector to invest in the human capital .
" i think that the motivation and the optimism will return quite quickly if a few fundamental conditions are changed .
if the government would support general research then we could have a flourishing landscape in no time . " margret steffen , dw staff -lrb- jsm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de are german universities losing their luster ?

german general götz gliemeroth handed over command of the nato-led peacekeeping force in afghanistan to canada on monday amid fresh security concerns following an emergence of suicide bomb attacks . after a year of steering the 6,420-strong multinational international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- charged with overseeing security in the afghan capital , german nato general goetz gliemeroth handed over the reins to canadian general rick hillier on monday .
the canadian troops with 2,000 soldiers make up the largest contingent of the nato-led isaf force .
it ’ s unclear how long they will remain in afghanistan .
the canadian contingent is expected to end its deployment in august , but canadian prime minister paul martin has said 500 soldiers will stay on after that period .
security fears rise after attacks the festive hand-over ceremony was marked by tight security following a recent wave of suicide bomb attacks which killed a canadian soldier in kabul last month and a british peacekeeper a day later .
the attacks , claimed by the taliban , came on the heels of a december suicide bombing in which five afghan security officials were killed in kabul .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaap de hoop scheffer earlier , jaap de hoop scheffer -lrb- photo -rrb- expressed concerns that the emergence of suicide bomb attacks on kabul peacekeepers showed that the capital was far from secure .
he called on the international community not to lose its focus on a nation still racked by violence , poverty and a booming drug trade .
" the situation is fragile , " de hoop scheffer told reporters aboard a u.s. military plane on his way to kabul .
" it ’ s extremely difficult to have a 100 percent defence against these horrible suicide attacks . ”
de hoop scheffer also underlined afghanistan ’ s importance for the military alliance .
" we now know that our future security , no matter where we are , is dependant on afghanistan ’ s security , " he said during the hand-over ceremony and warned that the international community needed to stay involved in afghanistan .
" the u.n. , the european union , japan and other important donors should stay fully committed to this country , " de hoop scheffer said .
" nato can provide security and stability , but the afghan people need housing and schooling and roofs over their heads . "
successes and challenges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lt-gen .
goetz f.e. gliemeroth , new commander of isaf , salutes as he arrives for the handover ceremony of commanding force from isaf to nato in kabul , afghanistan monday , aug .
11 , 2003 .
nato took command of the 5,000-strong international peacekeeping force in the afghan capital on monday , a historic move that marks the alliance 's first operation outside europe since it was created 54 years ago .
-lrb- ap photo / apichart weerawong -rrb- taking stock of germany ’ s isaf year , german general götz gliemeroth -lrb- photo -rrb- stressed that germany had notched up successes during its command of the isaf , most notably the smooth running of the loya jirga or the grand assembly that agreed on a new constitution for afghanistan in december .
he also said considerable progress was made in the program towards disarming some 10,000 militia in the country under germany ’ s leadership .
at the same time gliemeroth warned that the nexus between the local warlords who ran provincial private armies and the wealthy druglords posed one of the biggest threats to afghanistan ’ s future .
" deplorably we ’ re seeing a connection between this so-called warlordism , which means commanders who maintain armies for political reasons to exert pressure , and the funds that come from the drugs trade , " gliemeroth said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poppy farmer mohammad agha in afghanistan the general , who has suggested in the past that nato should tackle the issue even it meant violent conflicts with the drug mafia , insisted that cracking down on the flourishing drug trade should be made a priority .
" it ’ s a challenge that the international community must urgently take up .
i can only add that soldiers are the least appropriate means to combat the planting of opium and drug transport .
rather we need to set up the right structures in afghanistan and shore them with funds , " he said .
continuing commitment to afghanistan needed gliemeroth urged continuing engagement in the civil-military area .
he pointed towards the success of the first provincial reconstruction team -lrb- prt -rrb- in kunduz in northern afghanistan .
nato controls that area and the prt is involved in the reconstruction of hundreds of schools , hospitals , fountains and irrigation projects .
" i think our alliance partners have realized the central importance of such prts for the further development of afghanistan , " he said .
nato currently runs one prt , while the u.s-led force of 10,600 controls the remainder .
prts , whose members range from a few dozen to more than 200 , combine military and reconstruction roles in far-flung areas .
by next month there will be 13 prts across afghanistan .
nato ’ s peacekeeping force aims to set up five new teams over the next six months .
gliemeroth however warned that the situation in iraq shouldn ’ t be allowed to divert attention from afghanistan .
" currently , in all fairness to the situation in iraq , it has to be said that afghanistan has been largely overshadowed by the development there , " gliemeroth said .
" but i think the international community owes this land -lrb- afghanistan -rrb- a great deal .

britain , which was given the role of stamping out afghanistan ’ s drug output at the bonn conference shortly after the fall of the taliban regime , is in favor of burning the poppy fields and destroying the drug labs . considered harsh by many , the united states supports such a " slash and burn " tactic . however , german experts wish to pursue alternative solutions .
“ these repressive measures do not correspond to our plan of lasting development , ” said christoph berg , project manager of the drugs and development scheme of the german society for technical cooperation -lrb- gtz -rrb- , in an interview with deutsche welle .
“ we want to show the farmers that there are alternatives to opium growing . ” farmers would prefer alternative income bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the warlords control their own areas and profit from the local crop .

the warlords profit from the drug business and the afghan economy relies heavily on it while there is little alternative .
convincing some of the benefits of other crops will take time . but the german focus is on a peaceful and progressive campaign against the drug trade emanating from afghanistan .

the soldiers of the regional reconstruction team -lrb- prt -rrb- in the northern afghan city of kunduz are operating in one of the most opium rich areas of the country .
however , the german parliament only agreed the deployment of the force outside the relative safety of the international assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- mission in kabul on the condition that the 220 soldiers of the prt keep out of the fight with the drug barons . but despite the plans of the gtz and the resolution of the bundeswehr , the fight against the poppy growers and cultivators will go on as british and u.s. forces continue to target a way of life that not only provides their enemies with funds to fight on but also takes the war to the streets of their home nations . harvests improving every year according to the united nations , 2003 saw afghanistan ’ s second-best harvest ever registered : 3,600 metric tons of opium , material for 360 metric tons of heroin was produced last year .

" we have the german 's names , and we have as much evidence against them as we have against khan , " kasuri told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper . three germans had been implicated in " activities in the 1980s and 90s " kasuri said .
the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- would have to communicate any information about them to germany , he added .
" that 's not our thing . " at a security conference in munich on sunday , kasuri said " lots of europeans " had been involved .
the iaea and iran had given pakistan their names , he told the audience . investigations worldwide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the founder of pakistan 's nuclear program , dr. abdul qadeer khan , is seen in this march 19 , 1998 photo .
khan has admitted he transferred nuclear technology to iran , libya and north korea .
pakistani president pervez musharraf pardoned a. q. khan after he admitted on wednesday to passing on nuclear information to iran , libya and north korea .
following two months of investigations , musharraf effectively ruled out pursuing the issue any further .
khan , who was the chief developer of pakistan 's atomic bomb , claimed full responsibility , but observers allege that khan could not have acted without the military 's knowledge . at least four germans , including two former employees of the company leybold-heraeus , are suspected of taking part in illicit deals with khan , the spiegel newsmagazine has reported .

mikhail gorbachev … helmut kohl … david hasselhoff .
no , do not adjust your screens .
the list of those who contributed to the fall of the berlin wall and the end of communism has long been missing one name … until now . it was one of the defining moments of the twentieth century .
not only did it come to represent the collapse of the soviet union , the end of the communist dream and the concluding drama of the cold war , the fall of the berlin wall must also be remembered as the moment a nation that had been divided for 28 years came together .
thank you , david hasselhoff . excuse me ?
david hasselhoff ?
the man who made talking cars every small boy ’ s dream and scantily-clad , surgically enhanced beauties running in slow motion every teenage boy ’ s fantasy ?
surely the actor-slash-singer responsible for immortalizing such screen idols as michael knight and mitch buchannon can ’ t be accredited with bringing down a superpower and reuniting germany . well , according to the man himself , hasselhoff does indeed feel that he played his part in bringing about the fall of the berlin wall and aiding the reunification of east and west germany .
and not through some heroic spy chase across communist berlin at the wheel of his trusty car kitt or a daring rescue involving pamela anderson and a defecting russian diplomat in a thong .
no , hasselhoff believes his contribution came about through the unifying and healing power of his music . cover version caught the moment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after recording an english language cover version of the 1970s german hit , “ auf der strasse nach suden ” and renaming it “ looking for freedom , ” hasselhoff raced up the charts in the late summer of 1989 , just as a tide of revolution began rolling through eastern europe . the soft rock god had sublimely caught the moment by crooning the stirring lyrics : " i 've been lookin ' for freedom ; i 've been lookin ' so long ; i 've been lookin ' for freedom ; still the search goes on . "
and as a result , after spending several weeks at number one , the song became the anthem of some of those struggling to reconcile the broken nation . even as the hammers began to fall on the symbol of division , hasselhoff ’ s music was omnipresent ; the album of the same name was also germany ’ s best selling long player of the time , keeping less important records off the top spot for three months . freedom found bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " david , we love you ! "
at last , all those germans who had been looking for freedom eventually found it as the wall finally crumbled on november 9 , 1989 , allowing thousands of east germans to flood into west berlin to be reunited with loved ones and to buy long-forbidden albums from hasselhoff ’ s musical back catalogue . there was even a moment when the reunited country joined together to thank the man who had provided the soundtrack to such historic change .
after being invited to headline a new year ’ s eve concert at the brandenburg gate by former german chancellor helmut kohl , the people ’ s champion finally got his chance to deliver his song in person to an audience of almost a million reunited germans . playing to an audience of united germans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it was the first time germany had been unified , and close to a million east and west german fans stood together in the freezing cold at midnight watching me perform .
i was overcome with emotion , " he recalled in an interview with german magazine tv spielfilm . but official recognition evaded him .
“ i am a little bit sad that no photo of me hangs in the checkpoint charlie museum in berlin , ” he added with regret after his contribution to reunification failed to make it into the berlin wall commemorative exhibition at the former border crossing . museum missing hero 's portrait bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : checkpoint charlie .
but how can this be ?
surely a man who mobilized a divided nation , a man whose voice was the catalyst for revolution , should be honoured for his role in changing the world as many knew it back then . but the checkpoint charlie museum in berlin is n't quite convinced of the singer 's historical significance .
“ what did he do ? ” wondered the museum 's spokesperson when dw-world questioned why hasselhoff was not included in the hall of fame .
“ we didn ’ t know the song was that important .
we like mr. hasselhoff but there are no documents that record his role in the fall of the berlin wall . ” “ we do have a picture of roger moore as james bond though , ” the spokesperson offered up as a gesture to international stardom . and so , while a fictional spy is lauded for his work in promoting berlin , david hasselhoff must be content with making the next generation of germans whole again through his music . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de where 's the berlin wall ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 09.02.2004 preventing the next parmalat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parmalat - could it happen in germany ?
after the parmalat fiasco , the italian government has taken steps to reform the country 's regulatory system .
but do the reforms go far enough , and how do they compare to those elsewhere in europe , including germany ? the italian cabinet has approved a draft law aimed at reforming italy 's regulatory system .
the law , which is still subject to parliamentary approval , is the first step towards changing a system which , in the eyes of many , failed to prevent the multi-billion dollar parmalat scandal .
but after months of political wrangling , the tough original version of the bill was watered down - and may be further diluted before it gets final parliamentary approval sometime in the next three months - raising doubts about the current italian government 's ability to impose better corporate governance and soothe investor anxieties .
elsewhere in europe , including germany , steps have been taken to prevent a parmalat or enron-style meltdown .
but are the safeguards sufficient ?
italian economy minister hopes for radical reform the law approved by the italian government last week was very different from the one proposed by italy 's economy minister giulio tremonti .
shortly after parmalat first made the news in december , tremonti called for shifting oversight authority away from the bank of italy and giving more power to the anti-trust authority and consab , the italian equivalent of the united states ' federal exchange commission -lrb- fec -rrb- .
those found guilty of financial fraud would also face longer prison terms .
in short , tremonti hoped to consolidate italy 's complicated regulatory system , which is comprised of five parts , each devoted to different types of business , into a three-pronged system .
italian politicians reluctant to make big changes but tremonti faced tough opposition from the country 's business-mogul prime minister silvio berlusconi and his allies , who feared that a harsh response would be bad for business .
" we do n't need to turn an exceptional event into a witch hunt , which would make the running of an insurance or financial company difficult , " said berlusconi .
as it turned out the draft law did not , as some had hoped , consolidate the various authorities .
instead it strengthened consob with greater sanctioning powers and the authority to oversee corporate bond issues .
not everyone , including tremonti , was convinced .
" we would have liked a radical reform , and now we risk introducing a reform that is n't very incisive , " he said .
the german path to reform in an interview with deutsche welle , marco becht , the executive director of the european corporate governance institute and a professor of finance and economics at the university of brussels , points to the complexity of the issue .
" sometimes it is a case of management without enough shareholder oversight , as was the case with enron , and sometimes it is a case of a very powerful shareholder getting up to something , as was the case with parmalat , " he said .
" the tools you need in each of these situations is slightly different , " he added .
given the complexity of the task at hand , and the increasing complexity of multi-national corporations engaged in different types of business , what 's a government - say the one in berlin - to do ?
tremonti 's approach , consolidating various oversight authorities into a more cooperative powerful single entity , is an approach that has proven popular elsewhere in europe , according to ernst maug , a professor of business administration at humboldt university in berlin .
germany did so in 2002 , consolidating various regulatory agencies into bafin , the federal agency responsible for overseeing the entire financial sector .
" this seems to be the trend and makes a lot of sense to me , " maug told deutsche welle .
" it does n't make sense to have different regulatory agencies overseeing different sectors just because one security is called a stock and another a bond ; when you have one authority you have a better chance of catching things . "
what 's more , also in 2002 , the german corporate governance code , also known as the " kodex , " was implemented .
this code of " best practices " is not legally binding , but companies are now required to disclose in their annual reports the extent to which they comply with the code and explain opt-outs .
a german parmalat ?
these measures by no means guarantee that a corporate scandal like parmalat or enron wo n't happen in germany .
" could it happen here - yes , " says maug .
you will never have a system where everyone complies with the law all the time , he points out , and reducing these scandals to zero is not an option , since the resulting regulation could prove too costly for business .
brecht concurs .
" there is always a trade-off in trying to prevent the next parmalat from happening and restricting executives from being able to do business , " he says .
" with regulation , you have to do a cost-benefit analysis . "
in the meantime , governments in europe and the world over continue to debate how to strike the best balance . kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de how to say " enron " in italian casting new doubt on european corporate governance , leading italian food group parmalat announced last week the firm had a € 4-billion discrepancy in its books .

after the parmalat fiasco , the italian government has taken steps to reform the country 's regulatory system .
but do the reforms go far enough , and how do they compare to those elsewhere in europe , including germany ? the italian cabinet has approved a draft law aimed at reforming italy 's regulatory system .
the law , which is still subject to parliamentary approval , is the first step towards changing a system which , in the eyes of many , failed to prevent the multi-billion dollar parmalat scandal .
but after months of political wrangling , the tough original version of the bill was watered down - and may be further diluted before it gets final parliamentary approval sometime in the next three months - raising doubts about the current italian government 's ability to impose better corporate governance and soothe investor anxieties .
elsewhere in europe , including germany , steps have been taken to prevent a parmalat or enron-style meltdown .
but are the safeguards sufficient ?
italian economy minister hopes for radical reform the law approved by the italian government last week was very different from the one proposed by italy 's economy minister giulio tremonti .
shortly after parmalat first made the news in december , tremonti called for shifting oversight authority away from the bank of italy and giving more power to the anti-trust authority and consab , the italian equivalent of the united states ' federal exchange commission -lrb- fec -rrb- .
those found guilty of financial fraud would also face longer prison terms .
in short , tremonti hoped to consolidate italy 's complicated regulatory system , which is comprised of five parts , each devoted to different types of business , into a three-pronged system .
italian politicians reluctant to make big changes but tremonti faced tough opposition from the country 's business-mogul prime minister silvio berlusconi and his allies , who feared that a harsh response would be bad for business .
" we do n't need to turn an exceptional event into a witch hunt , which would make the running of an insurance or financial company difficult , " said berlusconi .
as it turned out the draft law did not , as some had hoped , consolidate the various authorities .
instead it strengthened consob with greater sanctioning powers and the authority to oversee corporate bond issues .
not everyone , including tremonti , was convinced .
" we would have liked a radical reform , and now we risk introducing a reform that is n't very incisive , " he said .
the german path to reform in an interview with deutsche welle , marco becht , the executive director of the european corporate governance institute and a professor of finance and economics at the university of brussels , points to the complexity of the issue .
" sometimes it is a case of management without enough shareholder oversight , as was the case with enron , and sometimes it is a case of a very powerful shareholder getting up to something , as was the case with parmalat , " he said .
" the tools you need in each of these situations is slightly different , " he added .
given the complexity of the task at hand , and the increasing complexity of multi-national corporations engaged in different types of business , what 's a government - say the one in berlin - to do ?
tremonti 's approach , consolidating various oversight authorities into a more cooperative powerful single entity , is an approach that has proven popular elsewhere in europe , according to ernst maug , a professor of business administration at humboldt university in berlin .
germany did so in 2002 , consolidating various regulatory agencies into bafin , the federal agency responsible for overseeing the entire financial sector .
" this seems to be the trend and makes a lot of sense to me , " maug told deutsche welle .
" it does n't make sense to have different regulatory agencies overseeing different sectors just because one security is called a stock and another a bond ; when you have one authority you have a better chance of catching things . "
what 's more , also in 2002 , the german corporate governance code , also known as the " kodex , " was implemented .
this code of " best practices " is not legally binding , but companies are now required to disclose in their annual reports the extent to which they comply with the code and explain opt-outs .
a german parmalat ?
these measures by no means guarantee that a corporate scandal like parmalat or enron wo n't happen in germany .
" could it happen here - yes , " says maug .
you will never have a system where everyone complies with the law all the time , he points out , and reducing these scandals to zero is not an option , since the resulting regulation could prove too costly for business .
brecht concurs .
" there is always a trade-off in trying to prevent the next parmalat from happening and restricting executives from being able to do business , " he says .
" with regulation , you have to do a cost-benefit analysis . "

germany did so in 2002 , consolidating various regulatory agencies into bafin , the federal agency responsible for overseeing the entire financial sector .
" this seems to be the trend and makes a lot of sense to me , " maug told deutsche welle .
" it does n't make sense to have different regulatory agencies overseeing different sectors just because one security is called a stock and another a bond ; when you have one authority you have a better chance of catching things . "

after the parmalat fiasco , the italian government has taken steps to reform the country 's regulatory system .
but do the reforms go far enough , and how do they compare to those elsewhere in europe , including germany ? the italian cabinet has approved a draft law aimed at reforming italy 's regulatory system .
the law , which is still subject to parliamentary approval , is the first step towards changing a system which , in the eyes of many , failed to prevent the multi-billion dollar parmalat scandal .
but after months of political wrangling , the tough original version of the bill was watered down - and may be further diluted before it gets final parliamentary approval sometime in the next three months - raising doubts about the current italian government 's ability to impose better corporate governance and soothe investor anxieties .
elsewhere in europe , including germany , steps have been taken to prevent a parmalat or enron-style meltdown .
but are the safeguards sufficient ?
italian economy minister hopes for radical reform the law approved by the italian government last week was very different from the one proposed by italy 's economy minister giulio tremonti .
shortly after parmalat first made the news in december , tremonti called for shifting oversight authority away from the bank of italy and giving more power to the anti-trust authority and consab , the italian equivalent of the united states ' federal exchange commission -lrb- fec -rrb- .
those found guilty of financial fraud would also face longer prison terms .
in short , tremonti hoped to consolidate italy 's complicated regulatory system , which is comprised of five parts , each devoted to different types of business , into a three-pronged system .
italian politicians reluctant to make big changes but tremonti faced tough opposition from the country 's business-mogul prime minister silvio berlusconi and his allies , who feared that a harsh response would be bad for business .
" we do n't need to turn an exceptional event into a witch hunt , which would make the running of an insurance or financial company difficult , " said berlusconi .
as it turned out the draft law did not , as some had hoped , consolidate the various authorities .
instead it strengthened consob with greater sanctioning powers and the authority to oversee corporate bond issues .
not everyone , including tremonti , was convinced .
" we would have liked a radical reform , and now we risk introducing a reform that is n't very incisive , " he said .
the german path to reform in an interview with deutsche welle , marco becht , the executive director of the european corporate governance institute and a professor of finance and economics at the university of brussels , points to the complexity of the issue .
" sometimes it is a case of management without enough shareholder oversight , as was the case with enron , and sometimes it is a case of a very powerful shareholder getting up to something , as was the case with parmalat , " he said .
" the tools you need in each of these situations is slightly different , " he added .

german general götz gliemeroth handed over command of the nato-led peacekeeping force in afghanistan to canada on monday amid fresh security concerns following an emergence of suicide bomb attacks . after a year of steering the 6,420-strong multinational international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- charged with overseeing security in the afghan capital , german nato general goetz gliemeroth handed over the reins to canadian general rick hillier on monday .
the canadian troops with 2,000 soldiers make up the largest contingent of the nato-led isaf force .
it ’ s unclear how long they will remain in afghanistan .
the canadian contingent is expected to end its deployment in august , but canadian prime minister paul martin has said 500 soldiers will stay on after that period .
security fears rise after attacks the festive hand-over ceremony was marked by tight security following a recent wave of suicide bomb attacks which killed a canadian soldier in kabul last month and a british peacekeeper a day later .
the attacks , claimed by the taliban , came on the heels of a december suicide bombing in which five afghan security officials were killed in kabul .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaap de hoop scheffer earlier , jaap de hoop scheffer -lrb- photo -rrb- expressed concerns that the emergence of suicide bomb attacks on kabul peacekeepers showed that the capital was far from secure .
he called on the international community not to lose its focus on a nation still racked by violence , poverty and a booming drug trade .
" the situation is fragile , " de hoop scheffer told reporters aboard a u.s. military plane on his way to kabul .
" it ’ s extremely difficult to have a 100 percent defence against these horrible suicide attacks . ”
de hoop scheffer also underlined afghanistan ’ s importance for the military alliance .
" we now know that our future security , no matter where we are , is dependant on afghanistan ’ s security , " he said during the hand-over ceremony and warned that the international community needed to stay involved in afghanistan .
" the u.n. , the european union , japan and other important donors should stay fully committed to this country , " de hoop scheffer said .
" nato can provide security and stability , but the afghan people need housing and schooling and roofs over their heads . "
successes and challenges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lt-gen .
goetz f.e. gliemeroth , new commander of isaf , salutes as he arrives for the handover ceremony of commanding force from isaf to nato in kabul , afghanistan monday , aug .
11 , 2003 .
nato took command of the 5,000-strong international peacekeeping force in the afghan capital on monday , a historic move that marks the alliance 's first operation outside europe since it was created 54 years ago .
-lrb- ap photo / apichart weerawong -rrb- taking stock of germany ’ s isaf year , german general götz gliemeroth -lrb- photo -rrb- stressed that germany had notched up successes during its command of the isaf , most notably the smooth running of the loya jirga or the grand assembly that agreed on a new constitution for afghanistan in december .
he also said considerable progress was made in the program towards disarming some 10,000 militia in the country under germany ’ s leadership .
at the same time gliemeroth warned that the nexus between the local warlords who ran provincial private armies and the wealthy druglords posed one of the biggest threats to afghanistan ’ s future .
" deplorably we ’ re seeing a connection between this so-called warlordism , which means commanders who maintain armies for political reasons to exert pressure , and the funds that come from the drugs trade , " gliemeroth said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poppy farmer mohammad agha in afghanistan the general , who has suggested in the past that nato should tackle the issue even it meant violent conflicts with the drug mafia , insisted that cracking down on the flourishing drug trade should be made a priority .
" it ’ s a challenge that the international community must urgently take up .
i can only add that soldiers are the least appropriate means to combat the planting of opium and drug transport .
rather we need to set up the right structures in afghanistan and shore them with funds , " he said .
continuing commitment to afghanistan needed gliemeroth urged continuing engagement in the civil-military area .
he pointed towards the success of the first provincial reconstruction team -lrb- prt -rrb- in kunduz in northern afghanistan .
nato controls that area and the prt is involved in the reconstruction of hundreds of schools , hospitals , fountains and irrigation projects .
" i think our alliance partners have realized the central importance of such prts for the further development of afghanistan , " he said .
nato currently runs one prt , while the u.s-led force of 10,600 controls the remainder .
prts , whose members range from a few dozen to more than 200 , combine military and reconstruction roles in far-flung areas .
by next month there will be 13 prts across afghanistan .
nato ’ s peacekeeping force aims to set up five new teams over the next six months .
gliemeroth however warned that the situation in iraq shouldn ’ t be allowed to divert attention from afghanistan .
" currently , in all fairness to the situation in iraq , it has to be said that afghanistan has been largely overshadowed by the development there , " gliemeroth said .
" but i think the international community owes this land -lrb- afghanistan -rrb- a great deal .

while german participants familiarize themselves with new methods , theories and teaching aids , the fruits of their labors continue to abandon ship .
after investing tens of thousands in education and training costs , germany is losing its best qualified professionals to better paid positions elsewhere , economists complain .
and the growing brain drain is compounding germany 's economic woes through the loss of skilled labor and human resources .
nearly 118,000 people packed up and left the country in 2002 for jobs abroad , the german statistical office reported .
mathis malchow is one of those who , along with his girlfriend , left germany for better prospects abroad .
" we just decided that we would try our luck in london , because it 's the only city that has the potential for growth , " the architect told deutsche welle .
malchow has indeed been lucky .
he has a job with the renowned british architect sir norman foster .
the highlight so far has been working on one of london 's most conspicuous new landmarks , the swiss re building , affectionately dubbed the " erotic gherkin " by locals .
malchow does n't regret leaving germany .
" it 's definitely been an enriching experience , " he said .
helping them to go , then urging them to come back besides the young professionals and academics who leave germany for work , young germans who have completed vocational training also have good chances of finding a job abroad .
eva-elisabeth weber , a job counselor at the central employment agency in bonn , noted that hoteliers , chefs , managers and mechanical engineers , in particular , have good career opportunities beyond germany .
each year the agency locates jobs for some 6,000 skilled laborers , professionals and managers outside of the country .
it also tries to coax them back home when germany needs them .
" there are many doctors who we have found jobs for abroad , and now we have a shortage of qualified doctors here in germany .
we are now trying to encourage those german doctors and nurses spread across the european union to come back , " weber said .
science suffers every seventh person with a doctorate in science leaves germany for the united states , the scientist magazine has reported .
three of the four german nobel prize winners work in the united states .
" the trouble is that we are losing our highest achievers , " christoph anz of the confederation of german employers associations told the scientist .
" we have reached the point where we will no longer be able to compete in the booming biotechnology sector . "
gerd kempermann , a researcher in molecular medicine who has worked in the united states , says the work structure in other countries is often more attractive than in germany .
" the rules -lrb- in germany -rrb- do n't always fit everyone .
when someone realizes that they do n't fit into a certain formula then they begin to search for where their potential can be realized - where employers look to see what they can offer good employees . "
the most common complaints are that german research and development is under-funded and that institutes and universities are plagued by unwieldy bureaucracy .
" american universities offer scientists better pay conditions , more time for research and less time spent teaching , " said peter doermann , a research group leader at the max planck institute for molecular plant physiology near berlin .
some estimates say that scientists can earn three times as much money working in the united states compared to germany .
harming those who stay the brain drain can also hurt scientists working at home , doermann told deutsche welle .
" for me it 's a problem of collaboration , since the major players are in the u.s. there are some germans who were quite promising , and all of them went to the u.s. if you are below a critical number of people in a certain research area , you encounter problems applying for joint grants and european grants .
the german research foundation insists on only german research scientists , and if people leave there are n't enough left to collaborate , " he explained .
in an effort to reverse the trend , the german government last year said it would devote an extra € 100 million -lrb- $ 127 million -rrb- over the next four years to stimulate research and development in biotechnology in addition to the € 110 million already spent in the last three years .
announcing the package at the biotechnology day in leipzig in october , education and research minister edelgard bulmahn said the extra money would be directed to small- and medium-sized biotechnology companies .
gerd kempermann , for one , recently returned to germany to work at a local research clinic , but not because the conditions were better he said .
" they were for soft reasons , private reasons .
one ends up returning to where one comes from , " he explained .
kempermann is optimistic that despite the critical unemployment situation in the country - where 4.6 million people are registered jobless - the wealth of talent should encourage the public and private sector to invest in the human capital .
" i think that the motivation and the optimism will return quite quickly if a few fundamental conditions are changed .

after his resignation as social democratic party chairman on friday , german chancellor gerhard schröder on saturday named his likely successors , who he hopes will bring the party together on difficult reforms . these are days of surprise in the corridors of the germany ’ s governing party , the social democrats .
few had any idea on friday morning that chancellor gerhard schröder would resign from his post as head of the social democratic party and hand the reins over to franz müntefering , the party ’ s parliamentary group chairman .
then , on saturday , he named a successor for the party 's luckless general secretary , olaf scholz .
" on march 21 , the spd is going to call a special party conference , " schröder told reporters saturday .
" the party executive will unanimously nominate franz müntefering as its new party chairman .
and the party executive will also nominate klaus uwe benneter as the spd ’ s new general secretary with the same number of votes . "
a new deputy 56-year-old lawyer benneter , also a member of the german parliament , the bundestag , is also a close friend of schröder .
during the turbulent 70s , the two were active together in the spd ’ s young socialists at a time when the spd ’ s youth group had taken an extreme left political course .
at one point , benneter was even temporarily banned from the party because he had spoken out in favor of cooperation with communists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus-uwe benneter today ’ s an altogether different story .
these days , benneter -lrb- photo -rrb- calls for deep cuts into germany ’ s social system , for reforms of the labor market and public healthcare system – all initiatives that have drawn heavy criticism from the social democrats ’ party base and voters .
together , benneter and müntefering are expected to bring the party ’ s traditional leftist core into line with the government ’ s planned reforms .
müntefering calls for broad party debate on reforms müntefering said saturday he wanted to speak clear language about " equitableness , " one of the core principles of european social democratic movements . " that ’ s not just a saying , " müntefering said , " rather , it is something that has always been a deep part of this party ’ s history .
whoever speaks of ‘ equitableness ’ has to start with equal opportunities .
and they have to start with the fact that that is not functioning in the scope that we desire .
we ’ ve spoken of our solid determination to create a situation where young people in this country aren ’ t able to fall from school desk to the unemployment rolls .
the situation can ’ t stay as it is . "
speaking on a handful of german public broadcasting stations on saturday , müntefering said he wants to involve the party in the government ’ s reform policies more than in the past , admitting to ard that the reform policy negotiations within the party had been " suboptimal . "
in the future , he said reforms needed to be prepared more " cautiously . "
in an interview with zdf , he said he intended to open an intensive debate within the party about planned reforms while at the same time standing shoulder to shoulder with the government .
a deft political move ?
the first reactions coming out of the party this weekend suggest schröder made a deft political move by resigning from his position as party chairman .
the chancellor made clear on saturday that the party reins would soon be tightened , and that even in his cabinet there was no breathing room left for error .
in other words : controversial members of the cabinet , like transport minister manfred stolpe who has overseen the trouble-plagued implementation of tolls for heavy trucks and transports on germany highways , are now on probation . indeed , in recent weeks the pages of germany 's top newspapers and magazines have been filled with speculation of a possible shakeup of schröder 's cabinet .
schröder said the party needed to put its collective energy toward the different tasks required for safeguarding and implementing the reform process .
opposition : spd falling apart the minority opposition , neo-liberal free democratic party immediately criticized benneter ’ s nomination , lambasting the move as a signal that the spd is shifting to the left .
and dieter althaus of the christian democratic union said that the decision by the spd to appoint a relatively unknown politician to the position of general secretary showed how difficult it had become for the party to find leaders .
earlier , cdu chairwoman angela merkel and the head of the cdu ’ s bavarian sister party , the christian social union , edmund stoiber , both said schröder ’ s resignation marked the " beginning of the end " of the party . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder leaves an unloved post by quitting as the head of the social democratic party on friday , gerhard schröder left an office he hardly loved .

after his resignation as social democratic party chairman on friday , german chancellor gerhard schröder on saturday named his likely successors , who he hopes will bring the party together on difficult reforms . these are days of surprise in the corridors of the germany ’ s governing party , the social democrats .
few had any idea on friday morning that chancellor gerhard schröder would resign from his post as head of the social democratic party and hand the reins over to franz müntefering , the party ’ s parliamentary group chairman .
then , on saturday , he named a successor for the party 's luckless general secretary , olaf scholz .
" on march 21 , the spd is going to call a special party conference , " schröder told reporters saturday .
" the party executive will unanimously nominate franz müntefering as its new party chairman .
and the party executive will also nominate klaus uwe benneter as the spd ’ s new general secretary with the same number of votes . "
a new deputy 56-year-old lawyer benneter , also a member of the german parliament , the bundestag , is also a close friend of schröder .
during the turbulent 70s , the two were active together in the spd ’ s young socialists at a time when the spd ’ s youth group had taken an extreme left political course .
at one point , benneter was even temporarily banned from the party because he had spoken out in favor of cooperation with communists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus-uwe benneter today ’ s an altogether different story .
these days , benneter -lrb- photo -rrb- calls for deep cuts into germany ’ s social system , for reforms of the labor market and public healthcare system – all initiatives that have drawn heavy criticism from the social democrats ’ party base and voters .
together , benneter and müntefering are expected to bring the party ’ s traditional leftist core into line with the government ’ s planned reforms .
müntefering calls for broad party debate on reforms müntefering said saturday he wanted to speak clear language about " equitableness , " one of the core principles of european social democratic movements . " that ’ s not just a saying , " müntefering said , " rather , it is something that has always been a deep part of this party ’ s history .

and the party executive will also nominate klaus uwe benneter as the spd ’ s new general secretary with the same number of votes . "
a new deputy 56-year-old lawyer benneter , also a member of the german parliament , the bundestag , is also a close friend of schröder .
during the turbulent 70s , the two were active together in the spd ’ s young socialists at a time when the spd ’ s youth group had taken an extreme left political course .
at one point , benneter was even temporarily banned from the party because he had spoken out in favor of cooperation with communists .

these days , benneter -lrb- photo -rrb- calls for deep cuts into germany ’ s social system , for reforms of the labor market and public healthcare system – all initiatives that have drawn heavy criticism from the social democrats ’ party base and voters .
together , benneter and müntefering are expected to bring the party ’ s traditional leftist core into line with the government ’ s planned reforms .
müntefering calls for broad party debate on reforms müntefering said saturday he wanted to speak clear language about " equitableness , " one of the core principles of european social democratic movements . " that ’ s not just a saying , " müntefering said , " rather , it is something that has always been a deep part of this party ’ s history .
whoever speaks of ‘ equitableness ’ has to start with equal opportunities .
and they have to start with the fact that that is not functioning in the scope that we desire .
we ’ ve spoken of our solid determination to create a situation where young people in this country aren ’ t able to fall from school desk to the unemployment rolls .
the situation can ’ t stay as it is . "
speaking on a handful of german public broadcasting stations on saturday , müntefering said he wants to involve the party in the government ’ s reform policies more than in the past , admitting to ard that the reform policy negotiations within the party had been " suboptimal . "
in the future , he said reforms needed to be prepared more " cautiously . "
in an interview with zdf , he said he intended to open an intensive debate within the party about planned reforms while at the same time standing shoulder to shoulder with the government .
a deft political move ?
the first reactions coming out of the party this weekend suggest schröder made a deft political move by resigning from his position as party chairman .
the chancellor made clear on saturday that the party reins would soon be tightened , and that even in his cabinet there was no breathing room left for error .
in other words : controversial members of the cabinet , like transport minister manfred stolpe who has overseen the trouble-plagued implementation of tolls for heavy trucks and transports on germany highways , are now on probation . indeed , in recent weeks the pages of germany 's top newspapers and magazines have been filled with speculation of a possible shakeup of schröder 's cabinet .
schröder said the party needed to put its collective energy toward the different tasks required for safeguarding and implementing the reform process .
opposition : spd falling apart the minority opposition , neo-liberal free democratic party immediately criticized benneter ’ s nomination , lambasting the move as a signal that the spd is shifting to the left .
and dieter althaus of the christian democratic union said that the decision by the spd to appoint a relatively unknown politician to the position of general secretary showed how difficult it had become for the party to find leaders .

after his resignation as social democratic party chairman on friday , german chancellor gerhard schröder on saturday named his likely successors , who he hopes will bring the party together on difficult reforms . these are days of surprise in the corridors of the germany ’ s governing party , the social democrats .
few had any idea on friday morning that chancellor gerhard schröder would resign from his post as head of the social democratic party and hand the reins over to franz müntefering , the party ’ s parliamentary group chairman .
then , on saturday , he named a successor for the party 's luckless general secretary , olaf scholz .
" on march 21 , the spd is going to call a special party conference , " schröder told reporters saturday .
" the party executive will unanimously nominate franz müntefering as its new party chairman .

" we have the german 's names , and we have as much evidence against them as we have against khan , " kasuri told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper . three germans had been implicated in " activities in the 1980s and 90s " kasuri said .
the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- would have to communicate any information about them to germany , he added .
" that 's not our thing . " at a security conference in munich on sunday , kasuri said " lots of europeans " had been involved .
the iaea and iran had given pakistan their names , he told the audience . investigations worldwide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the founder of pakistan 's nuclear program , dr. abdul qadeer khan , is seen in this march 19 , 1998 photo .
khan has admitted he transferred nuclear technology to iran , libya and north korea .
pakistani president pervez musharraf pardoned a. q. khan after he admitted on wednesday to passing on nuclear information to iran , libya and north korea .
following two months of investigations , musharraf effectively ruled out pursuing the issue any further .
khan , who was the chief developer of pakistan 's atomic bomb , claimed full responsibility , but observers allege that khan could not have acted without the military 's knowledge . at least four germans , including two former employees of the company leybold-heraeus , are suspected of taking part in illicit deals with khan , the spiegel newsmagazine has reported .
the united nations and the german customs crime agency are investigating the german links . this is not the first time that german ties to the pakistani nuclear program have raised suspicions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.02.2004 brain drain hurting germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these frankfurt students have n't left germany - yet germany 's brightest and best qualified young professionals are leaving the country in droves and securing lucrative positions abroad . educators are converging on cologne for europe 's largest education and training trade fair , which opened monday .
while german participants familiarize themselves with new methods , theories and teaching aids , the fruits of their labors continue to abandon ship .
after investing tens of thousands in education and training costs , germany is losing its best qualified professionals to better paid positions elsewhere , economists complain .
and the growing brain drain is compounding germany 's economic woes through the loss of skilled labor and human resources .
nearly 118,000 people packed up and left the country in 2002 for jobs abroad , the german statistical office reported .
mathis malchow is one of those who , along with his girlfriend , left germany for better prospects abroad .
" we just decided that we would try our luck in london , because it 's the only city that has the potential for growth , " the architect told deutsche welle .
malchow has indeed been lucky .
he has a job with the renowned british architect sir norman foster .
the highlight so far has been working on one of london 's most conspicuous new landmarks , the swiss re building , affectionately dubbed the " erotic gherkin " by locals .
malchow does n't regret leaving germany .
" it 's definitely been an enriching experience , " he said .
helping them to go , then urging them to come back besides the young professionals and academics who leave germany for work , young germans who have completed vocational training also have good chances of finding a job abroad .
eva-elisabeth weber , a job counselor at the central employment agency in bonn , noted that hoteliers , chefs , managers and mechanical engineers , in particular , have good career opportunities beyond germany .
each year the agency locates jobs for some 6,000 skilled laborers , professionals and managers outside of the country .
it also tries to coax them back home when germany needs them .
" there are many doctors who we have found jobs for abroad , and now we have a shortage of qualified doctors here in germany .
we are now trying to encourage those german doctors and nurses spread across the european union to come back , " weber said .
science suffers every seventh person with a doctorate in science leaves germany for the united states , the scientist magazine has reported .
three of the four german nobel prize winners work in the united states .
" the trouble is that we are losing our highest achievers , " christoph anz of the confederation of german employers associations told the scientist .
" we have reached the point where we will no longer be able to compete in the booming biotechnology sector . "
gerd kempermann , a researcher in molecular medicine who has worked in the united states , says the work structure in other countries is often more attractive than in germany .
" the rules -lrb- in germany -rrb- do n't always fit everyone .
when someone realizes that they do n't fit into a certain formula then they begin to search for where their potential can be realized - where employers look to see what they can offer good employees . "
the most common complaints are that german research and development is under-funded and that institutes and universities are plagued by unwieldy bureaucracy .
" american universities offer scientists better pay conditions , more time for research and less time spent teaching , " said peter doermann , a research group leader at the max planck institute for molecular plant physiology near berlin .
some estimates say that scientists can earn three times as much money working in the united states compared to germany .
harming those who stay the brain drain can also hurt scientists working at home , doermann told deutsche welle .
" for me it 's a problem of collaboration , since the major players are in the u.s. there are some germans who were quite promising , and all of them went to the u.s. if you are below a critical number of people in a certain research area , you encounter problems applying for joint grants and european grants .
the german research foundation insists on only german research scientists , and if people leave there are n't enough left to collaborate , " he explained .
in an effort to reverse the trend , the german government last year said it would devote an extra € 100 million -lrb- $ 127 million -rrb- over the next four years to stimulate research and development in biotechnology in addition to the € 110 million already spent in the last three years .
announcing the package at the biotechnology day in leipzig in october , education and research minister edelgard bulmahn said the extra money would be directed to small- and medium-sized biotechnology companies .
gerd kempermann , for one , recently returned to germany to work at a local research clinic , but not because the conditions were better he said .
" they were for soft reasons , private reasons .
one ends up returning to where one comes from , " he explained .

while german participants familiarize themselves with new methods , theories and teaching aids , the fruits of their labors continue to abandon ship .
after investing tens of thousands in education and training costs , germany is losing its best qualified professionals to better paid positions elsewhere , economists complain .
and the growing brain drain is compounding germany 's economic woes through the loss of skilled labor and human resources .
nearly 118,000 people packed up and left the country in 2002 for jobs abroad , the german statistical office reported .
mathis malchow is one of those who , along with his girlfriend , left germany for better prospects abroad .
" we just decided that we would try our luck in london , because it 's the only city that has the potential for growth , " the architect told deutsche welle .
malchow has indeed been lucky .
he has a job with the renowned british architect sir norman foster .
the highlight so far has been working on one of london 's most conspicuous new landmarks , the swiss re building , affectionately dubbed the " erotic gherkin " by locals .
malchow does n't regret leaving germany .
" it 's definitely been an enriching experience , " he said .
helping them to go , then urging them to come back besides the young professionals and academics who leave germany for work , young germans who have completed vocational training also have good chances of finding a job abroad .
eva-elisabeth weber , a job counselor at the central employment agency in bonn , noted that hoteliers , chefs , managers and mechanical engineers , in particular , have good career opportunities beyond germany .
each year the agency locates jobs for some 6,000 skilled laborers , professionals and managers outside of the country .
it also tries to coax them back home when germany needs them .
" there are many doctors who we have found jobs for abroad , and now we have a shortage of qualified doctors here in germany .
we are now trying to encourage those german doctors and nurses spread across the european union to come back , " weber said .
science suffers every seventh person with a doctorate in science leaves germany for the united states , the scientist magazine has reported .
three of the four german nobel prize winners work in the united states .
" the trouble is that we are losing our highest achievers , " christoph anz of the confederation of german employers associations told the scientist .
" we have reached the point where we will no longer be able to compete in the booming biotechnology sector . "
gerd kempermann , a researcher in molecular medicine who has worked in the united states , says the work structure in other countries is often more attractive than in germany .
" the rules -lrb- in germany -rrb- do n't always fit everyone .
when someone realizes that they do n't fit into a certain formula then they begin to search for where their potential can be realized - where employers look to see what they can offer good employees . "
the most common complaints are that german research and development is under-funded and that institutes and universities are plagued by unwieldy bureaucracy .
" american universities offer scientists better pay conditions , more time for research and less time spent teaching , " said peter doermann , a research group leader at the max planck institute for molecular plant physiology near berlin .
some estimates say that scientists can earn three times as much money working in the united states compared to germany .
harming those who stay the brain drain can also hurt scientists working at home , doermann told deutsche welle .
" for me it 's a problem of collaboration , since the major players are in the u.s. there are some germans who were quite promising , and all of them went to the u.s. if you are below a critical number of people in a certain research area , you encounter problems applying for joint grants and european grants .
the german research foundation insists on only german research scientists , and if people leave there are n't enough left to collaborate , " he explained .
in an effort to reverse the trend , the german government last year said it would devote an extra € 100 million -lrb- $ 127 million -rrb- over the next four years to stimulate research and development in biotechnology in addition to the € 110 million already spent in the last three years .
announcing the package at the biotechnology day in leipzig in october , education and research minister edelgard bulmahn said the extra money would be directed to small- and medium-sized biotechnology companies .
gerd kempermann , for one , recently returned to germany to work at a local research clinic , but not because the conditions were better he said .
" they were for soft reasons , private reasons .
one ends up returning to where one comes from , " he explained .
kempermann is optimistic that despite the critical unemployment situation in the country - where 4.6 million people are registered jobless - the wealth of talent should encourage the public and private sector to invest in the human capital .

mikhail gorbachev … helmut kohl … david hasselhoff .
no , do not adjust your screens .
the list of those who contributed to the fall of the berlin wall and the end of communism has long been missing one name … until now . it was one of the defining moments of the twentieth century .
not only did it come to represent the collapse of the soviet union , the end of the communist dream and the concluding drama of the cold war , the fall of the berlin wall must also be remembered as the moment a nation that had been divided for 28 years came together .
thank you , david hasselhoff . excuse me ?
david hasselhoff ?
the man who made talking cars every small boy ’ s dream and scantily-clad , surgically enhanced beauties running in slow motion every teenage boy ’ s fantasy ?
surely the actor-slash-singer responsible for immortalizing such screen idols as michael knight and mitch buchannon can ’ t be accredited with bringing down a superpower and reuniting germany . well , according to the man himself , hasselhoff does indeed feel that he played his part in bringing about the fall of the berlin wall and aiding the reunification of east and west germany .
and not through some heroic spy chase across communist berlin at the wheel of his trusty car kitt or a daring rescue involving pamela anderson and a defecting russian diplomat in a thong .
no , hasselhoff believes his contribution came about through the unifying and healing power of his music . cover version caught the moment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after recording an english language cover version of the 1970s german hit , “ auf der strasse nach suden ” and renaming it “ looking for freedom , ” hasselhoff raced up the charts in the late summer of 1989 , just as a tide of revolution began rolling through eastern europe . the soft rock god had sublimely caught the moment by crooning the stirring lyrics : " i 've been lookin ' for freedom ; i 've been lookin ' so long ; i 've been lookin ' for freedom ; still the search goes on . "
and as a result , after spending several weeks at number one , the song became the anthem of some of those struggling to reconcile the broken nation . even as the hammers began to fall on the symbol of division , hasselhoff ’ s music was omnipresent ; the album of the same name was also germany ’ s best selling long player of the time , keeping less important records off the top spot for three months . freedom found bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " david , we love you ! "
at last , all those germans who had been looking for freedom eventually found it as the wall finally crumbled on november 9 , 1989 , allowing thousands of east germans to flood into west berlin to be reunited with loved ones and to buy long-forbidden albums from hasselhoff ’ s musical back catalogue . there was even a moment when the reunited country joined together to thank the man who had provided the soundtrack to such historic change .
after being invited to headline a new year ’ s eve concert at the brandenburg gate by former german chancellor helmut kohl , the people ’ s champion finally got his chance to deliver his song in person to an audience of almost a million reunited germans . playing to an audience of united germans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it was the first time germany had been unified , and close to a million east and west german fans stood together in the freezing cold at midnight watching me perform .
i was overcome with emotion , " he recalled in an interview with german magazine tv spielfilm . but official recognition evaded him .
“ i am a little bit sad that no photo of me hangs in the checkpoint charlie museum in berlin , ” he added with regret after his contribution to reunification failed to make it into the berlin wall commemorative exhibition at the former border crossing . museum missing hero 's portrait bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : checkpoint charlie .
but how can this be ?
surely a man who mobilized a divided nation , a man whose voice was the catalyst for revolution , should be honoured for his role in changing the world as many knew it back then . but the checkpoint charlie museum in berlin is n't quite convinced of the singer 's historical significance .
“ what did he do ? ” wondered the museum 's spokesperson when dw-world questioned why hasselhoff was not included in the hall of fame .
“ we didn ’ t know the song was that important .
we like mr. hasselhoff but there are no documents that record his role in the fall of the berlin wall . ” “ we do have a picture of roger moore as james bond though , ” the spokesperson offered up as a gesture to international stardom . and so , while a fictional spy is lauded for his work in promoting berlin , david hasselhoff must be content with making the next generation of germans whole again through his music . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de where 's the berlin wall ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 09.02.2004 preventing the next parmalat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parmalat - could it happen in germany ?
after the parmalat fiasco , the italian government has taken steps to reform the country 's regulatory system .
but do the reforms go far enough , and how do they compare to those elsewhere in europe , including germany ? the italian cabinet has approved a draft law aimed at reforming italy 's regulatory system .
the law , which is still subject to parliamentary approval , is the first step towards changing a system which , in the eyes of many , failed to prevent the multi-billion dollar parmalat scandal .
but after months of political wrangling , the tough original version of the bill was watered down - and may be further diluted before it gets final parliamentary approval sometime in the next three months - raising doubts about the current italian government 's ability to impose better corporate governance and soothe investor anxieties .
elsewhere in europe , including germany , steps have been taken to prevent a parmalat or enron-style meltdown .
but are the safeguards sufficient ?
italian economy minister hopes for radical reform the law approved by the italian government last week was very different from the one proposed by italy 's economy minister giulio tremonti .
shortly after parmalat first made the news in december , tremonti called for shifting oversight authority away from the bank of italy and giving more power to the anti-trust authority and consab , the italian equivalent of the united states ' federal exchange commission -lrb- fec -rrb- .
those found guilty of financial fraud would also face longer prison terms .
in short , tremonti hoped to consolidate italy 's complicated regulatory system , which is comprised of five parts , each devoted to different types of business , into a three-pronged system .
italian politicians reluctant to make big changes but tremonti faced tough opposition from the country 's business-mogul prime minister silvio berlusconi and his allies , who feared that a harsh response would be bad for business .
" we do n't need to turn an exceptional event into a witch hunt , which would make the running of an insurance or financial company difficult , " said berlusconi .
as it turned out the draft law did not , as some had hoped , consolidate the various authorities .
instead it strengthened consob with greater sanctioning powers and the authority to oversee corporate bond issues .
not everyone , including tremonti , was convinced .
" we would have liked a radical reform , and now we risk introducing a reform that is n't very incisive , " he said .
the german path to reform in an interview with deutsche welle , marco becht , the executive director of the european corporate governance institute and a professor of finance and economics at the university of brussels , points to the complexity of the issue .
" sometimes it is a case of management without enough shareholder oversight , as was the case with enron , and sometimes it is a case of a very powerful shareholder getting up to something , as was the case with parmalat , " he said .
" the tools you need in each of these situations is slightly different , " he added .
given the complexity of the task at hand , and the increasing complexity of multi-national corporations engaged in different types of business , what 's a government - say the one in berlin - to do ?
tremonti 's approach , consolidating various oversight authorities into a more cooperative powerful single entity , is an approach that has proven popular elsewhere in europe , according to ernst maug , a professor of business administration at humboldt university in berlin .
germany did so in 2002 , consolidating various regulatory agencies into bafin , the federal agency responsible for overseeing the entire financial sector .
" this seems to be the trend and makes a lot of sense to me , " maug told deutsche welle .
" it does n't make sense to have different regulatory agencies overseeing different sectors just because one security is called a stock and another a bond ; when you have one authority you have a better chance of catching things . "
what 's more , also in 2002 , the german corporate governance code , also known as the " kodex , " was implemented .
this code of " best practices " is not legally binding , but companies are now required to disclose in their annual reports the extent to which they comply with the code and explain opt-outs .
a german parmalat ?
these measures by no means guarantee that a corporate scandal like parmalat or enron wo n't happen in germany .
" could it happen here - yes , " says maug .
you will never have a system where everyone complies with the law all the time , he points out , and reducing these scandals to zero is not an option , since the resulting regulation could prove too costly for business .
brecht concurs .
" there is always a trade-off in trying to prevent the next parmalat from happening and restricting executives from being able to do business , " he says .
" with regulation , you have to do a cost-benefit analysis . "
in the meantime , governments in europe and the world over continue to debate how to strike the best balance . kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de how to say " enron " in italian casting new doubt on european corporate governance , leading italian food group parmalat announced last week the firm had a € 4-billion discrepancy in its books .

as nature awakes from the harsh winter and blossoms begin to change the barren land , the opium poppy sleeps on .
a few months later , the fields will be full with beautiful red flowers . then the harvest begins ; the poppies are mowed and in the weeks that follow , the product that these plants hold within will hit the streets of western cities in the form of powder sold in small plastic bags . in an attempt to stop the tide of afghan heroin flooding european cities , politicians and representatives of international organizations have been meeting in kabul to discuss strategies to counter the country ’ s drug cultivation industry . britain and us favor burning fields bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but while the experts are united in their cause to stamp out the scourge of afghan heroin crossing their borders , there are conflicting views on what the best action is .
britain , which was given the role of stamping out afghanistan ’ s drug output at the bonn conference shortly after the fall of the taliban regime , is in favor of burning the poppy fields and destroying the drug labs . considered harsh by many , the united states supports such a " slash and burn " tactic . however , german experts wish to pursue alternative solutions .
“ these repressive measures do not correspond to our plan of lasting development , ” said christoph berg , project manager of the drugs and development scheme of the german society for technical cooperation -lrb- gtz -rrb- , in an interview with deutsche welle .
“ we want to show the farmers that there are alternatives to opium growing . ” farmers would prefer alternative income bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the warlords control their own areas and profit from the local crop .
research carried out by the gtz shows that the cultivation of wheat , wine , fruit or spices could well replace the production of heroin as a source of making a living for afghans .
" we have spoken with farmers .
many would stop growing opium if they could survive by producing other products , ” said berg , adding that all production of opium is illegal in afghanistan . the gtz experts in kabul form a part of a project investigating " drug control connected to development , " an eu supported initiative which is being funded by the bloc to the tune of € 9 million over the next three years .
the project intends to start the process of replacing the drug economy at the very roots by working with schools and health centers in the eastern provinces of laghman , kunar and nangarhar and to set up and strengthen alternative agricultural cooperatives . gtz must convince profiting warlords bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr soldiers on patrol in afghanistan .
the project will last for at least 10 to 15 years , according to berg , and it will take at least that long before the first successes becomes visible in the fight against drugs .
not everybody is so eager to cooperate .
“ we must also try to include the local warlords and work constructively with them , ” said berg .
the warlords profit from the drug business and the afghan economy relies heavily on it while there is little alternative .
convincing some of the benefits of other crops will take time . but the german focus is on a peaceful and progressive campaign against the drug trade emanating from afghanistan .
the military has also taken a non-aggressive stance on the opium business , especially as the bundeswehr attempts to win over the hearts and minds of the afghan people through its reconstruction efforts . germany rules out military intervention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heroin is a problem in most european cities .

however , the german parliament only agreed the deployment of the force outside the relative safety of the international assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- mission in kabul on the condition that the 220 soldiers of the prt keep out of the fight with the drug barons . but despite the plans of the gtz and the resolution of the bundeswehr , the fight against the poppy growers and cultivators will go on as british and u.s. forces continue to target a way of life that not only provides their enemies with funds to fight on but also takes the war to the streets of their home nations . harvests improving every year according to the united nations , 2003 saw afghanistan ’ s second-best harvest ever registered : 3,600 metric tons of opium , material for 360 metric tons of heroin was produced last year .

mikhail gorbachev … helmut kohl … david hasselhoff .
no , do not adjust your screens .
the list of those who contributed to the fall of the berlin wall and the end of communism has long been missing one name … until now . it was one of the defining moments of the twentieth century .
not only did it come to represent the collapse of the soviet union , the end of the communist dream and the concluding drama of the cold war , the fall of the berlin wall must also be remembered as the moment a nation that had been divided for 28 years came together .
thank you , david hasselhoff . excuse me ?
david hasselhoff ?
the man who made talking cars every small boy ’ s dream and scantily-clad , surgically enhanced beauties running in slow motion every teenage boy ’ s fantasy ?
surely the actor-slash-singer responsible for immortalizing such screen idols as michael knight and mitch buchannon can ’ t be accredited with bringing down a superpower and reuniting germany . well , according to the man himself , hasselhoff does indeed feel that he played his part in bringing about the fall of the berlin wall and aiding the reunification of east and west germany .
and not through some heroic spy chase across communist berlin at the wheel of his trusty car kitt or a daring rescue involving pamela anderson and a defecting russian diplomat in a thong .
no , hasselhoff believes his contribution came about through the unifying and healing power of his music . cover version caught the moment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after recording an english language cover version of the 1970s german hit , “ auf der strasse nach suden ” and renaming it “ looking for freedom , ” hasselhoff raced up the charts in the late summer of 1989 , just as a tide of revolution began rolling through eastern europe . the soft rock god had sublimely caught the moment by crooning the stirring lyrics : " i 've been lookin ' for freedom ; i 've been lookin ' so long ; i 've been lookin ' for freedom ; still the search goes on . "
and as a result , after spending several weeks at number one , the song became the anthem of some of those struggling to reconcile the broken nation . even as the hammers began to fall on the symbol of division , hasselhoff ’ s music was omnipresent ; the album of the same name was also germany ’ s best selling long player of the time , keeping less important records off the top spot for three months . freedom found bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " david , we love you !

mikhail gorbachev … helmut kohl … david hasselhoff .
no , do not adjust your screens .
the list of those who contributed to the fall of the berlin wall and the end of communism has long been missing one name … until now . it was one of the defining moments of the twentieth century .
not only did it come to represent the collapse of the soviet union , the end of the communist dream and the concluding drama of the cold war , the fall of the berlin wall must also be remembered as the moment a nation that had been divided for 28 years came together .
thank you , david hasselhoff . excuse me ?
david hasselhoff ?
the man who made talking cars every small boy ’ s dream and scantily-clad , surgically enhanced beauties running in slow motion every teenage boy ’ s fantasy ?
surely the actor-slash-singer responsible for immortalizing such screen idols as michael knight and mitch buchannon can ’ t be accredited with bringing down a superpower and reuniting germany . well , according to the man himself , hasselhoff does indeed feel that he played his part in bringing about the fall of the berlin wall and aiding the reunification of east and west germany .
and not through some heroic spy chase across communist berlin at the wheel of his trusty car kitt or a daring rescue involving pamela anderson and a defecting russian diplomat in a thong .
no , hasselhoff believes his contribution came about through the unifying and healing power of his music . cover version caught the moment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after recording an english language cover version of the 1970s german hit , “ auf der strasse nach suden ” and renaming it “ looking for freedom , ” hasselhoff raced up the charts in the late summer of 1989 , just as a tide of revolution began rolling through eastern europe . the soft rock god had sublimely caught the moment by crooning the stirring lyrics : " i 've been lookin ' for freedom ; i 've been lookin ' so long ; i 've been lookin ' for freedom ; still the search goes on . "
and as a result , after spending several weeks at number one , the song became the anthem of some of those struggling to reconcile the broken nation . even as the hammers began to fall on the symbol of division , hasselhoff ’ s music was omnipresent ; the album of the same name was also germany ’ s best selling long player of the time , keeping less important records off the top spot for three months . freedom found bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " david , we love you ! "
at last , all those germans who had been looking for freedom eventually found it as the wall finally crumbled on november 9 , 1989 , allowing thousands of east germans to flood into west berlin to be reunited with loved ones and to buy long-forbidden albums from hasselhoff ’ s musical back catalogue . there was even a moment when the reunited country joined together to thank the man who had provided the soundtrack to such historic change .
after being invited to headline a new year ’ s eve concert at the brandenburg gate by former german chancellor helmut kohl , the people ’ s champion finally got his chance to deliver his song in person to an audience of almost a million reunited germans . playing to an audience of united germans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it was the first time germany had been unified , and close to a million east and west german fans stood together in the freezing cold at midnight watching me perform .
i was overcome with emotion , " he recalled in an interview with german magazine tv spielfilm . but official recognition evaded him .
“ i am a little bit sad that no photo of me hangs in the checkpoint charlie museum in berlin , ” he added with regret after his contribution to reunification failed to make it into the berlin wall commemorative exhibition at the former border crossing . museum missing hero 's portrait bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : checkpoint charlie .
but how can this be ?
surely a man who mobilized a divided nation , a man whose voice was the catalyst for revolution , should be honoured for his role in changing the world as many knew it back then . but the checkpoint charlie museum in berlin is n't quite convinced of the singer 's historical significance .
“ what did he do ? ” wondered the museum 's spokesperson when dw-world questioned why hasselhoff was not included in the hall of fame .
“ we didn ’ t know the song was that important .

german general götz gliemeroth handed over command of the nato-led peacekeeping force in afghanistan to canada on monday amid fresh security concerns following an emergence of suicide bomb attacks . after a year of steering the 6,420-strong multinational international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- charged with overseeing security in the afghan capital , german nato general goetz gliemeroth handed over the reins to canadian general rick hillier on monday .
the canadian troops with 2,000 soldiers make up the largest contingent of the nato-led isaf force .
it ’ s unclear how long they will remain in afghanistan .
the canadian contingent is expected to end its deployment in august , but canadian prime minister paul martin has said 500 soldiers will stay on after that period .
security fears rise after attacks the festive hand-over ceremony was marked by tight security following a recent wave of suicide bomb attacks which killed a canadian soldier in kabul last month and a british peacekeeper a day later .
the attacks , claimed by the taliban , came on the heels of a december suicide bombing in which five afghan security officials were killed in kabul .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaap de hoop scheffer earlier , jaap de hoop scheffer -lrb- photo -rrb- expressed concerns that the emergence of suicide bomb attacks on kabul peacekeepers showed that the capital was far from secure .
he called on the international community not to lose its focus on a nation still racked by violence , poverty and a booming drug trade .
" the situation is fragile , " de hoop scheffer told reporters aboard a u.s. military plane on his way to kabul .
" it ’ s extremely difficult to have a 100 percent defence against these horrible suicide attacks . ”
de hoop scheffer also underlined afghanistan ’ s importance for the military alliance .
" we now know that our future security , no matter where we are , is dependant on afghanistan ’ s security , " he said during the hand-over ceremony and warned that the international community needed to stay involved in afghanistan .
" the u.n. , the european union , japan and other important donors should stay fully committed to this country , " de hoop scheffer said .
" nato can provide security and stability , but the afghan people need housing and schooling and roofs over their heads . "

11 , 2003 .
nato took command of the 5,000-strong international peacekeeping force in the afghan capital on monday , a historic move that marks the alliance 's first operation outside europe since it was created 54 years ago .
-lrb- ap photo / apichart weerawong -rrb- taking stock of germany ’ s isaf year , german general götz gliemeroth -lrb- photo -rrb- stressed that germany had notched up successes during its command of the isaf , most notably the smooth running of the loya jirga or the grand assembly that agreed on a new constitution for afghanistan in december .
he also said considerable progress was made in the program towards disarming some 10,000 militia in the country under germany ’ s leadership .
at the same time gliemeroth warned that the nexus between the local warlords who ran provincial private armies and the wealthy druglords posed one of the biggest threats to afghanistan ’ s future .
" deplorably we ’ re seeing a connection between this so-called warlordism , which means commanders who maintain armies for political reasons to exert pressure , and the funds that come from the drugs trade , " gliemeroth said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poppy farmer mohammad agha in afghanistan the general , who has suggested in the past that nato should tackle the issue even it meant violent conflicts with the drug mafia , insisted that cracking down on the flourishing drug trade should be made a priority .
" it ’ s a challenge that the international community must urgently take up .
i can only add that soldiers are the least appropriate means to combat the planting of opium and drug transport .
rather we need to set up the right structures in afghanistan and shore them with funds , " he said .
continuing commitment to afghanistan needed gliemeroth urged continuing engagement in the civil-military area .
he pointed towards the success of the first provincial reconstruction team -lrb- prt -rrb- in kunduz in northern afghanistan .
nato controls that area and the prt is involved in the reconstruction of hundreds of schools , hospitals , fountains and irrigation projects .
" i think our alliance partners have realized the central importance of such prts for the further development of afghanistan , " he said .
nato currently runs one prt , while the u.s-led force of 10,600 controls the remainder .
prts , whose members range from a few dozen to more than 200 , combine military and reconstruction roles in far-flung areas .
by next month there will be 13 prts across afghanistan .
nato ’ s peacekeeping force aims to set up five new teams over the next six months .
gliemeroth however warned that the situation in iraq shouldn ’ t be allowed to divert attention from afghanistan .
" currently , in all fairness to the situation in iraq , it has to be said that afghanistan has been largely overshadowed by the development there , " gliemeroth said .

after his resignation as social democratic party chairman on friday , german chancellor gerhard schröder on saturday named his likely successors , who he hopes will bring the party together on difficult reforms . these are days of surprise in the corridors of the germany ’ s governing party , the social democrats .
few had any idea on friday morning that chancellor gerhard schröder would resign from his post as head of the social democratic party and hand the reins over to franz müntefering , the party ’ s parliamentary group chairman .
then , on saturday , he named a successor for the party 's luckless general secretary , olaf scholz .
" on march 21 , the spd is going to call a special party conference , " schröder told reporters saturday .
" the party executive will unanimously nominate franz müntefering as its new party chairman .
and the party executive will also nominate klaus uwe benneter as the spd ’ s new general secretary with the same number of votes . "
a new deputy 56-year-old lawyer benneter , also a member of the german parliament , the bundestag , is also a close friend of schröder .
during the turbulent 70s , the two were active together in the spd ’ s young socialists at a time when the spd ’ s youth group had taken an extreme left political course .
at one point , benneter was even temporarily banned from the party because he had spoken out in favor of cooperation with communists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus-uwe benneter today ’ s an altogether different story .
these days , benneter -lrb- photo -rrb- calls for deep cuts into germany ’ s social system , for reforms of the labor market and public healthcare system – all initiatives that have drawn heavy criticism from the social democrats ’ party base and voters .
together , benneter and müntefering are expected to bring the party ’ s traditional leftist core into line with the government ’ s planned reforms .
müntefering calls for broad party debate on reforms müntefering said saturday he wanted to speak clear language about " equitableness , " one of the core principles of european social democratic movements . " that ’ s not just a saying , " müntefering said , " rather , it is something that has always been a deep part of this party ’ s history .
whoever speaks of ‘ equitableness ’ has to start with equal opportunities .
and they have to start with the fact that that is not functioning in the scope that we desire .
we ’ ve spoken of our solid determination to create a situation where young people in this country aren ’ t able to fall from school desk to the unemployment rolls .
the situation can ’ t stay as it is . "
speaking on a handful of german public broadcasting stations on saturday , müntefering said he wants to involve the party in the government ’ s reform policies more than in the past , admitting to ard that the reform policy negotiations within the party had been " suboptimal . "
in the future , he said reforms needed to be prepared more " cautiously . "
in an interview with zdf , he said he intended to open an intensive debate within the party about planned reforms while at the same time standing shoulder to shoulder with the government .
a deft political move ?
the first reactions coming out of the party this weekend suggest schröder made a deft political move by resigning from his position as party chairman .
the chancellor made clear on saturday that the party reins would soon be tightened , and that even in his cabinet there was no breathing room left for error .
in other words : controversial members of the cabinet , like transport minister manfred stolpe who has overseen the trouble-plagued implementation of tolls for heavy trucks and transports on germany highways , are now on probation . indeed , in recent weeks the pages of germany 's top newspapers and magazines have been filled with speculation of a possible shakeup of schröder 's cabinet .
schröder said the party needed to put its collective energy toward the different tasks required for safeguarding and implementing the reform process .

after his resignation as social democratic party chairman on friday , german chancellor gerhard schröder on saturday named his likely successors , who he hopes will bring the party together on difficult reforms . these are days of surprise in the corridors of the germany ’ s governing party , the social democrats .
few had any idea on friday morning that chancellor gerhard schröder would resign from his post as head of the social democratic party and hand the reins over to franz müntefering , the party ’ s parliamentary group chairman .
then , on saturday , he named a successor for the party 's luckless general secretary , olaf scholz .
" on march 21 , the spd is going to call a special party conference , " schröder told reporters saturday .
" the party executive will unanimously nominate franz müntefering as its new party chairman .
and the party executive will also nominate klaus uwe benneter as the spd ’ s new general secretary with the same number of votes . "
a new deputy 56-year-old lawyer benneter , also a member of the german parliament , the bundestag , is also a close friend of schröder .
during the turbulent 70s , the two were active together in the spd ’ s young socialists at a time when the spd ’ s youth group had taken an extreme left political course .
at one point , benneter was even temporarily banned from the party because he had spoken out in favor of cooperation with communists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus-uwe benneter today ’ s an altogether different story .
these days , benneter -lrb- photo -rrb- calls for deep cuts into germany ’ s social system , for reforms of the labor market and public healthcare system – all initiatives that have drawn heavy criticism from the social democrats ’ party base and voters .
together , benneter and müntefering are expected to bring the party ’ s traditional leftist core into line with the government ’ s planned reforms .
müntefering calls for broad party debate on reforms müntefering said saturday he wanted to speak clear language about " equitableness , " one of the core principles of european social democratic movements . " that ’ s not just a saying , " müntefering said , " rather , it is something that has always been a deep part of this party ’ s history .
whoever speaks of ‘ equitableness ’ has to start with equal opportunities .
and they have to start with the fact that that is not functioning in the scope that we desire .
we ’ ve spoken of our solid determination to create a situation where young people in this country aren ’ t able to fall from school desk to the unemployment rolls .
the situation can ’ t stay as it is . "
speaking on a handful of german public broadcasting stations on saturday , müntefering said he wants to involve the party in the government ’ s reform policies more than in the past , admitting to ard that the reform policy negotiations within the party had been " suboptimal . "
in the future , he said reforms needed to be prepared more " cautiously . "
in an interview with zdf , he said he intended to open an intensive debate within the party about planned reforms while at the same time standing shoulder to shoulder with the government .
a deft political move ?
the first reactions coming out of the party this weekend suggest schröder made a deft political move by resigning from his position as party chairman .
the chancellor made clear on saturday that the party reins would soon be tightened , and that even in his cabinet there was no breathing room left for error .
in other words : controversial members of the cabinet , like transport minister manfred stolpe who has overseen the trouble-plagued implementation of tolls for heavy trucks and transports on germany highways , are now on probation . indeed , in recent weeks the pages of germany 's top newspapers and magazines have been filled with speculation of a possible shakeup of schröder 's cabinet .
schröder said the party needed to put its collective energy toward the different tasks required for safeguarding and implementing the reform process .

and they have to start with the fact that that is not functioning in the scope that we desire .
we ’ ve spoken of our solid determination to create a situation where young people in this country aren ’ t able to fall from school desk to the unemployment rolls .
the situation can ’ t stay as it is . "
speaking on a handful of german public broadcasting stations on saturday , müntefering said he wants to involve the party in the government ’ s reform policies more than in the past , admitting to ard that the reform policy negotiations within the party had been " suboptimal . "
in the future , he said reforms needed to be prepared more " cautiously . "
in an interview with zdf , he said he intended to open an intensive debate within the party about planned reforms while at the same time standing shoulder to shoulder with the government .
a deft political move ?
the first reactions coming out of the party this weekend suggest schröder made a deft political move by resigning from his position as party chairman .
the chancellor made clear on saturday that the party reins would soon be tightened , and that even in his cabinet there was no breathing room left for error .
in other words : controversial members of the cabinet , like transport minister manfred stolpe who has overseen the trouble-plagued implementation of tolls for heavy trucks and transports on germany highways , are now on probation . indeed , in recent weeks the pages of germany 's top newspapers and magazines have been filled with speculation of a possible shakeup of schröder 's cabinet .
schröder said the party needed to put its collective energy toward the different tasks required for safeguarding and implementing the reform process .
opposition : spd falling apart the minority opposition , neo-liberal free democratic party immediately criticized benneter ’ s nomination , lambasting the move as a signal that the spd is shifting to the left .
and dieter althaus of the christian democratic union said that the decision by the spd to appoint a relatively unknown politician to the position of general secretary showed how difficult it had become for the party to find leaders .
earlier , cdu chairwoman angela merkel and the head of the cdu ’ s bavarian sister party , the christian social union , edmund stoiber , both said schröder ’ s resignation marked the " beginning of the end " of the party . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder leaves an unloved post by quitting as the head of the social democratic party on friday , gerhard schröder left an office he hardly loved .
besides , his likely successor could help build party support for schröder 's equally unloved reforms .

meeting near berlin on monday , german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac said they want an agreement on a new european union constitution before the end of the irish eu presidency in june . the french and german leaders revived hopes for the european union ’ s stalled constitution on monday after they said they want an agreement on it before the six-month irish presidency of the eu runs out at the end of june .
meeting in genshagen , south of berlin , schröder and chirac were unanimous that the future of the eu had to be dealt with soon .
" we agreed that it 's our joint wish that the constitution issue should be resolved by the end of june during the irish presidency , " chirac said at a joint news conference with schröder .
" if this does not happen then in any case we must try to find an accord by the end of the dutch presidency at the end of 2004 , " he added .
warming franco-german ties the move is a further sign of deepening franco-german ties .
the two leaders have forged a close political relationship since last year when they both opposed the iraq war and have seen eye to eye on hotly-debated issues such as a post-war iraqi order , the eu constitution and european security and defense policy .
" our positions on european union themes are identical , " chirac said .

eu constitution talks broke down last december after poland and spain refused to accept newly weighted voting rights in the draft text , which would greatly curtail their voting rights in the eu council of ministers .
the two countries were the main beneficiaries of the 2000 nice treaty , which gave them just two votes less than the much more populous france and germany .

" we must stick to the principle of double majority , " he told reporters in berlin .
" we want progress on the issue of majority voting and we also think that the question of the efficiency of the work of the commission must be better secured than is currently the case . "
chirac added : " we want a smaller commission that in the future can work efficiently .
it is also our wish that the work of the european council does not become bogged down by excessive demands for agreement . "
schröder and chirac also said they were sticking with demands for a freeze on the eu budget until 2013 .

meeting near berlin on monday , german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac said they want an agreement on a new european union constitution before the end of the irish eu presidency in june . the french and german leaders revived hopes for the european union ’ s stalled constitution on monday after they said they want an agreement on it before the six-month irish presidency of the eu runs out at the end of june .
meeting in genshagen , south of berlin , schröder and chirac were unanimous that the future of the eu had to be dealt with soon .
" we agreed that it 's our joint wish that the constitution issue should be resolved by the end of june during the irish presidency , " chirac said at a joint news conference with schröder .
" if this does not happen then in any case we must try to find an accord by the end of the dutch presidency at the end of 2004 , " he added .
warming franco-german ties the move is a further sign of deepening franco-german ties .
the two leaders have forged a close political relationship since last year when they both opposed the iraq war and have seen eye to eye on hotly-debated issues such as a post-war iraqi order , the eu constitution and european security and defense policy .
" our positions on european union themes are identical , " chirac said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish premier bertie ahern schröder was to head to dublin later on monday for talks with irish prime minister bertie ahern -lrb- photo -rrb- , who currently holds the rotating eu presidency .
ireland has been trying to broker an agreement on the eu constitution when it took over the presidency on jan 1 .
bedevilled eu constitution the new constitution is supposed to prepare the eu for may , when it expands from 15 to 25 members .
most observers consider the bloc ’ s current institutional set-up as too unwieldy and inefficient .
besides ending the rotation of the eu presidency amongst the national governments , the draft constitution aims to streamline the eu commission and decision-making .
eu constitution talks broke down last december after poland and spain refused to accept newly weighted voting rights in the draft text , which would greatly curtail their voting rights in the eu council of ministers .
the two countries were the main beneficiaries of the 2000 nice treaty , which gave them just two votes less than the much more populous france and germany .
the issue has pitted france and germany against spain and poland , a future eu member .
not willing to compromise schröder however said on monday that berlin and paris did not want agreement on the constitution " at any cost . "
" we must stick to the principle of double majority , " he told reporters in berlin .
" we want progress on the issue of majority voting and we also think that the question of the efficiency of the work of the commission must be better secured than is currently the case . "
chirac added : " we want a smaller commission that in the future can work efficiently .
it is also our wish that the work of the european council does not become bogged down by excessive demands for agreement . "
schröder and chirac also said they were sticking with demands for a freeze on the eu budget until 2013 .
france , germany , britain , the netherlands , sweden and austria - all of which are net contributors to the eu – made the budget freeze demand last december in an open letter .
with a little bit of british help the franco-german duo hopes their efforts will be given additional clout by the british prime minister tony blair who is expected to join in a trilateral summit in berlin next week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's prime minister tony blair both schröder and chirac hope that the franco-german motor , ideally beefed up a bit with the help of britain ’ s tony blair -lrb- photo -rrb- , will create new momentum for a breakthrough in talks on the future of europe . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ireland puts eu constitution at the top of its agenda after a rocky shot at the helm of the eu presidency , italy handed the reins to ireland on january 1st .

as nature awakes from the harsh winter and blossoms begin to change the barren land , the opium poppy sleeps on .
a few months later , the fields will be full with beautiful red flowers . then the harvest begins ; the poppies are mowed and in the weeks that follow , the product that these plants hold within will hit the streets of western cities in the form of powder sold in small plastic bags . in an attempt to stop the tide of afghan heroin flooding european cities , politicians and representatives of international organizations have been meeting in kabul to discuss strategies to counter the country ’ s drug cultivation industry . britain and us favor burning fields bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but while the experts are united in their cause to stamp out the scourge of afghan heroin crossing their borders , there are conflicting views on what the best action is .
britain , which was given the role of stamping out afghanistan ’ s drug output at the bonn conference shortly after the fall of the taliban regime , is in favor of burning the poppy fields and destroying the drug labs . considered harsh by many , the united states supports such a " slash and burn " tactic . however , german experts wish to pursue alternative solutions .
“ these repressive measures do not correspond to our plan of lasting development , ” said christoph berg , project manager of the drugs and development scheme of the german society for technical cooperation -lrb- gtz -rrb- , in an interview with deutsche welle .
“ we want to show the farmers that there are alternatives to opium growing . ” farmers would prefer alternative income bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the warlords control their own areas and profit from the local crop .
research carried out by the gtz shows that the cultivation of wheat , wine , fruit or spices could well replace the production of heroin as a source of making a living for afghans .
" we have spoken with farmers .
many would stop growing opium if they could survive by producing other products , ” said berg , adding that all production of opium is illegal in afghanistan . the gtz experts in kabul form a part of a project investigating " drug control connected to development , " an eu supported initiative which is being funded by the bloc to the tune of € 9 million over the next three years .
the project intends to start the process of replacing the drug economy at the very roots by working with schools and health centers in the eastern provinces of laghman , kunar and nangarhar and to set up and strengthen alternative agricultural cooperatives . gtz must convince profiting warlords bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr soldiers on patrol in afghanistan .
the project will last for at least 10 to 15 years , according to berg , and it will take at least that long before the first successes becomes visible in the fight against drugs .
not everybody is so eager to cooperate .
“ we must also try to include the local warlords and work constructively with them , ” said berg .
the warlords profit from the drug business and the afghan economy relies heavily on it while there is little alternative .
convincing some of the benefits of other crops will take time . but the german focus is on a peaceful and progressive campaign against the drug trade emanating from afghanistan .

while german participants familiarize themselves with new methods , theories and teaching aids , the fruits of their labors continue to abandon ship .
after investing tens of thousands in education and training costs , germany is losing its best qualified professionals to better paid positions elsewhere , economists complain .
and the growing brain drain is compounding germany 's economic woes through the loss of skilled labor and human resources .
nearly 118,000 people packed up and left the country in 2002 for jobs abroad , the german statistical office reported .
mathis malchow is one of those who , along with his girlfriend , left germany for better prospects abroad .
" we just decided that we would try our luck in london , because it 's the only city that has the potential for growth , " the architect told deutsche welle .
malchow has indeed been lucky .
he has a job with the renowned british architect sir norman foster .
the highlight so far has been working on one of london 's most conspicuous new landmarks , the swiss re building , affectionately dubbed the " erotic gherkin " by locals .
malchow does n't regret leaving germany .
" it 's definitely been an enriching experience , " he said .
helping them to go , then urging them to come back besides the young professionals and academics who leave germany for work , young germans who have completed vocational training also have good chances of finding a job abroad .
eva-elisabeth weber , a job counselor at the central employment agency in bonn , noted that hoteliers , chefs , managers and mechanical engineers , in particular , have good career opportunities beyond germany .
each year the agency locates jobs for some 6,000 skilled laborers , professionals and managers outside of the country .
it also tries to coax them back home when germany needs them .
" there are many doctors who we have found jobs for abroad , and now we have a shortage of qualified doctors here in germany .
we are now trying to encourage those german doctors and nurses spread across the european union to come back , " weber said .
science suffers every seventh person with a doctorate in science leaves germany for the united states , the scientist magazine has reported .
three of the four german nobel prize winners work in the united states .
" the trouble is that we are losing our highest achievers , " christoph anz of the confederation of german employers associations told the scientist .
" we have reached the point where we will no longer be able to compete in the booming biotechnology sector . "
gerd kempermann , a researcher in molecular medicine who has worked in the united states , says the work structure in other countries is often more attractive than in germany .
" the rules -lrb- in germany -rrb- do n't always fit everyone .
when someone realizes that they do n't fit into a certain formula then they begin to search for where their potential can be realized - where employers look to see what they can offer good employees . "
the most common complaints are that german research and development is under-funded and that institutes and universities are plagued by unwieldy bureaucracy .
" american universities offer scientists better pay conditions , more time for research and less time spent teaching , " said peter doermann , a research group leader at the max planck institute for molecular plant physiology near berlin .
some estimates say that scientists can earn three times as much money working in the united states compared to germany .
harming those who stay the brain drain can also hurt scientists working at home , doermann told deutsche welle .
" for me it 's a problem of collaboration , since the major players are in the u.s. there are some germans who were quite promising , and all of them went to the u.s. if you are below a critical number of people in a certain research area , you encounter problems applying for joint grants and european grants .
the german research foundation insists on only german research scientists , and if people leave there are n't enough left to collaborate , " he explained .
in an effort to reverse the trend , the german government last year said it would devote an extra € 100 million -lrb- $ 127 million -rrb- over the next four years to stimulate research and development in biotechnology in addition to the € 110 million already spent in the last three years .
announcing the package at the biotechnology day in leipzig in october , education and research minister edelgard bulmahn said the extra money would be directed to small- and medium-sized biotechnology companies .
gerd kempermann , for one , recently returned to germany to work at a local research clinic , but not because the conditions were better he said .
" they were for soft reasons , private reasons .
one ends up returning to where one comes from , " he explained .
kempermann is optimistic that despite the critical unemployment situation in the country - where 4.6 million people are registered jobless - the wealth of talent should encourage the public and private sector to invest in the human capital .

while german participants familiarize themselves with new methods , theories and teaching aids , the fruits of their labors continue to abandon ship .
after investing tens of thousands in education and training costs , germany is losing its best qualified professionals to better paid positions elsewhere , economists complain .
and the growing brain drain is compounding germany 's economic woes through the loss of skilled labor and human resources .
nearly 118,000 people packed up and left the country in 2002 for jobs abroad , the german statistical office reported .
mathis malchow is one of those who , along with his girlfriend , left germany for better prospects abroad .
" we just decided that we would try our luck in london , because it 's the only city that has the potential for growth , " the architect told deutsche welle .
malchow has indeed been lucky .
he has a job with the renowned british architect sir norman foster .
the highlight so far has been working on one of london 's most conspicuous new landmarks , the swiss re building , affectionately dubbed the " erotic gherkin " by locals .
malchow does n't regret leaving germany .
" it 's definitely been an enriching experience , " he said .
helping them to go , then urging them to come back besides the young professionals and academics who leave germany for work , young germans who have completed vocational training also have good chances of finding a job abroad .
eva-elisabeth weber , a job counselor at the central employment agency in bonn , noted that hoteliers , chefs , managers and mechanical engineers , in particular , have good career opportunities beyond germany .
each year the agency locates jobs for some 6,000 skilled laborers , professionals and managers outside of the country .
it also tries to coax them back home when germany needs them .
" there are many doctors who we have found jobs for abroad , and now we have a shortage of qualified doctors here in germany .
we are now trying to encourage those german doctors and nurses spread across the european union to come back , " weber said .
science suffers every seventh person with a doctorate in science leaves germany for the united states , the scientist magazine has reported .
three of the four german nobel prize winners work in the united states .
" the trouble is that we are losing our highest achievers , " christoph anz of the confederation of german employers associations told the scientist .
" we have reached the point where we will no longer be able to compete in the booming biotechnology sector . "
gerd kempermann , a researcher in molecular medicine who has worked in the united states , says the work structure in other countries is often more attractive than in germany .
" the rules -lrb- in germany -rrb- do n't always fit everyone .
when someone realizes that they do n't fit into a certain formula then they begin to search for where their potential can be realized - where employers look to see what they can offer good employees . "
the most common complaints are that german research and development is under-funded and that institutes and universities are plagued by unwieldy bureaucracy .
" american universities offer scientists better pay conditions , more time for research and less time spent teaching , " said peter doermann , a research group leader at the max planck institute for molecular plant physiology near berlin .
some estimates say that scientists can earn three times as much money working in the united states compared to germany .
harming those who stay the brain drain can also hurt scientists working at home , doermann told deutsche welle .
" for me it 's a problem of collaboration , since the major players are in the u.s. there are some germans who were quite promising , and all of them went to the u.s. if you are below a critical number of people in a certain research area , you encounter problems applying for joint grants and european grants .
the german research foundation insists on only german research scientists , and if people leave there are n't enough left to collaborate , " he explained .
in an effort to reverse the trend , the german government last year said it would devote an extra € 100 million -lrb- $ 127 million -rrb- over the next four years to stimulate research and development in biotechnology in addition to the € 110 million already spent in the last three years .
announcing the package at the biotechnology day in leipzig in october , education and research minister edelgard bulmahn said the extra money would be directed to small- and medium-sized biotechnology companies .
gerd kempermann , for one , recently returned to germany to work at a local research clinic , but not because the conditions were better he said .
" they were for soft reasons , private reasons .
one ends up returning to where one comes from , " he explained .
kempermann is optimistic that despite the critical unemployment situation in the country - where 4.6 million people are registered jobless - the wealth of talent should encourage the public and private sector to invest in the human capital .

after the parmalat fiasco , the italian government has taken steps to reform the country 's regulatory system .
but do the reforms go far enough , and how do they compare to those elsewhere in europe , including germany ? the italian cabinet has approved a draft law aimed at reforming italy 's regulatory system .
the law , which is still subject to parliamentary approval , is the first step towards changing a system which , in the eyes of many , failed to prevent the multi-billion dollar parmalat scandal .
but after months of political wrangling , the tough original version of the bill was watered down - and may be further diluted before it gets final parliamentary approval sometime in the next three months - raising doubts about the current italian government 's ability to impose better corporate governance and soothe investor anxieties .
elsewhere in europe , including germany , steps have been taken to prevent a parmalat or enron-style meltdown .
but are the safeguards sufficient ?
italian economy minister hopes for radical reform the law approved by the italian government last week was very different from the one proposed by italy 's economy minister giulio tremonti .
shortly after parmalat first made the news in december , tremonti called for shifting oversight authority away from the bank of italy and giving more power to the anti-trust authority and consab , the italian equivalent of the united states ' federal exchange commission -lrb- fec -rrb- .
those found guilty of financial fraud would also face longer prison terms .
in short , tremonti hoped to consolidate italy 's complicated regulatory system , which is comprised of five parts , each devoted to different types of business , into a three-pronged system .
italian politicians reluctant to make big changes but tremonti faced tough opposition from the country 's business-mogul prime minister silvio berlusconi and his allies , who feared that a harsh response would be bad for business .
" we do n't need to turn an exceptional event into a witch hunt , which would make the running of an insurance or financial company difficult , " said berlusconi .
as it turned out the draft law did not , as some had hoped , consolidate the various authorities .
instead it strengthened consob with greater sanctioning powers and the authority to oversee corporate bond issues .
not everyone , including tremonti , was convinced .
" we would have liked a radical reform , and now we risk introducing a reform that is n't very incisive , " he said .
the german path to reform in an interview with deutsche welle , marco becht , the executive director of the european corporate governance institute and a professor of finance and economics at the university of brussels , points to the complexity of the issue .
" sometimes it is a case of management without enough shareholder oversight , as was the case with enron , and sometimes it is a case of a very powerful shareholder getting up to something , as was the case with parmalat , " he said .
" the tools you need in each of these situations is slightly different , " he added .
given the complexity of the task at hand , and the increasing complexity of multi-national corporations engaged in different types of business , what 's a government - say the one in berlin - to do ?
tremonti 's approach , consolidating various oversight authorities into a more cooperative powerful single entity , is an approach that has proven popular elsewhere in europe , according to ernst maug , a professor of business administration at humboldt university in berlin .
germany did so in 2002 , consolidating various regulatory agencies into bafin , the federal agency responsible for overseeing the entire financial sector .
" this seems to be the trend and makes a lot of sense to me , " maug told deutsche welle .
" it does n't make sense to have different regulatory agencies overseeing different sectors just because one security is called a stock and another a bond ; when you have one authority you have a better chance of catching things . "
what 's more , also in 2002 , the german corporate governance code , also known as the " kodex , " was implemented .
this code of " best practices " is not legally binding , but companies are now required to disclose in their annual reports the extent to which they comply with the code and explain opt-outs .
a german parmalat ?
these measures by no means guarantee that a corporate scandal like parmalat or enron wo n't happen in germany .
" could it happen here - yes , " says maug .
you will never have a system where everyone complies with the law all the time , he points out , and reducing these scandals to zero is not an option , since the resulting regulation could prove too costly for business .

" there is always a trade-off in trying to prevent the next parmalat from happening and restricting executives from being able to do business , " he says .

german general götz gliemeroth handed over command of the nato-led peacekeeping force in afghanistan to canada on monday amid fresh security concerns following an emergence of suicide bomb attacks . after a year of steering the 6,420-strong multinational international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- charged with overseeing security in the afghan capital , german nato general goetz gliemeroth handed over the reins to canadian general rick hillier on monday .
the canadian troops with 2,000 soldiers make up the largest contingent of the nato-led isaf force .
it ’ s unclear how long they will remain in afghanistan .

he also said considerable progress was made in the program towards disarming some 10,000 militia in the country under germany ’ s leadership .

while german participants familiarize themselves with new methods , theories and teaching aids , the fruits of their labors continue to abandon ship .
after investing tens of thousands in education and training costs , germany is losing its best qualified professionals to better paid positions elsewhere , economists complain .
and the growing brain drain is compounding germany 's economic woes through the loss of skilled labor and human resources .
nearly 118,000 people packed up and left the country in 2002 for jobs abroad , the german statistical office reported .
mathis malchow is one of those who , along with his girlfriend , left germany for better prospects abroad .
" we just decided that we would try our luck in london , because it 's the only city that has the potential for growth , " the architect told deutsche welle .
malchow has indeed been lucky .
he has a job with the renowned british architect sir norman foster .
the highlight so far has been working on one of london 's most conspicuous new landmarks , the swiss re building , affectionately dubbed the " erotic gherkin " by locals .
malchow does n't regret leaving germany .
" it 's definitely been an enriching experience , " he said .
helping them to go , then urging them to come back besides the young professionals and academics who leave germany for work , young germans who have completed vocational training also have good chances of finding a job abroad .
eva-elisabeth weber , a job counselor at the central employment agency in bonn , noted that hoteliers , chefs , managers and mechanical engineers , in particular , have good career opportunities beyond germany .
each year the agency locates jobs for some 6,000 skilled laborers , professionals and managers outside of the country .
it also tries to coax them back home when germany needs them .
" there are many doctors who we have found jobs for abroad , and now we have a shortage of qualified doctors here in germany .
we are now trying to encourage those german doctors and nurses spread across the european union to come back , " weber said .
science suffers every seventh person with a doctorate in science leaves germany for the united states , the scientist magazine has reported .
three of the four german nobel prize winners work in the united states .
" the trouble is that we are losing our highest achievers , " christoph anz of the confederation of german employers associations told the scientist .
" we have reached the point where we will no longer be able to compete in the booming biotechnology sector . "
gerd kempermann , a researcher in molecular medicine who has worked in the united states , says the work structure in other countries is often more attractive than in germany .
" the rules -lrb- in germany -rrb- do n't always fit everyone .
when someone realizes that they do n't fit into a certain formula then they begin to search for where their potential can be realized - where employers look to see what they can offer good employees . "
the most common complaints are that german research and development is under-funded and that institutes and universities are plagued by unwieldy bureaucracy .
" american universities offer scientists better pay conditions , more time for research and less time spent teaching , " said peter doermann , a research group leader at the max planck institute for molecular plant physiology near berlin .
some estimates say that scientists can earn three times as much money working in the united states compared to germany .
harming those who stay the brain drain can also hurt scientists working at home , doermann told deutsche welle .
" for me it 's a problem of collaboration , since the major players are in the u.s. there are some germans who were quite promising , and all of them went to the u.s. if you are below a critical number of people in a certain research area , you encounter problems applying for joint grants and european grants .
the german research foundation insists on only german research scientists , and if people leave there are n't enough left to collaborate , " he explained .
in an effort to reverse the trend , the german government last year said it would devote an extra € 100 million -lrb- $ 127 million -rrb- over the next four years to stimulate research and development in biotechnology in addition to the € 110 million already spent in the last three years .
announcing the package at the biotechnology day in leipzig in october , education and research minister edelgard bulmahn said the extra money would be directed to small- and medium-sized biotechnology companies .
gerd kempermann , for one , recently returned to germany to work at a local research clinic , but not because the conditions were better he said .
" they were for soft reasons , private reasons .
one ends up returning to where one comes from , " he explained .
kempermann is optimistic that despite the critical unemployment situation in the country - where 4.6 million people are registered jobless - the wealth of talent should encourage the public and private sector to invest in the human capital .
" i think that the motivation and the optimism will return quite quickly if a few fundamental conditions are changed .
if the government would support general research then we could have a flourishing landscape in no time . " margret steffen , dw staff -lrb- jsm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de are german universities losing their luster ?

german general götz gliemeroth handed over command of the nato-led peacekeeping force in afghanistan to canada on monday amid fresh security concerns following an emergence of suicide bomb attacks . after a year of steering the 6,420-strong multinational international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- charged with overseeing security in the afghan capital , german nato general goetz gliemeroth handed over the reins to canadian general rick hillier on monday .
the canadian troops with 2,000 soldiers make up the largest contingent of the nato-led isaf force .
it ’ s unclear how long they will remain in afghanistan .
the canadian contingent is expected to end its deployment in august , but canadian prime minister paul martin has said 500 soldiers will stay on after that period .
security fears rise after attacks the festive hand-over ceremony was marked by tight security following a recent wave of suicide bomb attacks which killed a canadian soldier in kabul last month and a british peacekeeper a day later .
the attacks , claimed by the taliban , came on the heels of a december suicide bombing in which five afghan security officials were killed in kabul .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaap de hoop scheffer earlier , jaap de hoop scheffer -lrb- photo -rrb- expressed concerns that the emergence of suicide bomb attacks on kabul peacekeepers showed that the capital was far from secure .
he called on the international community not to lose its focus on a nation still racked by violence , poverty and a booming drug trade .
" the situation is fragile , " de hoop scheffer told reporters aboard a u.s. military plane on his way to kabul .
" it ’ s extremely difficult to have a 100 percent defence against these horrible suicide attacks . ”
de hoop scheffer also underlined afghanistan ’ s importance for the military alliance .
" we now know that our future security , no matter where we are , is dependant on afghanistan ’ s security , " he said during the hand-over ceremony and warned that the international community needed to stay involved in afghanistan .
" the u.n. , the european union , japan and other important donors should stay fully committed to this country , " de hoop scheffer said .
" nato can provide security and stability , but the afghan people need housing and schooling and roofs over their heads . "
successes and challenges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lt-gen .
goetz f.e. gliemeroth , new commander of isaf , salutes as he arrives for the handover ceremony of commanding force from isaf to nato in kabul , afghanistan monday , aug .
11 , 2003 .
nato took command of the 5,000-strong international peacekeeping force in the afghan capital on monday , a historic move that marks the alliance 's first operation outside europe since it was created 54 years ago .
-lrb- ap photo / apichart weerawong -rrb- taking stock of germany ’ s isaf year , german general götz gliemeroth -lrb- photo -rrb- stressed that germany had notched up successes during its command of the isaf , most notably the smooth running of the loya jirga or the grand assembly that agreed on a new constitution for afghanistan in december .
he also said considerable progress was made in the program towards disarming some 10,000 militia in the country under germany ’ s leadership .
at the same time gliemeroth warned that the nexus between the local warlords who ran provincial private armies and the wealthy druglords posed one of the biggest threats to afghanistan ’ s future .
" deplorably we ’ re seeing a connection between this so-called warlordism , which means commanders who maintain armies for political reasons to exert pressure , and the funds that come from the drugs trade , " gliemeroth said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poppy farmer mohammad agha in afghanistan the general , who has suggested in the past that nato should tackle the issue even it meant violent conflicts with the drug mafia , insisted that cracking down on the flourishing drug trade should be made a priority .
" it ’ s a challenge that the international community must urgently take up .
i can only add that soldiers are the least appropriate means to combat the planting of opium and drug transport .
rather we need to set up the right structures in afghanistan and shore them with funds , " he said .
continuing commitment to afghanistan needed gliemeroth urged continuing engagement in the civil-military area .
he pointed towards the success of the first provincial reconstruction team -lrb- prt -rrb- in kunduz in northern afghanistan .
nato controls that area and the prt is involved in the reconstruction of hundreds of schools , hospitals , fountains and irrigation projects .
" i think our alliance partners have realized the central importance of such prts for the further development of afghanistan , " he said .
nato currently runs one prt , while the u.s-led force of 10,600 controls the remainder .
prts , whose members range from a few dozen to more than 200 , combine military and reconstruction roles in far-flung areas .
by next month there will be 13 prts across afghanistan .
nato ’ s peacekeeping force aims to set up five new teams over the next six months .
gliemeroth however warned that the situation in iraq shouldn ’ t be allowed to divert attention from afghanistan .
" currently , in all fairness to the situation in iraq , it has to be said that afghanistan has been largely overshadowed by the development there , " gliemeroth said .

as nature awakes from the harsh winter and blossoms begin to change the barren land , the opium poppy sleeps on .
a few months later , the fields will be full with beautiful red flowers . then the harvest begins ; the poppies are mowed and in the weeks that follow , the product that these plants hold within will hit the streets of western cities in the form of powder sold in small plastic bags . in an attempt to stop the tide of afghan heroin flooding european cities , politicians and representatives of international organizations have been meeting in kabul to discuss strategies to counter the country ’ s drug cultivation industry . britain and us favor burning fields bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but while the experts are united in their cause to stamp out the scourge of afghan heroin crossing their borders , there are conflicting views on what the best action is .
britain , which was given the role of stamping out afghanistan ’ s drug output at the bonn conference shortly after the fall of the taliban regime , is in favor of burning the poppy fields and destroying the drug labs . considered harsh by many , the united states supports such a " slash and burn " tactic . however , german experts wish to pursue alternative solutions .
“ these repressive measures do not correspond to our plan of lasting development , ” said christoph berg , project manager of the drugs and development scheme of the german society for technical cooperation -lrb- gtz -rrb- , in an interview with deutsche welle .
“ we want to show the farmers that there are alternatives to opium growing . ” farmers would prefer alternative income bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the warlords control their own areas and profit from the local crop .
research carried out by the gtz shows that the cultivation of wheat , wine , fruit or spices could well replace the production of heroin as a source of making a living for afghans .
" we have spoken with farmers .
many would stop growing opium if they could survive by producing other products , ” said berg , adding that all production of opium is illegal in afghanistan . the gtz experts in kabul form a part of a project investigating " drug control connected to development , " an eu supported initiative which is being funded by the bloc to the tune of € 9 million over the next three years .
the project intends to start the process of replacing the drug economy at the very roots by working with schools and health centers in the eastern provinces of laghman , kunar and nangarhar and to set up and strengthen alternative agricultural cooperatives . gtz must convince profiting warlords bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr soldiers on patrol in afghanistan .
the project will last for at least 10 to 15 years , according to berg , and it will take at least that long before the first successes becomes visible in the fight against drugs .
not everybody is so eager to cooperate .

as nature awakes from the harsh winter and blossoms begin to change the barren land , the opium poppy sleeps on .
a few months later , the fields will be full with beautiful red flowers . then the harvest begins ; the poppies are mowed and in the weeks that follow , the product that these plants hold within will hit the streets of western cities in the form of powder sold in small plastic bags . in an attempt to stop the tide of afghan heroin flooding european cities , politicians and representatives of international organizations have been meeting in kabul to discuss strategies to counter the country ’ s drug cultivation industry . britain and us favor burning fields bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but while the experts are united in their cause to stamp out the scourge of afghan heroin crossing their borders , there are conflicting views on what the best action is .
britain , which was given the role of stamping out afghanistan ’ s drug output at the bonn conference shortly after the fall of the taliban regime , is in favor of burning the poppy fields and destroying the drug labs . considered harsh by many , the united states supports such a " slash and burn " tactic . however , german experts wish to pursue alternative solutions .
“ these repressive measures do not correspond to our plan of lasting development , ” said christoph berg , project manager of the drugs and development scheme of the german society for technical cooperation -lrb- gtz -rrb- , in an interview with deutsche welle .
“ we want to show the farmers that there are alternatives to opium growing . ” farmers would prefer alternative income bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the warlords control their own areas and profit from the local crop .
research carried out by the gtz shows that the cultivation of wheat , wine , fruit or spices could well replace the production of heroin as a source of making a living for afghans .
" we have spoken with farmers .
many would stop growing opium if they could survive by producing other products , ” said berg , adding that all production of opium is illegal in afghanistan . the gtz experts in kabul form a part of a project investigating " drug control connected to development , " an eu supported initiative which is being funded by the bloc to the tune of € 9 million over the next three years .
the project intends to start the process of replacing the drug economy at the very roots by working with schools and health centers in the eastern provinces of laghman , kunar and nangarhar and to set up and strengthen alternative agricultural cooperatives . gtz must convince profiting warlords bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr soldiers on patrol in afghanistan .
the project will last for at least 10 to 15 years , according to berg , and it will take at least that long before the first successes becomes visible in the fight against drugs .
not everybody is so eager to cooperate .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 09.02.2004 german experts offer alternatives in afghan drug war großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan 's opium trade is flourishing while britain proposes a “ slash and burn ” policy in the fight against the afghan opium trade , the germans want to link education and prevention with development in a different type of war . the far-reaching plains of afghanistan hold a deadly secret through the spring .
as nature awakes from the harsh winter and blossoms begin to change the barren land , the opium poppy sleeps on .
a few months later , the fields will be full with beautiful red flowers . then the harvest begins ; the poppies are mowed and in the weeks that follow , the product that these plants hold within will hit the streets of western cities in the form of powder sold in small plastic bags . in an attempt to stop the tide of afghan heroin flooding european cities , politicians and representatives of international organizations have been meeting in kabul to discuss strategies to counter the country ’ s drug cultivation industry . britain and us favor burning fields bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but while the experts are united in their cause to stamp out the scourge of afghan heroin crossing their borders , there are conflicting views on what the best action is .
britain , which was given the role of stamping out afghanistan ’ s drug output at the bonn conference shortly after the fall of the taliban regime , is in favor of burning the poppy fields and destroying the drug labs . considered harsh by many , the united states supports such a " slash and burn " tactic . however , german experts wish to pursue alternative solutions .
“ these repressive measures do not correspond to our plan of lasting development , ” said christoph berg , project manager of the drugs and development scheme of the german society for technical cooperation -lrb- gtz -rrb- , in an interview with deutsche welle .
“ we want to show the farmers that there are alternatives to opium growing . ” farmers would prefer alternative income bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the warlords control their own areas and profit from the local crop .
research carried out by the gtz shows that the cultivation of wheat , wine , fruit or spices could well replace the production of heroin as a source of making a living for afghans .
" we have spoken with farmers .
many would stop growing opium if they could survive by producing other products , ” said berg , adding that all production of opium is illegal in afghanistan . the gtz experts in kabul form a part of a project investigating " drug control connected to development , " an eu supported initiative which is being funded by the bloc to the tune of € 9 million over the next three years .
the project intends to start the process of replacing the drug economy at the very roots by working with schools and health centers in the eastern provinces of laghman , kunar and nangarhar and to set up and strengthen alternative agricultural cooperatives . gtz must convince profiting warlords bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr soldiers on patrol in afghanistan .
the project will last for at least 10 to 15 years , according to berg , and it will take at least that long before the first successes becomes visible in the fight against drugs .
not everybody is so eager to cooperate .
“ we must also try to include the local warlords and work constructively with them , ” said berg .
the warlords profit from the drug business and the afghan economy relies heavily on it while there is little alternative .
convincing some of the benefits of other crops will take time . but the german focus is on a peaceful and progressive campaign against the drug trade emanating from afghanistan .
the military has also taken a non-aggressive stance on the opium business , especially as the bundeswehr attempts to win over the hearts and minds of the afghan people through its reconstruction efforts . germany rules out military intervention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heroin is a problem in most european cities .
the soldiers of the regional reconstruction team -lrb- prt -rrb- in the northern afghan city of kunduz are operating in one of the most opium rich areas of the country .
however , the german parliament only agreed the deployment of the force outside the relative safety of the international assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- mission in kabul on the condition that the 220 soldiers of the prt keep out of the fight with the drug barons . but despite the plans of the gtz and the resolution of the bundeswehr , the fight against the poppy growers and cultivators will go on as british and u.s. forces continue to target a way of life that not only provides their enemies with funds to fight on but also takes the war to the streets of their home nations . harvests improving every year according to the united nations , 2003 saw afghanistan ’ s second-best harvest ever registered : 3,600 metric tons of opium , material for 360 metric tons of heroin was produced last year .
this number is second only to the bumper crop of 1999 from which 4,600 metric tons were collected . # b # this year , a good harvest is expected once again , adding to afghanistan ’ s reputation as the world market leader in the production of the drug .
the drug cultivation and drug trafficking makes up half of the afghan domestic product , three quarters of the world production in opium comes from the hindu kush and drug experts estimate that 90 percent of the raw afghan opium makes it to europe in the form of refined heroin . dw-staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de struck says afghanistan still not safe german defense minister peter struck has wrapped up a visit to the northern afghan city of kunduz , saying the country still is n't " stable " and has ruled out helping the afghans fight the drug trade .

mikhail gorbachev … helmut kohl … david hasselhoff .
no , do not adjust your screens .
the list of those who contributed to the fall of the berlin wall and the end of communism has long been missing one name … until now . it was one of the defining moments of the twentieth century .
not only did it come to represent the collapse of the soviet union , the end of the communist dream and the concluding drama of the cold war , the fall of the berlin wall must also be remembered as the moment a nation that had been divided for 28 years came together .
thank you , david hasselhoff . excuse me ?
david hasselhoff ?
the man who made talking cars every small boy ’ s dream and scantily-clad , surgically enhanced beauties running in slow motion every teenage boy ’ s fantasy ?
surely the actor-slash-singer responsible for immortalizing such screen idols as michael knight and mitch buchannon can ’ t be accredited with bringing down a superpower and reuniting germany . well , according to the man himself , hasselhoff does indeed feel that he played his part in bringing about the fall of the berlin wall and aiding the reunification of east and west germany .
and not through some heroic spy chase across communist berlin at the wheel of his trusty car kitt or a daring rescue involving pamela anderson and a defecting russian diplomat in a thong .
no , hasselhoff believes his contribution came about through the unifying and healing power of his music . cover version caught the moment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after recording an english language cover version of the 1970s german hit , “ auf der strasse nach suden ” and renaming it “ looking for freedom , ” hasselhoff raced up the charts in the late summer of 1989 , just as a tide of revolution began rolling through eastern europe . the soft rock god had sublimely caught the moment by crooning the stirring lyrics : " i 've been lookin ' for freedom ; i 've been lookin ' so long ; i 've been lookin ' for freedom ; still the search goes on . "
and as a result , after spending several weeks at number one , the song became the anthem of some of those struggling to reconcile the broken nation . even as the hammers began to fall on the symbol of division , hasselhoff ’ s music was omnipresent ; the album of the same name was also germany ’ s best selling long player of the time , keeping less important records off the top spot for three months . freedom found bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " david , we love you ! "
at last , all those germans who had been looking for freedom eventually found it as the wall finally crumbled on november 9 , 1989 , allowing thousands of east germans to flood into west berlin to be reunited with loved ones and to buy long-forbidden albums from hasselhoff ’ s musical back catalogue . there was even a moment when the reunited country joined together to thank the man who had provided the soundtrack to such historic change .
after being invited to headline a new year ’ s eve concert at the brandenburg gate by former german chancellor helmut kohl , the people ’ s champion finally got his chance to deliver his song in person to an audience of almost a million reunited germans . playing to an audience of united germans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it was the first time germany had been unified , and close to a million east and west german fans stood together in the freezing cold at midnight watching me perform .
i was overcome with emotion , " he recalled in an interview with german magazine tv spielfilm . but official recognition evaded him .
“ i am a little bit sad that no photo of me hangs in the checkpoint charlie museum in berlin , ” he added with regret after his contribution to reunification failed to make it into the berlin wall commemorative exhibition at the former border crossing . museum missing hero 's portrait bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : checkpoint charlie .
but how can this be ?
surely a man who mobilized a divided nation , a man whose voice was the catalyst for revolution , should be honoured for his role in changing the world as many knew it back then . but the checkpoint charlie museum in berlin is n't quite convinced of the singer 's historical significance .
“ what did he do ? ” wondered the museum 's spokesperson when dw-world questioned why hasselhoff was not included in the hall of fame .
“ we didn ’ t know the song was that important .
we like mr. hasselhoff but there are no documents that record his role in the fall of the berlin wall . ” “ we do have a picture of roger moore as james bond though , ” the spokesperson offered up as a gesture to international stardom . and so , while a fictional spy is lauded for his work in promoting berlin , david hasselhoff must be content with making the next generation of germans whole again through his music . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de where 's the berlin wall ?
in the past few years , berlin has rushed to preserve the remaining remants of its wall - the ultimate cold war symbol - for the sake of history and curious tourists .

mikhail gorbachev … helmut kohl … david hasselhoff .
no , do not adjust your screens .
the list of those who contributed to the fall of the berlin wall and the end of communism has long been missing one name … until now . it was one of the defining moments of the twentieth century .
not only did it come to represent the collapse of the soviet union , the end of the communist dream and the concluding drama of the cold war , the fall of the berlin wall must also be remembered as the moment a nation that had been divided for 28 years came together .
thank you , david hasselhoff . excuse me ?
david hasselhoff ?
the man who made talking cars every small boy ’ s dream and scantily-clad , surgically enhanced beauties running in slow motion every teenage boy ’ s fantasy ?
surely the actor-slash-singer responsible for immortalizing such screen idols as michael knight and mitch buchannon can ’ t be accredited with bringing down a superpower and reuniting germany . well , according to the man himself , hasselhoff does indeed feel that he played his part in bringing about the fall of the berlin wall and aiding the reunification of east and west germany .
and not through some heroic spy chase across communist berlin at the wheel of his trusty car kitt or a daring rescue involving pamela anderson and a defecting russian diplomat in a thong .
no , hasselhoff believes his contribution came about through the unifying and healing power of his music . cover version caught the moment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after recording an english language cover version of the 1970s german hit , “ auf der strasse nach suden ” and renaming it “ looking for freedom , ” hasselhoff raced up the charts in the late summer of 1989 , just as a tide of revolution began rolling through eastern europe . the soft rock god had sublimely caught the moment by crooning the stirring lyrics : " i 've been lookin ' for freedom ; i 've been lookin ' so long ; i 've been lookin ' for freedom ; still the search goes on . "
and as a result , after spending several weeks at number one , the song became the anthem of some of those struggling to reconcile the broken nation . even as the hammers began to fall on the symbol of division , hasselhoff ’ s music was omnipresent ; the album of the same name was also germany ’ s best selling long player of the time , keeping less important records off the top spot for three months . freedom found bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " david , we love you ! "
at last , all those germans who had been looking for freedom eventually found it as the wall finally crumbled on november 9 , 1989 , allowing thousands of east germans to flood into west berlin to be reunited with loved ones and to buy long-forbidden albums from hasselhoff ’ s musical back catalogue . there was even a moment when the reunited country joined together to thank the man who had provided the soundtrack to such historic change .
after being invited to headline a new year ’ s eve concert at the brandenburg gate by former german chancellor helmut kohl , the people ’ s champion finally got his chance to deliver his song in person to an audience of almost a million reunited germans . playing to an audience of united germans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it was the first time germany had been unified , and close to a million east and west german fans stood together in the freezing cold at midnight watching me perform .
i was overcome with emotion , " he recalled in an interview with german magazine tv spielfilm . but official recognition evaded him .
“ i am a little bit sad that no photo of me hangs in the checkpoint charlie museum in berlin , ” he added with regret after his contribution to reunification failed to make it into the berlin wall commemorative exhibition at the former border crossing . museum missing hero 's portrait bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : checkpoint charlie .

surely a man who mobilized a divided nation , a man whose voice was the catalyst for revolution , should be honoured for his role in changing the world as many knew it back then . but the checkpoint charlie museum in berlin is n't quite convinced of the singer 's historical significance .
“ what did he do ? ” wondered the museum 's spokesperson when dw-world questioned why hasselhoff was not included in the hall of fame .
“ we didn ’ t know the song was that important .
we like mr. hasselhoff but there are no documents that record his role in the fall of the berlin wall . ” “ we do have a picture of roger moore as james bond though , ” the spokesperson offered up as a gesture to international stardom . and so , while a fictional spy is lauded for his work in promoting berlin , david hasselhoff must be content with making the next generation of germans whole again through his music . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de where 's the berlin wall ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 09.02.2004 preventing the next parmalat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parmalat - could it happen in germany ?
after the parmalat fiasco , the italian government has taken steps to reform the country 's regulatory system .
but do the reforms go far enough , and how do they compare to those elsewhere in europe , including germany ? the italian cabinet has approved a draft law aimed at reforming italy 's regulatory system .
the law , which is still subject to parliamentary approval , is the first step towards changing a system which , in the eyes of many , failed to prevent the multi-billion dollar parmalat scandal .
but after months of political wrangling , the tough original version of the bill was watered down - and may be further diluted before it gets final parliamentary approval sometime in the next three months - raising doubts about the current italian government 's ability to impose better corporate governance and soothe investor anxieties .
elsewhere in europe , including germany , steps have been taken to prevent a parmalat or enron-style meltdown .
but are the safeguards sufficient ?
italian economy minister hopes for radical reform the law approved by the italian government last week was very different from the one proposed by italy 's economy minister giulio tremonti .
shortly after parmalat first made the news in december , tremonti called for shifting oversight authority away from the bank of italy and giving more power to the anti-trust authority and consab , the italian equivalent of the united states ' federal exchange commission -lrb- fec -rrb- .
those found guilty of financial fraud would also face longer prison terms .
in short , tremonti hoped to consolidate italy 's complicated regulatory system , which is comprised of five parts , each devoted to different types of business , into a three-pronged system .
italian politicians reluctant to make big changes but tremonti faced tough opposition from the country 's business-mogul prime minister silvio berlusconi and his allies , who feared that a harsh response would be bad for business .
" we do n't need to turn an exceptional event into a witch hunt , which would make the running of an insurance or financial company difficult , " said berlusconi .
as it turned out the draft law did not , as some had hoped , consolidate the various authorities .
instead it strengthened consob with greater sanctioning powers and the authority to oversee corporate bond issues .
not everyone , including tremonti , was convinced .
" we would have liked a radical reform , and now we risk introducing a reform that is n't very incisive , " he said .
the german path to reform in an interview with deutsche welle , marco becht , the executive director of the european corporate governance institute and a professor of finance and economics at the university of brussels , points to the complexity of the issue .
" sometimes it is a case of management without enough shareholder oversight , as was the case with enron , and sometimes it is a case of a very powerful shareholder getting up to something , as was the case with parmalat , " he said .
" the tools you need in each of these situations is slightly different , " he added .
given the complexity of the task at hand , and the increasing complexity of multi-national corporations engaged in different types of business , what 's a government - say the one in berlin - to do ?
tremonti 's approach , consolidating various oversight authorities into a more cooperative powerful single entity , is an approach that has proven popular elsewhere in europe , according to ernst maug , a professor of business administration at humboldt university in berlin .
germany did so in 2002 , consolidating various regulatory agencies into bafin , the federal agency responsible for overseeing the entire financial sector .
" this seems to be the trend and makes a lot of sense to me , " maug told deutsche welle .
" it does n't make sense to have different regulatory agencies overseeing different sectors just because one security is called a stock and another a bond ; when you have one authority you have a better chance of catching things . "
what 's more , also in 2002 , the german corporate governance code , also known as the " kodex , " was implemented .
this code of " best practices " is not legally binding , but companies are now required to disclose in their annual reports the extent to which they comply with the code and explain opt-outs .
a german parmalat ?
these measures by no means guarantee that a corporate scandal like parmalat or enron wo n't happen in germany .
" could it happen here - yes , " says maug .
you will never have a system where everyone complies with the law all the time , he points out , and reducing these scandals to zero is not an option , since the resulting regulation could prove too costly for business .
brecht concurs .
" there is always a trade-off in trying to prevent the next parmalat from happening and restricting executives from being able to do business , " he says .
" with regulation , you have to do a cost-benefit analysis . "
in the meantime , governments in europe and the world over continue to debate how to strike the best balance . kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de how to say " enron " in italian casting new doubt on european corporate governance , leading italian food group parmalat announced last week the firm had a € 4-billion discrepancy in its books .

as nature awakes from the harsh winter and blossoms begin to change the barren land , the opium poppy sleeps on .
a few months later , the fields will be full with beautiful red flowers . then the harvest begins ; the poppies are mowed and in the weeks that follow , the product that these plants hold within will hit the streets of western cities in the form of powder sold in small plastic bags . in an attempt to stop the tide of afghan heroin flooding european cities , politicians and representatives of international organizations have been meeting in kabul to discuss strategies to counter the country ’ s drug cultivation industry . britain and us favor burning fields bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but while the experts are united in their cause to stamp out the scourge of afghan heroin crossing their borders , there are conflicting views on what the best action is .
britain , which was given the role of stamping out afghanistan ’ s drug output at the bonn conference shortly after the fall of the taliban regime , is in favor of burning the poppy fields and destroying the drug labs . considered harsh by many , the united states supports such a " slash and burn " tactic . however , german experts wish to pursue alternative solutions .
“ these repressive measures do not correspond to our plan of lasting development , ” said christoph berg , project manager of the drugs and development scheme of the german society for technical cooperation -lrb- gtz -rrb- , in an interview with deutsche welle .
“ we want to show the farmers that there are alternatives to opium growing . ” farmers would prefer alternative income bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the warlords control their own areas and profit from the local crop .
research carried out by the gtz shows that the cultivation of wheat , wine , fruit or spices could well replace the production of heroin as a source of making a living for afghans .
" we have spoken with farmers .
many would stop growing opium if they could survive by producing other products , ” said berg , adding that all production of opium is illegal in afghanistan . the gtz experts in kabul form a part of a project investigating " drug control connected to development , " an eu supported initiative which is being funded by the bloc to the tune of € 9 million over the next three years .
the project intends to start the process of replacing the drug economy at the very roots by working with schools and health centers in the eastern provinces of laghman , kunar and nangarhar and to set up and strengthen alternative agricultural cooperatives . gtz must convince profiting warlords bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr soldiers on patrol in afghanistan .
the project will last for at least 10 to 15 years , according to berg , and it will take at least that long before the first successes becomes visible in the fight against drugs .
not everybody is so eager to cooperate .
“ we must also try to include the local warlords and work constructively with them , ” said berg .
the warlords profit from the drug business and the afghan economy relies heavily on it while there is little alternative .
convincing some of the benefits of other crops will take time . but the german focus is on a peaceful and progressive campaign against the drug trade emanating from afghanistan .
the military has also taken a non-aggressive stance on the opium business , especially as the bundeswehr attempts to win over the hearts and minds of the afghan people through its reconstruction efforts . germany rules out military intervention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heroin is a problem in most european cities .
the soldiers of the regional reconstruction team -lrb- prt -rrb- in the northern afghan city of kunduz are operating in one of the most opium rich areas of the country .
however , the german parliament only agreed the deployment of the force outside the relative safety of the international assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- mission in kabul on the condition that the 220 soldiers of the prt keep out of the fight with the drug barons . but despite the plans of the gtz and the resolution of the bundeswehr , the fight against the poppy growers and cultivators will go on as british and u.s. forces continue to target a way of life that not only provides their enemies with funds to fight on but also takes the war to the streets of their home nations . harvests improving every year according to the united nations , 2003 saw afghanistan ’ s second-best harvest ever registered : 3,600 metric tons of opium , material for 360 metric tons of heroin was produced last year .
this number is second only to the bumper crop of 1999 from which 4,600 metric tons were collected . # b # this year , a good harvest is expected once again , adding to afghanistan ’ s reputation as the world market leader in the production of the drug .
the drug cultivation and drug trafficking makes up half of the afghan domestic product , three quarters of the world production in opium comes from the hindu kush and drug experts estimate that 90 percent of the raw afghan opium makes it to europe in the form of refined heroin . dw-staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de struck says afghanistan still not safe german defense minister peter struck has wrapped up a visit to the northern afghan city of kunduz , saying the country still is n't " stable " and has ruled out helping the afghans fight the drug trade .

“ these repressive measures do not correspond to our plan of lasting development , ” said christoph berg , project manager of the drugs and development scheme of the german society for technical cooperation -lrb- gtz -rrb- , in an interview with deutsche welle .
“ we want to show the farmers that there are alternatives to opium growing . ” farmers would prefer alternative income bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the warlords control their own areas and profit from the local crop .
research carried out by the gtz shows that the cultivation of wheat , wine , fruit or spices could well replace the production of heroin as a source of making a living for afghans .
" we have spoken with farmers .
many would stop growing opium if they could survive by producing other products , ” said berg , adding that all production of opium is illegal in afghanistan . the gtz experts in kabul form a part of a project investigating " drug control connected to development , " an eu supported initiative which is being funded by the bloc to the tune of € 9 million over the next three years .
the project intends to start the process of replacing the drug economy at the very roots by working with schools and health centers in the eastern provinces of laghman , kunar and nangarhar and to set up and strengthen alternative agricultural cooperatives . gtz must convince profiting warlords bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr soldiers on patrol in afghanistan .
the project will last for at least 10 to 15 years , according to berg , and it will take at least that long before the first successes becomes visible in the fight against drugs .
not everybody is so eager to cooperate .
“ we must also try to include the local warlords and work constructively with them , ” said berg .
the warlords profit from the drug business and the afghan economy relies heavily on it while there is little alternative .
convincing some of the benefits of other crops will take time . but the german focus is on a peaceful and progressive campaign against the drug trade emanating from afghanistan .
the military has also taken a non-aggressive stance on the opium business , especially as the bundeswehr attempts to win over the hearts and minds of the afghan people through its reconstruction efforts . germany rules out military intervention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heroin is a problem in most european cities .
the soldiers of the regional reconstruction team -lrb- prt -rrb- in the northern afghan city of kunduz are operating in one of the most opium rich areas of the country .
however , the german parliament only agreed the deployment of the force outside the relative safety of the international assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- mission in kabul on the condition that the 220 soldiers of the prt keep out of the fight with the drug barons . but despite the plans of the gtz and the resolution of the bundeswehr , the fight against the poppy growers and cultivators will go on as british and u.s. forces continue to target a way of life that not only provides their enemies with funds to fight on but also takes the war to the streets of their home nations . harvests improving every year according to the united nations , 2003 saw afghanistan ’ s second-best harvest ever registered : 3,600 metric tons of opium , material for 360 metric tons of heroin was produced last year .
this number is second only to the bumper crop of 1999 from which 4,600 metric tons were collected . # b # this year , a good harvest is expected once again , adding to afghanistan ’ s reputation as the world market leader in the production of the drug .
the drug cultivation and drug trafficking makes up half of the afghan domestic product , three quarters of the world production in opium comes from the hindu kush and drug experts estimate that 90 percent of the raw afghan opium makes it to europe in the form of refined heroin . dw-staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de struck says afghanistan still not safe german defense minister peter struck has wrapped up a visit to the northern afghan city of kunduz , saying the country still is n't " stable " and has ruled out helping the afghans fight the drug trade .

opium cultivation is forbidden in the country , but there ’ s no denying it ’ s a lucrative business for impoverished farmers .

meeting near berlin on monday , german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac said they want an agreement on a new european union constitution before the end of the irish eu presidency in june . the french and german leaders revived hopes for the european union ’ s stalled constitution on monday after they said they want an agreement on it before the six-month irish presidency of the eu runs out at the end of june .
meeting in genshagen , south of berlin , schröder and chirac were unanimous that the future of the eu had to be dealt with soon .
" we agreed that it 's our joint wish that the constitution issue should be resolved by the end of june during the irish presidency , " chirac said at a joint news conference with schröder .
" if this does not happen then in any case we must try to find an accord by the end of the dutch presidency at the end of 2004 , " he added .
warming franco-german ties the move is a further sign of deepening franco-german ties .
the two leaders have forged a close political relationship since last year when they both opposed the iraq war and have seen eye to eye on hotly-debated issues such as a post-war iraqi order , the eu constitution and european security and defense policy .
" our positions on european union themes are identical , " chirac said .

most observers consider the bloc ’ s current institutional set-up as too unwieldy and inefficient .
besides ending the rotation of the eu presidency amongst the national governments , the draft constitution aims to streamline the eu commission and decision-making .
eu constitution talks broke down last december after poland and spain refused to accept newly weighted voting rights in the draft text , which would greatly curtail their voting rights in the eu council of ministers .
the two countries were the main beneficiaries of the 2000 nice treaty , which gave them just two votes less than the much more populous france and germany .
the issue has pitted france and germany against spain and poland , a future eu member .
not willing to compromise schröder however said on monday that berlin and paris did not want agreement on the constitution " at any cost . "
" we must stick to the principle of double majority , " he told reporters in berlin .
" we want progress on the issue of majority voting and we also think that the question of the efficiency of the work of the commission must be better secured than is currently the case . "
chirac added : " we want a smaller commission that in the future can work efficiently .
it is also our wish that the work of the european council does not become bogged down by excessive demands for agreement . "
schröder and chirac also said they were sticking with demands for a freeze on the eu budget until 2013 .
france , germany , britain , the netherlands , sweden and austria - all of which are net contributors to the eu – made the budget freeze demand last december in an open letter .

meeting near berlin on monday , german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac said they want an agreement on a new european union constitution before the end of the irish eu presidency in june . the french and german leaders revived hopes for the european union ’ s stalled constitution on monday after they said they want an agreement on it before the six-month irish presidency of the eu runs out at the end of june .
meeting in genshagen , south of berlin , schröder and chirac were unanimous that the future of the eu had to be dealt with soon .
" we agreed that it 's our joint wish that the constitution issue should be resolved by the end of june during the irish presidency , " chirac said at a joint news conference with schröder .
" if this does not happen then in any case we must try to find an accord by the end of the dutch presidency at the end of 2004 , " he added .
warming franco-german ties the move is a further sign of deepening franco-german ties .
the two leaders have forged a close political relationship since last year when they both opposed the iraq war and have seen eye to eye on hotly-debated issues such as a post-war iraqi order , the eu constitution and european security and defense policy .
" our positions on european union themes are identical , " chirac said .

ireland has been trying to broker an agreement on the eu constitution when it took over the presidency on jan 1 .
bedevilled eu constitution the new constitution is supposed to prepare the eu for may , when it expands from 15 to 25 members .
most observers consider the bloc ’ s current institutional set-up as too unwieldy and inefficient .
besides ending the rotation of the eu presidency amongst the national governments , the draft constitution aims to streamline the eu commission and decision-making .
eu constitution talks broke down last december after poland and spain refused to accept newly weighted voting rights in the draft text , which would greatly curtail their voting rights in the eu council of ministers .
the two countries were the main beneficiaries of the 2000 nice treaty , which gave them just two votes less than the much more populous france and germany .
the issue has pitted france and germany against spain and poland , a future eu member .
not willing to compromise schröder however said on monday that berlin and paris did not want agreement on the constitution " at any cost . "
" we must stick to the principle of double majority , " he told reporters in berlin .
" we want progress on the issue of majority voting and we also think that the question of the efficiency of the work of the commission must be better secured than is currently the case . "
chirac added : " we want a smaller commission that in the future can work efficiently .
it is also our wish that the work of the european council does not become bogged down by excessive demands for agreement . "
schröder and chirac also said they were sticking with demands for a freeze on the eu budget until 2013 .
france , germany , britain , the netherlands , sweden and austria - all of which are net contributors to the eu – made the budget freeze demand last december in an open letter .
with a little bit of british help the franco-german duo hopes their efforts will be given additional clout by the british prime minister tony blair who is expected to join in a trilateral summit in berlin next week .

after his resignation as social democratic party chairman on friday , german chancellor gerhard schröder on saturday named his likely successors , who he hopes will bring the party together on difficult reforms . these are days of surprise in the corridors of the germany ’ s governing party , the social democrats .
few had any idea on friday morning that chancellor gerhard schröder would resign from his post as head of the social democratic party and hand the reins over to franz müntefering , the party ’ s parliamentary group chairman .
then , on saturday , he named a successor for the party 's luckless general secretary , olaf scholz .
" on march 21 , the spd is going to call a special party conference , " schröder told reporters saturday .
" the party executive will unanimously nominate franz müntefering as its new party chairman .
and the party executive will also nominate klaus uwe benneter as the spd ’ s new general secretary with the same number of votes . "
a new deputy 56-year-old lawyer benneter , also a member of the german parliament , the bundestag , is also a close friend of schröder .
during the turbulent 70s , the two were active together in the spd ’ s young socialists at a time when the spd ’ s youth group had taken an extreme left political course .
at one point , benneter was even temporarily banned from the party because he had spoken out in favor of cooperation with communists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus-uwe benneter today ’ s an altogether different story .
these days , benneter -lrb- photo -rrb- calls for deep cuts into germany ’ s social system , for reforms of the labor market and public healthcare system – all initiatives that have drawn heavy criticism from the social democrats ’ party base and voters .
together , benneter and müntefering are expected to bring the party ’ s traditional leftist core into line with the government ’ s planned reforms .
müntefering calls for broad party debate on reforms müntefering said saturday he wanted to speak clear language about " equitableness , " one of the core principles of european social democratic movements . " that ’ s not just a saying , " müntefering said , " rather , it is something that has always been a deep part of this party ’ s history .
whoever speaks of ‘ equitableness ’ has to start with equal opportunities .
and they have to start with the fact that that is not functioning in the scope that we desire .
we ’ ve spoken of our solid determination to create a situation where young people in this country aren ’ t able to fall from school desk to the unemployment rolls .
the situation can ’ t stay as it is . "
speaking on a handful of german public broadcasting stations on saturday , müntefering said he wants to involve the party in the government ’ s reform policies more than in the past , admitting to ard that the reform policy negotiations within the party had been " suboptimal . "
in the future , he said reforms needed to be prepared more " cautiously . "
in an interview with zdf , he said he intended to open an intensive debate within the party about planned reforms while at the same time standing shoulder to shoulder with the government .
a deft political move ?
the first reactions coming out of the party this weekend suggest schröder made a deft political move by resigning from his position as party chairman .
the chancellor made clear on saturday that the party reins would soon be tightened , and that even in his cabinet there was no breathing room left for error .
in other words : controversial members of the cabinet , like transport minister manfred stolpe who has overseen the trouble-plagued implementation of tolls for heavy trucks and transports on germany highways , are now on probation . indeed , in recent weeks the pages of germany 's top newspapers and magazines have been filled with speculation of a possible shakeup of schröder 's cabinet .
schröder said the party needed to put its collective energy toward the different tasks required for safeguarding and implementing the reform process .
opposition : spd falling apart the minority opposition , neo-liberal free democratic party immediately criticized benneter ’ s nomination , lambasting the move as a signal that the spd is shifting to the left .
and dieter althaus of the christian democratic union said that the decision by the spd to appoint a relatively unknown politician to the position of general secretary showed how difficult it had become for the party to find leaders .
earlier , cdu chairwoman angela merkel and the head of the cdu ’ s bavarian sister party , the christian social union , edmund stoiber , both said schröder ’ s resignation marked the " beginning of the end " of the party . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder leaves an unloved post by quitting as the head of the social democratic party on friday , gerhard schröder left an office he hardly loved .

german general götz gliemeroth handed over command of the nato-led peacekeeping force in afghanistan to canada on monday amid fresh security concerns following an emergence of suicide bomb attacks . after a year of steering the 6,420-strong multinational international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- charged with overseeing security in the afghan capital , german nato general goetz gliemeroth handed over the reins to canadian general rick hillier on monday .
the canadian troops with 2,000 soldiers make up the largest contingent of the nato-led isaf force .
it ’ s unclear how long they will remain in afghanistan .
the canadian contingent is expected to end its deployment in august , but canadian prime minister paul martin has said 500 soldiers will stay on after that period .
security fears rise after attacks the festive hand-over ceremony was marked by tight security following a recent wave of suicide bomb attacks which killed a canadian soldier in kabul last month and a british peacekeeper a day later .
the attacks , claimed by the taliban , came on the heels of a december suicide bombing in which five afghan security officials were killed in kabul .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaap de hoop scheffer earlier , jaap de hoop scheffer -lrb- photo -rrb- expressed concerns that the emergence of suicide bomb attacks on kabul peacekeepers showed that the capital was far from secure .
he called on the international community not to lose its focus on a nation still racked by violence , poverty and a booming drug trade .
" the situation is fragile , " de hoop scheffer told reporters aboard a u.s. military plane on his way to kabul .
" it ’ s extremely difficult to have a 100 percent defence against these horrible suicide attacks . ”
de hoop scheffer also underlined afghanistan ’ s importance for the military alliance .
" we now know that our future security , no matter where we are , is dependant on afghanistan ’ s security , " he said during the hand-over ceremony and warned that the international community needed to stay involved in afghanistan .
" the u.n. , the european union , japan and other important donors should stay fully committed to this country , " de hoop scheffer said .
" nato can provide security and stability , but the afghan people need housing and schooling and roofs over their heads . "

11 , 2003 .
nato took command of the 5,000-strong international peacekeeping force in the afghan capital on monday , a historic move that marks the alliance 's first operation outside europe since it was created 54 years ago .
-lrb- ap photo / apichart weerawong -rrb- taking stock of germany ’ s isaf year , german general götz gliemeroth -lrb- photo -rrb- stressed that germany had notched up successes during its command of the isaf , most notably the smooth running of the loya jirga or the grand assembly that agreed on a new constitution for afghanistan in december .
he also said considerable progress was made in the program towards disarming some 10,000 militia in the country under germany ’ s leadership .
at the same time gliemeroth warned that the nexus between the local warlords who ran provincial private armies and the wealthy druglords posed one of the biggest threats to afghanistan ’ s future .
" deplorably we ’ re seeing a connection between this so-called warlordism , which means commanders who maintain armies for political reasons to exert pressure , and the funds that come from the drugs trade , " gliemeroth said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poppy farmer mohammad agha in afghanistan the general , who has suggested in the past that nato should tackle the issue even it meant violent conflicts with the drug mafia , insisted that cracking down on the flourishing drug trade should be made a priority .
" it ’ s a challenge that the international community must urgently take up .
i can only add that soldiers are the least appropriate means to combat the planting of opium and drug transport .
rather we need to set up the right structures in afghanistan and shore them with funds , " he said .
continuing commitment to afghanistan needed gliemeroth urged continuing engagement in the civil-military area .
he pointed towards the success of the first provincial reconstruction team -lrb- prt -rrb- in kunduz in northern afghanistan .
nato controls that area and the prt is involved in the reconstruction of hundreds of schools , hospitals , fountains and irrigation projects .
" i think our alliance partners have realized the central importance of such prts for the further development of afghanistan , " he said .
nato currently runs one prt , while the u.s-led force of 10,600 controls the remainder .
prts , whose members range from a few dozen to more than 200 , combine military and reconstruction roles in far-flung areas .
by next month there will be 13 prts across afghanistan .
nato ’ s peacekeeping force aims to set up five new teams over the next six months .
gliemeroth however warned that the situation in iraq shouldn ’ t be allowed to divert attention from afghanistan .
" currently , in all fairness to the situation in iraq , it has to be said that afghanistan has been largely overshadowed by the development there , " gliemeroth said .

after his resignation as social democratic party chairman on friday , german chancellor gerhard schröder on saturday named his likely successors , who he hopes will bring the party together on difficult reforms . these are days of surprise in the corridors of the germany ’ s governing party , the social democrats .
few had any idea on friday morning that chancellor gerhard schröder would resign from his post as head of the social democratic party and hand the reins over to franz müntefering , the party ’ s parliamentary group chairman .
then , on saturday , he named a successor for the party 's luckless general secretary , olaf scholz .
" on march 21 , the spd is going to call a special party conference , " schröder told reporters saturday .
" the party executive will unanimously nominate franz müntefering as its new party chairman .
and the party executive will also nominate klaus uwe benneter as the spd ’ s new general secretary with the same number of votes . "
a new deputy 56-year-old lawyer benneter , also a member of the german parliament , the bundestag , is also a close friend of schröder .
during the turbulent 70s , the two were active together in the spd ’ s young socialists at a time when the spd ’ s youth group had taken an extreme left political course .
at one point , benneter was even temporarily banned from the party because he had spoken out in favor of cooperation with communists .

german general götz gliemeroth handed over command of the nato-led peacekeeping force in afghanistan to canada on monday amid fresh security concerns following an emergence of suicide bomb attacks . after a year of steering the 6,420-strong multinational international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- charged with overseeing security in the afghan capital , german nato general goetz gliemeroth handed over the reins to canadian general rick hillier on monday .
the canadian troops with 2,000 soldiers make up the largest contingent of the nato-led isaf force .
it ’ s unclear how long they will remain in afghanistan .
the canadian contingent is expected to end its deployment in august , but canadian prime minister paul martin has said 500 soldiers will stay on after that period .
security fears rise after attacks the festive hand-over ceremony was marked by tight security following a recent wave of suicide bomb attacks which killed a canadian soldier in kabul last month and a british peacekeeper a day later .
the attacks , claimed by the taliban , came on the heels of a december suicide bombing in which five afghan security officials were killed in kabul .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaap de hoop scheffer earlier , jaap de hoop scheffer -lrb- photo -rrb- expressed concerns that the emergence of suicide bomb attacks on kabul peacekeepers showed that the capital was far from secure .
he called on the international community not to lose its focus on a nation still racked by violence , poverty and a booming drug trade .
" the situation is fragile , " de hoop scheffer told reporters aboard a u.s. military plane on his way to kabul .
" it ’ s extremely difficult to have a 100 percent defence against these horrible suicide attacks . ”
de hoop scheffer also underlined afghanistan ’ s importance for the military alliance .
" we now know that our future security , no matter where we are , is dependant on afghanistan ’ s security , " he said during the hand-over ceremony and warned that the international community needed to stay involved in afghanistan .
" the u.n. , the european union , japan and other important donors should stay fully committed to this country , " de hoop scheffer said .
" nato can provide security and stability , but the afghan people need housing and schooling and roofs over their heads . "
successes and challenges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lt-gen .
goetz f.e. gliemeroth , new commander of isaf , salutes as he arrives for the handover ceremony of commanding force from isaf to nato in kabul , afghanistan monday , aug .
11 , 2003 .
nato took command of the 5,000-strong international peacekeeping force in the afghan capital on monday , a historic move that marks the alliance 's first operation outside europe since it was created 54 years ago .
-lrb- ap photo / apichart weerawong -rrb- taking stock of germany ’ s isaf year , german general götz gliemeroth -lrb- photo -rrb- stressed that germany had notched up successes during its command of the isaf , most notably the smooth running of the loya jirga or the grand assembly that agreed on a new constitution for afghanistan in december .
he also said considerable progress was made in the program towards disarming some 10,000 militia in the country under germany ’ s leadership .
at the same time gliemeroth warned that the nexus between the local warlords who ran provincial private armies and the wealthy druglords posed one of the biggest threats to afghanistan ’ s future .
" deplorably we ’ re seeing a connection between this so-called warlordism , which means commanders who maintain armies for political reasons to exert pressure , and the funds that come from the drugs trade , " gliemeroth said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poppy farmer mohammad agha in afghanistan the general , who has suggested in the past that nato should tackle the issue even it meant violent conflicts with the drug mafia , insisted that cracking down on the flourishing drug trade should be made a priority .
" it ’ s a challenge that the international community must urgently take up .
i can only add that soldiers are the least appropriate means to combat the planting of opium and drug transport .
rather we need to set up the right structures in afghanistan and shore them with funds , " he said .
continuing commitment to afghanistan needed gliemeroth urged continuing engagement in the civil-military area .
he pointed towards the success of the first provincial reconstruction team -lrb- prt -rrb- in kunduz in northern afghanistan .
nato controls that area and the prt is involved in the reconstruction of hundreds of schools , hospitals , fountains and irrigation projects .
" i think our alliance partners have realized the central importance of such prts for the further development of afghanistan , " he said .
nato currently runs one prt , while the u.s-led force of 10,600 controls the remainder .
prts , whose members range from a few dozen to more than 200 , combine military and reconstruction roles in far-flung areas .
by next month there will be 13 prts across afghanistan .
nato ’ s peacekeeping force aims to set up five new teams over the next six months .
gliemeroth however warned that the situation in iraq shouldn ’ t be allowed to divert attention from afghanistan .
" currently , in all fairness to the situation in iraq , it has to be said that afghanistan has been largely overshadowed by the development there , " gliemeroth said .
" but i think the international community owes this land -lrb- afghanistan -rrb- a great deal .

after the parmalat fiasco , the italian government has taken steps to reform the country 's regulatory system .
but do the reforms go far enough , and how do they compare to those elsewhere in europe , including germany ? the italian cabinet has approved a draft law aimed at reforming italy 's regulatory system .
the law , which is still subject to parliamentary approval , is the first step towards changing a system which , in the eyes of many , failed to prevent the multi-billion dollar parmalat scandal .
but after months of political wrangling , the tough original version of the bill was watered down - and may be further diluted before it gets final parliamentary approval sometime in the next three months - raising doubts about the current italian government 's ability to impose better corporate governance and soothe investor anxieties .
elsewhere in europe , including germany , steps have been taken to prevent a parmalat or enron-style meltdown .
but are the safeguards sufficient ?
italian economy minister hopes for radical reform the law approved by the italian government last week was very different from the one proposed by italy 's economy minister giulio tremonti .
shortly after parmalat first made the news in december , tremonti called for shifting oversight authority away from the bank of italy and giving more power to the anti-trust authority and consab , the italian equivalent of the united states ' federal exchange commission -lrb- fec -rrb- .
those found guilty of financial fraud would also face longer prison terms .
in short , tremonti hoped to consolidate italy 's complicated regulatory system , which is comprised of five parts , each devoted to different types of business , into a three-pronged system .
italian politicians reluctant to make big changes but tremonti faced tough opposition from the country 's business-mogul prime minister silvio berlusconi and his allies , who feared that a harsh response would be bad for business .
" we do n't need to turn an exceptional event into a witch hunt , which would make the running of an insurance or financial company difficult , " said berlusconi .
as it turned out the draft law did not , as some had hoped , consolidate the various authorities .
instead it strengthened consob with greater sanctioning powers and the authority to oversee corporate bond issues .
not everyone , including tremonti , was convinced .
" we would have liked a radical reform , and now we risk introducing a reform that is n't very incisive , " he said .
the german path to reform in an interview with deutsche welle , marco becht , the executive director of the european corporate governance institute and a professor of finance and economics at the university of brussels , points to the complexity of the issue .
" sometimes it is a case of management without enough shareholder oversight , as was the case with enron , and sometimes it is a case of a very powerful shareholder getting up to something , as was the case with parmalat , " he said .
" the tools you need in each of these situations is slightly different , " he added .
given the complexity of the task at hand , and the increasing complexity of multi-national corporations engaged in different types of business , what 's a government - say the one in berlin - to do ?
tremonti 's approach , consolidating various oversight authorities into a more cooperative powerful single entity , is an approach that has proven popular elsewhere in europe , according to ernst maug , a professor of business administration at humboldt university in berlin .
germany did so in 2002 , consolidating various regulatory agencies into bafin , the federal agency responsible for overseeing the entire financial sector .
" this seems to be the trend and makes a lot of sense to me , " maug told deutsche welle .
" it does n't make sense to have different regulatory agencies overseeing different sectors just because one security is called a stock and another a bond ; when you have one authority you have a better chance of catching things . "
what 's more , also in 2002 , the german corporate governance code , also known as the " kodex , " was implemented .
this code of " best practices " is not legally binding , but companies are now required to disclose in their annual reports the extent to which they comply with the code and explain opt-outs .
a german parmalat ?
these measures by no means guarantee that a corporate scandal like parmalat or enron wo n't happen in germany .
" could it happen here - yes , " says maug .
you will never have a system where everyone complies with the law all the time , he points out , and reducing these scandals to zero is not an option , since the resulting regulation could prove too costly for business .
brecht concurs .
" there is always a trade-off in trying to prevent the next parmalat from happening and restricting executives from being able to do business , " he says .
" with regulation , you have to do a cost-benefit analysis . "
in the meantime , governments in europe and the world over continue to debate how to strike the best balance . kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de how to say " enron " in italian casting new doubt on european corporate governance , leading italian food group parmalat announced last week the firm had a € 4-billion discrepancy in its books .

" there are more than 300 families in vadinagar alone who are facing an economic crisis .

the community 's culture is changing - the snake dowries are gone although at least now more children are attending school .

he belongs to the nath community that hails from jodhpur in rajasthan but which has been in gujarat for nine generations .
" our sole vocation used to be catching snakes and displaying them in public , " he says .
" this was accompanied by various other acts of juggling .
but particularly in the past decade , the government has become strict and we have lost our livelihood . "
' crisis ' though he has forbidden his community from catching snakes , mr nath himself still owns a black king cobra - just in case he is asked to prove his skills once more .
he can also hypnotise his audience into believing he has converted their rupee notes into other denominations .
mr nath still likes to dress up as the chief of his community .
but as his cobra hisses at his side he laments : " it is difficult for me to even feed my snake .
i have to feed it with milk and eggs on alternate days and i can barely afford it . "
he talks candidly of the battle with the government over its implementation of the wildlife protection act .
" there are more than 300 families in vadinagar alone who are facing an economic crisis .
the government should do something for their rehabilitation , " mr nath says .
the community 's culture is changing - the snake dowries are gone although at least now more children are attending school .
still , the elders rue the fact that they are not able to pass on the skills of catching snakes , extracting their poison and making them perform to the tune of a pipe .

the deal , reached after two weeks of last-ditch talks , opens up us markets to many australian goods .
but it leaves key tariffs on australian farm goods untouched while giving us farmers free access - factors which australian farmers see as a sell-out .
the " hypocritical " decision meant farmers were the " sacrificial lamb " , farming leaders said .
industry gains the negotiations had overrun three deadlines by the time they were concluded on sunday .
it took a phone call between australian prime minister john howard and president george w bush - allies in the us-led war on iraq - to clinch the deal .
the agreement , mr howard said , " will add enormous long-term benefits to the australian economy " by scrapping tariffs on 99 % of us manufacturing exports to australia and 97 % of the manufactured goods flowing the other way .
the us trade representative , robert zoellick , said the cut in duties was " the most significant immediate cut in industrial tariffs ever achieved in a us free trade agreement " .
trade between the two countries is worth $ 28bn , with the us enjoying a $ 9bn trade surplus , the ustr said .
' hypocrisy ' but the cuts in industrial tariffs were not matched by market access for australia 's farmers .
australian beef producers will see the tariffs they face phased out slowly over 18 years - while the sugar cane industry has been left out altogether .
the us , on the other hand , will see the $ 400m it pays annually in tariffs vanish immediately .
us farmers are seen as important to president bush 's re-election campaign in november 's election .
" i came to the conclusion that it would have been against the national interest to give up a deal that is going to be of enormous benefit to the rest of the economy because we could n't get something on sugar , " mr howard told channel nine tv in australia .
but farmers saw it differently .
" we feel we 've been chosen as the sacrificial lamb to allow virtually every other industry to improve their income proposals , " said jim pedersen , chairman of the australian cane growers ' council .
and the national farmers ' federation accused both australian and us governments of being hypocritical .
" the us is a huge agricultural exporter and demands access to overseas markets , but continues to hide behind a veil of protection in its own market , " said peter corish , president of the nff .

previously , hundreds have been squashed on charlcombe lane in bath .
in 2002 bath and north east somerset council -lrb- b & nes -rrb- decided to close it until they had all crossed safely .
the scheme was widely supported by local residents and more than 800 were saved two years ago when part of the lane was closed to traffic between february and april .
the toads make their way annually from the surrounding hills , north of the city , to the lakes in the valley below , where they breed .
in 2003 , volunteers collected 619 toads , 94 frogs and 66 newts and gave them a lift on their way to the breeding grounds .
this year , wessex water has contributed £ 750 to help publicise and enforce the scheme .
" we are delighted to receive this wessex watermark award which helps us pay for the road closure , " said mary thompson , a volunteer from the rescue group .
jane briggs , b & nes 's wildlife community officer said : " it actually reduces the mortality of the toads quite considerably . "
the road will close for eight weeks from monday , 9 february .

the reverend simon bessant says the bnp 's policies are damaging the county 's community relations .
members of the general synod will be asked to back his private members ' motion condemning the " sin of racism " when it starts on monday .
mr bessant is making the call ahead of this year 's council elections and european parliament poll .
he said christians had been silent on this issue for too long , especially as the bnp had won several council seats in lancashire .
" we have been keeping quiet because we did not want to rock the boat and give people publicity . "
' affront to god ' he said the time had come for churches to speak out against the bnp 's policies , such as voluntary repatriation .
" this is not what this county or country needs , " said the mr bessant , who is director of mission and evangelisation for the diocese of blackburn .
his motion notes recent bnp successes and says any political movement or candidate which seeks to divide the community on ethnic grounds is an " affront to god . "
it adds : " voting or supporting any political party that offers racist policies is incompatible with christian discipleship . "
he said to bbc news online that he believes churchgoers backing racist parties were " sinning . "
the motion says all christians should express their " loathing of the sin of racism . "
but a spokesman for the bnp said mr bessant was " misguided " and claimed the party had active members of the church of england in its ranks .
" he should be attacking people who are trying to destroy our society . "
he added : " the bnp is trying to preserve our traditional british culture and our way of life . "

edinburgh-based miller construction successfully bid for the work at the beatson oncology centre at gartnavel general hospital in glasgow .

the winning bidder was announced on monday by greater glasgow nhs board .
chief executive of nhs greater glasgow , tom divers , said : " patients and staff will undoubtedly benefit from the long-awaited development of the new west of scotland cancer centre .
" it will be one of the finest specialist oncology units in the world . "
the project director , stephen baker from boc , said all the bids had been of an " extremely high standard " , but miller was picked because of the " improvements it presented to medical planning , access and external views from the building " .

the finished product will comprise five floors and include : three floors of inpatient wards varied patient and family information services a pharmacy outpatient areas with state-of-the-art scanning equipment clinical trial and research space and an education suite which provides for student lectures and long-distance television links with other cancer specialists .
the existing tom wheldon building will eventually be used only for outpatient radiotherapy .
isobel neil , boc general manager , said : " the interior of the new cancer centre as a whole will be designed to promote a sense of wellbeing among patients and staff , and the project team plans to appoint an artistic advisor who will help to develop a therapeutic environment .
" this approach was pioneered by the glasgow homeopathic hospital , also on the gartnavel site , where it has proved tremendously successful .
" we know that using the right colours , finishes and furniture can create positive surroundings for patients and a pleasant working environment for staff .
" thanks to the support of our charitable partners - including friends of the beatson , teenage cancer trust and macmillan cancer relief - we will create a world class cancer treatment centre where comfort is inbuilt . "
robin mackie , managing director of miller construction , said his company was absolutely delighted to be awarded the contract and looked " forward to working with the beatson to deliver an outstanding facility " .
