german beer : worth a scientific look getting pickled in germany germany 's love affair with beer cools business -pipe- 13.02.2004 oetker gulps down brau und brunnen großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oetker 's ulrich kallmeyer , left , and brau und brunnen ceo michael hollmann .
germany 's largest food producer , oetker , announced friday it will take over brewer brau und brunnen , making the company germany 's top beer producer .
it 's the latest in a series of mergers in germany 's brewing industry . oetker has bought 62 percent stake in brau und brunnen from hypovereinsbank -lrb- hvb -rrb- , germany 's second biggest bank , for € 220 million -lrb- $ 283 million -rrb- . " pilsner goes nicely with pudding and pizza , " said ulrich kallmeyer , one of family-owned oetker 's top executives . brau und brunnen , which has brand names like jever , tucher and berliner pilsner under its roof , had a turnover of € 578 million in 2002 .
" we are happy to be able to sell at a good price , " a hvb spokesman said .
oetker also announced its intention of launching a takeover bid for the remaining brau und brunnen shares for a unit price of € 80 . germany 's beer market , europe 's largest , is the only one on the continent where such takeovers are still possible , according to experts . almost 1,300 breweries still exist in the country , the most fragmented market in europe .
together , they produce roughly as much beer as u.s. brewery giant anheuser-bush alone .
even oetker , which will now control about 15 percent of the german market , dwarfs in comparison to the makers of bud or sab miller , the second largest brewery in the world . foreigners get thirsty for german beer giants such as sab miller and anheuser have so far stayed away from german breweries , but other foreign competitors have begun to develop a thirst for german beer .
in the past four years , mergers and takeovers have begun to shake up the country 's brewery scene , which remains attractive despite a recent drop in consumption . last year , germans still gulped down an impressive 105 million hectoliters -lrb- 2.7 billion gallons -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgian interbrew now fills these steins at oktoberfest .

in 2001 , the trend began with a joint company created by dutch heineken and munich 's schörghuber group , which includes brands such as paulaner and kulmbacher . the belgian brewing giant interbrew took the top position in germany 's beer market after buying gilde group , beck 's brewery in bremen .
the belgians are also present at munich 's oktoberfest after buying löwenbräu and spaten last fall . in january , another international player entered the german beer market : danish carlberg group joined forced with germany 's largest family-owned brewery , bitburger , and bought holsten brewery for € 1 billion .

greek and turkish cypriot negotiators agreed to a u.n.-proposed plan to unify the divided island , ending days of marathon negotiations in new york . " we have achieved a resumption of talks under the auspices of the secretary-general , " greek cypriot leader tassos papadopoulos told reuters . the plan , pushed by u.n. secretary general kofi annan , calls for both sides of the island , divided since the turkish invasion in 1974 , to begin negotiating details of the unification on feb .
19 .
annan wanted both sides to reach a compromise before the greek cypriot side enters the european union on may 1 . the un secretary general apparently gave both sides an ultimatum in the early morning hours friday in new york city , telling them to either sign or reject his proposal . both sides say they still have a lot of work ahead of them . " we expect long and tiring work ahead of us , " turkish foreign ministry undersecretary ugur ziyal told reporters . working against the clock the compromise came as time was running out to resolve the decades-old conflict , which began when turkish troops invaded the north half of the island following a coup orchestrated by the greek dictatorship in athens . the southern , greek side of the island has enjoyed international recognition and flourished economically .
the northern side is recognized only by turkey and is populated mostly with turkish soldiers .
a buffer zone patrolled by un soldiers separates the two sides . over the years , the deadlock has frustrated top diplomats from europe and the united states .
most recently , turkish cypriot leader rauf denktash walked out of un-backed talks a year ago . but with the prospect of eu-entry in may , the current negotiations have taken on an added sense of urgency .
if the two sides fail to reach a reunification agreement before may 1 , then only the greek cypriot south will join the eu . after tacitly supporting the turkish cypriot leader for years , turkey is now urging denktash to compromise , fearing failed talks could harm turkey 's chances of joining the eu down the road . annan pressures both sides into referendums bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary-general kofi annan , center , shakes hands with greek cypriot president tassos papadopoulos , right , and rauf denktash , turkish cypriot leader , left .
according to the un plan , both sides will engage in intense talks guided by the un until march 26th , at which time remaining differences will be left to annan to resolve with the final plan submitted to both the turkish and greek cypriots in separate referendums on april 21st . according to the reuters news agency , the negotiations partly stalled due to disagreements over the extent of eu involvement in the upcoming negotiations .
the greeks , it seems , would like eu experts from brussels to participate , while the turkish side is less enthusiastic about such a plan . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a divided cyprus makes the cut cyprus is one of the countries most ready to join the european union .

german chancellor gerhard schröder and british prime minister tony blair met in berlin on thursday ahead of a three-way summit with france next week .
they denied the formation of a leading " triumvirate " within the eu . days after hosting french president jacques chirac in the german capital , schröder 's talks with the british premier aimed to pave the way for the upcoming summit with all three leaders next wednesday . the purpose of the upcoming french-british-german meeting is to coordinate positions for the eu 's next summit , scheduled for march 25-26 in brussels .
the three leading countries of the european union are hoping to present a common front as the bloc prepares to expand to 25 members in may .
the eu draft constitution was derailed in december after poland and spain blocked attempts to bring voting rights more in line with each country 's population . besides pushing to get the eu constitution back on track , berlin and paris hope london will add its clout to efforts to cap the eu budget .
schröder and chirac this week said they were sticking with demands for a freeze on the eu budget until 2013 .
france , germany , britain , the netherlands , sweden and austria - all of which are net contributors to the eu , meaning they pay more in than they get back – made the budget freeze demand last december in an open letter . no eu triumvirate with such meetings becoming a regular occurance , many other eu countries , including italy and spain , have become increasingly suspicious of closer french-british-german cooperation , fearing the three countries will band together to impose their will on others . however , both schröder and blair , speaking after their meeting , said that such concerns were unfounded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " this is not about trying to create a directoire in europe at all , " said blair .
" i think it 's important that we try and work at these issues together and not exclude other countries , " he added . iraq rift healed the summit next week is also an attempt to show the rift caused by the war in iraq has been sealed .
whereas france and germany strongly opposed the u.s.-led campaign to oust saddam hussein , britain was america 's staunchest supporter . after talking with blair , schröder made clear divisions over the case for war were a thing of the past .
" we both believe it makes no sense to talk about history and discuss our different positions on the need for war , but instead both of us must help ensure that the process of democratization and reconstruction in iraq succeeds , " he said . topping the defense policy agenda will be u.s. proposals to get nato more involved in stabilizing iraq - which both france and germany are weary of - and the transatlantic alliance 's expanding role in peacekeeping in afghanistan . as a sign of the new three-way cooperation on defense matters , germany said on wednesday it would back anglo-french plans for a european rapid-reaction force that could be sent to flashpoints around the world .
the proposal calls for a force of 1,500 soldiers that could be deployed within 15 days . the eu already has plans to set up a 60,000-strong unit that could be ready for action within 60 days and nato wants to create a rapid-reaction force of 21,000 troops . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin , paris want eu constitution deal meeting near berlin on monday , german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac said they want an agreement on a new european union constitution before the end of the irish eu presidency in june .

schröder and chirac this week said they were sticking with demands for a freeze on the eu budget until 2013 .
france , germany , britain , the netherlands , sweden and austria - all of which are net contributors to the eu , meaning they pay more in than they get back – made the budget freeze demand last december in an open letter . no eu triumvirate with such meetings becoming a regular occurance , many other eu countries , including italy and spain , have become increasingly suspicious of closer french-british-german cooperation , fearing the three countries will band together to impose their will on others . however , both schröder and blair , speaking after their meeting , said that such concerns were unfounded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " this is not about trying to create a directoire in europe at all , " said blair .
" i think it 's important that we try and work at these issues together and not exclude other countries , " he added . iraq rift healed the summit next week is also an attempt to show the rift caused by the war in iraq has been sealed .
whereas france and germany strongly opposed the u.s.-led campaign to oust saddam hussein , britain was america 's staunchest supporter . after talking with blair , schröder made clear divisions over the case for war were a thing of the past .
" we both believe it makes no sense to talk about history and discuss our different positions on the need for war , but instead both of us must help ensure that the process of democratization and reconstruction in iraq succeeds , " he said . topping the defense policy agenda will be u.s. proposals to get nato more involved in stabilizing iraq - which both france and germany are weary of - and the transatlantic alliance 's expanding role in peacekeeping in afghanistan . as a sign of the new three-way cooperation on defense matters , germany said on wednesday it would back anglo-french plans for a european rapid-reaction force that could be sent to flashpoints around the world .
the proposal calls for a force of 1,500 soldiers that could be deployed within 15 days . the eu already has plans to set up a 60,000-strong unit that could be ready for action within 60 days and nato wants to create a rapid-reaction force of 21,000 troops . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin , paris want eu constitution deal meeting near berlin on monday , german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac said they want an agreement on a new european union constitution before the end of the irish eu presidency in june .

schily squints into the new iris scan system .
forget passport controls and get ready for some eye contact next time you enter frankfurt airport .
that ’ s where german interior minister schily has kicked off the first high-tech biometric iris-scanning system . the future arrived at frankfurt airport this week with the introduction of a sophisticated digital camera at border controls capable of recognizing people by their irises .
considered the most accurate system in biometrics - the process of identifying people through their unique biological factors - the iris scanning technology is meant to both speed up conventional passport controls as well as enhance existing security procedures .
" biometrics doesn ’ t just make travelling safer , but also simpler , " german interior minister otto schily said as he launched the new technology on thursday .
the system is expected to cut long waiting lines at airports on account of its partly automated border controls .
the minister added the iris scan would initially be in place as a pilot project for six months .
it would help officials gather information about biometric procedures for their " border control routines " , he said , as well as help germany gain important insights for improving its domestic security .
the nuts and bolts as a first step , passengers first have to have their iris photographed .
for that they have to step up to a special high-resolution digital camera - fitted with an infrared imager to illuminate the eye even behind glasses or lens - for a picture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman has her iris scanned for computer recognition .
a computer will then process the digital images with the help of a software that will carefully map the iris in a spiral form working from the outside to the inside and record the unique spots and pigments .
that data will then be transferred onto the passenger ’ s machine-readable passport .
once they have their iris blueprint in the system , passengers in future will simply have to feed in their machine-readable passports , glance at the camera , and once the iris scan matches the passport data , the exit doors will automatically swing open .
the entire procedure is expected to last 20 seconds .
before submitting to the iris scan for the first time , passengers have to agree to a passport check by border guards and sign a data security document .
the offer is only meant for eu citizens aged 18 and above .
iris scan the most accurate experts believe the iris scan remains the most accurate biometric process , which involves automated identification of one ’ s identity using physiological clues such as scanning an iris or facial features , hand or fingerprint recognition or handwriting analysis , and matching that information with a database .
since iris patterns are extremely complex , with more than 200 unique spots , they are believed to be the most reliable distinguishing feature of a person and thus easy to capture and compare with a database .
experts say the iris scan is also superior to fingerprint-recognition systems .
that ’ s because greasy , dirty or peeling skin on the finger can easily distort fingerprint-recognition , a factor that plays no role in the case of iris-recognition .
furthermore , the iris doesn ’ t just betray the identity of the passenger , but can also tell much about his or her possible drug and alcohol consumption .
u.s. leads the way in biometric security biometrics , useful in fighting document and credit card fraud , first took off as a global industry after the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in new york and washington .
the u.s. has been the frontrunner , with washington believed to be spending $ 8 billion on biometric security , which involves checking biometric information against terrorist watch lists and police databases .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new sign at frankfurt airport informs passengers about the automated passport control .
in january , the u.s. introduced fingerprint recognition systems for incoming travelers requiring a visa and iris scans and facial-recognition systems are expected to follow .
the u.s. has also urged other countries to follow suit and upgrade security procedures .
new u.s. laws require all passports of visitors issued after october 26 , 2004 to carry biometric features if the traveler is to enter without a visa .
the european parliament is also considering measures to replace all traditional european passports by a new biometric version by 2005 .
in addition it ’ s mulling proposals to introduce biometric data on visas and residence permits of third country nationals residing in the eu as a means to counter illegal immigration .
concerns of data security however biometric technology has its share of critics .
it ’ s been slammed by human rights and civil liberties groups , who have complained that the storage of such information could be subject to abuse and could be used to record people 's movements .
experts have also questioned the efficiency of the technology and said it could leave millions of people vulnerable to a mistaken identity . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu eyes biometric passport plan some see compulsory fingerprinting as an invasion of civil rights and retinal scanning is thought by many to be the stuff of science fiction , but these measures and more may all be part of a new eu passport come 2005 .

this year , democrats have swiftly mobilized members abroad to help determine the party 's presidential candidate . ron schlundt has a lot on his plate .
the chairman of german branch of democrats abroad - the international organization of the u.s. democratic party - has spent the past weeks compiling lists and counting votes .
as american voters turned out last sunday for primary elections in maine , expatriate americans living in germany held their own presidential straw polls in berlin , frankfurt and kaiserslautern organized by democrats abroad .
two days earlier , democrats in heidelberg and göttingen cast votes , which were followed on monday with the munich caucus , bavaria 's answer to the iowa caucus .
finally , at the end of february , the germany-wide caucus takes place .
the results will be sent to the international caucus in edinburgh this march . there , the combined tallies from countries around the world will determine which candidate the nine democrats abroad delegates will support at the democratic national convention in boston this july .
seven million americans live abroad the influence of democrats abroad sharply increased after president george w. bush 's razor-thing victory in 2000 with the help of republican absentee voters living overseas .
the democrats have since paid closer attention to their far-flung pool of potential voters .
indeed , close to seven million americans live outside the u.s. - considerably more than live in smaller u.s. states like maine , nebraska or nevada .
" these are all possible voters , who could be important if there 's a tight race , " explained schlundt .
by rallying the vote with groups like democrats abroad , the party leadership in washington is hoping to pull as many voters as it can come november .
bildunterschrift : wesley clark , john edwards , howard dean , john kerry according to schlundt , the results of the handful of straw polls being held in germany have largely mirrored those taking place back at home .
john kerry has been the clear victor -lrb- 55 percent -rrb- in regional straw polls across the country and howard dean has landed in a distant second place -lrb- 19 percent -rrb- . wesley clark and john edwards trailed even further , with 10 percent and 9 percent respectively .
but there are also key differences between american and german straw polls - especially when it comes to venues .
though u.s. events are held in public buildings or schools , in kaiserslautern the caucus was held in schmidt 's apartment .
the pool of potential american voters here is relatively small and is comprised of many soldiers and their families , expatriates here on business or even university students studying abroad .
" about 30 or 40 people came to my home , " schlundt said , adding with laugh , " in other words , it went very well . "
there was more congestion at straw polls in heidelberg and berlin , cities considered the biggest districts for the so-called " german democrats . "
in the capital city , the straw poll was held , appropriately , in an american diner , and at a restaurant in heidelberg .
close to 200 of the around 1,500 registered democrats in germany participated in the primary election poll .
procedural restrictions in the straw polling process create geographical barriers that make it hard for more people to participate .
" in a caucus , people ca n't submit an absentee ballot by mail .
that 's why all voters - even if they live in leipzig or cologne - have to submit their vote at one of the participating polling places , " schlundt said , explaining the overall turnout .
an air of change " but participation is 10 times greater than by the last elections , " said schlundt , who serves as a history professor at a satellite branch of the university of maryland in germany when he 's not organizing democratic caucuses .
the reason so many democrats are turning out to the polls , he said , is that " so many democrats are so opposed to bush that you do n't even have to mobilize them . "
that applies not only to germany , but also in close to 40 other countries where primaries have been held in recent days .
turnout everywhere has been greater than expected , according to the professor .
" the iraq war was probably the most important issue for our members , " said schlundt .
" the majority were against the war .
that 's why dean was popular for so long . "
but international policy is n't always at the top of the agenda for american democrats living in germany .
everyday problems are also important .
" in germany , we ca n't receive any retirement or public heath care or unemployment benefits from the united states , " he said before concluding : " but that 's hard to change . "
expat influence appears to be growing , however .
though the democrats abroad are a small organization , they still get the party 's ear in washington .
" we were able to speak to almost every candidate in washington - we had several of conference calls with them , and howard dean was a guest at our official dinner , " schlundt said . michael knigge -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european press review : can kerry beat bush ?

this year , democrats have swiftly mobilized members abroad to help determine the party 's presidential candidate . ron schlundt has a lot on his plate .
the chairman of german branch of democrats abroad - the international organization of the u.s. democratic party - has spent the past weeks compiling lists and counting votes .
as american voters turned out last sunday for primary elections in maine , expatriate americans living in germany held their own presidential straw polls in berlin , frankfurt and kaiserslautern organized by democrats abroad .
two days earlier , democrats in heidelberg and göttingen cast votes , which were followed on monday with the munich caucus , bavaria 's answer to the iowa caucus .
finally , at the end of february , the germany-wide caucus takes place .
the results will be sent to the international caucus in edinburgh this march . there , the combined tallies from countries around the world will determine which candidate the nine democrats abroad delegates will support at the democratic national convention in boston this july .
seven million americans live abroad the influence of democrats abroad sharply increased after president george w. bush 's razor-thing victory in 2000 with the help of republican absentee voters living overseas .
the democrats have since paid closer attention to their far-flung pool of potential voters .
indeed , close to seven million americans live outside the u.s. - considerably more than live in smaller u.s. states like maine , nebraska or nevada .
" these are all possible voters , who could be important if there 's a tight race , " explained schlundt .
by rallying the vote with groups like democrats abroad , the party leadership in washington is hoping to pull as many voters as it can come november .
bildunterschrift : wesley clark , john edwards , howard dean , john kerry according to schlundt , the results of the handful of straw polls being held in germany have largely mirrored those taking place back at home .
john kerry has been the clear victor -lrb- 55 percent -rrb- in regional straw polls across the country and howard dean has landed in a distant second place -lrb- 19 percent -rrb- . wesley clark and john edwards trailed even further , with 10 percent and 9 percent respectively .
but there are also key differences between american and german straw polls - especially when it comes to venues .
though u.s. events are held in public buildings or schools , in kaiserslautern the caucus was held in schmidt 's apartment .
the pool of potential american voters here is relatively small and is comprised of many soldiers and their families , expatriates here on business or even university students studying abroad .
" about 30 or 40 people came to my home , " schlundt said , adding with laugh , " in other words , it went very well . "
there was more congestion at straw polls in heidelberg and berlin , cities considered the biggest districts for the so-called " german democrats . "
in the capital city , the straw poll was held , appropriately , in an american diner , and at a restaurant in heidelberg .
close to 200 of the around 1,500 registered democrats in germany participated in the primary election poll .
procedural restrictions in the straw polling process create geographical barriers that make it hard for more people to participate .
" in a caucus , people ca n't submit an absentee ballot by mail .
that 's why all voters - even if they live in leipzig or cologne - have to submit their vote at one of the participating polling places , " schlundt said , explaining the overall turnout .

greek and turkish cypriot negotiators agreed to a u.n.-proposed plan to unify the divided island , ending days of marathon negotiations in new york . " we have achieved a resumption of talks under the auspices of the secretary-general , " greek cypriot leader tassos papadopoulos told reuters . the plan , pushed by u.n. secretary general kofi annan , calls for both sides of the island , divided since the turkish invasion in 1974 , to begin negotiating details of the unification on feb .
19 .
annan wanted both sides to reach a compromise before the greek cypriot side enters the european union on may 1 . the un secretary general apparently gave both sides an ultimatum in the early morning hours friday in new york city , telling them to either sign or reject his proposal . both sides say they still have a lot of work ahead of them . " we expect long and tiring work ahead of us , " turkish foreign ministry undersecretary ugur ziyal told reporters . working against the clock the compromise came as time was running out to resolve the decades-old conflict , which began when turkish troops invaded the north half of the island following a coup orchestrated by the greek dictatorship in athens . the southern , greek side of the island has enjoyed international recognition and flourished economically .
the northern side is recognized only by turkey and is populated mostly with turkish soldiers .
a buffer zone patrolled by un soldiers separates the two sides . over the years , the deadlock has frustrated top diplomats from europe and the united states .
most recently , turkish cypriot leader rauf denktash walked out of un-backed talks a year ago . but with the prospect of eu-entry in may , the current negotiations have taken on an added sense of urgency .
if the two sides fail to reach a reunification agreement before may 1 , then only the greek cypriot south will join the eu . after tacitly supporting the turkish cypriot leader for years , turkey is now urging denktash to compromise , fearing failed talks could harm turkey 's chances of joining the eu down the road . annan pressures both sides into referendums bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary-general kofi annan , center , shakes hands with greek cypriot president tassos papadopoulos , right , and rauf denktash , turkish cypriot leader , left .
according to the un plan , both sides will engage in intense talks guided by the un until march 26th , at which time remaining differences will be left to annan to resolve with the final plan submitted to both the turkish and greek cypriots in separate referendums on april 21st . according to the reuters news agency , the negotiations partly stalled due to disagreements over the extent of eu involvement in the upcoming negotiations .

schily squints into the new iris scan system .
forget passport controls and get ready for some eye contact next time you enter frankfurt airport .
that ’ s where german interior minister schily has kicked off the first high-tech biometric iris-scanning system . the future arrived at frankfurt airport this week with the introduction of a sophisticated digital camera at border controls capable of recognizing people by their irises .
considered the most accurate system in biometrics - the process of identifying people through their unique biological factors - the iris scanning technology is meant to both speed up conventional passport controls as well as enhance existing security procedures .
" biometrics doesn ’ t just make travelling safer , but also simpler , " german interior minister otto schily said as he launched the new technology on thursday .
the system is expected to cut long waiting lines at airports on account of its partly automated border controls .
the minister added the iris scan would initially be in place as a pilot project for six months .
it would help officials gather information about biometric procedures for their " border control routines " , he said , as well as help germany gain important insights for improving its domestic security .
the nuts and bolts as a first step , passengers first have to have their iris photographed .
for that they have to step up to a special high-resolution digital camera - fitted with an infrared imager to illuminate the eye even behind glasses or lens - for a picture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman has her iris scanned for computer recognition .
a computer will then process the digital images with the help of a software that will carefully map the iris in a spiral form working from the outside to the inside and record the unique spots and pigments .
that data will then be transferred onto the passenger ’ s machine-readable passport .
once they have their iris blueprint in the system , passengers in future will simply have to feed in their machine-readable passports , glance at the camera , and once the iris scan matches the passport data , the exit doors will automatically swing open .
the entire procedure is expected to last 20 seconds .
before submitting to the iris scan for the first time , passengers have to agree to a passport check by border guards and sign a data security document .
the offer is only meant for eu citizens aged 18 and above .
iris scan the most accurate experts believe the iris scan remains the most accurate biometric process , which involves automated identification of one ’ s identity using physiological clues such as scanning an iris or facial features , hand or fingerprint recognition or handwriting analysis , and matching that information with a database .
since iris patterns are extremely complex , with more than 200 unique spots , they are believed to be the most reliable distinguishing feature of a person and thus easy to capture and compare with a database .
experts say the iris scan is also superior to fingerprint-recognition systems .
that ’ s because greasy , dirty or peeling skin on the finger can easily distort fingerprint-recognition , a factor that plays no role in the case of iris-recognition .
furthermore , the iris doesn ’ t just betray the identity of the passenger , but can also tell much about his or her possible drug and alcohol consumption .
u.s. leads the way in biometric security biometrics , useful in fighting document and credit card fraud , first took off as a global industry after the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in new york and washington .
the u.s. has been the frontrunner , with washington believed to be spending $ 8 billion on biometric security , which involves checking biometric information against terrorist watch lists and police databases .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new sign at frankfurt airport informs passengers about the automated passport control .
in january , the u.s. introduced fingerprint recognition systems for incoming travelers requiring a visa and iris scans and facial-recognition systems are expected to follow .
the u.s. has also urged other countries to follow suit and upgrade security procedures .
new u.s. laws require all passports of visitors issued after october 26 , 2004 to carry biometric features if the traveler is to enter without a visa .
the european parliament is also considering measures to replace all traditional european passports by a new biometric version by 2005 .
in addition it ’ s mulling proposals to introduce biometric data on visas and residence permits of third country nationals residing in the eu as a means to counter illegal immigration .
concerns of data security however biometric technology has its share of critics .
it ’ s been slammed by human rights and civil liberties groups , who have complained that the storage of such information could be subject to abuse and could be used to record people 's movements .
experts have also questioned the efficiency of the technology and said it could leave millions of people vulnerable to a mistaken identity . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu eyes biometric passport plan some see compulsory fingerprinting as an invasion of civil rights and retinal scanning is thought by many to be the stuff of science fiction , but these measures and more may all be part of a new eu passport come 2005 .

as american voters turned out last sunday for primary elections in maine , expatriate americans living in germany held their own presidential straw polls in berlin , frankfurt and kaiserslautern organized by democrats abroad .
two days earlier , democrats in heidelberg and göttingen cast votes , which were followed on monday with the munich caucus , bavaria 's answer to the iowa caucus .
finally , at the end of february , the germany-wide caucus takes place .
the results will be sent to the international caucus in edinburgh this march . there , the combined tallies from countries around the world will determine which candidate the nine democrats abroad delegates will support at the democratic national convention in boston this july .
seven million americans live abroad the influence of democrats abroad sharply increased after president george w. bush 's razor-thing victory in 2000 with the help of republican absentee voters living overseas .
the democrats have since paid closer attention to their far-flung pool of potential voters .
indeed , close to seven million americans live outside the u.s. - considerably more than live in smaller u.s. states like maine , nebraska or nevada .
" these are all possible voters , who could be important if there 's a tight race , " explained schlundt .
by rallying the vote with groups like democrats abroad , the party leadership in washington is hoping to pull as many voters as it can come november .
bildunterschrift : wesley clark , john edwards , howard dean , john kerry according to schlundt , the results of the handful of straw polls being held in germany have largely mirrored those taking place back at home .
john kerry has been the clear victor -lrb- 55 percent -rrb- in regional straw polls across the country and howard dean has landed in a distant second place -lrb- 19 percent -rrb- . wesley clark and john edwards trailed even further , with 10 percent and 9 percent respectively .
but there are also key differences between american and german straw polls - especially when it comes to venues .
though u.s. events are held in public buildings or schools , in kaiserslautern the caucus was held in schmidt 's apartment .
the pool of potential american voters here is relatively small and is comprised of many soldiers and their families , expatriates here on business or even university students studying abroad .
" about 30 or 40 people came to my home , " schlundt said , adding with laugh , " in other words , it went very well . "
there was more congestion at straw polls in heidelberg and berlin , cities considered the biggest districts for the so-called " german democrats . "
in the capital city , the straw poll was held , appropriately , in an american diner , and at a restaurant in heidelberg .
close to 200 of the around 1,500 registered democrats in germany participated in the primary election poll .
procedural restrictions in the straw polling process create geographical barriers that make it hard for more people to participate .
" in a caucus , people ca n't submit an absentee ballot by mail .
that 's why all voters - even if they live in leipzig or cologne - have to submit their vote at one of the participating polling places , " schlundt said , explaining the overall turnout .
an air of change " but participation is 10 times greater than by the last elections , " said schlundt , who serves as a history professor at a satellite branch of the university of maryland in germany when he 's not organizing democratic caucuses .
the reason so many democrats are turning out to the polls , he said , is that " so many democrats are so opposed to bush that you do n't even have to mobilize them . "
that applies not only to germany , but also in close to 40 other countries where primaries have been held in recent days .
turnout everywhere has been greater than expected , according to the professor .
" the iraq war was probably the most important issue for our members , " said schlundt .
" the majority were against the war .
that 's why dean was popular for so long . "
but international policy is n't always at the top of the agenda for american democrats living in germany .
everyday problems are also important .
" in germany , we ca n't receive any retirement or public heath care or unemployment benefits from the united states , " he said before concluding : " but that 's hard to change . "
expat influence appears to be growing , however .
though the democrats abroad are a small organization , they still get the party 's ear in washington .
" we were able to speak to almost every candidate in washington - we had several of conference calls with them , and howard dean was a guest at our official dinner , " schlundt said . michael knigge -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european press review : can kerry beat bush ?

greek and turkish cypriot negotiators agreed to a u.n.-proposed plan to unify the divided island , ending days of marathon negotiations in new york . " we have achieved a resumption of talks under the auspices of the secretary-general , " greek cypriot leader tassos papadopoulos told reuters . the plan , pushed by u.n. secretary general kofi annan , calls for both sides of the island , divided since the turkish invasion in 1974 , to begin negotiating details of the unification on feb .
19 .
annan wanted both sides to reach a compromise before the greek cypriot side enters the european union on may 1 . the un secretary general apparently gave both sides an ultimatum in the early morning hours friday in new york city , telling them to either sign or reject his proposal . both sides say they still have a lot of work ahead of them . " we expect long and tiring work ahead of us , " turkish foreign ministry undersecretary ugur ziyal told reporters . working against the clock the compromise came as time was running out to resolve the decades-old conflict , which began when turkish troops invaded the north half of the island following a coup orchestrated by the greek dictatorship in athens . the southern , greek side of the island has enjoyed international recognition and flourished economically .
the northern side is recognized only by turkey and is populated mostly with turkish soldiers .
a buffer zone patrolled by un soldiers separates the two sides . over the years , the deadlock has frustrated top diplomats from europe and the united states .
most recently , turkish cypriot leader rauf denktash walked out of un-backed talks a year ago . but with the prospect of eu-entry in may , the current negotiations have taken on an added sense of urgency .
if the two sides fail to reach a reunification agreement before may 1 , then only the greek cypriot south will join the eu . after tacitly supporting the turkish cypriot leader for years , turkey is now urging denktash to compromise , fearing failed talks could harm turkey 's chances of joining the eu down the road . annan pressures both sides into referendums bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary-general kofi annan , center , shakes hands with greek cypriot president tassos papadopoulos , right , and rauf denktash , turkish cypriot leader , left .
according to the un plan , both sides will engage in intense talks guided by the un until march 26th , at which time remaining differences will be left to annan to resolve with the final plan submitted to both the turkish and greek cypriots in separate referendums on april 21st . according to the reuters news agency , the negotiations partly stalled due to disagreements over the extent of eu involvement in the upcoming negotiations .
the greeks , it seems , would like eu experts from brussels to participate , while the turkish side is less enthusiastic about such a plan . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a divided cyprus makes the cut cyprus is one of the countries most ready to join the european union .

schily squints into the new iris scan system .
forget passport controls and get ready for some eye contact next time you enter frankfurt airport .
that ’ s where german interior minister schily has kicked off the first high-tech biometric iris-scanning system . the future arrived at frankfurt airport this week with the introduction of a sophisticated digital camera at border controls capable of recognizing people by their irises .
considered the most accurate system in biometrics - the process of identifying people through their unique biological factors - the iris scanning technology is meant to both speed up conventional passport controls as well as enhance existing security procedures .
" biometrics doesn ’ t just make travelling safer , but also simpler , " german interior minister otto schily said as he launched the new technology on thursday .
the system is expected to cut long waiting lines at airports on account of its partly automated border controls .
the minister added the iris scan would initially be in place as a pilot project for six months .
it would help officials gather information about biometric procedures for their " border control routines " , he said , as well as help germany gain important insights for improving its domestic security .
the nuts and bolts as a first step , passengers first have to have their iris photographed .
for that they have to step up to a special high-resolution digital camera - fitted with an infrared imager to illuminate the eye even behind glasses or lens - for a picture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman has her iris scanned for computer recognition .
a computer will then process the digital images with the help of a software that will carefully map the iris in a spiral form working from the outside to the inside and record the unique spots and pigments .
that data will then be transferred onto the passenger ’ s machine-readable passport .
once they have their iris blueprint in the system , passengers in future will simply have to feed in their machine-readable passports , glance at the camera , and once the iris scan matches the passport data , the exit doors will automatically swing open .
the entire procedure is expected to last 20 seconds .
before submitting to the iris scan for the first time , passengers have to agree to a passport check by border guards and sign a data security document .
the offer is only meant for eu citizens aged 18 and above .
iris scan the most accurate experts believe the iris scan remains the most accurate biometric process , which involves automated identification of one ’ s identity using physiological clues such as scanning an iris or facial features , hand or fingerprint recognition or handwriting analysis , and matching that information with a database .
since iris patterns are extremely complex , with more than 200 unique spots , they are believed to be the most reliable distinguishing feature of a person and thus easy to capture and compare with a database .
experts say the iris scan is also superior to fingerprint-recognition systems .
that ’ s because greasy , dirty or peeling skin on the finger can easily distort fingerprint-recognition , a factor that plays no role in the case of iris-recognition .
furthermore , the iris doesn ’ t just betray the identity of the passenger , but can also tell much about his or her possible drug and alcohol consumption .
u.s. leads the way in biometric security biometrics , useful in fighting document and credit card fraud , first took off as a global industry after the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in new york and washington .
the u.s. has been the frontrunner , with washington believed to be spending $ 8 billion on biometric security , which involves checking biometric information against terrorist watch lists and police databases .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new sign at frankfurt airport informs passengers about the automated passport control .
in january , the u.s. introduced fingerprint recognition systems for incoming travelers requiring a visa and iris scans and facial-recognition systems are expected to follow .
the u.s. has also urged other countries to follow suit and upgrade security procedures .
new u.s. laws require all passports of visitors issued after october 26 , 2004 to carry biometric features if the traveler is to enter without a visa .
the european parliament is also considering measures to replace all traditional european passports by a new biometric version by 2005 .
in addition it ’ s mulling proposals to introduce biometric data on visas and residence permits of third country nationals residing in the eu as a means to counter illegal immigration .
concerns of data security however biometric technology has its share of critics .
it ’ s been slammed by human rights and civil liberties groups , who have complained that the storage of such information could be subject to abuse and could be used to record people 's movements .
experts have also questioned the efficiency of the technology and said it could leave millions of people vulnerable to a mistaken identity . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu eyes biometric passport plan some see compulsory fingerprinting as an invasion of civil rights and retinal scanning is thought by many to be the stuff of science fiction , but these measures and more may all be part of a new eu passport come 2005 .

schily squints into the new iris scan system .
forget passport controls and get ready for some eye contact next time you enter frankfurt airport .
that ’ s where german interior minister schily has kicked off the first high-tech biometric iris-scanning system . the future arrived at frankfurt airport this week with the introduction of a sophisticated digital camera at border controls capable of recognizing people by their irises .
considered the most accurate system in biometrics - the process of identifying people through their unique biological factors - the iris scanning technology is meant to both speed up conventional passport controls as well as enhance existing security procedures .
" biometrics doesn ’ t just make travelling safer , but also simpler , " german interior minister otto schily said as he launched the new technology on thursday .
the system is expected to cut long waiting lines at airports on account of its partly automated border controls .
the minister added the iris scan would initially be in place as a pilot project for six months .
it would help officials gather information about biometric procedures for their " border control routines " , he said , as well as help germany gain important insights for improving its domestic security .
the nuts and bolts as a first step , passengers first have to have their iris photographed .
for that they have to step up to a special high-resolution digital camera - fitted with an infrared imager to illuminate the eye even behind glasses or lens - for a picture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman has her iris scanned for computer recognition .
a computer will then process the digital images with the help of a software that will carefully map the iris in a spiral form working from the outside to the inside and record the unique spots and pigments .
that data will then be transferred onto the passenger ’ s machine-readable passport .
once they have their iris blueprint in the system , passengers in future will simply have to feed in their machine-readable passports , glance at the camera , and once the iris scan matches the passport data , the exit doors will automatically swing open .
the entire procedure is expected to last 20 seconds .
before submitting to the iris scan for the first time , passengers have to agree to a passport check by border guards and sign a data security document .
the offer is only meant for eu citizens aged 18 and above .
iris scan the most accurate experts believe the iris scan remains the most accurate biometric process , which involves automated identification of one ’ s identity using physiological clues such as scanning an iris or facial features , hand or fingerprint recognition or handwriting analysis , and matching that information with a database .
since iris patterns are extremely complex , with more than 200 unique spots , they are believed to be the most reliable distinguishing feature of a person and thus easy to capture and compare with a database .
experts say the iris scan is also superior to fingerprint-recognition systems .
that ’ s because greasy , dirty or peeling skin on the finger can easily distort fingerprint-recognition , a factor that plays no role in the case of iris-recognition .
furthermore , the iris doesn ’ t just betray the identity of the passenger , but can also tell much about his or her possible drug and alcohol consumption .
u.s. leads the way in biometric security biometrics , useful in fighting document and credit card fraud , first took off as a global industry after the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in new york and washington .
the u.s. has been the frontrunner , with washington believed to be spending $ 8 billion on biometric security , which involves checking biometric information against terrorist watch lists and police databases .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new sign at frankfurt airport informs passengers about the automated passport control .
in january , the u.s. introduced fingerprint recognition systems for incoming travelers requiring a visa and iris scans and facial-recognition systems are expected to follow .
the u.s. has also urged other countries to follow suit and upgrade security procedures .
new u.s. laws require all passports of visitors issued after october 26 , 2004 to carry biometric features if the traveler is to enter without a visa .
the european parliament is also considering measures to replace all traditional european passports by a new biometric version by 2005 .
in addition it ’ s mulling proposals to introduce biometric data on visas and residence permits of third country nationals residing in the eu as a means to counter illegal immigration .
concerns of data security however biometric technology has its share of critics .
it ’ s been slammed by human rights and civil liberties groups , who have complained that the storage of such information could be subject to abuse and could be used to record people 's movements .
experts have also questioned the efficiency of the technology and said it could leave millions of people vulnerable to a mistaken identity . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu eyes biometric passport plan some see compulsory fingerprinting as an invasion of civil rights and retinal scanning is thought by many to be the stuff of science fiction , but these measures and more may all be part of a new eu passport come 2005 .

german beer : worth a scientific look getting pickled in germany germany 's love affair with beer cools business -pipe- 13.02.2004 oetker gulps down brau und brunnen großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oetker 's ulrich kallmeyer , left , and brau und brunnen ceo michael hollmann .
germany 's largest food producer , oetker , announced friday it will take over brewer brau und brunnen , making the company germany 's top beer producer .
it 's the latest in a series of mergers in germany 's brewing industry . oetker has bought 62 percent stake in brau und brunnen from hypovereinsbank -lrb- hvb -rrb- , germany 's second biggest bank , for € 220 million -lrb- $ 283 million -rrb- . " pilsner goes nicely with pudding and pizza , " said ulrich kallmeyer , one of family-owned oetker 's top executives . brau und brunnen , which has brand names like jever , tucher and berliner pilsner under its roof , had a turnover of € 578 million in 2002 .
" we are happy to be able to sell at a good price , " a hvb spokesman said .
oetker also announced its intention of launching a takeover bid for the remaining brau und brunnen shares for a unit price of € 80 . germany 's beer market , europe 's largest , is the only one on the continent where such takeovers are still possible , according to experts . almost 1,300 breweries still exist in the country , the most fragmented market in europe .
together , they produce roughly as much beer as u.s. brewery giant anheuser-bush alone .
even oetker , which will now control about 15 percent of the german market , dwarfs in comparison to the makers of bud or sab miller , the second largest brewery in the world . foreigners get thirsty for german beer giants such as sab miller and anheuser have so far stayed away from german breweries , but other foreign competitors have begun to develop a thirst for german beer .
in the past four years , mergers and takeovers have begun to shake up the country 's brewery scene , which remains attractive despite a recent drop in consumption . last year , germans still gulped down an impressive 105 million hectoliters -lrb- 2.7 billion gallons -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgian interbrew now fills these steins at oktoberfest .
foreigners already control one-third of the market .
in 2001 , the trend began with a joint company created by dutch heineken and munich 's schörghuber group , which includes brands such as paulaner and kulmbacher . the belgian brewing giant interbrew took the top position in germany 's beer market after buying gilde group , beck 's brewery in bremen .
the belgians are also present at munich 's oktoberfest after buying löwenbräu and spaten last fall . in january , another international player entered the german beer market : danish carlberg group joined forced with germany 's largest family-owned brewery , bitburger , and bought holsten brewery for € 1 billion .
at the time , brau and brunnen 's ceo announced plans for a takeover in the coming weeks , but oetker stopped that idea short . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " gods ' food " is what dr. oetker calls its answer to jell-o .
brau und brunnen wo n't be oetker 's first venture into the brewing industry : the company already owns radeberger group , which includes beer brands such as dab and berliner kindl .
the combined company will control 15 percent of the market , according to experts . while the move might push oetker 's traditional food sector , which includes everything from baking powder to frozen pizzas , to third place within the company , its shipping business hamburg süd remains the top money-maker .
oetker also owns a bank , an insurance company , a chemical plant and several luxury hotels . henrik böhme -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the dark cloud over oktoberfest shortly before oktoberfest kicked off in munich this month , the begium-based brewing multinational interbrew acquired two of the annual festival ’ s most famous brews : spaten and franziskaner .

together , they produce roughly as much beer as u.s. brewery giant anheuser-bush alone .
even oetker , which will now control about 15 percent of the german market , dwarfs in comparison to the makers of bud or sab miller , the second largest brewery in the world . foreigners get thirsty for german beer giants such as sab miller and anheuser have so far stayed away from german breweries , but other foreign competitors have begun to develop a thirst for german beer .
in the past four years , mergers and takeovers have begun to shake up the country 's brewery scene , which remains attractive despite a recent drop in consumption . last year , germans still gulped down an impressive 105 million hectoliters -lrb- 2.7 billion gallons -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgian interbrew now fills these steins at oktoberfest .
foreigners already control one-third of the market .
in 2001 , the trend began with a joint company created by dutch heineken and munich 's schörghuber group , which includes brands such as paulaner and kulmbacher . the belgian brewing giant interbrew took the top position in germany 's beer market after buying gilde group , beck 's brewery in bremen .
the belgians are also present at munich 's oktoberfest after buying löwenbräu and spaten last fall . in january , another international player entered the german beer market : danish carlberg group joined forced with germany 's largest family-owned brewery , bitburger , and bought holsten brewery for € 1 billion .
at the time , brau and brunnen 's ceo announced plans for a takeover in the coming weeks , but oetker stopped that idea short . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " gods ' food " is what dr. oetker calls its answer to jell-o .
brau und brunnen wo n't be oetker 's first venture into the brewing industry : the company already owns radeberger group , which includes beer brands such as dab and berliner kindl .
the combined company will control 15 percent of the market , according to experts . while the move might push oetker 's traditional food sector , which includes everything from baking powder to frozen pizzas , to third place within the company , its shipping business hamburg süd remains the top money-maker .
oetker also owns a bank , an insurance company , a chemical plant and several luxury hotels . henrik böhme -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the dark cloud over oktoberfest shortly before oktoberfest kicked off in munich this month , the begium-based brewing multinational interbrew acquired two of the annual festival ’ s most famous brews : spaten and franziskaner .

this year , democrats have swiftly mobilized members abroad to help determine the party 's presidential candidate . ron schlundt has a lot on his plate .
the chairman of german branch of democrats abroad - the international organization of the u.s. democratic party - has spent the past weeks compiling lists and counting votes .
as american voters turned out last sunday for primary elections in maine , expatriate americans living in germany held their own presidential straw polls in berlin , frankfurt and kaiserslautern organized by democrats abroad .
two days earlier , democrats in heidelberg and göttingen cast votes , which were followed on monday with the munich caucus , bavaria 's answer to the iowa caucus .
finally , at the end of february , the germany-wide caucus takes place .
the results will be sent to the international caucus in edinburgh this march . there , the combined tallies from countries around the world will determine which candidate the nine democrats abroad delegates will support at the democratic national convention in boston this july .
seven million americans live abroad the influence of democrats abroad sharply increased after president george w. bush 's razor-thing victory in 2000 with the help of republican absentee voters living overseas .
the democrats have since paid closer attention to their far-flung pool of potential voters .
indeed , close to seven million americans live outside the u.s. - considerably more than live in smaller u.s. states like maine , nebraska or nevada .
" these are all possible voters , who could be important if there 's a tight race , " explained schlundt .
by rallying the vote with groups like democrats abroad , the party leadership in washington is hoping to pull as many voters as it can come november .
bildunterschrift : wesley clark , john edwards , howard dean , john kerry according to schlundt , the results of the handful of straw polls being held in germany have largely mirrored those taking place back at home .
john kerry has been the clear victor -lrb- 55 percent -rrb- in regional straw polls across the country and howard dean has landed in a distant second place -lrb- 19 percent -rrb- . wesley clark and john edwards trailed even further , with 10 percent and 9 percent respectively .
but there are also key differences between american and german straw polls - especially when it comes to venues .
though u.s. events are held in public buildings or schools , in kaiserslautern the caucus was held in schmidt 's apartment .
the pool of potential american voters here is relatively small and is comprised of many soldiers and their families , expatriates here on business or even university students studying abroad .
" about 30 or 40 people came to my home , " schlundt said , adding with laugh , " in other words , it went very well . "
there was more congestion at straw polls in heidelberg and berlin , cities considered the biggest districts for the so-called " german democrats . "
in the capital city , the straw poll was held , appropriately , in an american diner , and at a restaurant in heidelberg .
close to 200 of the around 1,500 registered democrats in germany participated in the primary election poll .
procedural restrictions in the straw polling process create geographical barriers that make it hard for more people to participate .
" in a caucus , people ca n't submit an absentee ballot by mail .
that 's why all voters - even if they live in leipzig or cologne - have to submit their vote at one of the participating polling places , " schlundt said , explaining the overall turnout .
an air of change " but participation is 10 times greater than by the last elections , " said schlundt , who serves as a history professor at a satellite branch of the university of maryland in germany when he 's not organizing democratic caucuses .
the reason so many democrats are turning out to the polls , he said , is that " so many democrats are so opposed to bush that you do n't even have to mobilize them . "
that applies not only to germany , but also in close to 40 other countries where primaries have been held in recent days .
turnout everywhere has been greater than expected , according to the professor .
" the iraq war was probably the most important issue for our members , " said schlundt .
" the majority were against the war .
that 's why dean was popular for so long . "
but international policy is n't always at the top of the agenda for american democrats living in germany .
everyday problems are also important .
" in germany , we ca n't receive any retirement or public heath care or unemployment benefits from the united states , " he said before concluding : " but that 's hard to change . "
expat influence appears to be growing , however .
though the democrats abroad are a small organization , they still get the party 's ear in washington .
" we were able to speak to almost every candidate in washington - we had several of conference calls with them , and howard dean was a guest at our official dinner , " schlundt said . michael knigge -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european press review : can kerry beat bush ?

schily squints into the new iris scan system .
forget passport controls and get ready for some eye contact next time you enter frankfurt airport .
that ’ s where german interior minister schily has kicked off the first high-tech biometric iris-scanning system . the future arrived at frankfurt airport this week with the introduction of a sophisticated digital camera at border controls capable of recognizing people by their irises .
considered the most accurate system in biometrics - the process of identifying people through their unique biological factors - the iris scanning technology is meant to both speed up conventional passport controls as well as enhance existing security procedures .
" biometrics doesn ’ t just make travelling safer , but also simpler , " german interior minister otto schily said as he launched the new technology on thursday .
the system is expected to cut long waiting lines at airports on account of its partly automated border controls .
the minister added the iris scan would initially be in place as a pilot project for six months .
it would help officials gather information about biometric procedures for their " border control routines " , he said , as well as help germany gain important insights for improving its domestic security .
the nuts and bolts as a first step , passengers first have to have their iris photographed .
for that they have to step up to a special high-resolution digital camera - fitted with an infrared imager to illuminate the eye even behind glasses or lens - for a picture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman has her iris scanned for computer recognition .
a computer will then process the digital images with the help of a software that will carefully map the iris in a spiral form working from the outside to the inside and record the unique spots and pigments .
that data will then be transferred onto the passenger ’ s machine-readable passport .
once they have their iris blueprint in the system , passengers in future will simply have to feed in their machine-readable passports , glance at the camera , and once the iris scan matches the passport data , the exit doors will automatically swing open .
the entire procedure is expected to last 20 seconds .
before submitting to the iris scan for the first time , passengers have to agree to a passport check by border guards and sign a data security document .
the offer is only meant for eu citizens aged 18 and above .
iris scan the most accurate experts believe the iris scan remains the most accurate biometric process , which involves automated identification of one ’ s identity using physiological clues such as scanning an iris or facial features , hand or fingerprint recognition or handwriting analysis , and matching that information with a database .
since iris patterns are extremely complex , with more than 200 unique spots , they are believed to be the most reliable distinguishing feature of a person and thus easy to capture and compare with a database .
experts say the iris scan is also superior to fingerprint-recognition systems .
that ’ s because greasy , dirty or peeling skin on the finger can easily distort fingerprint-recognition , a factor that plays no role in the case of iris-recognition .
furthermore , the iris doesn ’ t just betray the identity of the passenger , but can also tell much about his or her possible drug and alcohol consumption .
u.s. leads the way in biometric security biometrics , useful in fighting document and credit card fraud , first took off as a global industry after the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in new york and washington .
the u.s. has been the frontrunner , with washington believed to be spending $ 8 billion on biometric security , which involves checking biometric information against terrorist watch lists and police databases .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new sign at frankfurt airport informs passengers about the automated passport control .
in january , the u.s. introduced fingerprint recognition systems for incoming travelers requiring a visa and iris scans and facial-recognition systems are expected to follow .
the u.s. has also urged other countries to follow suit and upgrade security procedures .
new u.s. laws require all passports of visitors issued after october 26 , 2004 to carry biometric features if the traveler is to enter without a visa .
the european parliament is also considering measures to replace all traditional european passports by a new biometric version by 2005 .
in addition it ’ s mulling proposals to introduce biometric data on visas and residence permits of third country nationals residing in the eu as a means to counter illegal immigration .
concerns of data security however biometric technology has its share of critics .
it ’ s been slammed by human rights and civil liberties groups , who have complained that the storage of such information could be subject to abuse and could be used to record people 's movements .
experts have also questioned the efficiency of the technology and said it could leave millions of people vulnerable to a mistaken identity . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu eyes biometric passport plan some see compulsory fingerprinting as an invasion of civil rights and retinal scanning is thought by many to be the stuff of science fiction , but these measures and more may all be part of a new eu passport come 2005 .

schily squints into the new iris scan system .
forget passport controls and get ready for some eye contact next time you enter frankfurt airport .
that ’ s where german interior minister schily has kicked off the first high-tech biometric iris-scanning system . the future arrived at frankfurt airport this week with the introduction of a sophisticated digital camera at border controls capable of recognizing people by their irises .
considered the most accurate system in biometrics - the process of identifying people through their unique biological factors - the iris scanning technology is meant to both speed up conventional passport controls as well as enhance existing security procedures .
" biometrics doesn ’ t just make travelling safer , but also simpler , " german interior minister otto schily said as he launched the new technology on thursday .
the system is expected to cut long waiting lines at airports on account of its partly automated border controls .
the minister added the iris scan would initially be in place as a pilot project for six months .
it would help officials gather information about biometric procedures for their " border control routines " , he said , as well as help germany gain important insights for improving its domestic security .
the nuts and bolts as a first step , passengers first have to have their iris photographed .
for that they have to step up to a special high-resolution digital camera - fitted with an infrared imager to illuminate the eye even behind glasses or lens - for a picture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman has her iris scanned for computer recognition .
a computer will then process the digital images with the help of a software that will carefully map the iris in a spiral form working from the outside to the inside and record the unique spots and pigments .
that data will then be transferred onto the passenger ’ s machine-readable passport .
once they have their iris blueprint in the system , passengers in future will simply have to feed in their machine-readable passports , glance at the camera , and once the iris scan matches the passport data , the exit doors will automatically swing open .
the entire procedure is expected to last 20 seconds .
before submitting to the iris scan for the first time , passengers have to agree to a passport check by border guards and sign a data security document .
the offer is only meant for eu citizens aged 18 and above .
iris scan the most accurate experts believe the iris scan remains the most accurate biometric process , which involves automated identification of one ’ s identity using physiological clues such as scanning an iris or facial features , hand or fingerprint recognition or handwriting analysis , and matching that information with a database .
since iris patterns are extremely complex , with more than 200 unique spots , they are believed to be the most reliable distinguishing feature of a person and thus easy to capture and compare with a database .
experts say the iris scan is also superior to fingerprint-recognition systems .
that ’ s because greasy , dirty or peeling skin on the finger can easily distort fingerprint-recognition , a factor that plays no role in the case of iris-recognition .
furthermore , the iris doesn ’ t just betray the identity of the passenger , but can also tell much about his or her possible drug and alcohol consumption .
u.s. leads the way in biometric security biometrics , useful in fighting document and credit card fraud , first took off as a global industry after the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in new york and washington .
the u.s. has been the frontrunner , with washington believed to be spending $ 8 billion on biometric security , which involves checking biometric information against terrorist watch lists and police databases .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new sign at frankfurt airport informs passengers about the automated passport control .
in january , the u.s. introduced fingerprint recognition systems for incoming travelers requiring a visa and iris scans and facial-recognition systems are expected to follow .
the u.s. has also urged other countries to follow suit and upgrade security procedures .
new u.s. laws require all passports of visitors issued after october 26 , 2004 to carry biometric features if the traveler is to enter without a visa .
the european parliament is also considering measures to replace all traditional european passports by a new biometric version by 2005 .
in addition it ’ s mulling proposals to introduce biometric data on visas and residence permits of third country nationals residing in the eu as a means to counter illegal immigration .
concerns of data security however biometric technology has its share of critics .
it ’ s been slammed by human rights and civil liberties groups , who have complained that the storage of such information could be subject to abuse and could be used to record people 's movements .
experts have also questioned the efficiency of the technology and said it could leave millions of people vulnerable to a mistaken identity . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu eyes biometric passport plan some see compulsory fingerprinting as an invasion of civil rights and retinal scanning is thought by many to be the stuff of science fiction , but these measures and more may all be part of a new eu passport come 2005 .

it would help officials gather information about biometric procedures for their " border control routines " , he said , as well as help germany gain important insights for improving its domestic security .
the nuts and bolts as a first step , passengers first have to have their iris photographed .
for that they have to step up to a special high-resolution digital camera - fitted with an infrared imager to illuminate the eye even behind glasses or lens - for a picture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman has her iris scanned for computer recognition .
a computer will then process the digital images with the help of a software that will carefully map the iris in a spiral form working from the outside to the inside and record the unique spots and pigments .
that data will then be transferred onto the passenger ’ s machine-readable passport .
once they have their iris blueprint in the system , passengers in future will simply have to feed in their machine-readable passports , glance at the camera , and once the iris scan matches the passport data , the exit doors will automatically swing open .
the entire procedure is expected to last 20 seconds .
before submitting to the iris scan for the first time , passengers have to agree to a passport check by border guards and sign a data security document .
the offer is only meant for eu citizens aged 18 and above .
iris scan the most accurate experts believe the iris scan remains the most accurate biometric process , which involves automated identification of one ’ s identity using physiological clues such as scanning an iris or facial features , hand or fingerprint recognition or handwriting analysis , and matching that information with a database .
since iris patterns are extremely complex , with more than 200 unique spots , they are believed to be the most reliable distinguishing feature of a person and thus easy to capture and compare with a database .
experts say the iris scan is also superior to fingerprint-recognition systems .
that ’ s because greasy , dirty or peeling skin on the finger can easily distort fingerprint-recognition , a factor that plays no role in the case of iris-recognition .
furthermore , the iris doesn ’ t just betray the identity of the passenger , but can also tell much about his or her possible drug and alcohol consumption .
u.s. leads the way in biometric security biometrics , useful in fighting document and credit card fraud , first took off as a global industry after the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in new york and washington .
the u.s. has been the frontrunner , with washington believed to be spending $ 8 billion on biometric security , which involves checking biometric information against terrorist watch lists and police databases .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new sign at frankfurt airport informs passengers about the automated passport control .
in january , the u.s. introduced fingerprint recognition systems for incoming travelers requiring a visa and iris scans and facial-recognition systems are expected to follow .
the u.s. has also urged other countries to follow suit and upgrade security procedures .
new u.s. laws require all passports of visitors issued after october 26 , 2004 to carry biometric features if the traveler is to enter without a visa .
the european parliament is also considering measures to replace all traditional european passports by a new biometric version by 2005 .
in addition it ’ s mulling proposals to introduce biometric data on visas and residence permits of third country nationals residing in the eu as a means to counter illegal immigration .
concerns of data security however biometric technology has its share of critics .
it ’ s been slammed by human rights and civil liberties groups , who have complained that the storage of such information could be subject to abuse and could be used to record people 's movements .
experts have also questioned the efficiency of the technology and said it could leave millions of people vulnerable to a mistaken identity . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu eyes biometric passport plan some see compulsory fingerprinting as an invasion of civil rights and retinal scanning is thought by many to be the stuff of science fiction , but these measures and more may all be part of a new eu passport come 2005 .

german beer : worth a scientific look getting pickled in germany germany 's love affair with beer cools business -pipe- 13.02.2004 oetker gulps down brau und brunnen großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oetker 's ulrich kallmeyer , left , and brau und brunnen ceo michael hollmann .
germany 's largest food producer , oetker , announced friday it will take over brewer brau und brunnen , making the company germany 's top beer producer .
it 's the latest in a series of mergers in germany 's brewing industry . oetker has bought 62 percent stake in brau und brunnen from hypovereinsbank -lrb- hvb -rrb- , germany 's second biggest bank , for € 220 million -lrb- $ 283 million -rrb- . " pilsner goes nicely with pudding and pizza , " said ulrich kallmeyer , one of family-owned oetker 's top executives . brau und brunnen , which has brand names like jever , tucher and berliner pilsner under its roof , had a turnover of € 578 million in 2002 .
" we are happy to be able to sell at a good price , " a hvb spokesman said .
oetker also announced its intention of launching a takeover bid for the remaining brau und brunnen shares for a unit price of € 80 . germany 's beer market , europe 's largest , is the only one on the continent where such takeovers are still possible , according to experts . almost 1,300 breweries still exist in the country , the most fragmented market in europe .
together , they produce roughly as much beer as u.s. brewery giant anheuser-bush alone .
even oetker , which will now control about 15 percent of the german market , dwarfs in comparison to the makers of bud or sab miller , the second largest brewery in the world . foreigners get thirsty for german beer giants such as sab miller and anheuser have so far stayed away from german breweries , but other foreign competitors have begun to develop a thirst for german beer .
in the past four years , mergers and takeovers have begun to shake up the country 's brewery scene , which remains attractive despite a recent drop in consumption . last year , germans still gulped down an impressive 105 million hectoliters -lrb- 2.7 billion gallons -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgian interbrew now fills these steins at oktoberfest .
foreigners already control one-third of the market .
in 2001 , the trend began with a joint company created by dutch heineken and munich 's schörghuber group , which includes brands such as paulaner and kulmbacher . the belgian brewing giant interbrew took the top position in germany 's beer market after buying gilde group , beck 's brewery in bremen .
the belgians are also present at munich 's oktoberfest after buying löwenbräu and spaten last fall . in january , another international player entered the german beer market : danish carlberg group joined forced with germany 's largest family-owned brewery , bitburger , and bought holsten brewery for € 1 billion .
at the time , brau and brunnen 's ceo announced plans for a takeover in the coming weeks , but oetker stopped that idea short . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " gods ' food " is what dr. oetker calls its answer to jell-o .
brau und brunnen wo n't be oetker 's first venture into the brewing industry : the company already owns radeberger group , which includes beer brands such as dab and berliner kindl .
the combined company will control 15 percent of the market , according to experts . while the move might push oetker 's traditional food sector , which includes everything from baking powder to frozen pizzas , to third place within the company , its shipping business hamburg süd remains the top money-maker .
oetker also owns a bank , an insurance company , a chemical plant and several luxury hotels . henrik böhme -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the dark cloud over oktoberfest shortly before oktoberfest kicked off in munich this month , the begium-based brewing multinational interbrew acquired two of the annual festival ’ s most famous brews : spaten and franziskaner .

german chancellor gerhard schröder and british prime minister tony blair met in berlin on thursday ahead of a three-way summit with france next week .
they denied the formation of a leading " triumvirate " within the eu . days after hosting french president jacques chirac in the german capital , schröder 's talks with the british premier aimed to pave the way for the upcoming summit with all three leaders next wednesday . the purpose of the upcoming french-british-german meeting is to coordinate positions for the eu 's next summit , scheduled for march 25-26 in brussels .
the three leading countries of the european union are hoping to present a common front as the bloc prepares to expand to 25 members in may .
the eu draft constitution was derailed in december after poland and spain blocked attempts to bring voting rights more in line with each country 's population . besides pushing to get the eu constitution back on track , berlin and paris hope london will add its clout to efforts to cap the eu budget .
schröder and chirac this week said they were sticking with demands for a freeze on the eu budget until 2013 .
france , germany , britain , the netherlands , sweden and austria - all of which are net contributors to the eu , meaning they pay more in than they get back – made the budget freeze demand last december in an open letter . no eu triumvirate with such meetings becoming a regular occurance , many other eu countries , including italy and spain , have become increasingly suspicious of closer french-british-german cooperation , fearing the three countries will band together to impose their will on others . however , both schröder and blair , speaking after their meeting , said that such concerns were unfounded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " this is not about trying to create a directoire in europe at all , " said blair .
" i think it 's important that we try and work at these issues together and not exclude other countries , " he added . iraq rift healed the summit next week is also an attempt to show the rift caused by the war in iraq has been sealed .
whereas france and germany strongly opposed the u.s.-led campaign to oust saddam hussein , britain was america 's staunchest supporter . after talking with blair , schröder made clear divisions over the case for war were a thing of the past .
" we both believe it makes no sense to talk about history and discuss our different positions on the need for war , but instead both of us must help ensure that the process of democratization and reconstruction in iraq succeeds , " he said . topping the defense policy agenda will be u.s. proposals to get nato more involved in stabilizing iraq - which both france and germany are weary of - and the transatlantic alliance 's expanding role in peacekeeping in afghanistan . as a sign of the new three-way cooperation on defense matters , germany said on wednesday it would back anglo-french plans for a european rapid-reaction force that could be sent to flashpoints around the world .
the proposal calls for a force of 1,500 soldiers that could be deployed within 15 days . the eu already has plans to set up a 60,000-strong unit that could be ready for action within 60 days and nato wants to create a rapid-reaction force of 21,000 troops . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin , paris want eu constitution deal meeting near berlin on monday , german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac said they want an agreement on a new european union constitution before the end of the irish eu presidency in june .

greek and turkish cypriot negotiators agreed to a u.n.-proposed plan to unify the divided island , ending days of marathon negotiations in new york . " we have achieved a resumption of talks under the auspices of the secretary-general , " greek cypriot leader tassos papadopoulos told reuters . the plan , pushed by u.n. secretary general kofi annan , calls for both sides of the island , divided since the turkish invasion in 1974 , to begin negotiating details of the unification on feb .

annan wanted both sides to reach a compromise before the greek cypriot side enters the european union on may 1 . the un secretary general apparently gave both sides an ultimatum in the early morning hours friday in new york city , telling them to either sign or reject his proposal . both sides say they still have a lot of work ahead of them . " we expect long and tiring work ahead of us , " turkish foreign ministry undersecretary ugur ziyal told reporters . working against the clock the compromise came as time was running out to resolve the decades-old conflict , which began when turkish troops invaded the north half of the island following a coup orchestrated by the greek dictatorship in athens . the southern , greek side of the island has enjoyed international recognition and flourished economically .
the northern side is recognized only by turkey and is populated mostly with turkish soldiers .
a buffer zone patrolled by un soldiers separates the two sides . over the years , the deadlock has frustrated top diplomats from europe and the united states .
most recently , turkish cypriot leader rauf denktash walked out of un-backed talks a year ago . but with the prospect of eu-entry in may , the current negotiations have taken on an added sense of urgency .
if the two sides fail to reach a reunification agreement before may 1 , then only the greek cypriot south will join the eu . after tacitly supporting the turkish cypriot leader for years , turkey is now urging denktash to compromise , fearing failed talks could harm turkey 's chances of joining the eu down the road . annan pressures both sides into referendums bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary-general kofi annan , center , shakes hands with greek cypriot president tassos papadopoulos , right , and rauf denktash , turkish cypriot leader , left .

france , germany , britain , the netherlands , sweden and austria - all of which are net contributors to the eu , meaning they pay more in than they get back – made the budget freeze demand last december in an open letter . no eu triumvirate with such meetings becoming a regular occurance , many other eu countries , including italy and spain , have become increasingly suspicious of closer french-british-german cooperation , fearing the three countries will band together to impose their will on others . however , both schröder and blair , speaking after their meeting , said that such concerns were unfounded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " this is not about trying to create a directoire in europe at all , " said blair .
" i think it 's important that we try and work at these issues together and not exclude other countries , " he added . iraq rift healed the summit next week is also an attempt to show the rift caused by the war in iraq has been sealed .
whereas france and germany strongly opposed the u.s.-led campaign to oust saddam hussein , britain was america 's staunchest supporter . after talking with blair , schröder made clear divisions over the case for war were a thing of the past .
" we both believe it makes no sense to talk about history and discuss our different positions on the need for war , but instead both of us must help ensure that the process of democratization and reconstruction in iraq succeeds , " he said . topping the defense policy agenda will be u.s. proposals to get nato more involved in stabilizing iraq - which both france and germany are weary of - and the transatlantic alliance 's expanding role in peacekeeping in afghanistan . as a sign of the new three-way cooperation on defense matters , germany said on wednesday it would back anglo-french plans for a european rapid-reaction force that could be sent to flashpoints around the world .
the proposal calls for a force of 1,500 soldiers that could be deployed within 15 days . the eu already has plans to set up a 60,000-strong unit that could be ready for action within 60 days and nato wants to create a rapid-reaction force of 21,000 troops . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin , paris want eu constitution deal meeting near berlin on monday , german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac said they want an agreement on a new european union constitution before the end of the irish eu presidency in june .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.02.2004 democrats abroad mobilize against bush through expat primaries großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last u.s. election saw george bush win partly due to large numbers of republican absentee ballots .
this year , democrats have swiftly mobilized members abroad to help determine the party 's presidential candidate . ron schlundt has a lot on his plate .
the chairman of german branch of democrats abroad - the international organization of the u.s. democratic party - has spent the past weeks compiling lists and counting votes .
as american voters turned out last sunday for primary elections in maine , expatriate americans living in germany held their own presidential straw polls in berlin , frankfurt and kaiserslautern organized by democrats abroad .
two days earlier , democrats in heidelberg and göttingen cast votes , which were followed on monday with the munich caucus , bavaria 's answer to the iowa caucus .
finally , at the end of february , the germany-wide caucus takes place .
the results will be sent to the international caucus in edinburgh this march . there , the combined tallies from countries around the world will determine which candidate the nine democrats abroad delegates will support at the democratic national convention in boston this july .
seven million americans live abroad the influence of democrats abroad sharply increased after president george w. bush 's razor-thing victory in 2000 with the help of republican absentee voters living overseas .
the democrats have since paid closer attention to their far-flung pool of potential voters .
indeed , close to seven million americans live outside the u.s. - considerably more than live in smaller u.s. states like maine , nebraska or nevada .
" these are all possible voters , who could be important if there 's a tight race , " explained schlundt .
by rallying the vote with groups like democrats abroad , the party leadership in washington is hoping to pull as many voters as it can come november .
bildunterschrift : wesley clark , john edwards , howard dean , john kerry according to schlundt , the results of the handful of straw polls being held in germany have largely mirrored those taking place back at home .
john kerry has been the clear victor -lrb- 55 percent -rrb- in regional straw polls across the country and howard dean has landed in a distant second place -lrb- 19 percent -rrb- . wesley clark and john edwards trailed even further , with 10 percent and 9 percent respectively .
but there are also key differences between american and german straw polls - especially when it comes to venues .
though u.s. events are held in public buildings or schools , in kaiserslautern the caucus was held in schmidt 's apartment .
the pool of potential american voters here is relatively small and is comprised of many soldiers and their families , expatriates here on business or even university students studying abroad .
" about 30 or 40 people came to my home , " schlundt said , adding with laugh , " in other words , it went very well . "
there was more congestion at straw polls in heidelberg and berlin , cities considered the biggest districts for the so-called " german democrats . "
in the capital city , the straw poll was held , appropriately , in an american diner , and at a restaurant in heidelberg .
close to 200 of the around 1,500 registered democrats in germany participated in the primary election poll .
procedural restrictions in the straw polling process create geographical barriers that make it hard for more people to participate .
" in a caucus , people ca n't submit an absentee ballot by mail .

an air of change " but participation is 10 times greater than by the last elections , " said schlundt , who serves as a history professor at a satellite branch of the university of maryland in germany when he 's not organizing democratic caucuses .

that applies not only to germany , but also in close to 40 other countries where primaries have been held in recent days .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.02.2004 democrats abroad mobilize against bush through expat primaries großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last u.s. election saw george bush win partly due to large numbers of republican absentee ballots .
this year , democrats have swiftly mobilized members abroad to help determine the party 's presidential candidate . ron schlundt has a lot on his plate .
the chairman of german branch of democrats abroad - the international organization of the u.s. democratic party - has spent the past weeks compiling lists and counting votes .
as american voters turned out last sunday for primary elections in maine , expatriate americans living in germany held their own presidential straw polls in berlin , frankfurt and kaiserslautern organized by democrats abroad .
two days earlier , democrats in heidelberg and göttingen cast votes , which were followed on monday with the munich caucus , bavaria 's answer to the iowa caucus .
finally , at the end of february , the germany-wide caucus takes place .
the results will be sent to the international caucus in edinburgh this march . there , the combined tallies from countries around the world will determine which candidate the nine democrats abroad delegates will support at the democratic national convention in boston this july .
seven million americans live abroad the influence of democrats abroad sharply increased after president george w. bush 's razor-thing victory in 2000 with the help of republican absentee voters living overseas .
the democrats have since paid closer attention to their far-flung pool of potential voters .
indeed , close to seven million americans live outside the u.s. - considerably more than live in smaller u.s. states like maine , nebraska or nevada .
" these are all possible voters , who could be important if there 's a tight race , " explained schlundt .
by rallying the vote with groups like democrats abroad , the party leadership in washington is hoping to pull as many voters as it can come november .
bildunterschrift : wesley clark , john edwards , howard dean , john kerry according to schlundt , the results of the handful of straw polls being held in germany have largely mirrored those taking place back at home .
john kerry has been the clear victor -lrb- 55 percent -rrb- in regional straw polls across the country and howard dean has landed in a distant second place -lrb- 19 percent -rrb- . wesley clark and john edwards trailed even further , with 10 percent and 9 percent respectively .
but there are also key differences between american and german straw polls - especially when it comes to venues .
though u.s. events are held in public buildings or schools , in kaiserslautern the caucus was held in schmidt 's apartment .
the pool of potential american voters here is relatively small and is comprised of many soldiers and their families , expatriates here on business or even university students studying abroad .
" about 30 or 40 people came to my home , " schlundt said , adding with laugh , " in other words , it went very well . "
there was more congestion at straw polls in heidelberg and berlin , cities considered the biggest districts for the so-called " german democrats . "
in the capital city , the straw poll was held , appropriately , in an american diner , and at a restaurant in heidelberg .
close to 200 of the around 1,500 registered democrats in germany participated in the primary election poll .
procedural restrictions in the straw polling process create geographical barriers that make it hard for more people to participate .
" in a caucus , people ca n't submit an absentee ballot by mail .
that 's why all voters - even if they live in leipzig or cologne - have to submit their vote at one of the participating polling places , " schlundt said , explaining the overall turnout .
an air of change " but participation is 10 times greater than by the last elections , " said schlundt , who serves as a history professor at a satellite branch of the university of maryland in germany when he 's not organizing democratic caucuses .
the reason so many democrats are turning out to the polls , he said , is that " so many democrats are so opposed to bush that you do n't even have to mobilize them . "

german beer : worth a scientific look getting pickled in germany germany 's love affair with beer cools business -pipe- 13.02.2004 oetker gulps down brau und brunnen großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oetker 's ulrich kallmeyer , left , and brau und brunnen ceo michael hollmann .
germany 's largest food producer , oetker , announced friday it will take over brewer brau und brunnen , making the company germany 's top beer producer .
it 's the latest in a series of mergers in germany 's brewing industry . oetker has bought 62 percent stake in brau und brunnen from hypovereinsbank -lrb- hvb -rrb- , germany 's second biggest bank , for € 220 million -lrb- $ 283 million -rrb- . " pilsner goes nicely with pudding and pizza , " said ulrich kallmeyer , one of family-owned oetker 's top executives . brau und brunnen , which has brand names like jever , tucher and berliner pilsner under its roof , had a turnover of € 578 million in 2002 .
" we are happy to be able to sell at a good price , " a hvb spokesman said .
oetker also announced its intention of launching a takeover bid for the remaining brau und brunnen shares for a unit price of € 80 . germany 's beer market , europe 's largest , is the only one on the continent where such takeovers are still possible , according to experts . almost 1,300 breweries still exist in the country , the most fragmented market in europe .
together , they produce roughly as much beer as u.s. brewery giant anheuser-bush alone .
even oetker , which will now control about 15 percent of the german market , dwarfs in comparison to the makers of bud or sab miller , the second largest brewery in the world . foreigners get thirsty for german beer giants such as sab miller and anheuser have so far stayed away from german breweries , but other foreign competitors have begun to develop a thirst for german beer .
in the past four years , mergers and takeovers have begun to shake up the country 's brewery scene , which remains attractive despite a recent drop in consumption . last year , germans still gulped down an impressive 105 million hectoliters -lrb- 2.7 billion gallons -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgian interbrew now fills these steins at oktoberfest .
foreigners already control one-third of the market .
in 2001 , the trend began with a joint company created by dutch heineken and munich 's schörghuber group , which includes brands such as paulaner and kulmbacher . the belgian brewing giant interbrew took the top position in germany 's beer market after buying gilde group , beck 's brewery in bremen .
the belgians are also present at munich 's oktoberfest after buying löwenbräu and spaten last fall . in january , another international player entered the german beer market : danish carlberg group joined forced with germany 's largest family-owned brewery , bitburger , and bought holsten brewery for € 1 billion .
at the time , brau and brunnen 's ceo announced plans for a takeover in the coming weeks , but oetker stopped that idea short . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " gods ' food " is what dr. oetker calls its answer to jell-o .

schily squints into the new iris scan system .
forget passport controls and get ready for some eye contact next time you enter frankfurt airport .
that ’ s where german interior minister schily has kicked off the first high-tech biometric iris-scanning system . the future arrived at frankfurt airport this week with the introduction of a sophisticated digital camera at border controls capable of recognizing people by their irises .
considered the most accurate system in biometrics - the process of identifying people through their unique biological factors - the iris scanning technology is meant to both speed up conventional passport controls as well as enhance existing security procedures .
" biometrics doesn ’ t just make travelling safer , but also simpler , " german interior minister otto schily said as he launched the new technology on thursday .
the system is expected to cut long waiting lines at airports on account of its partly automated border controls .
the minister added the iris scan would initially be in place as a pilot project for six months .
it would help officials gather information about biometric procedures for their " border control routines " , he said , as well as help germany gain important insights for improving its domestic security .
the nuts and bolts as a first step , passengers first have to have their iris photographed .
for that they have to step up to a special high-resolution digital camera - fitted with an infrared imager to illuminate the eye even behind glasses or lens - for a picture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman has her iris scanned for computer recognition .
a computer will then process the digital images with the help of a software that will carefully map the iris in a spiral form working from the outside to the inside and record the unique spots and pigments .
that data will then be transferred onto the passenger ’ s machine-readable passport .
once they have their iris blueprint in the system , passengers in future will simply have to feed in their machine-readable passports , glance at the camera , and once the iris scan matches the passport data , the exit doors will automatically swing open .
the entire procedure is expected to last 20 seconds .
before submitting to the iris scan for the first time , passengers have to agree to a passport check by border guards and sign a data security document .
the offer is only meant for eu citizens aged 18 and above .
iris scan the most accurate experts believe the iris scan remains the most accurate biometric process , which involves automated identification of one ’ s identity using physiological clues such as scanning an iris or facial features , hand or fingerprint recognition or handwriting analysis , and matching that information with a database .
since iris patterns are extremely complex , with more than 200 unique spots , they are believed to be the most reliable distinguishing feature of a person and thus easy to capture and compare with a database .
experts say the iris scan is also superior to fingerprint-recognition systems .
that ’ s because greasy , dirty or peeling skin on the finger can easily distort fingerprint-recognition , a factor that plays no role in the case of iris-recognition .
furthermore , the iris doesn ’ t just betray the identity of the passenger , but can also tell much about his or her possible drug and alcohol consumption .
u.s. leads the way in biometric security biometrics , useful in fighting document and credit card fraud , first took off as a global industry after the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in new york and washington .
the u.s. has been the frontrunner , with washington believed to be spending $ 8 billion on biometric security , which involves checking biometric information against terrorist watch lists and police databases .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new sign at frankfurt airport informs passengers about the automated passport control .
in january , the u.s. introduced fingerprint recognition systems for incoming travelers requiring a visa and iris scans and facial-recognition systems are expected to follow .
the u.s. has also urged other countries to follow suit and upgrade security procedures .
new u.s. laws require all passports of visitors issued after october 26 , 2004 to carry biometric features if the traveler is to enter without a visa .
the european parliament is also considering measures to replace all traditional european passports by a new biometric version by 2005 .
in addition it ’ s mulling proposals to introduce biometric data on visas and residence permits of third country nationals residing in the eu as a means to counter illegal immigration .
concerns of data security however biometric technology has its share of critics .
it ’ s been slammed by human rights and civil liberties groups , who have complained that the storage of such information could be subject to abuse and could be used to record people 's movements .
experts have also questioned the efficiency of the technology and said it could leave millions of people vulnerable to a mistaken identity . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu eyes biometric passport plan some see compulsory fingerprinting as an invasion of civil rights and retinal scanning is thought by many to be the stuff of science fiction , but these measures and more may all be part of a new eu passport come 2005 .

" i think it 's important that we try and work at these issues together and not exclude other countries , " he added . iraq rift healed the summit next week is also an attempt to show the rift caused by the war in iraq has been sealed .
whereas france and germany strongly opposed the u.s.-led campaign to oust saddam hussein , britain was america 's staunchest supporter . after talking with blair , schröder made clear divisions over the case for war were a thing of the past .
" we both believe it makes no sense to talk about history and discuss our different positions on the need for war , but instead both of us must help ensure that the process of democratization and reconstruction in iraq succeeds , " he said . topping the defense policy agenda will be u.s. proposals to get nato more involved in stabilizing iraq - which both france and germany are weary of - and the transatlantic alliance 's expanding role in peacekeeping in afghanistan . as a sign of the new three-way cooperation on defense matters , germany said on wednesday it would back anglo-french plans for a european rapid-reaction force that could be sent to flashpoints around the world .
the proposal calls for a force of 1,500 soldiers that could be deployed within 15 days . the eu already has plans to set up a 60,000-strong unit that could be ready for action within 60 days and nato wants to create a rapid-reaction force of 21,000 troops . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin , paris want eu constitution deal meeting near berlin on monday , german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac said they want an agreement on a new european union constitution before the end of the irish eu presidency in june .

german beer : worth a scientific look getting pickled in germany germany 's love affair with beer cools business -pipe- 13.02.2004 oetker gulps down brau und brunnen großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oetker 's ulrich kallmeyer , left , and brau und brunnen ceo michael hollmann .
germany 's largest food producer , oetker , announced friday it will take over brewer brau und brunnen , making the company germany 's top beer producer .
it 's the latest in a series of mergers in germany 's brewing industry . oetker has bought 62 percent stake in brau und brunnen from hypovereinsbank -lrb- hvb -rrb- , germany 's second biggest bank , for € 220 million -lrb- $ 283 million -rrb- . " pilsner goes nicely with pudding and pizza , " said ulrich kallmeyer , one of family-owned oetker 's top executives . brau und brunnen , which has brand names like jever , tucher and berliner pilsner under its roof , had a turnover of € 578 million in 2002 .
" we are happy to be able to sell at a good price , " a hvb spokesman said .
oetker also announced its intention of launching a takeover bid for the remaining brau und brunnen shares for a unit price of € 80 . germany 's beer market , europe 's largest , is the only one on the continent where such takeovers are still possible , according to experts . almost 1,300 breweries still exist in the country , the most fragmented market in europe .
together , they produce roughly as much beer as u.s. brewery giant anheuser-bush alone .
even oetker , which will now control about 15 percent of the german market , dwarfs in comparison to the makers of bud or sab miller , the second largest brewery in the world . foreigners get thirsty for german beer giants such as sab miller and anheuser have so far stayed away from german breweries , but other foreign competitors have begun to develop a thirst for german beer .
in the past four years , mergers and takeovers have begun to shake up the country 's brewery scene , which remains attractive despite a recent drop in consumption . last year , germans still gulped down an impressive 105 million hectoliters -lrb- 2.7 billion gallons -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgian interbrew now fills these steins at oktoberfest .

it 's the latest in a series of mergers in germany 's brewing industry . oetker has bought 62 percent stake in brau und brunnen from hypovereinsbank -lrb- hvb -rrb- , germany 's second biggest bank , for € 220 million -lrb- $ 283 million -rrb- . " pilsner goes nicely with pudding and pizza , " said ulrich kallmeyer , one of family-owned oetker 's top executives . brau und brunnen , which has brand names like jever , tucher and berliner pilsner under its roof , had a turnover of € 578 million in 2002 .
" we are happy to be able to sell at a good price , " a hvb spokesman said .
oetker also announced its intention of launching a takeover bid for the remaining brau und brunnen shares for a unit price of € 80 . germany 's beer market , europe 's largest , is the only one on the continent where such takeovers are still possible , according to experts . almost 1,300 breweries still exist in the country , the most fragmented market in europe .
together , they produce roughly as much beer as u.s. brewery giant anheuser-bush alone .
even oetker , which will now control about 15 percent of the german market , dwarfs in comparison to the makers of bud or sab miller , the second largest brewery in the world . foreigners get thirsty for german beer giants such as sab miller and anheuser have so far stayed away from german breweries , but other foreign competitors have begun to develop a thirst for german beer .
in the past four years , mergers and takeovers have begun to shake up the country 's brewery scene , which remains attractive despite a recent drop in consumption . last year , germans still gulped down an impressive 105 million hectoliters -lrb- 2.7 billion gallons -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgian interbrew now fills these steins at oktoberfest .
foreigners already control one-third of the market .
in 2001 , the trend began with a joint company created by dutch heineken and munich 's schörghuber group , which includes brands such as paulaner and kulmbacher . the belgian brewing giant interbrew took the top position in germany 's beer market after buying gilde group , beck 's brewery in bremen .
the belgians are also present at munich 's oktoberfest after buying löwenbräu and spaten last fall . in january , another international player entered the german beer market : danish carlberg group joined forced with germany 's largest family-owned brewery , bitburger , and bought holsten brewery for € 1 billion .
at the time , brau and brunnen 's ceo announced plans for a takeover in the coming weeks , but oetker stopped that idea short . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " gods ' food " is what dr. oetker calls its answer to jell-o .
brau und brunnen wo n't be oetker 's first venture into the brewing industry : the company already owns radeberger group , which includes beer brands such as dab and berliner kindl .
the combined company will control 15 percent of the market , according to experts . while the move might push oetker 's traditional food sector , which includes everything from baking powder to frozen pizzas , to third place within the company , its shipping business hamburg süd remains the top money-maker .
oetker also owns a bank , an insurance company , a chemical plant and several luxury hotels . henrik böhme -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the dark cloud over oktoberfest shortly before oktoberfest kicked off in munich this month , the begium-based brewing multinational interbrew acquired two of the annual festival ’ s most famous brews : spaten and franziskaner .

" we expect long and tiring work ahead of us , " turkish foreign ministry undersecretary ugur ziyal told reporters . working against the clock the compromise came as time was running out to resolve the decades-old conflict , which began when turkish troops invaded the north half of the island following a coup orchestrated by the greek dictatorship in athens . the southern , greek side of the island has enjoyed international recognition and flourished economically .
the northern side is recognized only by turkey and is populated mostly with turkish soldiers .
a buffer zone patrolled by un soldiers separates the two sides . over the years , the deadlock has frustrated top diplomats from europe and the united states .
most recently , turkish cypriot leader rauf denktash walked out of un-backed talks a year ago . but with the prospect of eu-entry in may , the current negotiations have taken on an added sense of urgency .
if the two sides fail to reach a reunification agreement before may 1 , then only the greek cypriot south will join the eu . after tacitly supporting the turkish cypriot leader for years , turkey is now urging denktash to compromise , fearing failed talks could harm turkey 's chances of joining the eu down the road . annan pressures both sides into referendums bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary-general kofi annan , center , shakes hands with greek cypriot president tassos papadopoulos , right , and rauf denktash , turkish cypriot leader , left .
according to the un plan , both sides will engage in intense talks guided by the un until march 26th , at which time remaining differences will be left to annan to resolve with the final plan submitted to both the turkish and greek cypriots in separate referendums on april 21st . according to the reuters news agency , the negotiations partly stalled due to disagreements over the extent of eu involvement in the upcoming negotiations .
the greeks , it seems , would like eu experts from brussels to participate , while the turkish side is less enthusiastic about such a plan . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a divided cyprus makes the cut cyprus is one of the countries most ready to join the european union .

schily squints into the new iris scan system .
forget passport controls and get ready for some eye contact next time you enter frankfurt airport .
that ’ s where german interior minister schily has kicked off the first high-tech biometric iris-scanning system . the future arrived at frankfurt airport this week with the introduction of a sophisticated digital camera at border controls capable of recognizing people by their irises .
considered the most accurate system in biometrics - the process of identifying people through their unique biological factors - the iris scanning technology is meant to both speed up conventional passport controls as well as enhance existing security procedures .
" biometrics doesn ’ t just make travelling safer , but also simpler , " german interior minister otto schily said as he launched the new technology on thursday .
the system is expected to cut long waiting lines at airports on account of its partly automated border controls .
the minister added the iris scan would initially be in place as a pilot project for six months .
it would help officials gather information about biometric procedures for their " border control routines " , he said , as well as help germany gain important insights for improving its domestic security .
the nuts and bolts as a first step , passengers first have to have their iris photographed .
for that they have to step up to a special high-resolution digital camera - fitted with an infrared imager to illuminate the eye even behind glasses or lens - for a picture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman has her iris scanned for computer recognition .
a computer will then process the digital images with the help of a software that will carefully map the iris in a spiral form working from the outside to the inside and record the unique spots and pigments .
that data will then be transferred onto the passenger ’ s machine-readable passport .
once they have their iris blueprint in the system , passengers in future will simply have to feed in their machine-readable passports , glance at the camera , and once the iris scan matches the passport data , the exit doors will automatically swing open .
the entire procedure is expected to last 20 seconds .
before submitting to the iris scan for the first time , passengers have to agree to a passport check by border guards and sign a data security document .
the offer is only meant for eu citizens aged 18 and above .
iris scan the most accurate experts believe the iris scan remains the most accurate biometric process , which involves automated identification of one ’ s identity using physiological clues such as scanning an iris or facial features , hand or fingerprint recognition or handwriting analysis , and matching that information with a database .
since iris patterns are extremely complex , with more than 200 unique spots , they are believed to be the most reliable distinguishing feature of a person and thus easy to capture and compare with a database .
experts say the iris scan is also superior to fingerprint-recognition systems .
that ’ s because greasy , dirty or peeling skin on the finger can easily distort fingerprint-recognition , a factor that plays no role in the case of iris-recognition .
furthermore , the iris doesn ’ t just betray the identity of the passenger , but can also tell much about his or her possible drug and alcohol consumption .
u.s. leads the way in biometric security biometrics , useful in fighting document and credit card fraud , first took off as a global industry after the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in new york and washington .
the u.s. has been the frontrunner , with washington believed to be spending $ 8 billion on biometric security , which involves checking biometric information against terrorist watch lists and police databases .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new sign at frankfurt airport informs passengers about the automated passport control .
in january , the u.s. introduced fingerprint recognition systems for incoming travelers requiring a visa and iris scans and facial-recognition systems are expected to follow .
the u.s. has also urged other countries to follow suit and upgrade security procedures .
new u.s. laws require all passports of visitors issued after october 26 , 2004 to carry biometric features if the traveler is to enter without a visa .
the european parliament is also considering measures to replace all traditional european passports by a new biometric version by 2005 .
in addition it ’ s mulling proposals to introduce biometric data on visas and residence permits of third country nationals residing in the eu as a means to counter illegal immigration .
concerns of data security however biometric technology has its share of critics .
it ’ s been slammed by human rights and civil liberties groups , who have complained that the storage of such information could be subject to abuse and could be used to record people 's movements .
experts have also questioned the efficiency of the technology and said it could leave millions of people vulnerable to a mistaken identity . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu eyes biometric passport plan some see compulsory fingerprinting as an invasion of civil rights and retinal scanning is thought by many to be the stuff of science fiction , but these measures and more may all be part of a new eu passport come 2005 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.02.2004 democrats abroad mobilize against bush through expat primaries großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last u.s. election saw george bush win partly due to large numbers of republican absentee ballots .
this year , democrats have swiftly mobilized members abroad to help determine the party 's presidential candidate . ron schlundt has a lot on his plate .
the chairman of german branch of democrats abroad - the international organization of the u.s. democratic party - has spent the past weeks compiling lists and counting votes .
as american voters turned out last sunday for primary elections in maine , expatriate americans living in germany held their own presidential straw polls in berlin , frankfurt and kaiserslautern organized by democrats abroad .
two days earlier , democrats in heidelberg and göttingen cast votes , which were followed on monday with the munich caucus , bavaria 's answer to the iowa caucus .
finally , at the end of february , the germany-wide caucus takes place .
the results will be sent to the international caucus in edinburgh this march . there , the combined tallies from countries around the world will determine which candidate the nine democrats abroad delegates will support at the democratic national convention in boston this july .
seven million americans live abroad the influence of democrats abroad sharply increased after president george w. bush 's razor-thing victory in 2000 with the help of republican absentee voters living overseas .
the democrats have since paid closer attention to their far-flung pool of potential voters .
indeed , close to seven million americans live outside the u.s. - considerably more than live in smaller u.s. states like maine , nebraska or nevada .
" these are all possible voters , who could be important if there 's a tight race , " explained schlundt .
by rallying the vote with groups like democrats abroad , the party leadership in washington is hoping to pull as many voters as it can come november .
bildunterschrift : wesley clark , john edwards , howard dean , john kerry according to schlundt , the results of the handful of straw polls being held in germany have largely mirrored those taking place back at home .
john kerry has been the clear victor -lrb- 55 percent -rrb- in regional straw polls across the country and howard dean has landed in a distant second place -lrb- 19 percent -rrb- . wesley clark and john edwards trailed even further , with 10 percent and 9 percent respectively .
but there are also key differences between american and german straw polls - especially when it comes to venues .
though u.s. events are held in public buildings or schools , in kaiserslautern the caucus was held in schmidt 's apartment .
the pool of potential american voters here is relatively small and is comprised of many soldiers and their families , expatriates here on business or even university students studying abroad .
" about 30 or 40 people came to my home , " schlundt said , adding with laugh , " in other words , it went very well . "
there was more congestion at straw polls in heidelberg and berlin , cities considered the biggest districts for the so-called " german democrats . "
in the capital city , the straw poll was held , appropriately , in an american diner , and at a restaurant in heidelberg .
close to 200 of the around 1,500 registered democrats in germany participated in the primary election poll .
procedural restrictions in the straw polling process create geographical barriers that make it hard for more people to participate .
" in a caucus , people ca n't submit an absentee ballot by mail .
that 's why all voters - even if they live in leipzig or cologne - have to submit their vote at one of the participating polling places , " schlundt said , explaining the overall turnout .
an air of change " but participation is 10 times greater than by the last elections , " said schlundt , who serves as a history professor at a satellite branch of the university of maryland in germany when he 's not organizing democratic caucuses .
the reason so many democrats are turning out to the polls , he said , is that " so many democrats are so opposed to bush that you do n't even have to mobilize them . "
that applies not only to germany , but also in close to 40 other countries where primaries have been held in recent days .
turnout everywhere has been greater than expected , according to the professor .
" the iraq war was probably the most important issue for our members , " said schlundt .
" the majority were against the war .
that 's why dean was popular for so long . "
but international policy is n't always at the top of the agenda for american democrats living in germany .
everyday problems are also important .
" in germany , we ca n't receive any retirement or public heath care or unemployment benefits from the united states , " he said before concluding : " but that 's hard to change . "
expat influence appears to be growing , however .
though the democrats abroad are a small organization , they still get the party 's ear in washington .
" we were able to speak to almost every candidate in washington - we had several of conference calls with them , and howard dean was a guest at our official dinner , " schlundt said . michael knigge -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european press review : can kerry beat bush ?

this year , democrats have swiftly mobilized members abroad to help determine the party 's presidential candidate . ron schlundt has a lot on his plate .
the chairman of german branch of democrats abroad - the international organization of the u.s. democratic party - has spent the past weeks compiling lists and counting votes .
as american voters turned out last sunday for primary elections in maine , expatriate americans living in germany held their own presidential straw polls in berlin , frankfurt and kaiserslautern organized by democrats abroad .
two days earlier , democrats in heidelberg and göttingen cast votes , which were followed on monday with the munich caucus , bavaria 's answer to the iowa caucus .
finally , at the end of february , the germany-wide caucus takes place .
the results will be sent to the international caucus in edinburgh this march . there , the combined tallies from countries around the world will determine which candidate the nine democrats abroad delegates will support at the democratic national convention in boston this july .
seven million americans live abroad the influence of democrats abroad sharply increased after president george w. bush 's razor-thing victory in 2000 with the help of republican absentee voters living overseas .
the democrats have since paid closer attention to their far-flung pool of potential voters .
indeed , close to seven million americans live outside the u.s. - considerably more than live in smaller u.s. states like maine , nebraska or nevada .
" these are all possible voters , who could be important if there 's a tight race , " explained schlundt .
by rallying the vote with groups like democrats abroad , the party leadership in washington is hoping to pull as many voters as it can come november .
bildunterschrift : wesley clark , john edwards , howard dean , john kerry according to schlundt , the results of the handful of straw polls being held in germany have largely mirrored those taking place back at home .
john kerry has been the clear victor -lrb- 55 percent -rrb- in regional straw polls across the country and howard dean has landed in a distant second place -lrb- 19 percent -rrb- . wesley clark and john edwards trailed even further , with 10 percent and 9 percent respectively .
but there are also key differences between american and german straw polls - especially when it comes to venues .
though u.s. events are held in public buildings or schools , in kaiserslautern the caucus was held in schmidt 's apartment .
the pool of potential american voters here is relatively small and is comprised of many soldiers and their families , expatriates here on business or even university students studying abroad .
" about 30 or 40 people came to my home , " schlundt said , adding with laugh , " in other words , it went very well . "
there was more congestion at straw polls in heidelberg and berlin , cities considered the biggest districts for the so-called " german democrats . "
in the capital city , the straw poll was held , appropriately , in an american diner , and at a restaurant in heidelberg .
close to 200 of the around 1,500 registered democrats in germany participated in the primary election poll .
procedural restrictions in the straw polling process create geographical barriers that make it hard for more people to participate .
" in a caucus , people ca n't submit an absentee ballot by mail .
that 's why all voters - even if they live in leipzig or cologne - have to submit their vote at one of the participating polling places , " schlundt said , explaining the overall turnout .
an air of change " but participation is 10 times greater than by the last elections , " said schlundt , who serves as a history professor at a satellite branch of the university of maryland in germany when he 's not organizing democratic caucuses .
the reason so many democrats are turning out to the polls , he said , is that " so many democrats are so opposed to bush that you do n't even have to mobilize them . "
that applies not only to germany , but also in close to 40 other countries where primaries have been held in recent days .
turnout everywhere has been greater than expected , according to the professor .
" the iraq war was probably the most important issue for our members , " said schlundt .
" the majority were against the war .
that 's why dean was popular for so long . "
but international policy is n't always at the top of the agenda for american democrats living in germany .
everyday problems are also important .
" in germany , we ca n't receive any retirement or public heath care or unemployment benefits from the united states , " he said before concluding : " but that 's hard to change . "
expat influence appears to be growing , however .
though the democrats abroad are a small organization , they still get the party 's ear in washington .
" we were able to speak to almost every candidate in washington - we had several of conference calls with them , and howard dean was a guest at our official dinner , " schlundt said . michael knigge -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european press review : can kerry beat bush ?
european papers on thursday focused on u.s. democratic presidential front-runner john kerry ’ s success on the campaign trail .
most warned kerry had his work cut out if he was to dislodge bush from the white house .

schily squints into the new iris scan system .
forget passport controls and get ready for some eye contact next time you enter frankfurt airport .
that ’ s where german interior minister schily has kicked off the first high-tech biometric iris-scanning system . the future arrived at frankfurt airport this week with the introduction of a sophisticated digital camera at border controls capable of recognizing people by their irises .
considered the most accurate system in biometrics - the process of identifying people through their unique biological factors - the iris scanning technology is meant to both speed up conventional passport controls as well as enhance existing security procedures .
" biometrics doesn ’ t just make travelling safer , but also simpler , " german interior minister otto schily said as he launched the new technology on thursday .
the system is expected to cut long waiting lines at airports on account of its partly automated border controls .
the minister added the iris scan would initially be in place as a pilot project for six months .
it would help officials gather information about biometric procedures for their " border control routines " , he said , as well as help germany gain important insights for improving its domestic security .

for that they have to step up to a special high-resolution digital camera - fitted with an infrared imager to illuminate the eye even behind glasses or lens - for a picture .

a computer will then process the digital images with the help of a software that will carefully map the iris in a spiral form working from the outside to the inside and record the unique spots and pigments .
that data will then be transferred onto the passenger ’ s machine-readable passport .
once they have their iris blueprint in the system , passengers in future will simply have to feed in their machine-readable passports , glance at the camera , and once the iris scan matches the passport data , the exit doors will automatically swing open .
the entire procedure is expected to last 20 seconds .
before submitting to the iris scan for the first time , passengers have to agree to a passport check by border guards and sign a data security document .

iris scan the most accurate experts believe the iris scan remains the most accurate biometric process , which involves automated identification of one ’ s identity using physiological clues such as scanning an iris or facial features , hand or fingerprint recognition or handwriting analysis , and matching that information with a database .
since iris patterns are extremely complex , with more than 200 unique spots , they are believed to be the most reliable distinguishing feature of a person and thus easy to capture and compare with a database .
experts say the iris scan is also superior to fingerprint-recognition systems .

schily squints into the new iris scan system .
forget passport controls and get ready for some eye contact next time you enter frankfurt airport .
that ’ s where german interior minister schily has kicked off the first high-tech biometric iris-scanning system . the future arrived at frankfurt airport this week with the introduction of a sophisticated digital camera at border controls capable of recognizing people by their irises .
considered the most accurate system in biometrics - the process of identifying people through their unique biological factors - the iris scanning technology is meant to both speed up conventional passport controls as well as enhance existing security procedures .
" biometrics doesn ’ t just make travelling safer , but also simpler , " german interior minister otto schily said as he launched the new technology on thursday .
the system is expected to cut long waiting lines at airports on account of its partly automated border controls .
the minister added the iris scan would initially be in place as a pilot project for six months .
it would help officials gather information about biometric procedures for their " border control routines " , he said , as well as help germany gain important insights for improving its domestic security .

german beer : worth a scientific look getting pickled in germany germany 's love affair with beer cools business -pipe- 13.02.2004 oetker gulps down brau und brunnen großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oetker 's ulrich kallmeyer , left , and brau und brunnen ceo michael hollmann .
germany 's largest food producer , oetker , announced friday it will take over brewer brau und brunnen , making the company germany 's top beer producer .
it 's the latest in a series of mergers in germany 's brewing industry . oetker has bought 62 percent stake in brau und brunnen from hypovereinsbank -lrb- hvb -rrb- , germany 's second biggest bank , for € 220 million -lrb- $ 283 million -rrb- . " pilsner goes nicely with pudding and pizza , " said ulrich kallmeyer , one of family-owned oetker 's top executives . brau und brunnen , which has brand names like jever , tucher and berliner pilsner under its roof , had a turnover of € 578 million in 2002 .
" we are happy to be able to sell at a good price , " a hvb spokesman said .
oetker also announced its intention of launching a takeover bid for the remaining brau und brunnen shares for a unit price of € 80 . germany 's beer market , europe 's largest , is the only one on the continent where such takeovers are still possible , according to experts . almost 1,300 breweries still exist in the country , the most fragmented market in europe .
together , they produce roughly as much beer as u.s. brewery giant anheuser-bush alone .
even oetker , which will now control about 15 percent of the german market , dwarfs in comparison to the makers of bud or sab miller , the second largest brewery in the world . foreigners get thirsty for german beer giants such as sab miller and anheuser have so far stayed away from german breweries , but other foreign competitors have begun to develop a thirst for german beer .
in the past four years , mergers and takeovers have begun to shake up the country 's brewery scene , which remains attractive despite a recent drop in consumption . last year , germans still gulped down an impressive 105 million hectoliters -lrb- 2.7 billion gallons -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgian interbrew now fills these steins at oktoberfest .
foreigners already control one-third of the market .
in 2001 , the trend began with a joint company created by dutch heineken and munich 's schörghuber group , which includes brands such as paulaner and kulmbacher . the belgian brewing giant interbrew took the top position in germany 's beer market after buying gilde group , beck 's brewery in bremen .
the belgians are also present at munich 's oktoberfest after buying löwenbräu and spaten last fall . in january , another international player entered the german beer market : danish carlberg group joined forced with germany 's largest family-owned brewery , bitburger , and bought holsten brewery for € 1 billion .
at the time , brau and brunnen 's ceo announced plans for a takeover in the coming weeks , but oetker stopped that idea short . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " gods ' food " is what dr. oetker calls its answer to jell-o .
brau und brunnen wo n't be oetker 's first venture into the brewing industry : the company already owns radeberger group , which includes beer brands such as dab and berliner kindl .
the combined company will control 15 percent of the market , according to experts . while the move might push oetker 's traditional food sector , which includes everything from baking powder to frozen pizzas , to third place within the company , its shipping business hamburg süd remains the top money-maker .

germany 's largest food producer , oetker , announced friday it will take over brewer brau und brunnen , making the company germany 's top beer producer .
it 's the latest in a series of mergers in germany 's brewing industry . oetker has bought 62 percent stake in brau und brunnen from hypovereinsbank -lrb- hvb -rrb- , germany 's second biggest bank , for € 220 million -lrb- $ 283 million -rrb- . " pilsner goes nicely with pudding and pizza , " said ulrich kallmeyer , one of family-owned oetker 's top executives . brau und brunnen , which has brand names like jever , tucher and berliner pilsner under its roof , had a turnover of € 578 million in 2002 .
" we are happy to be able to sell at a good price , " a hvb spokesman said .
oetker also announced its intention of launching a takeover bid for the remaining brau und brunnen shares for a unit price of € 80 . germany 's beer market , europe 's largest , is the only one on the continent where such takeovers are still possible , according to experts . almost 1,300 breweries still exist in the country , the most fragmented market in europe .
together , they produce roughly as much beer as u.s. brewery giant anheuser-bush alone .
even oetker , which will now control about 15 percent of the german market , dwarfs in comparison to the makers of bud or sab miller , the second largest brewery in the world . foreigners get thirsty for german beer giants such as sab miller and anheuser have so far stayed away from german breweries , but other foreign competitors have begun to develop a thirst for german beer .
in the past four years , mergers and takeovers have begun to shake up the country 's brewery scene , which remains attractive despite a recent drop in consumption . last year , germans still gulped down an impressive 105 million hectoliters -lrb- 2.7 billion gallons -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgian interbrew now fills these steins at oktoberfest .

it 's the latest in a series of mergers in germany 's brewing industry . oetker has bought 62 percent stake in brau und brunnen from hypovereinsbank -lrb- hvb -rrb- , germany 's second biggest bank , for € 220 million -lrb- $ 283 million -rrb- . " pilsner goes nicely with pudding and pizza , " said ulrich kallmeyer , one of family-owned oetker 's top executives . brau und brunnen , which has brand names like jever , tucher and berliner pilsner under its roof , had a turnover of € 578 million in 2002 .
" we are happy to be able to sell at a good price , " a hvb spokesman said .
oetker also announced its intention of launching a takeover bid for the remaining brau und brunnen shares for a unit price of € 80 . germany 's beer market , europe 's largest , is the only one on the continent where such takeovers are still possible , according to experts . almost 1,300 breweries still exist in the country , the most fragmented market in europe .
together , they produce roughly as much beer as u.s. brewery giant anheuser-bush alone .
even oetker , which will now control about 15 percent of the german market , dwarfs in comparison to the makers of bud or sab miller , the second largest brewery in the world . foreigners get thirsty for german beer giants such as sab miller and anheuser have so far stayed away from german breweries , but other foreign competitors have begun to develop a thirst for german beer .
in the past four years , mergers and takeovers have begun to shake up the country 's brewery scene , which remains attractive despite a recent drop in consumption . last year , germans still gulped down an impressive 105 million hectoliters -lrb- 2.7 billion gallons -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgian interbrew now fills these steins at oktoberfest .
foreigners already control one-third of the market .
in 2001 , the trend began with a joint company created by dutch heineken and munich 's schörghuber group , which includes brands such as paulaner and kulmbacher . the belgian brewing giant interbrew took the top position in germany 's beer market after buying gilde group , beck 's brewery in bremen .
the belgians are also present at munich 's oktoberfest after buying löwenbräu and spaten last fall . in january , another international player entered the german beer market : danish carlberg group joined forced with germany 's largest family-owned brewery , bitburger , and bought holsten brewery for € 1 billion .
at the time , brau and brunnen 's ceo announced plans for a takeover in the coming weeks , but oetker stopped that idea short . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " gods ' food " is what dr. oetker calls its answer to jell-o .
brau und brunnen wo n't be oetker 's first venture into the brewing industry : the company already owns radeberger group , which includes beer brands such as dab and berliner kindl .
the combined company will control 15 percent of the market , according to experts . while the move might push oetker 's traditional food sector , which includes everything from baking powder to frozen pizzas , to third place within the company , its shipping business hamburg süd remains the top money-maker .
oetker also owns a bank , an insurance company , a chemical plant and several luxury hotels . henrik böhme -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the dark cloud over oktoberfest shortly before oktoberfest kicked off in munich this month , the begium-based brewing multinational interbrew acquired two of the annual festival ’ s most famous brews : spaten and franziskaner .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.02.2004 democrats abroad mobilize against bush through expat primaries großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last u.s. election saw george bush win partly due to large numbers of republican absentee ballots .
this year , democrats have swiftly mobilized members abroad to help determine the party 's presidential candidate . ron schlundt has a lot on his plate .
the chairman of german branch of democrats abroad - the international organization of the u.s. democratic party - has spent the past weeks compiling lists and counting votes .
as american voters turned out last sunday for primary elections in maine , expatriate americans living in germany held their own presidential straw polls in berlin , frankfurt and kaiserslautern organized by democrats abroad .
two days earlier , democrats in heidelberg and göttingen cast votes , which were followed on monday with the munich caucus , bavaria 's answer to the iowa caucus .
finally , at the end of february , the germany-wide caucus takes place .
the results will be sent to the international caucus in edinburgh this march . there , the combined tallies from countries around the world will determine which candidate the nine democrats abroad delegates will support at the democratic national convention in boston this july .
seven million americans live abroad the influence of democrats abroad sharply increased after president george w. bush 's razor-thing victory in 2000 with the help of republican absentee voters living overseas .
the democrats have since paid closer attention to their far-flung pool of potential voters .
indeed , close to seven million americans live outside the u.s. - considerably more than live in smaller u.s. states like maine , nebraska or nevada .
" these are all possible voters , who could be important if there 's a tight race , " explained schlundt .
by rallying the vote with groups like democrats abroad , the party leadership in washington is hoping to pull as many voters as it can come november .
bildunterschrift : wesley clark , john edwards , howard dean , john kerry according to schlundt , the results of the handful of straw polls being held in germany have largely mirrored those taking place back at home .
john kerry has been the clear victor -lrb- 55 percent -rrb- in regional straw polls across the country and howard dean has landed in a distant second place -lrb- 19 percent -rrb- . wesley clark and john edwards trailed even further , with 10 percent and 9 percent respectively .
but there are also key differences between american and german straw polls - especially when it comes to venues .
though u.s. events are held in public buildings or schools , in kaiserslautern the caucus was held in schmidt 's apartment .
the pool of potential american voters here is relatively small and is comprised of many soldiers and their families , expatriates here on business or even university students studying abroad .
" about 30 or 40 people came to my home , " schlundt said , adding with laugh , " in other words , it went very well . "
there was more congestion at straw polls in heidelberg and berlin , cities considered the biggest districts for the so-called " german democrats . "
in the capital city , the straw poll was held , appropriately , in an american diner , and at a restaurant in heidelberg .
close to 200 of the around 1,500 registered democrats in germany participated in the primary election poll .
procedural restrictions in the straw polling process create geographical barriers that make it hard for more people to participate .
" in a caucus , people ca n't submit an absentee ballot by mail .
that 's why all voters - even if they live in leipzig or cologne - have to submit their vote at one of the participating polling places , " schlundt said , explaining the overall turnout .
an air of change " but participation is 10 times greater than by the last elections , " said schlundt , who serves as a history professor at a satellite branch of the university of maryland in germany when he 's not organizing democratic caucuses .
the reason so many democrats are turning out to the polls , he said , is that " so many democrats are so opposed to bush that you do n't even have to mobilize them . "
that applies not only to germany , but also in close to 40 other countries where primaries have been held in recent days .
turnout everywhere has been greater than expected , according to the professor .
" the iraq war was probably the most important issue for our members , " said schlundt .
" the majority were against the war .
that 's why dean was popular for so long . "
but international policy is n't always at the top of the agenda for american democrats living in germany .
everyday problems are also important .
" in germany , we ca n't receive any retirement or public heath care or unemployment benefits from the united states , " he said before concluding : " but that 's hard to change . "
expat influence appears to be growing , however .
though the democrats abroad are a small organization , they still get the party 's ear in washington .
" we were able to speak to almost every candidate in washington - we had several of conference calls with them , and howard dean was a guest at our official dinner , " schlundt said . michael knigge -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european press review : can kerry beat bush ?

greek and turkish cypriot negotiators agreed to a u.n.-proposed plan to unify the divided island , ending days of marathon negotiations in new york . " we have achieved a resumption of talks under the auspices of the secretary-general , " greek cypriot leader tassos papadopoulos told reuters . the plan , pushed by u.n. secretary general kofi annan , calls for both sides of the island , divided since the turkish invasion in 1974 , to begin negotiating details of the unification on feb .
19 .
annan wanted both sides to reach a compromise before the greek cypriot side enters the european union on may 1 . the un secretary general apparently gave both sides an ultimatum in the early morning hours friday in new york city , telling them to either sign or reject his proposal . both sides say they still have a lot of work ahead of them . " we expect long and tiring work ahead of us , " turkish foreign ministry undersecretary ugur ziyal told reporters . working against the clock the compromise came as time was running out to resolve the decades-old conflict , which began when turkish troops invaded the north half of the island following a coup orchestrated by the greek dictatorship in athens . the southern , greek side of the island has enjoyed international recognition and flourished economically .
the northern side is recognized only by turkey and is populated mostly with turkish soldiers .
a buffer zone patrolled by un soldiers separates the two sides . over the years , the deadlock has frustrated top diplomats from europe and the united states .
most recently , turkish cypriot leader rauf denktash walked out of un-backed talks a year ago . but with the prospect of eu-entry in may , the current negotiations have taken on an added sense of urgency .
if the two sides fail to reach a reunification agreement before may 1 , then only the greek cypriot south will join the eu . after tacitly supporting the turkish cypriot leader for years , turkey is now urging denktash to compromise , fearing failed talks could harm turkey 's chances of joining the eu down the road . annan pressures both sides into referendums bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary-general kofi annan , center , shakes hands with greek cypriot president tassos papadopoulos , right , and rauf denktash , turkish cypriot leader , left .
according to the un plan , both sides will engage in intense talks guided by the un until march 26th , at which time remaining differences will be left to annan to resolve with the final plan submitted to both the turkish and greek cypriots in separate referendums on april 21st . according to the reuters news agency , the negotiations partly stalled due to disagreements over the extent of eu involvement in the upcoming negotiations .

schily squints into the new iris scan system .
forget passport controls and get ready for some eye contact next time you enter frankfurt airport .
that ’ s where german interior minister schily has kicked off the first high-tech biometric iris-scanning system . the future arrived at frankfurt airport this week with the introduction of a sophisticated digital camera at border controls capable of recognizing people by their irises .
considered the most accurate system in biometrics - the process of identifying people through their unique biological factors - the iris scanning technology is meant to both speed up conventional passport controls as well as enhance existing security procedures .
" biometrics doesn ’ t just make travelling safer , but also simpler , " german interior minister otto schily said as he launched the new technology on thursday .
the system is expected to cut long waiting lines at airports on account of its partly automated border controls .
the minister added the iris scan would initially be in place as a pilot project for six months .
it would help officials gather information about biometric procedures for their " border control routines " , he said , as well as help germany gain important insights for improving its domestic security .
the nuts and bolts as a first step , passengers first have to have their iris photographed .
for that they have to step up to a special high-resolution digital camera - fitted with an infrared imager to illuminate the eye even behind glasses or lens - for a picture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman has her iris scanned for computer recognition .
a computer will then process the digital images with the help of a software that will carefully map the iris in a spiral form working from the outside to the inside and record the unique spots and pigments .
that data will then be transferred onto the passenger ’ s machine-readable passport .
once they have their iris blueprint in the system , passengers in future will simply have to feed in their machine-readable passports , glance at the camera , and once the iris scan matches the passport data , the exit doors will automatically swing open .
the entire procedure is expected to last 20 seconds .
before submitting to the iris scan for the first time , passengers have to agree to a passport check by border guards and sign a data security document .
the offer is only meant for eu citizens aged 18 and above .
iris scan the most accurate experts believe the iris scan remains the most accurate biometric process , which involves automated identification of one ’ s identity using physiological clues such as scanning an iris or facial features , hand or fingerprint recognition or handwriting analysis , and matching that information with a database .
since iris patterns are extremely complex , with more than 200 unique spots , they are believed to be the most reliable distinguishing feature of a person and thus easy to capture and compare with a database .
experts say the iris scan is also superior to fingerprint-recognition systems .
that ’ s because greasy , dirty or peeling skin on the finger can easily distort fingerprint-recognition , a factor that plays no role in the case of iris-recognition .
furthermore , the iris doesn ’ t just betray the identity of the passenger , but can also tell much about his or her possible drug and alcohol consumption .
u.s. leads the way in biometric security biometrics , useful in fighting document and credit card fraud , first took off as a global industry after the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in new york and washington .
the u.s. has been the frontrunner , with washington believed to be spending $ 8 billion on biometric security , which involves checking biometric information against terrorist watch lists and police databases .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new sign at frankfurt airport informs passengers about the automated passport control .
in january , the u.s. introduced fingerprint recognition systems for incoming travelers requiring a visa and iris scans and facial-recognition systems are expected to follow .
the u.s. has also urged other countries to follow suit and upgrade security procedures .
new u.s. laws require all passports of visitors issued after october 26 , 2004 to carry biometric features if the traveler is to enter without a visa .
the european parliament is also considering measures to replace all traditional european passports by a new biometric version by 2005 .
in addition it ’ s mulling proposals to introduce biometric data on visas and residence permits of third country nationals residing in the eu as a means to counter illegal immigration .
concerns of data security however biometric technology has its share of critics .
it ’ s been slammed by human rights and civil liberties groups , who have complained that the storage of such information could be subject to abuse and could be used to record people 's movements .
experts have also questioned the efficiency of the technology and said it could leave millions of people vulnerable to a mistaken identity . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu eyes biometric passport plan some see compulsory fingerprinting as an invasion of civil rights and retinal scanning is thought by many to be the stuff of science fiction , but these measures and more may all be part of a new eu passport come 2005 .

schily squints into the new iris scan system .
forget passport controls and get ready for some eye contact next time you enter frankfurt airport .
that ’ s where german interior minister schily has kicked off the first high-tech biometric iris-scanning system . the future arrived at frankfurt airport this week with the introduction of a sophisticated digital camera at border controls capable of recognizing people by their irises .
considered the most accurate system in biometrics - the process of identifying people through their unique biological factors - the iris scanning technology is meant to both speed up conventional passport controls as well as enhance existing security procedures .
" biometrics doesn ’ t just make travelling safer , but also simpler , " german interior minister otto schily said as he launched the new technology on thursday .
the system is expected to cut long waiting lines at airports on account of its partly automated border controls .
the minister added the iris scan would initially be in place as a pilot project for six months .
it would help officials gather information about biometric procedures for their " border control routines " , he said , as well as help germany gain important insights for improving its domestic security .
the nuts and bolts as a first step , passengers first have to have their iris photographed .
for that they have to step up to a special high-resolution digital camera - fitted with an infrared imager to illuminate the eye even behind glasses or lens - for a picture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman has her iris scanned for computer recognition .
a computer will then process the digital images with the help of a software that will carefully map the iris in a spiral form working from the outside to the inside and record the unique spots and pigments .
that data will then be transferred onto the passenger ’ s machine-readable passport .
once they have their iris blueprint in the system , passengers in future will simply have to feed in their machine-readable passports , glance at the camera , and once the iris scan matches the passport data , the exit doors will automatically swing open .
the entire procedure is expected to last 20 seconds .
before submitting to the iris scan for the first time , passengers have to agree to a passport check by border guards and sign a data security document .
the offer is only meant for eu citizens aged 18 and above .
iris scan the most accurate experts believe the iris scan remains the most accurate biometric process , which involves automated identification of one ’ s identity using physiological clues such as scanning an iris or facial features , hand or fingerprint recognition or handwriting analysis , and matching that information with a database .
since iris patterns are extremely complex , with more than 200 unique spots , they are believed to be the most reliable distinguishing feature of a person and thus easy to capture and compare with a database .
experts say the iris scan is also superior to fingerprint-recognition systems .
that ’ s because greasy , dirty or peeling skin on the finger can easily distort fingerprint-recognition , a factor that plays no role in the case of iris-recognition .
furthermore , the iris doesn ’ t just betray the identity of the passenger , but can also tell much about his or her possible drug and alcohol consumption .
u.s. leads the way in biometric security biometrics , useful in fighting document and credit card fraud , first took off as a global industry after the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in new york and washington .
the u.s. has been the frontrunner , with washington believed to be spending $ 8 billion on biometric security , which involves checking biometric information against terrorist watch lists and police databases .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new sign at frankfurt airport informs passengers about the automated passport control .
in january , the u.s. introduced fingerprint recognition systems for incoming travelers requiring a visa and iris scans and facial-recognition systems are expected to follow .
the u.s. has also urged other countries to follow suit and upgrade security procedures .
new u.s. laws require all passports of visitors issued after october 26 , 2004 to carry biometric features if the traveler is to enter without a visa .
the european parliament is also considering measures to replace all traditional european passports by a new biometric version by 2005 .
in addition it ’ s mulling proposals to introduce biometric data on visas and residence permits of third country nationals residing in the eu as a means to counter illegal immigration .
concerns of data security however biometric technology has its share of critics .
it ’ s been slammed by human rights and civil liberties groups , who have complained that the storage of such information could be subject to abuse and could be used to record people 's movements .
experts have also questioned the efficiency of the technology and said it could leave millions of people vulnerable to a mistaken identity . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu eyes biometric passport plan some see compulsory fingerprinting as an invasion of civil rights and retinal scanning is thought by many to be the stuff of science fiction , but these measures and more may all be part of a new eu passport come 2005 .

german beer : worth a scientific look getting pickled in germany germany 's love affair with beer cools business -pipe- 13.02.2004 oetker gulps down brau und brunnen großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oetker 's ulrich kallmeyer , left , and brau und brunnen ceo michael hollmann .
germany 's largest food producer , oetker , announced friday it will take over brewer brau und brunnen , making the company germany 's top beer producer .
it 's the latest in a series of mergers in germany 's brewing industry . oetker has bought 62 percent stake in brau und brunnen from hypovereinsbank -lrb- hvb -rrb- , germany 's second biggest bank , for € 220 million -lrb- $ 283 million -rrb- . " pilsner goes nicely with pudding and pizza , " said ulrich kallmeyer , one of family-owned oetker 's top executives . brau und brunnen , which has brand names like jever , tucher and berliner pilsner under its roof , had a turnover of € 578 million in 2002 .
" we are happy to be able to sell at a good price , " a hvb spokesman said .
oetker also announced its intention of launching a takeover bid for the remaining brau und brunnen shares for a unit price of € 80 . germany 's beer market , europe 's largest , is the only one on the continent where such takeovers are still possible , according to experts . almost 1,300 breweries still exist in the country , the most fragmented market in europe .
together , they produce roughly as much beer as u.s. brewery giant anheuser-bush alone .
even oetker , which will now control about 15 percent of the german market , dwarfs in comparison to the makers of bud or sab miller , the second largest brewery in the world . foreigners get thirsty for german beer giants such as sab miller and anheuser have so far stayed away from german breweries , but other foreign competitors have begun to develop a thirst for german beer .
in the past four years , mergers and takeovers have begun to shake up the country 's brewery scene , which remains attractive despite a recent drop in consumption . last year , germans still gulped down an impressive 105 million hectoliters -lrb- 2.7 billion gallons -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgian interbrew now fills these steins at oktoberfest .

the belgians are also present at munich 's oktoberfest after buying löwenbräu and spaten last fall . in january , another international player entered the german beer market : danish carlberg group joined forced with germany 's largest family-owned brewery , bitburger , and bought holsten brewery for € 1 billion .

german beer : worth a scientific look getting pickled in germany germany 's love affair with beer cools business -pipe- 13.02.2004 oetker gulps down brau und brunnen großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oetker 's ulrich kallmeyer , left , and brau und brunnen ceo michael hollmann .
germany 's largest food producer , oetker , announced friday it will take over brewer brau und brunnen , making the company germany 's top beer producer .
it 's the latest in a series of mergers in germany 's brewing industry . oetker has bought 62 percent stake in brau und brunnen from hypovereinsbank -lrb- hvb -rrb- , germany 's second biggest bank , for € 220 million -lrb- $ 283 million -rrb- . " pilsner goes nicely with pudding and pizza , " said ulrich kallmeyer , one of family-owned oetker 's top executives . brau und brunnen , which has brand names like jever , tucher and berliner pilsner under its roof , had a turnover of € 578 million in 2002 .
" we are happy to be able to sell at a good price , " a hvb spokesman said .
oetker also announced its intention of launching a takeover bid for the remaining brau und brunnen shares for a unit price of € 80 . germany 's beer market , europe 's largest , is the only one on the continent where such takeovers are still possible , according to experts . almost 1,300 breweries still exist in the country , the most fragmented market in europe .
together , they produce roughly as much beer as u.s. brewery giant anheuser-bush alone .
even oetker , which will now control about 15 percent of the german market , dwarfs in comparison to the makers of bud or sab miller , the second largest brewery in the world . foreigners get thirsty for german beer giants such as sab miller and anheuser have so far stayed away from german breweries , but other foreign competitors have begun to develop a thirst for german beer .
in the past four years , mergers and takeovers have begun to shake up the country 's brewery scene , which remains attractive despite a recent drop in consumption . last year , germans still gulped down an impressive 105 million hectoliters -lrb- 2.7 billion gallons -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgian interbrew now fills these steins at oktoberfest .
foreigners already control one-third of the market .
in 2001 , the trend began with a joint company created by dutch heineken and munich 's schörghuber group , which includes brands such as paulaner and kulmbacher . the belgian brewing giant interbrew took the top position in germany 's beer market after buying gilde group , beck 's brewery in bremen .
the belgians are also present at munich 's oktoberfest after buying löwenbräu and spaten last fall . in january , another international player entered the german beer market : danish carlberg group joined forced with germany 's largest family-owned brewery , bitburger , and bought holsten brewery for € 1 billion .
at the time , brau and brunnen 's ceo announced plans for a takeover in the coming weeks , but oetker stopped that idea short . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " gods ' food " is what dr. oetker calls its answer to jell-o .

schily squints into the new iris scan system .
forget passport controls and get ready for some eye contact next time you enter frankfurt airport .
that ’ s where german interior minister schily has kicked off the first high-tech biometric iris-scanning system . the future arrived at frankfurt airport this week with the introduction of a sophisticated digital camera at border controls capable of recognizing people by their irises .
considered the most accurate system in biometrics - the process of identifying people through their unique biological factors - the iris scanning technology is meant to both speed up conventional passport controls as well as enhance existing security procedures .
" biometrics doesn ’ t just make travelling safer , but also simpler , " german interior minister otto schily said as he launched the new technology on thursday .
the system is expected to cut long waiting lines at airports on account of its partly automated border controls .
the minister added the iris scan would initially be in place as a pilot project for six months .
it would help officials gather information about biometric procedures for their " border control routines " , he said , as well as help germany gain important insights for improving its domestic security .
the nuts and bolts as a first step , passengers first have to have their iris photographed .
for that they have to step up to a special high-resolution digital camera - fitted with an infrared imager to illuminate the eye even behind glasses or lens - for a picture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman has her iris scanned for computer recognition .
a computer will then process the digital images with the help of a software that will carefully map the iris in a spiral form working from the outside to the inside and record the unique spots and pigments .
that data will then be transferred onto the passenger ’ s machine-readable passport .
once they have their iris blueprint in the system , passengers in future will simply have to feed in their machine-readable passports , glance at the camera , and once the iris scan matches the passport data , the exit doors will automatically swing open .
the entire procedure is expected to last 20 seconds .
before submitting to the iris scan for the first time , passengers have to agree to a passport check by border guards and sign a data security document .
the offer is only meant for eu citizens aged 18 and above .
iris scan the most accurate experts believe the iris scan remains the most accurate biometric process , which involves automated identification of one ’ s identity using physiological clues such as scanning an iris or facial features , hand or fingerprint recognition or handwriting analysis , and matching that information with a database .
since iris patterns are extremely complex , with more than 200 unique spots , they are believed to be the most reliable distinguishing feature of a person and thus easy to capture and compare with a database .
experts say the iris scan is also superior to fingerprint-recognition systems .
that ’ s because greasy , dirty or peeling skin on the finger can easily distort fingerprint-recognition , a factor that plays no role in the case of iris-recognition .
furthermore , the iris doesn ’ t just betray the identity of the passenger , but can also tell much about his or her possible drug and alcohol consumption .
u.s. leads the way in biometric security biometrics , useful in fighting document and credit card fraud , first took off as a global industry after the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in new york and washington .
the u.s. has been the frontrunner , with washington believed to be spending $ 8 billion on biometric security , which involves checking biometric information against terrorist watch lists and police databases .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new sign at frankfurt airport informs passengers about the automated passport control .
in january , the u.s. introduced fingerprint recognition systems for incoming travelers requiring a visa and iris scans and facial-recognition systems are expected to follow .
the u.s. has also urged other countries to follow suit and upgrade security procedures .
new u.s. laws require all passports of visitors issued after october 26 , 2004 to carry biometric features if the traveler is to enter without a visa .
the european parliament is also considering measures to replace all traditional european passports by a new biometric version by 2005 .
in addition it ’ s mulling proposals to introduce biometric data on visas and residence permits of third country nationals residing in the eu as a means to counter illegal immigration .
concerns of data security however biometric technology has its share of critics .
it ’ s been slammed by human rights and civil liberties groups , who have complained that the storage of such information could be subject to abuse and could be used to record people 's movements .
experts have also questioned the efficiency of the technology and said it could leave millions of people vulnerable to a mistaken identity . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu eyes biometric passport plan some see compulsory fingerprinting as an invasion of civil rights and retinal scanning is thought by many to be the stuff of science fiction , but these measures and more may all be part of a new eu passport come 2005 .

this year , democrats have swiftly mobilized members abroad to help determine the party 's presidential candidate . ron schlundt has a lot on his plate .
the chairman of german branch of democrats abroad - the international organization of the u.s. democratic party - has spent the past weeks compiling lists and counting votes .
as american voters turned out last sunday for primary elections in maine , expatriate americans living in germany held their own presidential straw polls in berlin , frankfurt and kaiserslautern organized by democrats abroad .
two days earlier , democrats in heidelberg and göttingen cast votes , which were followed on monday with the munich caucus , bavaria 's answer to the iowa caucus .
finally , at the end of february , the germany-wide caucus takes place .
the results will be sent to the international caucus in edinburgh this march . there , the combined tallies from countries around the world will determine which candidate the nine democrats abroad delegates will support at the democratic national convention in boston this july .
seven million americans live abroad the influence of democrats abroad sharply increased after president george w. bush 's razor-thing victory in 2000 with the help of republican absentee voters living overseas .
the democrats have since paid closer attention to their far-flung pool of potential voters .
indeed , close to seven million americans live outside the u.s. - considerably more than live in smaller u.s. states like maine , nebraska or nevada .
" these are all possible voters , who could be important if there 's a tight race , " explained schlundt .
by rallying the vote with groups like democrats abroad , the party leadership in washington is hoping to pull as many voters as it can come november .
bildunterschrift : wesley clark , john edwards , howard dean , john kerry according to schlundt , the results of the handful of straw polls being held in germany have largely mirrored those taking place back at home .
john kerry has been the clear victor -lrb- 55 percent -rrb- in regional straw polls across the country and howard dean has landed in a distant second place -lrb- 19 percent -rrb- . wesley clark and john edwards trailed even further , with 10 percent and 9 percent respectively .
but there are also key differences between american and german straw polls - especially when it comes to venues .
though u.s. events are held in public buildings or schools , in kaiserslautern the caucus was held in schmidt 's apartment .
the pool of potential american voters here is relatively small and is comprised of many soldiers and their families , expatriates here on business or even university students studying abroad .
" about 30 or 40 people came to my home , " schlundt said , adding with laugh , " in other words , it went very well . "
there was more congestion at straw polls in heidelberg and berlin , cities considered the biggest districts for the so-called " german democrats . "
in the capital city , the straw poll was held , appropriately , in an american diner , and at a restaurant in heidelberg .
close to 200 of the around 1,500 registered democrats in germany participated in the primary election poll .
procedural restrictions in the straw polling process create geographical barriers that make it hard for more people to participate .
" in a caucus , people ca n't submit an absentee ballot by mail .
that 's why all voters - even if they live in leipzig or cologne - have to submit their vote at one of the participating polling places , " schlundt said , explaining the overall turnout .
an air of change " but participation is 10 times greater than by the last elections , " said schlundt , who serves as a history professor at a satellite branch of the university of maryland in germany when he 's not organizing democratic caucuses .
the reason so many democrats are turning out to the polls , he said , is that " so many democrats are so opposed to bush that you do n't even have to mobilize them . "
that applies not only to germany , but also in close to 40 other countries where primaries have been held in recent days .
turnout everywhere has been greater than expected , according to the professor .
" the iraq war was probably the most important issue for our members , " said schlundt .
" the majority were against the war .
that 's why dean was popular for so long . "
but international policy is n't always at the top of the agenda for american democrats living in germany .
everyday problems are also important .
" in germany , we ca n't receive any retirement or public heath care or unemployment benefits from the united states , " he said before concluding : " but that 's hard to change . "
expat influence appears to be growing , however .
though the democrats abroad are a small organization , they still get the party 's ear in washington .
" we were able to speak to almost every candidate in washington - we had several of conference calls with them , and howard dean was a guest at our official dinner , " schlundt said . michael knigge -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european press review : can kerry beat bush ?
european papers on thursday focused on u.s. democratic presidential front-runner john kerry ’ s success on the campaign trail .
most warned kerry had his work cut out if he was to dislodge bush from the white house .

the results will be sent to the international caucus in edinburgh this march . there , the combined tallies from countries around the world will determine which candidate the nine democrats abroad delegates will support at the democratic national convention in boston this july .
seven million americans live abroad the influence of democrats abroad sharply increased after president george w. bush 's razor-thing victory in 2000 with the help of republican absentee voters living overseas .
the democrats have since paid closer attention to their far-flung pool of potential voters .
indeed , close to seven million americans live outside the u.s. - considerably more than live in smaller u.s. states like maine , nebraska or nevada .
" these are all possible voters , who could be important if there 's a tight race , " explained schlundt .
by rallying the vote with groups like democrats abroad , the party leadership in washington is hoping to pull as many voters as it can come november .
bildunterschrift : wesley clark , john edwards , howard dean , john kerry according to schlundt , the results of the handful of straw polls being held in germany have largely mirrored those taking place back at home .
john kerry has been the clear victor -lrb- 55 percent -rrb- in regional straw polls across the country and howard dean has landed in a distant second place -lrb- 19 percent -rrb- . wesley clark and john edwards trailed even further , with 10 percent and 9 percent respectively .
but there are also key differences between american and german straw polls - especially when it comes to venues .
though u.s. events are held in public buildings or schools , in kaiserslautern the caucus was held in schmidt 's apartment .
the pool of potential american voters here is relatively small and is comprised of many soldiers and their families , expatriates here on business or even university students studying abroad .
" about 30 or 40 people came to my home , " schlundt said , adding with laugh , " in other words , it went very well . "
there was more congestion at straw polls in heidelberg and berlin , cities considered the biggest districts for the so-called " german democrats . "
in the capital city , the straw poll was held , appropriately , in an american diner , and at a restaurant in heidelberg .
close to 200 of the around 1,500 registered democrats in germany participated in the primary election poll .
procedural restrictions in the straw polling process create geographical barriers that make it hard for more people to participate .
" in a caucus , people ca n't submit an absentee ballot by mail .
that 's why all voters - even if they live in leipzig or cologne - have to submit their vote at one of the participating polling places , " schlundt said , explaining the overall turnout .
an air of change " but participation is 10 times greater than by the last elections , " said schlundt , who serves as a history professor at a satellite branch of the university of maryland in germany when he 's not organizing democratic caucuses .
the reason so many democrats are turning out to the polls , he said , is that " so many democrats are so opposed to bush that you do n't even have to mobilize them . "
that applies not only to germany , but also in close to 40 other countries where primaries have been held in recent days .
turnout everywhere has been greater than expected , according to the professor .
" the iraq war was probably the most important issue for our members , " said schlundt .
" the majority were against the war .
that 's why dean was popular for so long . "
but international policy is n't always at the top of the agenda for american democrats living in germany .
everyday problems are also important .
" in germany , we ca n't receive any retirement or public heath care or unemployment benefits from the united states , " he said before concluding : " but that 's hard to change . "
expat influence appears to be growing , however .
though the democrats abroad are a small organization , they still get the party 's ear in washington .
" we were able to speak to almost every candidate in washington - we had several of conference calls with them , and howard dean was a guest at our official dinner , " schlundt said . michael knigge -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european press review : can kerry beat bush ?

german beer : worth a scientific look getting pickled in germany germany 's love affair with beer cools business -pipe- 13.02.2004 oetker gulps down brau und brunnen großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oetker 's ulrich kallmeyer , left , and brau und brunnen ceo michael hollmann .
germany 's largest food producer , oetker , announced friday it will take over brewer brau und brunnen , making the company germany 's top beer producer .
it 's the latest in a series of mergers in germany 's brewing industry . oetker has bought 62 percent stake in brau und brunnen from hypovereinsbank -lrb- hvb -rrb- , germany 's second biggest bank , for € 220 million -lrb- $ 283 million -rrb- . " pilsner goes nicely with pudding and pizza , " said ulrich kallmeyer , one of family-owned oetker 's top executives . brau und brunnen , which has brand names like jever , tucher and berliner pilsner under its roof , had a turnover of € 578 million in 2002 .
" we are happy to be able to sell at a good price , " a hvb spokesman said .
oetker also announced its intention of launching a takeover bid for the remaining brau und brunnen shares for a unit price of € 80 . germany 's beer market , europe 's largest , is the only one on the continent where such takeovers are still possible , according to experts . almost 1,300 breweries still exist in the country , the most fragmented market in europe .
together , they produce roughly as much beer as u.s. brewery giant anheuser-bush alone .
even oetker , which will now control about 15 percent of the german market , dwarfs in comparison to the makers of bud or sab miller , the second largest brewery in the world . foreigners get thirsty for german beer giants such as sab miller and anheuser have so far stayed away from german breweries , but other foreign competitors have begun to develop a thirst for german beer .
in the past four years , mergers and takeovers have begun to shake up the country 's brewery scene , which remains attractive despite a recent drop in consumption . last year , germans still gulped down an impressive 105 million hectoliters -lrb- 2.7 billion gallons -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgian interbrew now fills these steins at oktoberfest .
foreigners already control one-third of the market .
in 2001 , the trend began with a joint company created by dutch heineken and munich 's schörghuber group , which includes brands such as paulaner and kulmbacher . the belgian brewing giant interbrew took the top position in germany 's beer market after buying gilde group , beck 's brewery in bremen .
the belgians are also present at munich 's oktoberfest after buying löwenbräu and spaten last fall . in january , another international player entered the german beer market : danish carlberg group joined forced with germany 's largest family-owned brewery , bitburger , and bought holsten brewery for € 1 billion .
at the time , brau and brunnen 's ceo announced plans for a takeover in the coming weeks , but oetker stopped that idea short . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " gods ' food " is what dr. oetker calls its answer to jell-o .
brau und brunnen wo n't be oetker 's first venture into the brewing industry : the company already owns radeberger group , which includes beer brands such as dab and berliner kindl .
the combined company will control 15 percent of the market , according to experts . while the move might push oetker 's traditional food sector , which includes everything from baking powder to frozen pizzas , to third place within the company , its shipping business hamburg süd remains the top money-maker .

german chancellor gerhard schröder and british prime minister tony blair met in berlin on thursday ahead of a three-way summit with france next week .
they denied the formation of a leading " triumvirate " within the eu . days after hosting french president jacques chirac in the german capital , schröder 's talks with the british premier aimed to pave the way for the upcoming summit with all three leaders next wednesday . the purpose of the upcoming french-british-german meeting is to coordinate positions for the eu 's next summit , scheduled for march 25-26 in brussels .
the three leading countries of the european union are hoping to present a common front as the bloc prepares to expand to 25 members in may .

german beer : worth a scientific look getting pickled in germany germany 's love affair with beer cools business -pipe- 13.02.2004 oetker gulps down brau und brunnen großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oetker 's ulrich kallmeyer , left , and brau und brunnen ceo michael hollmann .
germany 's largest food producer , oetker , announced friday it will take over brewer brau und brunnen , making the company germany 's top beer producer .
it 's the latest in a series of mergers in germany 's brewing industry . oetker has bought 62 percent stake in brau und brunnen from hypovereinsbank -lrb- hvb -rrb- , germany 's second biggest bank , for € 220 million -lrb- $ 283 million -rrb- . " pilsner goes nicely with pudding and pizza , " said ulrich kallmeyer , one of family-owned oetker 's top executives . brau und brunnen , which has brand names like jever , tucher and berliner pilsner under its roof , had a turnover of € 578 million in 2002 .
" we are happy to be able to sell at a good price , " a hvb spokesman said .
oetker also announced its intention of launching a takeover bid for the remaining brau und brunnen shares for a unit price of € 80 . germany 's beer market , europe 's largest , is the only one on the continent where such takeovers are still possible , according to experts . almost 1,300 breweries still exist in the country , the most fragmented market in europe .
together , they produce roughly as much beer as u.s. brewery giant anheuser-bush alone .
even oetker , which will now control about 15 percent of the german market , dwarfs in comparison to the makers of bud or sab miller , the second largest brewery in the world . foreigners get thirsty for german beer giants such as sab miller and anheuser have so far stayed away from german breweries , but other foreign competitors have begun to develop a thirst for german beer .
in the past four years , mergers and takeovers have begun to shake up the country 's brewery scene , which remains attractive despite a recent drop in consumption . last year , germans still gulped down an impressive 105 million hectoliters -lrb- 2.7 billion gallons -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgian interbrew now fills these steins at oktoberfest .
foreigners already control one-third of the market .
in 2001 , the trend began with a joint company created by dutch heineken and munich 's schörghuber group , which includes brands such as paulaner and kulmbacher . the belgian brewing giant interbrew took the top position in germany 's beer market after buying gilde group , beck 's brewery in bremen .
the belgians are also present at munich 's oktoberfest after buying löwenbräu and spaten last fall . in january , another international player entered the german beer market : danish carlberg group joined forced with germany 's largest family-owned brewery , bitburger , and bought holsten brewery for € 1 billion .

greek and turkish cypriot negotiators agreed to a u.n.-proposed plan to unify the divided island , ending days of marathon negotiations in new york . " we have achieved a resumption of talks under the auspices of the secretary-general , " greek cypriot leader tassos papadopoulos told reuters . the plan , pushed by u.n. secretary general kofi annan , calls for both sides of the island , divided since the turkish invasion in 1974 , to begin negotiating details of the unification on feb .
19 .
annan wanted both sides to reach a compromise before the greek cypriot side enters the european union on may 1 . the un secretary general apparently gave both sides an ultimatum in the early morning hours friday in new york city , telling them to either sign or reject his proposal . both sides say they still have a lot of work ahead of them . " we expect long and tiring work ahead of us , " turkish foreign ministry undersecretary ugur ziyal told reporters . working against the clock the compromise came as time was running out to resolve the decades-old conflict , which began when turkish troops invaded the north half of the island following a coup orchestrated by the greek dictatorship in athens . the southern , greek side of the island has enjoyed international recognition and flourished economically .
the northern side is recognized only by turkey and is populated mostly with turkish soldiers .
a buffer zone patrolled by un soldiers separates the two sides . over the years , the deadlock has frustrated top diplomats from europe and the united states .
most recently , turkish cypriot leader rauf denktash walked out of un-backed talks a year ago . but with the prospect of eu-entry in may , the current negotiations have taken on an added sense of urgency .
if the two sides fail to reach a reunification agreement before may 1 , then only the greek cypriot south will join the eu . after tacitly supporting the turkish cypriot leader for years , turkey is now urging denktash to compromise , fearing failed talks could harm turkey 's chances of joining the eu down the road . annan pressures both sides into referendums bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary-general kofi annan , center , shakes hands with greek cypriot president tassos papadopoulos , right , and rauf denktash , turkish cypriot leader , left .
according to the un plan , both sides will engage in intense talks guided by the un until march 26th , at which time remaining differences will be left to annan to resolve with the final plan submitted to both the turkish and greek cypriots in separate referendums on april 21st . according to the reuters news agency , the negotiations partly stalled due to disagreements over the extent of eu involvement in the upcoming negotiations .
the greeks , it seems , would like eu experts from brussels to participate , while the turkish side is less enthusiastic about such a plan . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a divided cyprus makes the cut cyprus is one of the countries most ready to join the european union .

german chancellor gerhard schröder and british prime minister tony blair met in berlin on thursday ahead of a three-way summit with france next week .
they denied the formation of a leading " triumvirate " within the eu . days after hosting french president jacques chirac in the german capital , schröder 's talks with the british premier aimed to pave the way for the upcoming summit with all three leaders next wednesday . the purpose of the upcoming french-british-german meeting is to coordinate positions for the eu 's next summit , scheduled for march 25-26 in brussels .
the three leading countries of the european union are hoping to present a common front as the bloc prepares to expand to 25 members in may .
the eu draft constitution was derailed in december after poland and spain blocked attempts to bring voting rights more in line with each country 's population . besides pushing to get the eu constitution back on track , berlin and paris hope london will add its clout to efforts to cap the eu budget .
schröder and chirac this week said they were sticking with demands for a freeze on the eu budget until 2013 .

" i think it 's important that we try and work at these issues together and not exclude other countries , " he added . iraq rift healed the summit next week is also an attempt to show the rift caused by the war in iraq has been sealed .
whereas france and germany strongly opposed the u.s.-led campaign to oust saddam hussein , britain was america 's staunchest supporter . after talking with blair , schröder made clear divisions over the case for war were a thing of the past .
" we both believe it makes no sense to talk about history and discuss our different positions on the need for war , but instead both of us must help ensure that the process of democratization and reconstruction in iraq succeeds , " he said . topping the defense policy agenda will be u.s. proposals to get nato more involved in stabilizing iraq - which both france and germany are weary of - and the transatlantic alliance 's expanding role in peacekeeping in afghanistan . as a sign of the new three-way cooperation on defense matters , germany said on wednesday it would back anglo-french plans for a european rapid-reaction force that could be sent to flashpoints around the world .
the proposal calls for a force of 1,500 soldiers that could be deployed within 15 days . the eu already has plans to set up a 60,000-strong unit that could be ready for action within 60 days and nato wants to create a rapid-reaction force of 21,000 troops . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin , paris want eu constitution deal meeting near berlin on monday , german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac said they want an agreement on a new european union constitution before the end of the irish eu presidency in june .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.02.2004 democrats abroad mobilize against bush through expat primaries großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last u.s. election saw george bush win partly due to large numbers of republican absentee ballots .
this year , democrats have swiftly mobilized members abroad to help determine the party 's presidential candidate . ron schlundt has a lot on his plate .
the chairman of german branch of democrats abroad - the international organization of the u.s. democratic party - has spent the past weeks compiling lists and counting votes .
as american voters turned out last sunday for primary elections in maine , expatriate americans living in germany held their own presidential straw polls in berlin , frankfurt and kaiserslautern organized by democrats abroad .
two days earlier , democrats in heidelberg and göttingen cast votes , which were followed on monday with the munich caucus , bavaria 's answer to the iowa caucus .
finally , at the end of february , the germany-wide caucus takes place .
the results will be sent to the international caucus in edinburgh this march . there , the combined tallies from countries around the world will determine which candidate the nine democrats abroad delegates will support at the democratic national convention in boston this july .
seven million americans live abroad the influence of democrats abroad sharply increased after president george w. bush 's razor-thing victory in 2000 with the help of republican absentee voters living overseas .
the democrats have since paid closer attention to their far-flung pool of potential voters .
indeed , close to seven million americans live outside the u.s. - considerably more than live in smaller u.s. states like maine , nebraska or nevada .
" these are all possible voters , who could be important if there 's a tight race , " explained schlundt .
by rallying the vote with groups like democrats abroad , the party leadership in washington is hoping to pull as many voters as it can come november .
bildunterschrift : wesley clark , john edwards , howard dean , john kerry according to schlundt , the results of the handful of straw polls being held in germany have largely mirrored those taking place back at home .
john kerry has been the clear victor -lrb- 55 percent -rrb- in regional straw polls across the country and howard dean has landed in a distant second place -lrb- 19 percent -rrb- . wesley clark and john edwards trailed even further , with 10 percent and 9 percent respectively .
but there are also key differences between american and german straw polls - especially when it comes to venues .
though u.s. events are held in public buildings or schools , in kaiserslautern the caucus was held in schmidt 's apartment .
the pool of potential american voters here is relatively small and is comprised of many soldiers and their families , expatriates here on business or even university students studying abroad .
" about 30 or 40 people came to my home , " schlundt said , adding with laugh , " in other words , it went very well . "
there was more congestion at straw polls in heidelberg and berlin , cities considered the biggest districts for the so-called " german democrats . "
in the capital city , the straw poll was held , appropriately , in an american diner , and at a restaurant in heidelberg .
close to 200 of the around 1,500 registered democrats in germany participated in the primary election poll .
procedural restrictions in the straw polling process create geographical barriers that make it hard for more people to participate .
" in a caucus , people ca n't submit an absentee ballot by mail .
that 's why all voters - even if they live in leipzig or cologne - have to submit their vote at one of the participating polling places , " schlundt said , explaining the overall turnout .
an air of change " but participation is 10 times greater than by the last elections , " said schlundt , who serves as a history professor at a satellite branch of the university of maryland in germany when he 's not organizing democratic caucuses .
the reason so many democrats are turning out to the polls , he said , is that " so many democrats are so opposed to bush that you do n't even have to mobilize them . "
that applies not only to germany , but also in close to 40 other countries where primaries have been held in recent days .
turnout everywhere has been greater than expected , according to the professor .
" the iraq war was probably the most important issue for our members , " said schlundt .
" the majority were against the war .
that 's why dean was popular for so long . "
but international policy is n't always at the top of the agenda for american democrats living in germany .
everyday problems are also important .
" in germany , we ca n't receive any retirement or public heath care or unemployment benefits from the united states , " he said before concluding : " but that 's hard to change . "
expat influence appears to be growing , however .
though the democrats abroad are a small organization , they still get the party 's ear in washington .
" we were able to speak to almost every candidate in washington - we had several of conference calls with them , and howard dean was a guest at our official dinner , " schlundt said . michael knigge -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european press review : can kerry beat bush ?

the results will be sent to the international caucus in edinburgh this march . there , the combined tallies from countries around the world will determine which candidate the nine democrats abroad delegates will support at the democratic national convention in boston this july .
seven million americans live abroad the influence of democrats abroad sharply increased after president george w. bush 's razor-thing victory in 2000 with the help of republican absentee voters living overseas .
the democrats have since paid closer attention to their far-flung pool of potential voters .
indeed , close to seven million americans live outside the u.s. - considerably more than live in smaller u.s. states like maine , nebraska or nevada .
" these are all possible voters , who could be important if there 's a tight race , " explained schlundt .
by rallying the vote with groups like democrats abroad , the party leadership in washington is hoping to pull as many voters as it can come november .
bildunterschrift : wesley clark , john edwards , howard dean , john kerry according to schlundt , the results of the handful of straw polls being held in germany have largely mirrored those taking place back at home .
john kerry has been the clear victor -lrb- 55 percent -rrb- in regional straw polls across the country and howard dean has landed in a distant second place -lrb- 19 percent -rrb- . wesley clark and john edwards trailed even further , with 10 percent and 9 percent respectively .
but there are also key differences between american and german straw polls - especially when it comes to venues .
though u.s. events are held in public buildings or schools , in kaiserslautern the caucus was held in schmidt 's apartment .
the pool of potential american voters here is relatively small and is comprised of many soldiers and their families , expatriates here on business or even university students studying abroad .
" about 30 or 40 people came to my home , " schlundt said , adding with laugh , " in other words , it went very well . "
there was more congestion at straw polls in heidelberg and berlin , cities considered the biggest districts for the so-called " german democrats . "
in the capital city , the straw poll was held , appropriately , in an american diner , and at a restaurant in heidelberg .
close to 200 of the around 1,500 registered democrats in germany participated in the primary election poll .
procedural restrictions in the straw polling process create geographical barriers that make it hard for more people to participate .
" in a caucus , people ca n't submit an absentee ballot by mail .
that 's why all voters - even if they live in leipzig or cologne - have to submit their vote at one of the participating polling places , " schlundt said , explaining the overall turnout .
an air of change " but participation is 10 times greater than by the last elections , " said schlundt , who serves as a history professor at a satellite branch of the university of maryland in germany when he 's not organizing democratic caucuses .
the reason so many democrats are turning out to the polls , he said , is that " so many democrats are so opposed to bush that you do n't even have to mobilize them . "
that applies not only to germany , but also in close to 40 other countries where primaries have been held in recent days .
turnout everywhere has been greater than expected , according to the professor .
" the iraq war was probably the most important issue for our members , " said schlundt .
" the majority were against the war .
that 's why dean was popular for so long . "
but international policy is n't always at the top of the agenda for american democrats living in germany .
everyday problems are also important .
" in germany , we ca n't receive any retirement or public heath care or unemployment benefits from the united states , " he said before concluding : " but that 's hard to change . "
expat influence appears to be growing , however .
though the democrats abroad are a small organization , they still get the party 's ear in washington .
" we were able to speak to almost every candidate in washington - we had several of conference calls with them , and howard dean was a guest at our official dinner , " schlundt said . michael knigge -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european press review : can kerry beat bush ?

german chancellor gerhard schröder and british prime minister tony blair met in berlin on thursday ahead of a three-way summit with france next week .
they denied the formation of a leading " triumvirate " within the eu . days after hosting french president jacques chirac in the german capital , schröder 's talks with the british premier aimed to pave the way for the upcoming summit with all three leaders next wednesday . the purpose of the upcoming french-british-german meeting is to coordinate positions for the eu 's next summit , scheduled for march 25-26 in brussels .
the three leading countries of the european union are hoping to present a common front as the bloc prepares to expand to 25 members in may .
the eu draft constitution was derailed in december after poland and spain blocked attempts to bring voting rights more in line with each country 's population . besides pushing to get the eu constitution back on track , berlin and paris hope london will add its clout to efforts to cap the eu budget .
schröder and chirac this week said they were sticking with demands for a freeze on the eu budget until 2013 .
france , germany , britain , the netherlands , sweden and austria - all of which are net contributors to the eu , meaning they pay more in than they get back – made the budget freeze demand last december in an open letter . no eu triumvirate with such meetings becoming a regular occurance , many other eu countries , including italy and spain , have become increasingly suspicious of closer french-british-german cooperation , fearing the three countries will band together to impose their will on others . however , both schröder and blair , speaking after their meeting , said that such concerns were unfounded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " this is not about trying to create a directoire in europe at all , " said blair .
" i think it 's important that we try and work at these issues together and not exclude other countries , " he added . iraq rift healed the summit next week is also an attempt to show the rift caused by the war in iraq has been sealed .
whereas france and germany strongly opposed the u.s.-led campaign to oust saddam hussein , britain was america 's staunchest supporter . after talking with blair , schröder made clear divisions over the case for war were a thing of the past .
" we both believe it makes no sense to talk about history and discuss our different positions on the need for war , but instead both of us must help ensure that the process of democratization and reconstruction in iraq succeeds , " he said . topping the defense policy agenda will be u.s. proposals to get nato more involved in stabilizing iraq - which both france and germany are weary of - and the transatlantic alliance 's expanding role in peacekeeping in afghanistan . as a sign of the new three-way cooperation on defense matters , germany said on wednesday it would back anglo-french plans for a european rapid-reaction force that could be sent to flashpoints around the world .
the proposal calls for a force of 1,500 soldiers that could be deployed within 15 days . the eu already has plans to set up a 60,000-strong unit that could be ready for action within 60 days and nato wants to create a rapid-reaction force of 21,000 troops . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin , paris want eu constitution deal meeting near berlin on monday , german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac said they want an agreement on a new european union constitution before the end of the irish eu presidency in june .

they denied the formation of a leading " triumvirate " within the eu . days after hosting french president jacques chirac in the german capital , schröder 's talks with the british premier aimed to pave the way for the upcoming summit with all three leaders next wednesday . the purpose of the upcoming french-british-german meeting is to coordinate positions for the eu 's next summit , scheduled for march 25-26 in brussels .
the three leading countries of the european union are hoping to present a common front as the bloc prepares to expand to 25 members in may .
the eu draft constitution was derailed in december after poland and spain blocked attempts to bring voting rights more in line with each country 's population . besides pushing to get the eu constitution back on track , berlin and paris hope london will add its clout to efforts to cap the eu budget .
schröder and chirac this week said they were sticking with demands for a freeze on the eu budget until 2013 .
france , germany , britain , the netherlands , sweden and austria - all of which are net contributors to the eu , meaning they pay more in than they get back – made the budget freeze demand last december in an open letter . no eu triumvirate with such meetings becoming a regular occurance , many other eu countries , including italy and spain , have become increasingly suspicious of closer french-british-german cooperation , fearing the three countries will band together to impose their will on others . however , both schröder and blair , speaking after their meeting , said that such concerns were unfounded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " this is not about trying to create a directoire in europe at all , " said blair .
" i think it 's important that we try and work at these issues together and not exclude other countries , " he added . iraq rift healed the summit next week is also an attempt to show the rift caused by the war in iraq has been sealed .
whereas france and germany strongly opposed the u.s.-led campaign to oust saddam hussein , britain was america 's staunchest supporter . after talking with blair , schröder made clear divisions over the case for war were a thing of the past .
" we both believe it makes no sense to talk about history and discuss our different positions on the need for war , but instead both of us must help ensure that the process of democratization and reconstruction in iraq succeeds , " he said . topping the defense policy agenda will be u.s. proposals to get nato more involved in stabilizing iraq - which both france and germany are weary of - and the transatlantic alliance 's expanding role in peacekeeping in afghanistan . as a sign of the new three-way cooperation on defense matters , germany said on wednesday it would back anglo-french plans for a european rapid-reaction force that could be sent to flashpoints around the world .
the proposal calls for a force of 1,500 soldiers that could be deployed within 15 days . the eu already has plans to set up a 60,000-strong unit that could be ready for action within 60 days and nato wants to create a rapid-reaction force of 21,000 troops . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin , paris want eu constitution deal meeting near berlin on monday , german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac said they want an agreement on a new european union constitution before the end of the irish eu presidency in june .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.02.2004 democrats abroad mobilize against bush through expat primaries großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last u.s. election saw george bush win partly due to large numbers of republican absentee ballots .
this year , democrats have swiftly mobilized members abroad to help determine the party 's presidential candidate . ron schlundt has a lot on his plate .
the chairman of german branch of democrats abroad - the international organization of the u.s. democratic party - has spent the past weeks compiling lists and counting votes .
as american voters turned out last sunday for primary elections in maine , expatriate americans living in germany held their own presidential straw polls in berlin , frankfurt and kaiserslautern organized by democrats abroad .
two days earlier , democrats in heidelberg and göttingen cast votes , which were followed on monday with the munich caucus , bavaria 's answer to the iowa caucus .
finally , at the end of february , the germany-wide caucus takes place .
the results will be sent to the international caucus in edinburgh this march . there , the combined tallies from countries around the world will determine which candidate the nine democrats abroad delegates will support at the democratic national convention in boston this july .
seven million americans live abroad the influence of democrats abroad sharply increased after president george w. bush 's razor-thing victory in 2000 with the help of republican absentee voters living overseas .
the democrats have since paid closer attention to their far-flung pool of potential voters .
indeed , close to seven million americans live outside the u.s. - considerably more than live in smaller u.s. states like maine , nebraska or nevada .
" these are all possible voters , who could be important if there 's a tight race , " explained schlundt .
by rallying the vote with groups like democrats abroad , the party leadership in washington is hoping to pull as many voters as it can come november .
bildunterschrift : wesley clark , john edwards , howard dean , john kerry according to schlundt , the results of the handful of straw polls being held in germany have largely mirrored those taking place back at home .
john kerry has been the clear victor -lrb- 55 percent -rrb- in regional straw polls across the country and howard dean has landed in a distant second place -lrb- 19 percent -rrb- . wesley clark and john edwards trailed even further , with 10 percent and 9 percent respectively .
but there are also key differences between american and german straw polls - especially when it comes to venues .
though u.s. events are held in public buildings or schools , in kaiserslautern the caucus was held in schmidt 's apartment .
the pool of potential american voters here is relatively small and is comprised of many soldiers and their families , expatriates here on business or even university students studying abroad .
" about 30 or 40 people came to my home , " schlundt said , adding with laugh , " in other words , it went very well . "
there was more congestion at straw polls in heidelberg and berlin , cities considered the biggest districts for the so-called " german democrats . "
in the capital city , the straw poll was held , appropriately , in an american diner , and at a restaurant in heidelberg .
close to 200 of the around 1,500 registered democrats in germany participated in the primary election poll .
procedural restrictions in the straw polling process create geographical barriers that make it hard for more people to participate .
" in a caucus , people ca n't submit an absentee ballot by mail .
that 's why all voters - even if they live in leipzig or cologne - have to submit their vote at one of the participating polling places , " schlundt said , explaining the overall turnout .
an air of change " but participation is 10 times greater than by the last elections , " said schlundt , who serves as a history professor at a satellite branch of the university of maryland in germany when he 's not organizing democratic caucuses .
the reason so many democrats are turning out to the polls , he said , is that " so many democrats are so opposed to bush that you do n't even have to mobilize them . "
that applies not only to germany , but also in close to 40 other countries where primaries have been held in recent days .
turnout everywhere has been greater than expected , according to the professor .
" the iraq war was probably the most important issue for our members , " said schlundt .
" the majority were against the war .
that 's why dean was popular for so long . "
but international policy is n't always at the top of the agenda for american democrats living in germany .
everyday problems are also important .
" in germany , we ca n't receive any retirement or public heath care or unemployment benefits from the united states , " he said before concluding : " but that 's hard to change . "
expat influence appears to be growing , however .
though the democrats abroad are a small organization , they still get the party 's ear in washington .
" we were able to speak to almost every candidate in washington - we had several of conference calls with them , and howard dean was a guest at our official dinner , " schlundt said . michael knigge -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european press review : can kerry beat bush ?
european papers on thursday focused on u.s. democratic presidential front-runner john kerry ’ s success on the campaign trail .
most warned kerry had his work cut out if he was to dislodge bush from the white house .

schily squints into the new iris scan system .
forget passport controls and get ready for some eye contact next time you enter frankfurt airport .
that ’ s where german interior minister schily has kicked off the first high-tech biometric iris-scanning system . the future arrived at frankfurt airport this week with the introduction of a sophisticated digital camera at border controls capable of recognizing people by their irises .
considered the most accurate system in biometrics - the process of identifying people through their unique biological factors - the iris scanning technology is meant to both speed up conventional passport controls as well as enhance existing security procedures .
" biometrics doesn ’ t just make travelling safer , but also simpler , " german interior minister otto schily said as he launched the new technology on thursday .
the system is expected to cut long waiting lines at airports on account of its partly automated border controls .
the minister added the iris scan would initially be in place as a pilot project for six months .
it would help officials gather information about biometric procedures for their " border control routines " , he said , as well as help germany gain important insights for improving its domestic security .
the nuts and bolts as a first step , passengers first have to have their iris photographed .
for that they have to step up to a special high-resolution digital camera - fitted with an infrared imager to illuminate the eye even behind glasses or lens - for a picture .

schily squints into the new iris scan system .
forget passport controls and get ready for some eye contact next time you enter frankfurt airport .
that ’ s where german interior minister schily has kicked off the first high-tech biometric iris-scanning system . the future arrived at frankfurt airport this week with the introduction of a sophisticated digital camera at border controls capable of recognizing people by their irises .
considered the most accurate system in biometrics - the process of identifying people through their unique biological factors - the iris scanning technology is meant to both speed up conventional passport controls as well as enhance existing security procedures .
" biometrics doesn ’ t just make travelling safer , but also simpler , " german interior minister otto schily said as he launched the new technology on thursday .
the system is expected to cut long waiting lines at airports on account of its partly automated border controls .
the minister added the iris scan would initially be in place as a pilot project for six months .
it would help officials gather information about biometric procedures for their " border control routines " , he said , as well as help germany gain important insights for improving its domestic security .
the nuts and bolts as a first step , passengers first have to have their iris photographed .
for that they have to step up to a special high-resolution digital camera - fitted with an infrared imager to illuminate the eye even behind glasses or lens - for a picture .

schily squints into the new iris scan system .
forget passport controls and get ready for some eye contact next time you enter frankfurt airport .
that ’ s where german interior minister schily has kicked off the first high-tech biometric iris-scanning system . the future arrived at frankfurt airport this week with the introduction of a sophisticated digital camera at border controls capable of recognizing people by their irises .
considered the most accurate system in biometrics - the process of identifying people through their unique biological factors - the iris scanning technology is meant to both speed up conventional passport controls as well as enhance existing security procedures .
" biometrics doesn ’ t just make travelling safer , but also simpler , " german interior minister otto schily said as he launched the new technology on thursday .
the system is expected to cut long waiting lines at airports on account of its partly automated border controls .
the minister added the iris scan would initially be in place as a pilot project for six months .
it would help officials gather information about biometric procedures for their " border control routines " , he said , as well as help germany gain important insights for improving its domestic security .
the nuts and bolts as a first step , passengers first have to have their iris photographed .
for that they have to step up to a special high-resolution digital camera - fitted with an infrared imager to illuminate the eye even behind glasses or lens - for a picture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman has her iris scanned for computer recognition .
a computer will then process the digital images with the help of a software that will carefully map the iris in a spiral form working from the outside to the inside and record the unique spots and pigments .
that data will then be transferred onto the passenger ’ s machine-readable passport .
once they have their iris blueprint in the system , passengers in future will simply have to feed in their machine-readable passports , glance at the camera , and once the iris scan matches the passport data , the exit doors will automatically swing open .
the entire procedure is expected to last 20 seconds .
before submitting to the iris scan for the first time , passengers have to agree to a passport check by border guards and sign a data security document .
the offer is only meant for eu citizens aged 18 and above .
iris scan the most accurate experts believe the iris scan remains the most accurate biometric process , which involves automated identification of one ’ s identity using physiological clues such as scanning an iris or facial features , hand or fingerprint recognition or handwriting analysis , and matching that information with a database .
since iris patterns are extremely complex , with more than 200 unique spots , they are believed to be the most reliable distinguishing feature of a person and thus easy to capture and compare with a database .
experts say the iris scan is also superior to fingerprint-recognition systems .
that ’ s because greasy , dirty or peeling skin on the finger can easily distort fingerprint-recognition , a factor that plays no role in the case of iris-recognition .
furthermore , the iris doesn ’ t just betray the identity of the passenger , but can also tell much about his or her possible drug and alcohol consumption .
u.s. leads the way in biometric security biometrics , useful in fighting document and credit card fraud , first took off as a global industry after the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in new york and washington .
the u.s. has been the frontrunner , with washington believed to be spending $ 8 billion on biometric security , which involves checking biometric information against terrorist watch lists and police databases .

in january , the u.s. introduced fingerprint recognition systems for incoming travelers requiring a visa and iris scans and facial-recognition systems are expected to follow .
the u.s. has also urged other countries to follow suit and upgrade security procedures .
new u.s. laws require all passports of visitors issued after october 26 , 2004 to carry biometric features if the traveler is to enter without a visa .
the european parliament is also considering measures to replace all traditional european passports by a new biometric version by 2005 .
in addition it ’ s mulling proposals to introduce biometric data on visas and residence permits of third country nationals residing in the eu as a means to counter illegal immigration .
concerns of data security however biometric technology has its share of critics .
it ’ s been slammed by human rights and civil liberties groups , who have complained that the storage of such information could be subject to abuse and could be used to record people 's movements .
experts have also questioned the efficiency of the technology and said it could leave millions of people vulnerable to a mistaken identity . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu eyes biometric passport plan some see compulsory fingerprinting as an invasion of civil rights and retinal scanning is thought by many to be the stuff of science fiction , but these measures and more may all be part of a new eu passport come 2005 .

greek and turkish cypriot negotiators agreed to a u.n.-proposed plan to unify the divided island , ending days of marathon negotiations in new york . " we have achieved a resumption of talks under the auspices of the secretary-general , " greek cypriot leader tassos papadopoulos told reuters . the plan , pushed by u.n. secretary general kofi annan , calls for both sides of the island , divided since the turkish invasion in 1974 , to begin negotiating details of the unification on feb .
19 .
annan wanted both sides to reach a compromise before the greek cypriot side enters the european union on may 1 . the un secretary general apparently gave both sides an ultimatum in the early morning hours friday in new york city , telling them to either sign or reject his proposal . both sides say they still have a lot of work ahead of them . " we expect long and tiring work ahead of us , " turkish foreign ministry undersecretary ugur ziyal told reporters . working against the clock the compromise came as time was running out to resolve the decades-old conflict , which began when turkish troops invaded the north half of the island following a coup orchestrated by the greek dictatorship in athens . the southern , greek side of the island has enjoyed international recognition and flourished economically .

german beer : worth a scientific look getting pickled in germany germany 's love affair with beer cools business -pipe- 13.02.2004 oetker gulps down brau und brunnen großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oetker 's ulrich kallmeyer , left , and brau und brunnen ceo michael hollmann .
germany 's largest food producer , oetker , announced friday it will take over brewer brau und brunnen , making the company germany 's top beer producer .
it 's the latest in a series of mergers in germany 's brewing industry . oetker has bought 62 percent stake in brau und brunnen from hypovereinsbank -lrb- hvb -rrb- , germany 's second biggest bank , for € 220 million -lrb- $ 283 million -rrb- . " pilsner goes nicely with pudding and pizza , " said ulrich kallmeyer , one of family-owned oetker 's top executives . brau und brunnen , which has brand names like jever , tucher and berliner pilsner under its roof , had a turnover of € 578 million in 2002 .
" we are happy to be able to sell at a good price , " a hvb spokesman said .
oetker also announced its intention of launching a takeover bid for the remaining brau und brunnen shares for a unit price of € 80 . germany 's beer market , europe 's largest , is the only one on the continent where such takeovers are still possible , according to experts . almost 1,300 breweries still exist in the country , the most fragmented market in europe .
together , they produce roughly as much beer as u.s. brewery giant anheuser-bush alone .
even oetker , which will now control about 15 percent of the german market , dwarfs in comparison to the makers of bud or sab miller , the second largest brewery in the world . foreigners get thirsty for german beer giants such as sab miller and anheuser have so far stayed away from german breweries , but other foreign competitors have begun to develop a thirst for german beer .
in the past four years , mergers and takeovers have begun to shake up the country 's brewery scene , which remains attractive despite a recent drop in consumption . last year , germans still gulped down an impressive 105 million hectoliters -lrb- 2.7 billion gallons -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgian interbrew now fills these steins at oktoberfest .
foreigners already control one-third of the market .
in 2001 , the trend began with a joint company created by dutch heineken and munich 's schörghuber group , which includes brands such as paulaner and kulmbacher . the belgian brewing giant interbrew took the top position in germany 's beer market after buying gilde group , beck 's brewery in bremen .
the belgians are also present at munich 's oktoberfest after buying löwenbräu and spaten last fall . in january , another international player entered the german beer market : danish carlberg group joined forced with germany 's largest family-owned brewery , bitburger , and bought holsten brewery for € 1 billion .
at the time , brau and brunnen 's ceo announced plans for a takeover in the coming weeks , but oetker stopped that idea short . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " gods ' food " is what dr. oetker calls its answer to jell-o .
brau und brunnen wo n't be oetker 's first venture into the brewing industry : the company already owns radeberger group , which includes beer brands such as dab and berliner kindl .
the combined company will control 15 percent of the market , according to experts . while the move might push oetker 's traditional food sector , which includes everything from baking powder to frozen pizzas , to third place within the company , its shipping business hamburg süd remains the top money-maker .
oetker also owns a bank , an insurance company , a chemical plant and several luxury hotels . henrik böhme -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the dark cloud over oktoberfest shortly before oktoberfest kicked off in munich this month , the begium-based brewing multinational interbrew acquired two of the annual festival ’ s most famous brews : spaten and franziskaner .

as she embarks by bicycle on her voyage of discovery , berlin and beirut - two six-letter words , two cities with a common past - blend into one city .
both were destroyed in wars , divided into east and west , and rebuilt .
this is a thought-provoking , but humorous homage to two cities and to myrna maakaron 's old and new home countries . this year 's jury , producer maria köpf and directors hans-christian schmid and michael verhoeven , are also hosts for next year 's candidates .
after taking part in the berlinale talent campus , the promising young film talents have until april 2004 to hand in a concept for a short film relating to berlin . a jury will select three projects from among the applications .
the berlin-brandenburg film industry , a berlin production firm and up to € 70,000 in funding will help the young filmmakers realize their projects in the course of the year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.02.2004 democrats abroad mobilize against bush through expat primaries großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last u.s. election saw george bush win partly due to large numbers of republican absentee ballots .
this year , democrats have swiftly mobilized members abroad to help determine the party 's presidential candidate . ron schlundt has a lot on his plate .
the chairman of german branch of democrats abroad - the international organization of the u.s. democratic party - has spent the past weeks compiling lists and counting votes .
as american voters turned out last sunday for primary elections in maine , expatriate americans living in germany held their own presidential straw polls in berlin , frankfurt and kaiserslautern organized by democrats abroad .
two days earlier , democrats in heidelberg and göttingen cast votes , which were followed on monday with the munich caucus , bavaria 's answer to the iowa caucus .
finally , at the end of february , the germany-wide caucus takes place .
the results will be sent to the international caucus in edinburgh this march . there , the combined tallies from countries around the world will determine which candidate the nine democrats abroad delegates will support at the democratic national convention in boston this july .
seven million americans live abroad the influence of democrats abroad sharply increased after president george w. bush 's razor-thing victory in 2000 with the help of republican absentee voters living overseas .
the democrats have since paid closer attention to their far-flung pool of potential voters .
indeed , close to seven million americans live outside the u.s. - considerably more than live in smaller u.s. states like maine , nebraska or nevada .
" these are all possible voters , who could be important if there 's a tight race , " explained schlundt .
by rallying the vote with groups like democrats abroad , the party leadership in washington is hoping to pull as many voters as it can come november .
bildunterschrift : wesley clark , john edwards , howard dean , john kerry according to schlundt , the results of the handful of straw polls being held in germany have largely mirrored those taking place back at home .
john kerry has been the clear victor -lrb- 55 percent -rrb- in regional straw polls across the country and howard dean has landed in a distant second place -lrb- 19 percent -rrb- . wesley clark and john edwards trailed even further , with 10 percent and 9 percent respectively .
but there are also key differences between american and german straw polls - especially when it comes to venues .
though u.s. events are held in public buildings or schools , in kaiserslautern the caucus was held in schmidt 's apartment .
the pool of potential american voters here is relatively small and is comprised of many soldiers and their families , expatriates here on business or even university students studying abroad .
" about 30 or 40 people came to my home , " schlundt said , adding with laugh , " in other words , it went very well . "
there was more congestion at straw polls in heidelberg and berlin , cities considered the biggest districts for the so-called " german democrats . "
in the capital city , the straw poll was held , appropriately , in an american diner , and at a restaurant in heidelberg .
close to 200 of the around 1,500 registered democrats in germany participated in the primary election poll .
procedural restrictions in the straw polling process create geographical barriers that make it hard for more people to participate .
" in a caucus , people ca n't submit an absentee ballot by mail .
that 's why all voters - even if they live in leipzig or cologne - have to submit their vote at one of the participating polling places , " schlundt said , explaining the overall turnout .
an air of change " but participation is 10 times greater than by the last elections , " said schlundt , who serves as a history professor at a satellite branch of the university of maryland in germany when he 's not organizing democratic caucuses .
the reason so many democrats are turning out to the polls , he said , is that " so many democrats are so opposed to bush that you do n't even have to mobilize them . "
that applies not only to germany , but also in close to 40 other countries where primaries have been held in recent days .
turnout everywhere has been greater than expected , according to the professor .
" the iraq war was probably the most important issue for our members , " said schlundt .
" the majority were against the war .
that 's why dean was popular for so long . "
but international policy is n't always at the top of the agenda for american democrats living in germany .
everyday problems are also important .
" in germany , we ca n't receive any retirement or public heath care or unemployment benefits from the united states , " he said before concluding : " but that 's hard to change . "
expat influence appears to be growing , however .
though the democrats abroad are a small organization , they still get the party 's ear in washington .
" we were able to speak to almost every candidate in washington - we had several of conference calls with them , and howard dean was a guest at our official dinner , " schlundt said . michael knigge -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european press review : can kerry beat bush ?

this year , democrats have swiftly mobilized members abroad to help determine the party 's presidential candidate . ron schlundt has a lot on his plate .
the chairman of german branch of democrats abroad - the international organization of the u.s. democratic party - has spent the past weeks compiling lists and counting votes .
as american voters turned out last sunday for primary elections in maine , expatriate americans living in germany held their own presidential straw polls in berlin , frankfurt and kaiserslautern organized by democrats abroad .
two days earlier , democrats in heidelberg and göttingen cast votes , which were followed on monday with the munich caucus , bavaria 's answer to the iowa caucus .
finally , at the end of february , the germany-wide caucus takes place .
the results will be sent to the international caucus in edinburgh this march . there , the combined tallies from countries around the world will determine which candidate the nine democrats abroad delegates will support at the democratic national convention in boston this july .
seven million americans live abroad the influence of democrats abroad sharply increased after president george w. bush 's razor-thing victory in 2000 with the help of republican absentee voters living overseas .
the democrats have since paid closer attention to their far-flung pool of potential voters .
indeed , close to seven million americans live outside the u.s. - considerably more than live in smaller u.s. states like maine , nebraska or nevada .
" these are all possible voters , who could be important if there 's a tight race , " explained schlundt .
by rallying the vote with groups like democrats abroad , the party leadership in washington is hoping to pull as many voters as it can come november .
bildunterschrift : wesley clark , john edwards , howard dean , john kerry according to schlundt , the results of the handful of straw polls being held in germany have largely mirrored those taking place back at home .
john kerry has been the clear victor -lrb- 55 percent -rrb- in regional straw polls across the country and howard dean has landed in a distant second place -lrb- 19 percent -rrb- . wesley clark and john edwards trailed even further , with 10 percent and 9 percent respectively .
but there are also key differences between american and german straw polls - especially when it comes to venues .
though u.s. events are held in public buildings or schools , in kaiserslautern the caucus was held in schmidt 's apartment .
the pool of potential american voters here is relatively small and is comprised of many soldiers and their families , expatriates here on business or even university students studying abroad .
" about 30 or 40 people came to my home , " schlundt said , adding with laugh , " in other words , it went very well . "
there was more congestion at straw polls in heidelberg and berlin , cities considered the biggest districts for the so-called " german democrats . "
in the capital city , the straw poll was held , appropriately , in an american diner , and at a restaurant in heidelberg .
close to 200 of the around 1,500 registered democrats in germany participated in the primary election poll .
procedural restrictions in the straw polling process create geographical barriers that make it hard for more people to participate .
" in a caucus , people ca n't submit an absentee ballot by mail .
that 's why all voters - even if they live in leipzig or cologne - have to submit their vote at one of the participating polling places , " schlundt said , explaining the overall turnout .
an air of change " but participation is 10 times greater than by the last elections , " said schlundt , who serves as a history professor at a satellite branch of the university of maryland in germany when he 's not organizing democratic caucuses .
the reason so many democrats are turning out to the polls , he said , is that " so many democrats are so opposed to bush that you do n't even have to mobilize them . "
that applies not only to germany , but also in close to 40 other countries where primaries have been held in recent days .
turnout everywhere has been greater than expected , according to the professor .
" the iraq war was probably the most important issue for our members , " said schlundt .
" the majority were against the war .
that 's why dean was popular for so long . "
but international policy is n't always at the top of the agenda for american democrats living in germany .
everyday problems are also important .

schily squints into the new iris scan system .
forget passport controls and get ready for some eye contact next time you enter frankfurt airport .
that ’ s where german interior minister schily has kicked off the first high-tech biometric iris-scanning system . the future arrived at frankfurt airport this week with the introduction of a sophisticated digital camera at border controls capable of recognizing people by their irises .
considered the most accurate system in biometrics - the process of identifying people through their unique biological factors - the iris scanning technology is meant to both speed up conventional passport controls as well as enhance existing security procedures .
" biometrics doesn ’ t just make travelling safer , but also simpler , " german interior minister otto schily said as he launched the new technology on thursday .
the system is expected to cut long waiting lines at airports on account of its partly automated border controls .
the minister added the iris scan would initially be in place as a pilot project for six months .
it would help officials gather information about biometric procedures for their " border control routines " , he said , as well as help germany gain important insights for improving its domestic security .
the nuts and bolts as a first step , passengers first have to have their iris photographed .
for that they have to step up to a special high-resolution digital camera - fitted with an infrared imager to illuminate the eye even behind glasses or lens - for a picture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman has her iris scanned for computer recognition .
a computer will then process the digital images with the help of a software that will carefully map the iris in a spiral form working from the outside to the inside and record the unique spots and pigments .
that data will then be transferred onto the passenger ’ s machine-readable passport .
once they have their iris blueprint in the system , passengers in future will simply have to feed in their machine-readable passports , glance at the camera , and once the iris scan matches the passport data , the exit doors will automatically swing open .
the entire procedure is expected to last 20 seconds .
before submitting to the iris scan for the first time , passengers have to agree to a passport check by border guards and sign a data security document .
the offer is only meant for eu citizens aged 18 and above .
iris scan the most accurate experts believe the iris scan remains the most accurate biometric process , which involves automated identification of one ’ s identity using physiological clues such as scanning an iris or facial features , hand or fingerprint recognition or handwriting analysis , and matching that information with a database .
since iris patterns are extremely complex , with more than 200 unique spots , they are believed to be the most reliable distinguishing feature of a person and thus easy to capture and compare with a database .
experts say the iris scan is also superior to fingerprint-recognition systems .
that ’ s because greasy , dirty or peeling skin on the finger can easily distort fingerprint-recognition , a factor that plays no role in the case of iris-recognition .
furthermore , the iris doesn ’ t just betray the identity of the passenger , but can also tell much about his or her possible drug and alcohol consumption .
u.s. leads the way in biometric security biometrics , useful in fighting document and credit card fraud , first took off as a global industry after the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in new york and washington .
the u.s. has been the frontrunner , with washington believed to be spending $ 8 billion on biometric security , which involves checking biometric information against terrorist watch lists and police databases .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new sign at frankfurt airport informs passengers about the automated passport control .
in january , the u.s. introduced fingerprint recognition systems for incoming travelers requiring a visa and iris scans and facial-recognition systems are expected to follow .
the u.s. has also urged other countries to follow suit and upgrade security procedures .
new u.s. laws require all passports of visitors issued after october 26 , 2004 to carry biometric features if the traveler is to enter without a visa .
the european parliament is also considering measures to replace all traditional european passports by a new biometric version by 2005 .
in addition it ’ s mulling proposals to introduce biometric data on visas and residence permits of third country nationals residing in the eu as a means to counter illegal immigration .
concerns of data security however biometric technology has its share of critics .
it ’ s been slammed by human rights and civil liberties groups , who have complained that the storage of such information could be subject to abuse and could be used to record people 's movements .

schily squints into the new iris scan system .
forget passport controls and get ready for some eye contact next time you enter frankfurt airport .
that ’ s where german interior minister schily has kicked off the first high-tech biometric iris-scanning system . the future arrived at frankfurt airport this week with the introduction of a sophisticated digital camera at border controls capable of recognizing people by their irises .
considered the most accurate system in biometrics - the process of identifying people through their unique biological factors - the iris scanning technology is meant to both speed up conventional passport controls as well as enhance existing security procedures .
" biometrics doesn ’ t just make travelling safer , but also simpler , " german interior minister otto schily said as he launched the new technology on thursday .
the system is expected to cut long waiting lines at airports on account of its partly automated border controls .
the minister added the iris scan would initially be in place as a pilot project for six months .
it would help officials gather information about biometric procedures for their " border control routines " , he said , as well as help germany gain important insights for improving its domestic security .
the nuts and bolts as a first step , passengers first have to have their iris photographed .
for that they have to step up to a special high-resolution digital camera - fitted with an infrared imager to illuminate the eye even behind glasses or lens - for a picture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman has her iris scanned for computer recognition .
a computer will then process the digital images with the help of a software that will carefully map the iris in a spiral form working from the outside to the inside and record the unique spots and pigments .
that data will then be transferred onto the passenger ’ s machine-readable passport .
once they have their iris blueprint in the system , passengers in future will simply have to feed in their machine-readable passports , glance at the camera , and once the iris scan matches the passport data , the exit doors will automatically swing open .
the entire procedure is expected to last 20 seconds .
before submitting to the iris scan for the first time , passengers have to agree to a passport check by border guards and sign a data security document .
the offer is only meant for eu citizens aged 18 and above .

german beer : worth a scientific look getting pickled in germany germany 's love affair with beer cools business -pipe- 13.02.2004 oetker gulps down brau und brunnen großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oetker 's ulrich kallmeyer , left , and brau und brunnen ceo michael hollmann .
germany 's largest food producer , oetker , announced friday it will take over brewer brau und brunnen , making the company germany 's top beer producer .
it 's the latest in a series of mergers in germany 's brewing industry . oetker has bought 62 percent stake in brau und brunnen from hypovereinsbank -lrb- hvb -rrb- , germany 's second biggest bank , for € 220 million -lrb- $ 283 million -rrb- . " pilsner goes nicely with pudding and pizza , " said ulrich kallmeyer , one of family-owned oetker 's top executives . brau und brunnen , which has brand names like jever , tucher and berliner pilsner under its roof , had a turnover of € 578 million in 2002 .
" we are happy to be able to sell at a good price , " a hvb spokesman said .
oetker also announced its intention of launching a takeover bid for the remaining brau und brunnen shares for a unit price of € 80 . germany 's beer market , europe 's largest , is the only one on the continent where such takeovers are still possible , according to experts . almost 1,300 breweries still exist in the country , the most fragmented market in europe .
together , they produce roughly as much beer as u.s. brewery giant anheuser-bush alone .
even oetker , which will now control about 15 percent of the german market , dwarfs in comparison to the makers of bud or sab miller , the second largest brewery in the world . foreigners get thirsty for german beer giants such as sab miller and anheuser have so far stayed away from german breweries , but other foreign competitors have begun to develop a thirst for german beer .
in the past four years , mergers and takeovers have begun to shake up the country 's brewery scene , which remains attractive despite a recent drop in consumption . last year , germans still gulped down an impressive 105 million hectoliters -lrb- 2.7 billion gallons -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgian interbrew now fills these steins at oktoberfest .

in 2001 , the trend began with a joint company created by dutch heineken and munich 's schörghuber group , which includes brands such as paulaner and kulmbacher . the belgian brewing giant interbrew took the top position in germany 's beer market after buying gilde group , beck 's brewery in bremen .
the belgians are also present at munich 's oktoberfest after buying löwenbräu and spaten last fall . in january , another international player entered the german beer market : danish carlberg group joined forced with germany 's largest family-owned brewery , bitburger , and bought holsten brewery for € 1 billion .

the combined company will control 15 percent of the market , according to experts . while the move might push oetker 's traditional food sector , which includes everything from baking powder to frozen pizzas , to third place within the company , its shipping business hamburg süd remains the top money-maker .

germany 's largest food producer , oetker , announced friday it will take over brewer brau und brunnen , making the company germany 's top beer producer .
it 's the latest in a series of mergers in germany 's brewing industry . oetker has bought 62 percent stake in brau und brunnen from hypovereinsbank -lrb- hvb -rrb- , germany 's second biggest bank , for € 220 million -lrb- $ 283 million -rrb- . " pilsner goes nicely with pudding and pizza , " said ulrich kallmeyer , one of family-owned oetker 's top executives . brau und brunnen , which has brand names like jever , tucher and berliner pilsner under its roof , had a turnover of € 578 million in 2002 .
" we are happy to be able to sell at a good price , " a hvb spokesman said .
oetker also announced its intention of launching a takeover bid for the remaining brau und brunnen shares for a unit price of € 80 . germany 's beer market , europe 's largest , is the only one on the continent where such takeovers are still possible , according to experts . almost 1,300 breweries still exist in the country , the most fragmented market in europe .
together , they produce roughly as much beer as u.s. brewery giant anheuser-bush alone .
even oetker , which will now control about 15 percent of the german market , dwarfs in comparison to the makers of bud or sab miller , the second largest brewery in the world . foreigners get thirsty for german beer giants such as sab miller and anheuser have so far stayed away from german breweries , but other foreign competitors have begun to develop a thirst for german beer .
in the past four years , mergers and takeovers have begun to shake up the country 's brewery scene , which remains attractive despite a recent drop in consumption . last year , germans still gulped down an impressive 105 million hectoliters -lrb- 2.7 billion gallons -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgian interbrew now fills these steins at oktoberfest .

german chancellor gerhard schröder and british prime minister tony blair met in berlin on thursday ahead of a three-way summit with france next week .
they denied the formation of a leading " triumvirate " within the eu . days after hosting french president jacques chirac in the german capital , schröder 's talks with the british premier aimed to pave the way for the upcoming summit with all three leaders next wednesday . the purpose of the upcoming french-british-german meeting is to coordinate positions for the eu 's next summit , scheduled for march 25-26 in brussels .
the three leading countries of the european union are hoping to present a common front as the bloc prepares to expand to 25 members in may .
the eu draft constitution was derailed in december after poland and spain blocked attempts to bring voting rights more in line with each country 's population . besides pushing to get the eu constitution back on track , berlin and paris hope london will add its clout to efforts to cap the eu budget .
schröder and chirac this week said they were sticking with demands for a freeze on the eu budget until 2013 .
france , germany , britain , the netherlands , sweden and austria - all of which are net contributors to the eu , meaning they pay more in than they get back – made the budget freeze demand last december in an open letter . no eu triumvirate with such meetings becoming a regular occurance , many other eu countries , including italy and spain , have become increasingly suspicious of closer french-british-german cooperation , fearing the three countries will band together to impose their will on others . however , both schröder and blair , speaking after their meeting , said that such concerns were unfounded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " this is not about trying to create a directoire in europe at all , " said blair .
" i think it 's important that we try and work at these issues together and not exclude other countries , " he added . iraq rift healed the summit next week is also an attempt to show the rift caused by the war in iraq has been sealed .
whereas france and germany strongly opposed the u.s.-led campaign to oust saddam hussein , britain was america 's staunchest supporter . after talking with blair , schröder made clear divisions over the case for war were a thing of the past .
" we both believe it makes no sense to talk about history and discuss our different positions on the need for war , but instead both of us must help ensure that the process of democratization and reconstruction in iraq succeeds , " he said . topping the defense policy agenda will be u.s. proposals to get nato more involved in stabilizing iraq - which both france and germany are weary of - and the transatlantic alliance 's expanding role in peacekeeping in afghanistan . as a sign of the new three-way cooperation on defense matters , germany said on wednesday it would back anglo-french plans for a european rapid-reaction force that could be sent to flashpoints around the world .
the proposal calls for a force of 1,500 soldiers that could be deployed within 15 days . the eu already has plans to set up a 60,000-strong unit that could be ready for action within 60 days and nato wants to create a rapid-reaction force of 21,000 troops . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin , paris want eu constitution deal meeting near berlin on monday , german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac said they want an agreement on a new european union constitution before the end of the irish eu presidency in june .

schily squints into the new iris scan system .
forget passport controls and get ready for some eye contact next time you enter frankfurt airport .
that ’ s where german interior minister schily has kicked off the first high-tech biometric iris-scanning system . the future arrived at frankfurt airport this week with the introduction of a sophisticated digital camera at border controls capable of recognizing people by their irises .
considered the most accurate system in biometrics - the process of identifying people through their unique biological factors - the iris scanning technology is meant to both speed up conventional passport controls as well as enhance existing security procedures .
" biometrics doesn ’ t just make travelling safer , but also simpler , " german interior minister otto schily said as he launched the new technology on thursday .
the system is expected to cut long waiting lines at airports on account of its partly automated border controls .
the minister added the iris scan would initially be in place as a pilot project for six months .
it would help officials gather information about biometric procedures for their " border control routines " , he said , as well as help germany gain important insights for improving its domestic security .
the nuts and bolts as a first step , passengers first have to have their iris photographed .
for that they have to step up to a special high-resolution digital camera - fitted with an infrared imager to illuminate the eye even behind glasses or lens - for a picture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman has her iris scanned for computer recognition .
a computer will then process the digital images with the help of a software that will carefully map the iris in a spiral form working from the outside to the inside and record the unique spots and pigments .
that data will then be transferred onto the passenger ’ s machine-readable passport .
once they have their iris blueprint in the system , passengers in future will simply have to feed in their machine-readable passports , glance at the camera , and once the iris scan matches the passport data , the exit doors will automatically swing open .
the entire procedure is expected to last 20 seconds .
before submitting to the iris scan for the first time , passengers have to agree to a passport check by border guards and sign a data security document .

iris scan the most accurate experts believe the iris scan remains the most accurate biometric process , which involves automated identification of one ’ s identity using physiological clues such as scanning an iris or facial features , hand or fingerprint recognition or handwriting analysis , and matching that information with a database .
since iris patterns are extremely complex , with more than 200 unique spots , they are believed to be the most reliable distinguishing feature of a person and thus easy to capture and compare with a database .
experts say the iris scan is also superior to fingerprint-recognition systems .

schily squints into the new iris scan system .
forget passport controls and get ready for some eye contact next time you enter frankfurt airport .
that ’ s where german interior minister schily has kicked off the first high-tech biometric iris-scanning system . the future arrived at frankfurt airport this week with the introduction of a sophisticated digital camera at border controls capable of recognizing people by their irises .
considered the most accurate system in biometrics - the process of identifying people through their unique biological factors - the iris scanning technology is meant to both speed up conventional passport controls as well as enhance existing security procedures .
" biometrics doesn ’ t just make travelling safer , but also simpler , " german interior minister otto schily said as he launched the new technology on thursday .
the system is expected to cut long waiting lines at airports on account of its partly automated border controls .
the minister added the iris scan would initially be in place as a pilot project for six months .
it would help officials gather information about biometric procedures for their " border control routines " , he said , as well as help germany gain important insights for improving its domestic security .
the nuts and bolts as a first step , passengers first have to have their iris photographed .
for that they have to step up to a special high-resolution digital camera - fitted with an infrared imager to illuminate the eye even behind glasses or lens - for a picture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman has her iris scanned for computer recognition .
a computer will then process the digital images with the help of a software that will carefully map the iris in a spiral form working from the outside to the inside and record the unique spots and pigments .
that data will then be transferred onto the passenger ’ s machine-readable passport .
once they have their iris blueprint in the system , passengers in future will simply have to feed in their machine-readable passports , glance at the camera , and once the iris scan matches the passport data , the exit doors will automatically swing open .
the entire procedure is expected to last 20 seconds .
before submitting to the iris scan for the first time , passengers have to agree to a passport check by border guards and sign a data security document .
the offer is only meant for eu citizens aged 18 and above .

deputy environment minister allan wilson pledged to take action following a debate in the scottish parliament .
locals have reacted furiously to the proposals for the site at dalquhandy in lanarkshire .
socialist msp rosemary byrne called on the scottish executive to take urgent steps to ban the practice .
mr wilson insisted the recycling of fully-treated sewage by using it as a fertiliser on land was environmentally safe .
i will raise with my planning colleagues efforts to ensure community consultation allan wilson deputy environment minister but he vowed to lobby scottish executive colleagues to ensure planning rules were beefed up to make sure local people have their say on proposals for their area .
the minister said : " in terms of the planning process and the loopholes that have been identified i will raise with my planning colleagues efforts to ensure community consultation .
" i agree fundamentally that is the key to getting greater acceptance of the recycling effort that we have to put in . "
scottish coal has agreed a six-month trial with terra eco systems , a subsidiary of thames water , to plant treated sewage over a 37 hectare area on the 1,000 hectare site .
scottish coal and the executive have said the sewage would be in pellet form and would act as a fertiliser for the planting of willow trees .
transparency urged ms byrne said sewage spreading was already happening in other parts of the country .
she said planning permission was not needed and that local communities were kept in the dark .
" we must find a way to treat and dispose of our sewage that is environmentally friendly and poses no risk , " she said .
" but it must be done in a manner that is democratic and transparent .
" the communities of scotland can not and must not be used as a dumping ground . "
scottish coal also defended the scheme and said it would not have a detrimental effect on the environment .
a spokeswoman for the company said : " there are no health implications as a result of the proposal .
" the process has been approved by sepa -lrb- scottish environment protection agency -rrb- and they would not have backed it if they thought it was not safe .

the council tax bills are being set on thursday council tax bills in scotland are set to increase by an average of 4.4 % for the coming year .
most of the 32 local authorities met on thursday to decide on their charges for the next 12 months .
the individual increases ranged from under 2 % to almost 10 % at band d level .
the announcements came amid mounting calls for the reform or abolition of the system , which will be considered as part of a planned review of local government finance .
bbc news online scotland asked for your views on the council tax rise in your area and how it affects you .
we had a large response to this e-mail discussion and here is selection of your views .
this have your say is now closed .
whatever scheme was in place some groups of people would complain about it .
i live in glasgow and as far as i see we have the highest council tax in scotland , all be it the lowest increase .
so what do we get for this money ?
our bins and rubbish taken away , streets cleaned by an army of cleaners , the roads gritted within minuets of snow and ice , free and well maintained parks to enjoy , free museums and subsidised city parking and much more .
we get the elderly visited every day if need be , schools and nurseries upgraded , we get our water rates included ... what else do you want , if you want a western hip city someone -lrb- us -rrb- have to pay for it , or would you like to live in a slum as was many years ago .
stop moaning and pay up ...
glasgow 's worth it by far .
darren morris , glasgow i am really annoyed .
bought my first house in july and had a difficult six months so far .
anticipate the next six months to be just as hard .
i am loving living on my own , but it 's a real struggle to pay all the bills .
an increase in council tax is all i need ! ! !
morgan johnstone , edinburgh , scotland where were all you people when the scottish socialist party effectively destroyed any chance of the poll tax working ?
that was n't based on the price of your house , poor people got reduced charges and every single adult paid their share .
of course poll tax may well have risen at the same astronomical rates as council tax due to inept , unaccountable councils .
what you should worry more about is the differential between scotland and england averages .
in england the average is around £ 1,000 but that includes water and sewerage , you scots need to pay for water and sewerage on top -lrb- and it 's not like scotland is ever short of water ! -rrb- .
bob , uk to those advocating a return to the poll tax type of setup .
the last time it was in force my wife was unable to work yet she was expected to pay the full tax .
she had no income at all which meant both our taxes had to come out of our already stretched single wage .
the same thing is happening with the council tax .
it keeps climbing and services are being reduced yet councillors can jet all over the place for their little fact-finding missions .
they do n't need to increase this tax or even change it .
they just have to get council spending into line and stop wasting money on someone 's bright ideas .
hugh , dumbarton the big problem is that there 's no way that the level that councillors set the council tax affects them personally .
they can always vote to increase their own salaries and allowances to cover any increase that the rest of us have to pay .
the argument that they can always be booted out at the ballot box is a non-starter in so many councils where there is either near one-party rule or rule by cliques of " independents " where it does n't matter who you vote for a politician always gets in .
what about a simple system - for every percentage point over inflation that a council increases its council tax , the councillors lose a percentage point off their salaries and allowances , and vice versa .
it would clarify their minds wonderfully .
james , moray if pay rises are set at the rate of inflation then on what or whose authority does moray council have the right to raise our taxes by 9.8 % ?
gas , electric , fuel and other items have gone up but wages are not .
how do we afford this new rise ?
ian geddes , elgin councils should be made more accountable on how they spend tax payers ' money .
the only reason glasgow 's council tax has the lowest increase is because they made huge increases in the earlier years , but glaswegians are still paying the highest council tax in scotland .
i am now considering moving outside glasgow to save money .
britain , especially scotland , is becoming a tax state .
it wo n't be long before our salaries are taken at source and pocket money given to us .
john cairns , glasgow it is a disgrace when the area of scotland which is statistically has the lowest wages has the largest increase in council tax .
something is not right here !
helen ford , moray , scotland i work hard for what i have but another increase can not be justified especially since i see nothing for it .
all the talk about changing it to income based will just make things worse as i already pay enough tax .
so get the councils to get their houses in order first before you ask the public to pay any more and you never know we maybe due money back andrew , lanarkshire i 'm a civil servant and this year received a pay rise of £ 41.00 per month , after tax & national insurance contributions .
i am better off by £ 18.00 per month .
council tax is set to rise in my area , about 3.5 % although this is lower than the national average , it 's very worrying for me .
i 've still to take into account water and sewerage rises , rent and general cost of living rises .
after all this is paid i 'll be worse off ! !
it seems to be for the average person in britain , the harder you work the more your penalised .
as usual , the middle man always looses out !
lisa davies , motherwell , scotland i do n't know where the government think we can keep magically producing these above-inflation rises from our monthly salaries which are not even rising in line with inflation .
i 'd also like to know what we are paying for .
living in a rural community , i now have no post office and shop , non-existent transport links and every road out of the village has potholes requiring you to drive down the centre of the road to avoid constant damage to your car .
it seems to me that all my council tax is paying for at the moment is my bin emptied once a week .
something needs to be done to change the system , although i do think that a local income based tax will only serve to make the average family pay more .
what about all those people down south who are managing to pay £ 500,000 or more for houses ?
the old rateable value system seemed fairer to me .
michelle , east ayrshire surely it is time to do something about the regressive nature of our taxation system .
the poorest are paying more of their income proportionally for vat , income tax , national insurance and then the council tax comes as big whammy on top .
i think the time is becoming ripe for withholding the payments until they come up with something fairer .
sean , paisley , scotland it can hardly come as a surprise -lrb- because it was so widely predicted -rrb- that a soviet-style republic is emerging in scotland where the " rich " -lrb- those silly enough to work -rrb- are subject to persecution levels of council tax in order to finance the expanding leisure interests of the burgeoning welfare class .
ubi , aberdeen think it is terrible that the rates go up yet again , east dunbartonshire has the highest rate of payers and still they are increased .
very little has been done to merit the increase .
miss scott , kirkintilloch , east dunbartonshire perhaps if councils remembered that they work for us , the scottish voter , and did n't waste money on schemes which no-one wants or wo n't work , then perhaps the charges wo n't increase .
if edinburgh council can afford a £ 900,000 prize for the person who thinks up a slogan for edinburgh , or stopped wasting money by not taking trips abroad to evaluate how other tram systems work , then perhaps we would n't see suck a large increase .
craig , edinburgh i know councils rely more on government grant than council tax for their funding but they ca n't justify continually having increases two or three times the rate of inflation .
julie , dunfermline this is the perfect government indirect taxation under the guise of a local taxation .
it 's about time that this tax was collected at source based on income then the government would then have to take responsibility for this taxation .
jon , ballencrieff , east lothian i think that before council taxes are risen , the local authorities should sort out the shambolic collection system .
i 've been trying to sort out my council tax with glasgow city council for nearly a year .
every time i send an exemption form , it gets lost , and i was told that there is a six month backlog of correspondence .
thanks to them , i 'm getting threatening letters from bailiffs , when i should be exempt from the beginning .
alaina bell , glasgow , scotland the council tax is simply stupid , it does n't increase accountability , it 's not based on ability to pay and it 's far far far too high .
the scottish executive and all the councils seem to think that a 5 % increase is fine , well it 's not .
this is double inflation and it 's been that way for years .
could councils be more efficient ?
of course they could ! !
look at the example of that other useless public body - scottish water .
water charges are three times - that 's 300 % - higher than in england , and the scottish executive has just protected scottish water from competition - why ?
the customer culture , which is so strong in the private sector , simply does not exist in the public sector , and why should it , they will get paid no matter how bad they are .
it 's time for a change , a huge radical change .
do we actually need 32 councils in tiny scotland ?
in fact do we need any at all ?
ian , glasgow council tax is only part of the amount of money councils receive .
i would imagine one reason for the rise is that central government are not pumping more into councils .
ultimately the money comes from you , so take your pick is it your council or income tax you want to rise ?
rod , edinburgh as a council tax payer i think the consensus is that for every increase in council tax there is little improvement for the average householder to see .
as a council worker i see mismanagement of budgets and employees with little to do .
so in effect i feel there are other ways to increase the council revenue .
the councils should treat their organisations more like a business and pay heed to budgets and deadlines .
l fraser , edinburgh , scotland i would n't mind these increases if we actually saw any benefit from them in terms of service improvement .
however , commercial awareness , and indeed common sense , appears to be sadly lacking in many local authorities .
in edinburgh £ 70,000 has just been spent on a vehicle mounted laser device for detecting pot holes in the roads .
surely edinburgh city could have just asked their own staff to report pot holes as part of their responsibilities while carrying out other council business .
i 'm sure they would get results far more quickly , with wider coverage and at minimal cost .
dirk , edinburgh i think it is an absolute disgrace .
i am single and work very hard for what i have .
i am seriously thinking about moving out of glasgow as the council tax is now unaffordable .
aileen wilson , glasgow there would be no need for council tax rises if someone went and did a detailed analysis of where councils are wasting money , or spending money on things that are non essential , and identified what could be cut from their budgets .
dougie birrell , north queensferry , fife so much has been said about the unfairness of the current tax system , but there is very little coming forward in the way of alternatives .
how about the american purchase tax system , where there would be a national goods and service tax and a local tax added on top for the services .
this would ' tax ' the people who have more to spend and would also have the benefit of taking some income from tourists who use the services provided and paid for by the local inhabitants .
it would be good to hear some views on this .
i think scotland could well take a lead on this way to pay for our councils .
murray welsh , edinburgh i pay more than my fair share of tax , i have always worked - very hard !
i do that for me and my family - no-one else !
i 'm not a charity and i 'm hacked off at being treated like one .
there comes a point when there is no more to give .
i 'm there and i earn a good salary .
why should i and those like me always be the first port of call when the government needs more money .
because that 's exactly what happens when council tax is based on the value of your home .
they should be going back to basics and seeing where they can save money .
and i do n't mean by cutting services , i mean by being more efficient .
we have a government that is not accountable and a local government structure that is run by amateurs .
what hope really of improvements ?
we pay too much tax period .
savings are taxed , insurance is taxed , clothing is taxed , fuel is taxed , roads are taxed , entertainment is taxed , the roof over our heads is taxed , the list is quite frankly endless .
the point we are all missing is that the money that pays for all of these things has already been taxed !
denise ferguson , falkirk it goes up every year .
i do n't know how they can justify such a large increase .
my wages have n't changed for the last three years .
sean carr , aberdeen as a single parent who only receives help from the working families tax credit , it would be just another bill that mounts up .
it 's the principle .
maybe the government need to do more to help people as opposed to taking from them .
nicola dow , west lothian , scotland as usual the council tax increase is greater than inflation .
robert , glasgow the system requires a fundamental overhaul , the council should learn to cut its cloth to fit its suit .
kevin , west lothian i for one would like to know what my council tax is being spent on , and as to why it needs to go up .
after many months on complaining , my local council have still not fixed the dangerously crumbling wall or pavement outside my flat , supplied us with a replacement bin for the one stolen , nor fixed the large open hole by the road nearby .
what do we really get out of this ? !
martha , edinburgh , scotland as someone who works in local government i am increasing annoyed at the level of waste and the move away from core services to fund dubious events and initiatives .
as an edinburgh council tax payer i would prefer my council tax to pay for clean streets , improved public transport , investment in education and social services and not to waste on hogmanay street parties .
jane , edinburgh council tax up again , review on the way .
it 's a sham really .
the inefficiency and ineptitude of local councils would be funny if it were n't real .
that 's the heart of the matter , there 's no point changing the system until councils are brought up to scratch in efficiency terms , then we 'd see increases more in line with inflation .
i 'd vote for the introduction of a local tax based on ability to pay , not on the value of your property .
the poll tax was a fairer system , badly implemented .
the irony for me is that tommy sheridan , who was jailed over poll tax , is now campaigning for its return in a revised form .
neil mckinlay , falkirk , scotland my wife and i are both employed in the public sector .
our house has doubled in value in the past five years , however , our salaries have not - thus to base a tax on the value of your property seems inherently unfair .
there has been recent talk of rejigging the bands to take account of the housing market boom .
in 1998 we bought a house we could afford , in 2004 no honest building society would give us a mortgage to buy the same house at its current value .
property values are only pertinent at the time of purchase and over time do not give a true reflection of a person 's ability to pay .
gavin , glasgow i have always believed in paying for services received , but what i do n't believe in is paying for other people to use these services without paying .
why is n't there more pressure on people who do n't bother paying ?
these people are making the rest of us look like fools .
mind you , with people in authority bucking the system why should we care ?
mrs a walker , glasgow every year the tax increases by more than the inflation rates and the quality and amount of services are cut .
the increases affect everyone and the honest taxpayer has to cut his cloth etc . , whereas the council impose increases which everyone find increasingly difficult to pay .
with the house prices rising as they are , and the number of new houses being built especially in my area , you would expect the councils would be rubbing their hands from the extra revenue they must be collecting from these changes alone .
how are buyers encouraged to abide by the law and pay this tax , which it is based on rateable values , which the councils and government are soon to embark on a revaluation exercise which will increase the payments even more .
can we not relook at the " households " ability to pay , in line with the concept of the old poll tax .

the customer culture , which is so strong in the private sector , simply does not exist in the public sector , and why should it , they will get paid no matter how bad they are .
it 's time for a change , a huge radical change .
do we actually need 32 councils in tiny scotland ?
in fact do we need any at all ?
ian , glasgow council tax is only part of the amount of money councils receive .
i would imagine one reason for the rise is that central government are not pumping more into councils .
ultimately the money comes from you , so take your pick is it your council or income tax you want to rise ?
rod , edinburgh as a council tax payer i think the consensus is that for every increase in council tax there is little improvement for the average householder to see .
as a council worker i see mismanagement of budgets and employees with little to do .
so in effect i feel there are other ways to increase the council revenue .
the councils should treat their organisations more like a business and pay heed to budgets and deadlines .
l fraser , edinburgh , scotland i would n't mind these increases if we actually saw any benefit from them in terms of service improvement .
however , commercial awareness , and indeed common sense , appears to be sadly lacking in many local authorities .
in edinburgh £ 70,000 has just been spent on a vehicle mounted laser device for detecting pot holes in the roads .
surely edinburgh city could have just asked their own staff to report pot holes as part of their responsibilities while carrying out other council business .
i 'm sure they would get results far more quickly , with wider coverage and at minimal cost .
dirk , edinburgh i think it is an absolute disgrace .
i am single and work very hard for what i have .
i am seriously thinking about moving out of glasgow as the council tax is now unaffordable .
aileen wilson , glasgow there would be no need for council tax rises if someone went and did a detailed analysis of where councils are wasting money , or spending money on things that are non essential , and identified what could be cut from their budgets .
dougie birrell , north queensferry , fife so much has been said about the unfairness of the current tax system , but there is very little coming forward in the way of alternatives .
how about the american purchase tax system , where there would be a national goods and service tax and a local tax added on top for the services .
this would ' tax ' the people who have more to spend and would also have the benefit of taking some income from tourists who use the services provided and paid for by the local inhabitants .
it would be good to hear some views on this .
i think scotland could well take a lead on this way to pay for our councils .
murray welsh , edinburgh i pay more than my fair share of tax , i have always worked - very hard !
i do that for me and my family - no-one else !
i 'm not a charity and i 'm hacked off at being treated like one .
there comes a point when there is no more to give .
i 'm there and i earn a good salary .
why should i and those like me always be the first port of call when the government needs more money .
because that 's exactly what happens when council tax is based on the value of your home .
they should be going back to basics and seeing where they can save money .
and i do n't mean by cutting services , i mean by being more efficient .
we have a government that is not accountable and a local government structure that is run by amateurs .
what hope really of improvements ?
we pay too much tax period .
savings are taxed , insurance is taxed , clothing is taxed , fuel is taxed , roads are taxed , entertainment is taxed , the roof over our heads is taxed , the list is quite frankly endless .
the point we are all missing is that the money that pays for all of these things has already been taxed !
denise ferguson , falkirk it goes up every year .
i do n't know how they can justify such a large increase .
my wages have n't changed for the last three years .
sean carr , aberdeen as a single parent who only receives help from the working families tax credit , it would be just another bill that mounts up .
it 's the principle .
maybe the government need to do more to help people as opposed to taking from them .
nicola dow , west lothian , scotland as usual the council tax increase is greater than inflation .
robert , glasgow the system requires a fundamental overhaul , the council should learn to cut its cloth to fit its suit .
kevin , west lothian i for one would like to know what my council tax is being spent on , and as to why it needs to go up .
after many months on complaining , my local council have still not fixed the dangerously crumbling wall or pavement outside my flat , supplied us with a replacement bin for the one stolen , nor fixed the large open hole by the road nearby .
what do we really get out of this ? !
martha , edinburgh , scotland as someone who works in local government i am increasing annoyed at the level of waste and the move away from core services to fund dubious events and initiatives .
as an edinburgh council tax payer i would prefer my council tax to pay for clean streets , improved public transport , investment in education and social services and not to waste on hogmanay street parties .
jane , edinburgh council tax up again , review on the way .
it 's a sham really .
the inefficiency and ineptitude of local councils would be funny if it were n't real .
that 's the heart of the matter , there 's no point changing the system until councils are brought up to scratch in efficiency terms , then we 'd see increases more in line with inflation .
i 'd vote for the introduction of a local tax based on ability to pay , not on the value of your property .
the poll tax was a fairer system , badly implemented .
the irony for me is that tommy sheridan , who was jailed over poll tax , is now campaigning for its return in a revised form .
neil mckinlay , falkirk , scotland my wife and i are both employed in the public sector .
our house has doubled in value in the past five years , however , our salaries have not - thus to base a tax on the value of your property seems inherently unfair .
there has been recent talk of rejigging the bands to take account of the housing market boom .
in 1998 we bought a house we could afford , in 2004 no honest building society would give us a mortgage to buy the same house at its current value .
property values are only pertinent at the time of purchase and over time do not give a true reflection of a person 's ability to pay .
gavin , glasgow i have always believed in paying for services received , but what i do n't believe in is paying for other people to use these services without paying .
why is n't there more pressure on people who do n't bother paying ?
these people are making the rest of us look like fools .
mind you , with people in authority bucking the system why should we care ?
mrs a walker , glasgow every year the tax increases by more than the inflation rates and the quality and amount of services are cut .
the increases affect everyone and the honest taxpayer has to cut his cloth etc . , whereas the council impose increases which everyone find increasingly difficult to pay .
with the house prices rising as they are , and the number of new houses being built especially in my area , you would expect the councils would be rubbing their hands from the extra revenue they must be collecting from these changes alone .
how are buyers encouraged to abide by the law and pay this tax , which it is based on rateable values , which the councils and government are soon to embark on a revaluation exercise which will increase the payments even more .
can we not relook at the " households " ability to pay , in line with the concept of the old poll tax .

the council tax bills are being set on thursday council tax bills in scotland are set to increase by an average of 4.4 % for the coming year .
most of the 32 local authorities met on thursday to decide on their charges for the next 12 months .
the individual increases ranged from under 2 % to almost 10 % at band d level .
the announcements came amid mounting calls for the reform or abolition of the system , which will be considered as part of a planned review of local government finance .
bbc news online scotland asked for your views on the council tax rise in your area and how it affects you .
we had a large response to this e-mail discussion and here is selection of your views .
this have your say is now closed .
whatever scheme was in place some groups of people would complain about it .
i live in glasgow and as far as i see we have the highest council tax in scotland , all be it the lowest increase .
so what do we get for this money ?
our bins and rubbish taken away , streets cleaned by an army of cleaners , the roads gritted within minuets of snow and ice , free and well maintained parks to enjoy , free museums and subsidised city parking and much more .
we get the elderly visited every day if need be , schools and nurseries upgraded , we get our water rates included ... what else do you want , if you want a western hip city someone -lrb- us -rrb- have to pay for it , or would you like to live in a slum as was many years ago .
stop moaning and pay up ...
glasgow 's worth it by far .
darren morris , glasgow i am really annoyed .
bought my first house in july and had a difficult six months so far .
anticipate the next six months to be just as hard .
i am loving living on my own , but it 's a real struggle to pay all the bills .
an increase in council tax is all i need ! ! !
morgan johnstone , edinburgh , scotland where were all you people when the scottish socialist party effectively destroyed any chance of the poll tax working ?
that was n't based on the price of your house , poor people got reduced charges and every single adult paid their share .
of course poll tax may well have risen at the same astronomical rates as council tax due to inept , unaccountable councils .
what you should worry more about is the differential between scotland and england averages .
in england the average is around £ 1,000 but that includes water and sewerage , you scots need to pay for water and sewerage on top -lrb- and it 's not like scotland is ever short of water ! -rrb- .
bob , uk to those advocating a return to the poll tax type of setup .
the last time it was in force my wife was unable to work yet she was expected to pay the full tax .
she had no income at all which meant both our taxes had to come out of our already stretched single wage .
the same thing is happening with the council tax .
it keeps climbing and services are being reduced yet councillors can jet all over the place for their little fact-finding missions .
they do n't need to increase this tax or even change it .
they just have to get council spending into line and stop wasting money on someone 's bright ideas .
hugh , dumbarton the big problem is that there 's no way that the level that councillors set the council tax affects them personally .
they can always vote to increase their own salaries and allowances to cover any increase that the rest of us have to pay .
the argument that they can always be booted out at the ballot box is a non-starter in so many councils where there is either near one-party rule or rule by cliques of " independents " where it does n't matter who you vote for a politician always gets in .
what about a simple system - for every percentage point over inflation that a council increases its council tax , the councillors lose a percentage point off their salaries and allowances , and vice versa .
it would clarify their minds wonderfully .
james , moray if pay rises are set at the rate of inflation then on what or whose authority does moray council have the right to raise our taxes by 9.8 % ?
gas , electric , fuel and other items have gone up but wages are not .
how do we afford this new rise ?
ian geddes , elgin councils should be made more accountable on how they spend tax payers ' money .
the only reason glasgow 's council tax has the lowest increase is because they made huge increases in the earlier years , but glaswegians are still paying the highest council tax in scotland .
i am now considering moving outside glasgow to save money .
britain , especially scotland , is becoming a tax state .
it wo n't be long before our salaries are taken at source and pocket money given to us .
john cairns , glasgow it is a disgrace when the area of scotland which is statistically has the lowest wages has the largest increase in council tax .
something is not right here !
helen ford , moray , scotland i work hard for what i have but another increase can not be justified especially since i see nothing for it .
all the talk about changing it to income based will just make things worse as i already pay enough tax .
so get the councils to get their houses in order first before you ask the public to pay any more and you never know we maybe due money back andrew , lanarkshire i 'm a civil servant and this year received a pay rise of £ 41.00 per month , after tax & national insurance contributions .
i am better off by £ 18.00 per month .
council tax is set to rise in my area , about 3.5 % although this is lower than the national average , it 's very worrying for me .
i 've still to take into account water and sewerage rises , rent and general cost of living rises .
after all this is paid i 'll be worse off ! !
it seems to be for the average person in britain , the harder you work the more your penalised .
as usual , the middle man always looses out !
lisa davies , motherwell , scotland i do n't know where the government think we can keep magically producing these above-inflation rises from our monthly salaries which are not even rising in line with inflation .
i 'd also like to know what we are paying for .
living in a rural community , i now have no post office and shop , non-existent transport links and every road out of the village has potholes requiring you to drive down the centre of the road to avoid constant damage to your car .
it seems to me that all my council tax is paying for at the moment is my bin emptied once a week .
something needs to be done to change the system , although i do think that a local income based tax will only serve to make the average family pay more .
what about all those people down south who are managing to pay £ 500,000 or more for houses ?
the old rateable value system seemed fairer to me .
michelle , east ayrshire surely it is time to do something about the regressive nature of our taxation system .
the poorest are paying more of their income proportionally for vat , income tax , national insurance and then the council tax comes as big whammy on top .
i think the time is becoming ripe for withholding the payments until they come up with something fairer .
sean , paisley , scotland it can hardly come as a surprise -lrb- because it was so widely predicted -rrb- that a soviet-style republic is emerging in scotland where the " rich " -lrb- those silly enough to work -rrb- are subject to persecution levels of council tax in order to finance the expanding leisure interests of the burgeoning welfare class .
ubi , aberdeen think it is terrible that the rates go up yet again , east dunbartonshire has the highest rate of payers and still they are increased .
very little has been done to merit the increase .
miss scott , kirkintilloch , east dunbartonshire perhaps if councils remembered that they work for us , the scottish voter , and did n't waste money on schemes which no-one wants or wo n't work , then perhaps the charges wo n't increase .
if edinburgh council can afford a £ 900,000 prize for the person who thinks up a slogan for edinburgh , or stopped wasting money by not taking trips abroad to evaluate how other tram systems work , then perhaps we would n't see suck a large increase .
craig , edinburgh i know councils rely more on government grant than council tax for their funding but they ca n't justify continually having increases two or three times the rate of inflation .
julie , dunfermline this is the perfect government indirect taxation under the guise of a local taxation .
it 's about time that this tax was collected at source based on income then the government would then have to take responsibility for this taxation .
jon , ballencrieff , east lothian i think that before council taxes are risen , the local authorities should sort out the shambolic collection system .
i 've been trying to sort out my council tax with glasgow city council for nearly a year .
every time i send an exemption form , it gets lost , and i was told that there is a six month backlog of correspondence .
thanks to them , i 'm getting threatening letters from bailiffs , when i should be exempt from the beginning .
alaina bell , glasgow , scotland the council tax is simply stupid , it does n't increase accountability , it 's not based on ability to pay and it 's far far far too high .
the scottish executive and all the councils seem to think that a 5 % increase is fine , well it 's not .
this is double inflation and it 's been that way for years .
could councils be more efficient ?
of course they could ! !
look at the example of that other useless public body - scottish water .
water charges are three times - that 's 300 % - higher than in england , and the scottish executive has just protected scottish water from competition - why ?
the customer culture , which is so strong in the private sector , simply does not exist in the public sector , and why should it , they will get paid no matter how bad they are .
it 's time for a change , a huge radical change .

i 've still to take into account water and sewerage rises , rent and general cost of living rises .
after all this is paid i 'll be worse off ! !
it seems to be for the average person in britain , the harder you work the more your penalised .
as usual , the middle man always looses out !
lisa davies , motherwell , scotland i do n't know where the government think we can keep magically producing these above-inflation rises from our monthly salaries which are not even rising in line with inflation .
i 'd also like to know what we are paying for .
living in a rural community , i now have no post office and shop , non-existent transport links and every road out of the village has potholes requiring you to drive down the centre of the road to avoid constant damage to your car .
it seems to me that all my council tax is paying for at the moment is my bin emptied once a week .
something needs to be done to change the system , although i do think that a local income based tax will only serve to make the average family pay more .
what about all those people down south who are managing to pay £ 500,000 or more for houses ?
the old rateable value system seemed fairer to me .
michelle , east ayrshire surely it is time to do something about the regressive nature of our taxation system .
the poorest are paying more of their income proportionally for vat , income tax , national insurance and then the council tax comes as big whammy on top .
i think the time is becoming ripe for withholding the payments until they come up with something fairer .
sean , paisley , scotland it can hardly come as a surprise -lrb- because it was so widely predicted -rrb- that a soviet-style republic is emerging in scotland where the " rich " -lrb- those silly enough to work -rrb- are subject to persecution levels of council tax in order to finance the expanding leisure interests of the burgeoning welfare class .
ubi , aberdeen think it is terrible that the rates go up yet again , east dunbartonshire has the highest rate of payers and still they are increased .
very little has been done to merit the increase .
miss scott , kirkintilloch , east dunbartonshire perhaps if councils remembered that they work for us , the scottish voter , and did n't waste money on schemes which no-one wants or wo n't work , then perhaps the charges wo n't increase .
if edinburgh council can afford a £ 900,000 prize for the person who thinks up a slogan for edinburgh , or stopped wasting money by not taking trips abroad to evaluate how other tram systems work , then perhaps we would n't see suck a large increase .
craig , edinburgh i know councils rely more on government grant than council tax for their funding but they ca n't justify continually having increases two or three times the rate of inflation .
julie , dunfermline this is the perfect government indirect taxation under the guise of a local taxation .
it 's about time that this tax was collected at source based on income then the government would then have to take responsibility for this taxation .
jon , ballencrieff , east lothian i think that before council taxes are risen , the local authorities should sort out the shambolic collection system .
i 've been trying to sort out my council tax with glasgow city council for nearly a year .
every time i send an exemption form , it gets lost , and i was told that there is a six month backlog of correspondence .
thanks to them , i 'm getting threatening letters from bailiffs , when i should be exempt from the beginning .
alaina bell , glasgow , scotland the council tax is simply stupid , it does n't increase accountability , it 's not based on ability to pay and it 's far far far too high .
the scottish executive and all the councils seem to think that a 5 % increase is fine , well it 's not .
this is double inflation and it 's been that way for years .
could councils be more efficient ?
of course they could ! !
look at the example of that other useless public body - scottish water .
water charges are three times - that 's 300 % - higher than in england , and the scottish executive has just protected scottish water from competition - why ?
the customer culture , which is so strong in the private sector , simply does not exist in the public sector , and why should it , they will get paid no matter how bad they are .
it 's time for a change , a huge radical change .
do we actually need 32 councils in tiny scotland ?
in fact do we need any at all ?
ian , glasgow council tax is only part of the amount of money councils receive .
i would imagine one reason for the rise is that central government are not pumping more into councils .
ultimately the money comes from you , so take your pick is it your council or income tax you want to rise ?
rod , edinburgh as a council tax payer i think the consensus is that for every increase in council tax there is little improvement for the average householder to see .
as a council worker i see mismanagement of budgets and employees with little to do .
so in effect i feel there are other ways to increase the council revenue .
the councils should treat their organisations more like a business and pay heed to budgets and deadlines .
l fraser , edinburgh , scotland i would n't mind these increases if we actually saw any benefit from them in terms of service improvement .
however , commercial awareness , and indeed common sense , appears to be sadly lacking in many local authorities .
in edinburgh £ 70,000 has just been spent on a vehicle mounted laser device for detecting pot holes in the roads .
surely edinburgh city could have just asked their own staff to report pot holes as part of their responsibilities while carrying out other council business .
i 'm sure they would get results far more quickly , with wider coverage and at minimal cost .
dirk , edinburgh i think it is an absolute disgrace .
i am single and work very hard for what i have .
i am seriously thinking about moving out of glasgow as the council tax is now unaffordable .
aileen wilson , glasgow there would be no need for council tax rises if someone went and did a detailed analysis of where councils are wasting money , or spending money on things that are non essential , and identified what could be cut from their budgets .
dougie birrell , north queensferry , fife so much has been said about the unfairness of the current tax system , but there is very little coming forward in the way of alternatives .
how about the american purchase tax system , where there would be a national goods and service tax and a local tax added on top for the services .
this would ' tax ' the people who have more to spend and would also have the benefit of taking some income from tourists who use the services provided and paid for by the local inhabitants .
it would be good to hear some views on this .
i think scotland could well take a lead on this way to pay for our councils .
murray welsh , edinburgh i pay more than my fair share of tax , i have always worked - very hard !
i do that for me and my family - no-one else !
i 'm not a charity and i 'm hacked off at being treated like one .
there comes a point when there is no more to give .
i 'm there and i earn a good salary .
why should i and those like me always be the first port of call when the government needs more money .
because that 's exactly what happens when council tax is based on the value of your home .
they should be going back to basics and seeing where they can save money .
and i do n't mean by cutting services , i mean by being more efficient .
we have a government that is not accountable and a local government structure that is run by amateurs .
what hope really of improvements ?
we pay too much tax period .
savings are taxed , insurance is taxed , clothing is taxed , fuel is taxed , roads are taxed , entertainment is taxed , the roof over our heads is taxed , the list is quite frankly endless .
the point we are all missing is that the money that pays for all of these things has already been taxed !
denise ferguson , falkirk it goes up every year .
i do n't know how they can justify such a large increase .
my wages have n't changed for the last three years .
sean carr , aberdeen as a single parent who only receives help from the working families tax credit , it would be just another bill that mounts up .
it 's the principle .
maybe the government need to do more to help people as opposed to taking from them .
nicola dow , west lothian , scotland as usual the council tax increase is greater than inflation .
robert , glasgow the system requires a fundamental overhaul , the council should learn to cut its cloth to fit its suit .
kevin , west lothian i for one would like to know what my council tax is being spent on , and as to why it needs to go up .
after many months on complaining , my local council have still not fixed the dangerously crumbling wall or pavement outside my flat , supplied us with a replacement bin for the one stolen , nor fixed the large open hole by the road nearby .
what do we really get out of this ? !
martha , edinburgh , scotland as someone who works in local government i am increasing annoyed at the level of waste and the move away from core services to fund dubious events and initiatives .
as an edinburgh council tax payer i would prefer my council tax to pay for clean streets , improved public transport , investment in education and social services and not to waste on hogmanay street parties .
jane , edinburgh council tax up again , review on the way .
it 's a sham really .
the inefficiency and ineptitude of local councils would be funny if it were n't real .
that 's the heart of the matter , there 's no point changing the system until councils are brought up to scratch in efficiency terms , then we 'd see increases more in line with inflation .
i 'd vote for the introduction of a local tax based on ability to pay , not on the value of your property .
the poll tax was a fairer system , badly implemented .
the irony for me is that tommy sheridan , who was jailed over poll tax , is now campaigning for its return in a revised form .
neil mckinlay , falkirk , scotland my wife and i are both employed in the public sector .
our house has doubled in value in the past five years , however , our salaries have not - thus to base a tax on the value of your property seems inherently unfair .
there has been recent talk of rejigging the bands to take account of the housing market boom .
in 1998 we bought a house we could afford , in 2004 no honest building society would give us a mortgage to buy the same house at its current value .
property values are only pertinent at the time of purchase and over time do not give a true reflection of a person 's ability to pay .
gavin , glasgow i have always believed in paying for services received , but what i do n't believe in is paying for other people to use these services without paying .
why is n't there more pressure on people who do n't bother paying ?
these people are making the rest of us look like fools .
mind you , with people in authority bucking the system why should we care ?
mrs a walker , glasgow every year the tax increases by more than the inflation rates and the quality and amount of services are cut .
the increases affect everyone and the honest taxpayer has to cut his cloth etc . , whereas the council impose increases which everyone find increasingly difficult to pay .
with the house prices rising as they are , and the number of new houses being built especially in my area , you would expect the councils would be rubbing their hands from the extra revenue they must be collecting from these changes alone .
how are buyers encouraged to abide by the law and pay this tax , which it is based on rateable values , which the councils and government are soon to embark on a revaluation exercise which will increase the payments even more .
can we not relook at the " households " ability to pay , in line with the concept of the old poll tax .

the council tax bills are being set on thursday council tax bills in scotland are set to increase by an average of 4.4 % for the coming year .
most of the 32 local authorities met on thursday to decide on their charges for the next 12 months .
the individual increases ranged from under 2 % to almost 10 % at band d level .
the announcements came amid mounting calls for the reform or abolition of the system , which will be considered as part of a planned review of local government finance .
bbc news online scotland asked for your views on the council tax rise in your area and how it affects you .
we had a large response to this e-mail discussion and here is selection of your views .
this have your say is now closed .
whatever scheme was in place some groups of people would complain about it .
i live in glasgow and as far as i see we have the highest council tax in scotland , all be it the lowest increase .
so what do we get for this money ?
our bins and rubbish taken away , streets cleaned by an army of cleaners , the roads gritted within minuets of snow and ice , free and well maintained parks to enjoy , free museums and subsidised city parking and much more .
we get the elderly visited every day if need be , schools and nurseries upgraded , we get our water rates included ... what else do you want , if you want a western hip city someone -lrb- us -rrb- have to pay for it , or would you like to live in a slum as was many years ago .
stop moaning and pay up ...
glasgow 's worth it by far .
darren morris , glasgow i am really annoyed .
bought my first house in july and had a difficult six months so far .
anticipate the next six months to be just as hard .
i am loving living on my own , but it 's a real struggle to pay all the bills .
an increase in council tax is all i need ! ! !
morgan johnstone , edinburgh , scotland where were all you people when the scottish socialist party effectively destroyed any chance of the poll tax working ?
that was n't based on the price of your house , poor people got reduced charges and every single adult paid their share .
of course poll tax may well have risen at the same astronomical rates as council tax due to inept , unaccountable councils .
what you should worry more about is the differential between scotland and england averages .
in england the average is around £ 1,000 but that includes water and sewerage , you scots need to pay for water and sewerage on top -lrb- and it 's not like scotland is ever short of water ! -rrb- .
bob , uk to those advocating a return to the poll tax type of setup .
the last time it was in force my wife was unable to work yet she was expected to pay the full tax .
she had no income at all which meant both our taxes had to come out of our already stretched single wage .
the same thing is happening with the council tax .
it keeps climbing and services are being reduced yet councillors can jet all over the place for their little fact-finding missions .
they do n't need to increase this tax or even change it .
they just have to get council spending into line and stop wasting money on someone 's bright ideas .
hugh , dumbarton the big problem is that there 's no way that the level that councillors set the council tax affects them personally .
they can always vote to increase their own salaries and allowances to cover any increase that the rest of us have to pay .
the argument that they can always be booted out at the ballot box is a non-starter in so many councils where there is either near one-party rule or rule by cliques of " independents " where it does n't matter who you vote for a politician always gets in .
what about a simple system - for every percentage point over inflation that a council increases its council tax , the councillors lose a percentage point off their salaries and allowances , and vice versa .
it would clarify their minds wonderfully .
james , moray if pay rises are set at the rate of inflation then on what or whose authority does moray council have the right to raise our taxes by 9.8 % ?
gas , electric , fuel and other items have gone up but wages are not .
how do we afford this new rise ?
ian geddes , elgin councils should be made more accountable on how they spend tax payers ' money .
the only reason glasgow 's council tax has the lowest increase is because they made huge increases in the earlier years , but glaswegians are still paying the highest council tax in scotland .
i am now considering moving outside glasgow to save money .
britain , especially scotland , is becoming a tax state .
it wo n't be long before our salaries are taken at source and pocket money given to us .
john cairns , glasgow it is a disgrace when the area of scotland which is statistically has the lowest wages has the largest increase in council tax .
something is not right here !
helen ford , moray , scotland i work hard for what i have but another increase can not be justified especially since i see nothing for it .
all the talk about changing it to income based will just make things worse as i already pay enough tax .
so get the councils to get their houses in order first before you ask the public to pay any more and you never know we maybe due money back andrew , lanarkshire i 'm a civil servant and this year received a pay rise of £ 41.00 per month , after tax & national insurance contributions .
i am better off by £ 18.00 per month .
council tax is set to rise in my area , about 3.5 % although this is lower than the national average , it 's very worrying for me .
i 've still to take into account water and sewerage rises , rent and general cost of living rises .
after all this is paid i 'll be worse off ! !
it seems to be for the average person in britain , the harder you work the more your penalised .
as usual , the middle man always looses out !
lisa davies , motherwell , scotland i do n't know where the government think we can keep magically producing these above-inflation rises from our monthly salaries which are not even rising in line with inflation .

darren morris , glasgow i am really annoyed .
bought my first house in july and had a difficult six months so far .
anticipate the next six months to be just as hard .
i am loving living on my own , but it 's a real struggle to pay all the bills .
an increase in council tax is all i need ! ! !
morgan johnstone , edinburgh , scotland where were all you people when the scottish socialist party effectively destroyed any chance of the poll tax working ?
that was n't based on the price of your house , poor people got reduced charges and every single adult paid their share .
of course poll tax may well have risen at the same astronomical rates as council tax due to inept , unaccountable councils .
what you should worry more about is the differential between scotland and england averages .
in england the average is around £ 1,000 but that includes water and sewerage , you scots need to pay for water and sewerage on top -lrb- and it 's not like scotland is ever short of water ! -rrb- .
bob , uk to those advocating a return to the poll tax type of setup .
the last time it was in force my wife was unable to work yet she was expected to pay the full tax .
she had no income at all which meant both our taxes had to come out of our already stretched single wage .
the same thing is happening with the council tax .
it keeps climbing and services are being reduced yet councillors can jet all over the place for their little fact-finding missions .
they do n't need to increase this tax or even change it .
they just have to get council spending into line and stop wasting money on someone 's bright ideas .
hugh , dumbarton the big problem is that there 's no way that the level that councillors set the council tax affects them personally .
they can always vote to increase their own salaries and allowances to cover any increase that the rest of us have to pay .
the argument that they can always be booted out at the ballot box is a non-starter in so many councils where there is either near one-party rule or rule by cliques of " independents " where it does n't matter who you vote for a politician always gets in .
what about a simple system - for every percentage point over inflation that a council increases its council tax , the councillors lose a percentage point off their salaries and allowances , and vice versa .
it would clarify their minds wonderfully .
james , moray if pay rises are set at the rate of inflation then on what or whose authority does moray council have the right to raise our taxes by 9.8 % ?
gas , electric , fuel and other items have gone up but wages are not .
how do we afford this new rise ?
ian geddes , elgin councils should be made more accountable on how they spend tax payers ' money .
the only reason glasgow 's council tax has the lowest increase is because they made huge increases in the earlier years , but glaswegians are still paying the highest council tax in scotland .
i am now considering moving outside glasgow to save money .
britain , especially scotland , is becoming a tax state .
it wo n't be long before our salaries are taken at source and pocket money given to us .
john cairns , glasgow it is a disgrace when the area of scotland which is statistically has the lowest wages has the largest increase in council tax .
something is not right here !
helen ford , moray , scotland i work hard for what i have but another increase can not be justified especially since i see nothing for it .
all the talk about changing it to income based will just make things worse as i already pay enough tax .
so get the councils to get their houses in order first before you ask the public to pay any more and you never know we maybe due money back andrew , lanarkshire i 'm a civil servant and this year received a pay rise of £ 41.00 per month , after tax & national insurance contributions .
i am better off by £ 18.00 per month .
council tax is set to rise in my area , about 3.5 % although this is lower than the national average , it 's very worrying for me .
i 've still to take into account water and sewerage rises , rent and general cost of living rises .
after all this is paid i 'll be worse off ! !
it seems to be for the average person in britain , the harder you work the more your penalised .
as usual , the middle man always looses out !
lisa davies , motherwell , scotland i do n't know where the government think we can keep magically producing these above-inflation rises from our monthly salaries which are not even rising in line with inflation .
i 'd also like to know what we are paying for .
living in a rural community , i now have no post office and shop , non-existent transport links and every road out of the village has potholes requiring you to drive down the centre of the road to avoid constant damage to your car .
it seems to me that all my council tax is paying for at the moment is my bin emptied once a week .
something needs to be done to change the system , although i do think that a local income based tax will only serve to make the average family pay more .
what about all those people down south who are managing to pay £ 500,000 or more for houses ?
the old rateable value system seemed fairer to me .
michelle , east ayrshire surely it is time to do something about the regressive nature of our taxation system .
the poorest are paying more of their income proportionally for vat , income tax , national insurance and then the council tax comes as big whammy on top .
i think the time is becoming ripe for withholding the payments until they come up with something fairer .
sean , paisley , scotland it can hardly come as a surprise -lrb- because it was so widely predicted -rrb- that a soviet-style republic is emerging in scotland where the " rich " -lrb- those silly enough to work -rrb- are subject to persecution levels of council tax in order to finance the expanding leisure interests of the burgeoning welfare class .
ubi , aberdeen think it is terrible that the rates go up yet again , east dunbartonshire has the highest rate of payers and still they are increased .
very little has been done to merit the increase .
miss scott , kirkintilloch , east dunbartonshire perhaps if councils remembered that they work for us , the scottish voter , and did n't waste money on schemes which no-one wants or wo n't work , then perhaps the charges wo n't increase .
if edinburgh council can afford a £ 900,000 prize for the person who thinks up a slogan for edinburgh , or stopped wasting money by not taking trips abroad to evaluate how other tram systems work , then perhaps we would n't see suck a large increase .
craig , edinburgh i know councils rely more on government grant than council tax for their funding but they ca n't justify continually having increases two or three times the rate of inflation .
julie , dunfermline this is the perfect government indirect taxation under the guise of a local taxation .
it 's about time that this tax was collected at source based on income then the government would then have to take responsibility for this taxation .
jon , ballencrieff , east lothian i think that before council taxes are risen , the local authorities should sort out the shambolic collection system .
i 've been trying to sort out my council tax with glasgow city council for nearly a year .
every time i send an exemption form , it gets lost , and i was told that there is a six month backlog of correspondence .
thanks to them , i 'm getting threatening letters from bailiffs , when i should be exempt from the beginning .
alaina bell , glasgow , scotland the council tax is simply stupid , it does n't increase accountability , it 's not based on ability to pay and it 's far far far too high .
the scottish executive and all the councils seem to think that a 5 % increase is fine , well it 's not .
this is double inflation and it 's been that way for years .
could councils be more efficient ?
of course they could ! !
look at the example of that other useless public body - scottish water .
water charges are three times - that 's 300 % - higher than in england , and the scottish executive has just protected scottish water from competition - why ?
the customer culture , which is so strong in the private sector , simply does not exist in the public sector , and why should it , they will get paid no matter how bad they are .
it 's time for a change , a huge radical change .
do we actually need 32 councils in tiny scotland ?
in fact do we need any at all ?
ian , glasgow council tax is only part of the amount of money councils receive .
i would imagine one reason for the rise is that central government are not pumping more into councils .
ultimately the money comes from you , so take your pick is it your council or income tax you want to rise ?
rod , edinburgh as a council tax payer i think the consensus is that for every increase in council tax there is little improvement for the average householder to see .
as a council worker i see mismanagement of budgets and employees with little to do .
so in effect i feel there are other ways to increase the council revenue .
the councils should treat their organisations more like a business and pay heed to budgets and deadlines .
l fraser , edinburgh , scotland i would n't mind these increases if we actually saw any benefit from them in terms of service improvement .
however , commercial awareness , and indeed common sense , appears to be sadly lacking in many local authorities .
in edinburgh £ 70,000 has just been spent on a vehicle mounted laser device for detecting pot holes in the roads .
surely edinburgh city could have just asked their own staff to report pot holes as part of their responsibilities while carrying out other council business .
i 'm sure they would get results far more quickly , with wider coverage and at minimal cost .
dirk , edinburgh i think it is an absolute disgrace .
i am single and work very hard for what i have .
i am seriously thinking about moving out of glasgow as the council tax is now unaffordable .
aileen wilson , glasgow there would be no need for council tax rises if someone went and did a detailed analysis of where councils are wasting money , or spending money on things that are non essential , and identified what could be cut from their budgets .
dougie birrell , north queensferry , fife so much has been said about the unfairness of the current tax system , but there is very little coming forward in the way of alternatives .
how about the american purchase tax system , where there would be a national goods and service tax and a local tax added on top for the services .
this would ' tax ' the people who have more to spend and would also have the benefit of taking some income from tourists who use the services provided and paid for by the local inhabitants .
it would be good to hear some views on this .
i think scotland could well take a lead on this way to pay for our councils .
murray welsh , edinburgh i pay more than my fair share of tax , i have always worked - very hard !
i do that for me and my family - no-one else !
i 'm not a charity and i 'm hacked off at being treated like one .
there comes a point when there is no more to give .
i 'm there and i earn a good salary .
why should i and those like me always be the first port of call when the government needs more money .
because that 's exactly what happens when council tax is based on the value of your home .
they should be going back to basics and seeing where they can save money .
and i do n't mean by cutting services , i mean by being more efficient .
we have a government that is not accountable and a local government structure that is run by amateurs .
what hope really of improvements ?
we pay too much tax period .
savings are taxed , insurance is taxed , clothing is taxed , fuel is taxed , roads are taxed , entertainment is taxed , the roof over our heads is taxed , the list is quite frankly endless .
the point we are all missing is that the money that pays for all of these things has already been taxed !
denise ferguson , falkirk it goes up every year .
i do n't know how they can justify such a large increase .
my wages have n't changed for the last three years .
sean carr , aberdeen as a single parent who only receives help from the working families tax credit , it would be just another bill that mounts up .
it 's the principle .
maybe the government need to do more to help people as opposed to taking from them .
nicola dow , west lothian , scotland as usual the council tax increase is greater than inflation .
robert , glasgow the system requires a fundamental overhaul , the council should learn to cut its cloth to fit its suit .
kevin , west lothian i for one would like to know what my council tax is being spent on , and as to why it needs to go up .
after many months on complaining , my local council have still not fixed the dangerously crumbling wall or pavement outside my flat , supplied us with a replacement bin for the one stolen , nor fixed the large open hole by the road nearby .
what do we really get out of this ? !
martha , edinburgh , scotland as someone who works in local government i am increasing annoyed at the level of waste and the move away from core services to fund dubious events and initiatives .
as an edinburgh council tax payer i would prefer my council tax to pay for clean streets , improved public transport , investment in education and social services and not to waste on hogmanay street parties .
jane , edinburgh council tax up again , review on the way .
it 's a sham really .
the inefficiency and ineptitude of local councils would be funny if it were n't real .
that 's the heart of the matter , there 's no point changing the system until councils are brought up to scratch in efficiency terms , then we 'd see increases more in line with inflation .
i 'd vote for the introduction of a local tax based on ability to pay , not on the value of your property .
the poll tax was a fairer system , badly implemented .
the irony for me is that tommy sheridan , who was jailed over poll tax , is now campaigning for its return in a revised form .
neil mckinlay , falkirk , scotland my wife and i are both employed in the public sector .
our house has doubled in value in the past five years , however , our salaries have not - thus to base a tax on the value of your property seems inherently unfair .
there has been recent talk of rejigging the bands to take account of the housing market boom .
in 1998 we bought a house we could afford , in 2004 no honest building society would give us a mortgage to buy the same house at its current value .
property values are only pertinent at the time of purchase and over time do not give a true reflection of a person 's ability to pay .
gavin , glasgow i have always believed in paying for services received , but what i do n't believe in is paying for other people to use these services without paying .
why is n't there more pressure on people who do n't bother paying ?
these people are making the rest of us look like fools .
mind you , with people in authority bucking the system why should we care ?
mrs a walker , glasgow every year the tax increases by more than the inflation rates and the quality and amount of services are cut .
the increases affect everyone and the honest taxpayer has to cut his cloth etc . , whereas the council impose increases which everyone find increasingly difficult to pay .
with the house prices rising as they are , and the number of new houses being built especially in my area , you would expect the councils would be rubbing their hands from the extra revenue they must be collecting from these changes alone .
how are buyers encouraged to abide by the law and pay this tax , which it is based on rateable values , which the councils and government are soon to embark on a revaluation exercise which will increase the payments even more .
can we not relook at the " households " ability to pay , in line with the concept of the old poll tax .

the council tax bills are being set on thursday council tax bills in scotland are set to increase by an average of 4.4 % for the coming year .
most of the 32 local authorities met on thursday to decide on their charges for the next 12 months .
the individual increases ranged from under 2 % to almost 10 % at band d level .
the announcements came amid mounting calls for the reform or abolition of the system , which will be considered as part of a planned review of local government finance .
bbc news online scotland asked for your views on the council tax rise in your area and how it affects you .
we had a large response to this e-mail discussion and here is selection of your views .
this have your say is now closed .
whatever scheme was in place some groups of people would complain about it .
i live in glasgow and as far as i see we have the highest council tax in scotland , all be it the lowest increase .
so what do we get for this money ?
our bins and rubbish taken away , streets cleaned by an army of cleaners , the roads gritted within minuets of snow and ice , free and well maintained parks to enjoy , free museums and subsidised city parking and much more .
we get the elderly visited every day if need be , schools and nurseries upgraded , we get our water rates included ... what else do you want , if you want a western hip city someone -lrb- us -rrb- have to pay for it , or would you like to live in a slum as was many years ago .
stop moaning and pay up ...
glasgow 's worth it by far .
darren morris , glasgow i am really annoyed .

with the house prices rising as they are , and the number of new houses being built especially in my area , you would expect the councils would be rubbing their hands from the extra revenue they must be collecting from these changes alone .
how are buyers encouraged to abide by the law and pay this tax , which it is based on rateable values , which the councils and government are soon to embark on a revaluation exercise which will increase the payments even more .
can we not relook at the " households " ability to pay , in line with the concept of the old poll tax .

the council tax bills are being set on thursday council tax bills in scotland are set to increase by an average of 4.4 % for the coming year .
most of the 32 local authorities met on thursday to decide on their charges for the next 12 months .
the individual increases ranged from under 2 % to almost 10 % at band d level .
the announcements came amid mounting calls for the reform or abolition of the system , which will be considered as part of a planned review of local government finance .
bbc news online scotland asked for your views on the council tax rise in your area and how it affects you .
we had a large response to this e-mail discussion and here is selection of your views .
this have your say is now closed .
whatever scheme was in place some groups of people would complain about it .
i live in glasgow and as far as i see we have the highest council tax in scotland , all be it the lowest increase .
so what do we get for this money ?
our bins and rubbish taken away , streets cleaned by an army of cleaners , the roads gritted within minuets of snow and ice , free and well maintained parks to enjoy , free museums and subsidised city parking and much more .
we get the elderly visited every day if need be , schools and nurseries upgraded , we get our water rates included ... what else do you want , if you want a western hip city someone -lrb- us -rrb- have to pay for it , or would you like to live in a slum as was many years ago .
stop moaning and pay up ...
glasgow 's worth it by far .
darren morris , glasgow i am really annoyed .
bought my first house in july and had a difficult six months so far .
anticipate the next six months to be just as hard .
i am loving living on my own , but it 's a real struggle to pay all the bills .
an increase in council tax is all i need ! ! !
morgan johnstone , edinburgh , scotland where were all you people when the scottish socialist party effectively destroyed any chance of the poll tax working ?
that was n't based on the price of your house , poor people got reduced charges and every single adult paid their share .
of course poll tax may well have risen at the same astronomical rates as council tax due to inept , unaccountable councils .
what you should worry more about is the differential between scotland and england averages .
in england the average is around £ 1,000 but that includes water and sewerage , you scots need to pay for water and sewerage on top -lrb- and it 's not like scotland is ever short of water ! -rrb- .
bob , uk to those advocating a return to the poll tax type of setup .
the last time it was in force my wife was unable to work yet she was expected to pay the full tax .
she had no income at all which meant both our taxes had to come out of our already stretched single wage .
the same thing is happening with the council tax .
it keeps climbing and services are being reduced yet councillors can jet all over the place for their little fact-finding missions .
they do n't need to increase this tax or even change it .
they just have to get council spending into line and stop wasting money on someone 's bright ideas .
hugh , dumbarton the big problem is that there 's no way that the level that councillors set the council tax affects them personally .
they can always vote to increase their own salaries and allowances to cover any increase that the rest of us have to pay .
the argument that they can always be booted out at the ballot box is a non-starter in so many councils where there is either near one-party rule or rule by cliques of " independents " where it does n't matter who you vote for a politician always gets in .
what about a simple system - for every percentage point over inflation that a council increases its council tax , the councillors lose a percentage point off their salaries and allowances , and vice versa .
it would clarify their minds wonderfully .
james , moray if pay rises are set at the rate of inflation then on what or whose authority does moray council have the right to raise our taxes by 9.8 % ?
gas , electric , fuel and other items have gone up but wages are not .
how do we afford this new rise ?
ian geddes , elgin councils should be made more accountable on how they spend tax payers ' money .
the only reason glasgow 's council tax has the lowest increase is because they made huge increases in the earlier years , but glaswegians are still paying the highest council tax in scotland .
i am now considering moving outside glasgow to save money .
britain , especially scotland , is becoming a tax state .
it wo n't be long before our salaries are taken at source and pocket money given to us .
john cairns , glasgow it is a disgrace when the area of scotland which is statistically has the lowest wages has the largest increase in council tax .
something is not right here !
helen ford , moray , scotland i work hard for what i have but another increase can not be justified especially since i see nothing for it .
all the talk about changing it to income based will just make things worse as i already pay enough tax .
so get the councils to get their houses in order first before you ask the public to pay any more and you never know we maybe due money back andrew , lanarkshire i 'm a civil servant and this year received a pay rise of £ 41.00 per month , after tax & national insurance contributions .
i am better off by £ 18.00 per month .
council tax is set to rise in my area , about 3.5 % although this is lower than the national average , it 's very worrying for me .
i 've still to take into account water and sewerage rises , rent and general cost of living rises .
after all this is paid i 'll be worse off ! !
it seems to be for the average person in britain , the harder you work the more your penalised .
as usual , the middle man always looses out !
lisa davies , motherwell , scotland i do n't know where the government think we can keep magically producing these above-inflation rises from our monthly salaries which are not even rising in line with inflation .
i 'd also like to know what we are paying for .
living in a rural community , i now have no post office and shop , non-existent transport links and every road out of the village has potholes requiring you to drive down the centre of the road to avoid constant damage to your car .
it seems to me that all my council tax is paying for at the moment is my bin emptied once a week .
something needs to be done to change the system , although i do think that a local income based tax will only serve to make the average family pay more .
what about all those people down south who are managing to pay £ 500,000 or more for houses ?
the old rateable value system seemed fairer to me .
michelle , east ayrshire surely it is time to do something about the regressive nature of our taxation system .
the poorest are paying more of their income proportionally for vat , income tax , national insurance and then the council tax comes as big whammy on top .
i think the time is becoming ripe for withholding the payments until they come up with something fairer .
sean , paisley , scotland it can hardly come as a surprise -lrb- because it was so widely predicted -rrb- that a soviet-style republic is emerging in scotland where the " rich " -lrb- those silly enough to work -rrb- are subject to persecution levels of council tax in order to finance the expanding leisure interests of the burgeoning welfare class .
ubi , aberdeen think it is terrible that the rates go up yet again , east dunbartonshire has the highest rate of payers and still they are increased .
very little has been done to merit the increase .
miss scott , kirkintilloch , east dunbartonshire perhaps if councils remembered that they work for us , the scottish voter , and did n't waste money on schemes which no-one wants or wo n't work , then perhaps the charges wo n't increase .
if edinburgh council can afford a £ 900,000 prize for the person who thinks up a slogan for edinburgh , or stopped wasting money by not taking trips abroad to evaluate how other tram systems work , then perhaps we would n't see suck a large increase .
craig , edinburgh i know councils rely more on government grant than council tax for their funding but they ca n't justify continually having increases two or three times the rate of inflation .
julie , dunfermline this is the perfect government indirect taxation under the guise of a local taxation .
it 's about time that this tax was collected at source based on income then the government would then have to take responsibility for this taxation .
jon , ballencrieff , east lothian i think that before council taxes are risen , the local authorities should sort out the shambolic collection system .
i 've been trying to sort out my council tax with glasgow city council for nearly a year .
every time i send an exemption form , it gets lost , and i was told that there is a six month backlog of correspondence .
thanks to them , i 'm getting threatening letters from bailiffs , when i should be exempt from the beginning .
alaina bell , glasgow , scotland the council tax is simply stupid , it does n't increase accountability , it 's not based on ability to pay and it 's far far far too high .
the scottish executive and all the councils seem to think that a 5 % increase is fine , well it 's not .
this is double inflation and it 's been that way for years .
could councils be more efficient ?
of course they could ! !
look at the example of that other useless public body - scottish water .
water charges are three times - that 's 300 % - higher than in england , and the scottish executive has just protected scottish water from competition - why ?
the customer culture , which is so strong in the private sector , simply does not exist in the public sector , and why should it , they will get paid no matter how bad they are .
it 's time for a change , a huge radical change .
do we actually need 32 councils in tiny scotland ?
in fact do we need any at all ?
ian , glasgow council tax is only part of the amount of money councils receive .
i would imagine one reason for the rise is that central government are not pumping more into councils .
ultimately the money comes from you , so take your pick is it your council or income tax you want to rise ?
rod , edinburgh as a council tax payer i think the consensus is that for every increase in council tax there is little improvement for the average householder to see .
as a council worker i see mismanagement of budgets and employees with little to do .
so in effect i feel there are other ways to increase the council revenue .
the councils should treat their organisations more like a business and pay heed to budgets and deadlines .
l fraser , edinburgh , scotland i would n't mind these increases if we actually saw any benefit from them in terms of service improvement .
however , commercial awareness , and indeed common sense , appears to be sadly lacking in many local authorities .
in edinburgh £ 70,000 has just been spent on a vehicle mounted laser device for detecting pot holes in the roads .
surely edinburgh city could have just asked their own staff to report pot holes as part of their responsibilities while carrying out other council business .
i 'm sure they would get results far more quickly , with wider coverage and at minimal cost .
dirk , edinburgh i think it is an absolute disgrace .
i am single and work very hard for what i have .
i am seriously thinking about moving out of glasgow as the council tax is now unaffordable .
aileen wilson , glasgow there would be no need for council tax rises if someone went and did a detailed analysis of where councils are wasting money , or spending money on things that are non essential , and identified what could be cut from their budgets .
dougie birrell , north queensferry , fife so much has been said about the unfairness of the current tax system , but there is very little coming forward in the way of alternatives .
how about the american purchase tax system , where there would be a national goods and service tax and a local tax added on top for the services .
this would ' tax ' the people who have more to spend and would also have the benefit of taking some income from tourists who use the services provided and paid for by the local inhabitants .
it would be good to hear some views on this .
i think scotland could well take a lead on this way to pay for our councils .
murray welsh , edinburgh i pay more than my fair share of tax , i have always worked - very hard !
i do that for me and my family - no-one else !
i 'm not a charity and i 'm hacked off at being treated like one .
there comes a point when there is no more to give .
i 'm there and i earn a good salary .
why should i and those like me always be the first port of call when the government needs more money .
because that 's exactly what happens when council tax is based on the value of your home .
they should be going back to basics and seeing where they can save money .
and i do n't mean by cutting services , i mean by being more efficient .
we have a government that is not accountable and a local government structure that is run by amateurs .
what hope really of improvements ?
we pay too much tax period .
savings are taxed , insurance is taxed , clothing is taxed , fuel is taxed , roads are taxed , entertainment is taxed , the roof over our heads is taxed , the list is quite frankly endless .
the point we are all missing is that the money that pays for all of these things has already been taxed !
denise ferguson , falkirk it goes up every year .
i do n't know how they can justify such a large increase .
my wages have n't changed for the last three years .
sean carr , aberdeen as a single parent who only receives help from the working families tax credit , it would be just another bill that mounts up .
it 's the principle .
maybe the government need to do more to help people as opposed to taking from them .
nicola dow , west lothian , scotland as usual the council tax increase is greater than inflation .
robert , glasgow the system requires a fundamental overhaul , the council should learn to cut its cloth to fit its suit .
kevin , west lothian i for one would like to know what my council tax is being spent on , and as to why it needs to go up .
after many months on complaining , my local council have still not fixed the dangerously crumbling wall or pavement outside my flat , supplied us with a replacement bin for the one stolen , nor fixed the large open hole by the road nearby .
what do we really get out of this ? !
martha , edinburgh , scotland as someone who works in local government i am increasing annoyed at the level of waste and the move away from core services to fund dubious events and initiatives .
as an edinburgh council tax payer i would prefer my council tax to pay for clean streets , improved public transport , investment in education and social services and not to waste on hogmanay street parties .
jane , edinburgh council tax up again , review on the way .
it 's a sham really .
the inefficiency and ineptitude of local councils would be funny if it were n't real .
that 's the heart of the matter , there 's no point changing the system until councils are brought up to scratch in efficiency terms , then we 'd see increases more in line with inflation .
i 'd vote for the introduction of a local tax based on ability to pay , not on the value of your property .
the poll tax was a fairer system , badly implemented .
the irony for me is that tommy sheridan , who was jailed over poll tax , is now campaigning for its return in a revised form .
neil mckinlay , falkirk , scotland my wife and i are both employed in the public sector .
our house has doubled in value in the past five years , however , our salaries have not - thus to base a tax on the value of your property seems inherently unfair .
there has been recent talk of rejigging the bands to take account of the housing market boom .
in 1998 we bought a house we could afford , in 2004 no honest building society would give us a mortgage to buy the same house at its current value .
property values are only pertinent at the time of purchase and over time do not give a true reflection of a person 's ability to pay .
gavin , glasgow i have always believed in paying for services received , but what i do n't believe in is paying for other people to use these services without paying .
why is n't there more pressure on people who do n't bother paying ?
these people are making the rest of us look like fools .
mind you , with people in authority bucking the system why should we care ?
mrs a walker , glasgow every year the tax increases by more than the inflation rates and the quality and amount of services are cut .
the increases affect everyone and the honest taxpayer has to cut his cloth etc . , whereas the council impose increases which everyone find increasingly difficult to pay .
with the house prices rising as they are , and the number of new houses being built especially in my area , you would expect the councils would be rubbing their hands from the extra revenue they must be collecting from these changes alone .
how are buyers encouraged to abide by the law and pay this tax , which it is based on rateable values , which the councils and government are soon to embark on a revaluation exercise which will increase the payments even more .
can we not relook at the " households " ability to pay , in line with the concept of the old poll tax .

because that 's exactly what happens when council tax is based on the value of your home .
they should be going back to basics and seeing where they can save money .
and i do n't mean by cutting services , i mean by being more efficient .
we have a government that is not accountable and a local government structure that is run by amateurs .
what hope really of improvements ?
we pay too much tax period .
savings are taxed , insurance is taxed , clothing is taxed , fuel is taxed , roads are taxed , entertainment is taxed , the roof over our heads is taxed , the list is quite frankly endless .
the point we are all missing is that the money that pays for all of these things has already been taxed !
denise ferguson , falkirk it goes up every year .
i do n't know how they can justify such a large increase .
my wages have n't changed for the last three years .
sean carr , aberdeen as a single parent who only receives help from the working families tax credit , it would be just another bill that mounts up .
it 's the principle .
maybe the government need to do more to help people as opposed to taking from them .
nicola dow , west lothian , scotland as usual the council tax increase is greater than inflation .
robert , glasgow the system requires a fundamental overhaul , the council should learn to cut its cloth to fit its suit .
kevin , west lothian i for one would like to know what my council tax is being spent on , and as to why it needs to go up .
after many months on complaining , my local council have still not fixed the dangerously crumbling wall or pavement outside my flat , supplied us with a replacement bin for the one stolen , nor fixed the large open hole by the road nearby .
what do we really get out of this ? !
martha , edinburgh , scotland as someone who works in local government i am increasing annoyed at the level of waste and the move away from core services to fund dubious events and initiatives .
as an edinburgh council tax payer i would prefer my council tax to pay for clean streets , improved public transport , investment in education and social services and not to waste on hogmanay street parties .
jane , edinburgh council tax up again , review on the way .
it 's a sham really .
the inefficiency and ineptitude of local councils would be funny if it were n't real .
that 's the heart of the matter , there 's no point changing the system until councils are brought up to scratch in efficiency terms , then we 'd see increases more in line with inflation .
i 'd vote for the introduction of a local tax based on ability to pay , not on the value of your property .
the poll tax was a fairer system , badly implemented .
the irony for me is that tommy sheridan , who was jailed over poll tax , is now campaigning for its return in a revised form .
neil mckinlay , falkirk , scotland my wife and i are both employed in the public sector .
our house has doubled in value in the past five years , however , our salaries have not - thus to base a tax on the value of your property seems inherently unfair .
there has been recent talk of rejigging the bands to take account of the housing market boom .
in 1998 we bought a house we could afford , in 2004 no honest building society would give us a mortgage to buy the same house at its current value .
property values are only pertinent at the time of purchase and over time do not give a true reflection of a person 's ability to pay .
gavin , glasgow i have always believed in paying for services received , but what i do n't believe in is paying for other people to use these services without paying .
why is n't there more pressure on people who do n't bother paying ?
these people are making the rest of us look like fools .
mind you , with people in authority bucking the system why should we care ?
mrs a walker , glasgow every year the tax increases by more than the inflation rates and the quality and amount of services are cut .
the increases affect everyone and the honest taxpayer has to cut his cloth etc . , whereas the council impose increases which everyone find increasingly difficult to pay .
with the house prices rising as they are , and the number of new houses being built especially in my area , you would expect the councils would be rubbing their hands from the extra revenue they must be collecting from these changes alone .
how are buyers encouraged to abide by the law and pay this tax , which it is based on rateable values , which the councils and government are soon to embark on a revaluation exercise which will increase the payments even more .
can we not relook at the " households " ability to pay , in line with the concept of the old poll tax .

the council tax bills are being set on thursday council tax bills in scotland are set to increase by an average of 4.4 % for the coming year .
most of the 32 local authorities met on thursday to decide on their charges for the next 12 months .
the individual increases ranged from under 2 % to almost 10 % at band d level .
the announcements came amid mounting calls for the reform or abolition of the system , which will be considered as part of a planned review of local government finance .
bbc news online scotland asked for your views on the council tax rise in your area and how it affects you .
we had a large response to this e-mail discussion and here is selection of your views .
this have your say is now closed .
whatever scheme was in place some groups of people would complain about it .
i live in glasgow and as far as i see we have the highest council tax in scotland , all be it the lowest increase .
so what do we get for this money ?
our bins and rubbish taken away , streets cleaned by an army of cleaners , the roads gritted within minuets of snow and ice , free and well maintained parks to enjoy , free museums and subsidised city parking and much more .
we get the elderly visited every day if need be , schools and nurseries upgraded , we get our water rates included ... what else do you want , if you want a western hip city someone -lrb- us -rrb- have to pay for it , or would you like to live in a slum as was many years ago .
stop moaning and pay up ...
glasgow 's worth it by far .
darren morris , glasgow i am really annoyed .
bought my first house in july and had a difficult six months so far .
anticipate the next six months to be just as hard .
i am loving living on my own , but it 's a real struggle to pay all the bills .
an increase in council tax is all i need ! ! !
morgan johnstone , edinburgh , scotland where were all you people when the scottish socialist party effectively destroyed any chance of the poll tax working ?
that was n't based on the price of your house , poor people got reduced charges and every single adult paid their share .
of course poll tax may well have risen at the same astronomical rates as council tax due to inept , unaccountable councils .
what you should worry more about is the differential between scotland and england averages .
in england the average is around £ 1,000 but that includes water and sewerage , you scots need to pay for water and sewerage on top -lrb- and it 's not like scotland is ever short of water ! -rrb- .
bob , uk to those advocating a return to the poll tax type of setup .
the last time it was in force my wife was unable to work yet she was expected to pay the full tax .
she had no income at all which meant both our taxes had to come out of our already stretched single wage .
the same thing is happening with the council tax .
it keeps climbing and services are being reduced yet councillors can jet all over the place for their little fact-finding missions .
they do n't need to increase this tax or even change it .
they just have to get council spending into line and stop wasting money on someone 's bright ideas .
hugh , dumbarton the big problem is that there 's no way that the level that councillors set the council tax affects them personally .
they can always vote to increase their own salaries and allowances to cover any increase that the rest of us have to pay .
the argument that they can always be booted out at the ballot box is a non-starter in so many councils where there is either near one-party rule or rule by cliques of " independents " where it does n't matter who you vote for a politician always gets in .
what about a simple system - for every percentage point over inflation that a council increases its council tax , the councillors lose a percentage point off their salaries and allowances , and vice versa .
it would clarify their minds wonderfully .
james , moray if pay rises are set at the rate of inflation then on what or whose authority does moray council have the right to raise our taxes by 9.8 % ?
gas , electric , fuel and other items have gone up but wages are not .
how do we afford this new rise ?
ian geddes , elgin councils should be made more accountable on how they spend tax payers ' money .
the only reason glasgow 's council tax has the lowest increase is because they made huge increases in the earlier years , but glaswegians are still paying the highest council tax in scotland .
i am now considering moving outside glasgow to save money .
britain , especially scotland , is becoming a tax state .
it wo n't be long before our salaries are taken at source and pocket money given to us .
john cairns , glasgow it is a disgrace when the area of scotland which is statistically has the lowest wages has the largest increase in council tax .
something is not right here !
helen ford , moray , scotland i work hard for what i have but another increase can not be justified especially since i see nothing for it .
all the talk about changing it to income based will just make things worse as i already pay enough tax .
so get the councils to get their houses in order first before you ask the public to pay any more and you never know we maybe due money back andrew , lanarkshire i 'm a civil servant and this year received a pay rise of £ 41.00 per month , after tax & national insurance contributions .
i am better off by £ 18.00 per month .
council tax is set to rise in my area , about 3.5 % although this is lower than the national average , it 's very worrying for me .
i 've still to take into account water and sewerage rises , rent and general cost of living rises .
after all this is paid i 'll be worse off ! !
it seems to be for the average person in britain , the harder you work the more your penalised .
as usual , the middle man always looses out !
lisa davies , motherwell , scotland i do n't know where the government think we can keep magically producing these above-inflation rises from our monthly salaries which are not even rising in line with inflation .
i 'd also like to know what we are paying for .
living in a rural community , i now have no post office and shop , non-existent transport links and every road out of the village has potholes requiring you to drive down the centre of the road to avoid constant damage to your car .
it seems to me that all my council tax is paying for at the moment is my bin emptied once a week .
something needs to be done to change the system , although i do think that a local income based tax will only serve to make the average family pay more .
what about all those people down south who are managing to pay £ 500,000 or more for houses ?
the old rateable value system seemed fairer to me .
michelle , east ayrshire surely it is time to do something about the regressive nature of our taxation system .
the poorest are paying more of their income proportionally for vat , income tax , national insurance and then the council tax comes as big whammy on top .
i think the time is becoming ripe for withholding the payments until they come up with something fairer .
sean , paisley , scotland it can hardly come as a surprise -lrb- because it was so widely predicted -rrb- that a soviet-style republic is emerging in scotland where the " rich " -lrb- those silly enough to work -rrb- are subject to persecution levels of council tax in order to finance the expanding leisure interests of the burgeoning welfare class .
ubi , aberdeen think it is terrible that the rates go up yet again , east dunbartonshire has the highest rate of payers and still they are increased .
very little has been done to merit the increase .
miss scott , kirkintilloch , east dunbartonshire perhaps if councils remembered that they work for us , the scottish voter , and did n't waste money on schemes which no-one wants or wo n't work , then perhaps the charges wo n't increase .
if edinburgh council can afford a £ 900,000 prize for the person who thinks up a slogan for edinburgh , or stopped wasting money by not taking trips abroad to evaluate how other tram systems work , then perhaps we would n't see suck a large increase .
craig , edinburgh i know councils rely more on government grant than council tax for their funding but they ca n't justify continually having increases two or three times the rate of inflation .
julie , dunfermline this is the perfect government indirect taxation under the guise of a local taxation .
it 's about time that this tax was collected at source based on income then the government would then have to take responsibility for this taxation .
jon , ballencrieff , east lothian i think that before council taxes are risen , the local authorities should sort out the shambolic collection system .
i 've been trying to sort out my council tax with glasgow city council for nearly a year .
every time i send an exemption form , it gets lost , and i was told that there is a six month backlog of correspondence .
thanks to them , i 'm getting threatening letters from bailiffs , when i should be exempt from the beginning .
alaina bell , glasgow , scotland the council tax is simply stupid , it does n't increase accountability , it 's not based on ability to pay and it 's far far far too high .
the scottish executive and all the councils seem to think that a 5 % increase is fine , well it 's not .
this is double inflation and it 's been that way for years .
could councils be more efficient ?
of course they could ! !
look at the example of that other useless public body - scottish water .
water charges are three times - that 's 300 % - higher than in england , and the scottish executive has just protected scottish water from competition - why ?
the customer culture , which is so strong in the private sector , simply does not exist in the public sector , and why should it , they will get paid no matter how bad they are .
it 's time for a change , a huge radical change .
do we actually need 32 councils in tiny scotland ?
in fact do we need any at all ?
ian , glasgow council tax is only part of the amount of money councils receive .
i would imagine one reason for the rise is that central government are not pumping more into councils .
ultimately the money comes from you , so take your pick is it your council or income tax you want to rise ?
rod , edinburgh as a council tax payer i think the consensus is that for every increase in council tax there is little improvement for the average householder to see .
as a council worker i see mismanagement of budgets and employees with little to do .
so in effect i feel there are other ways to increase the council revenue .
the councils should treat their organisations more like a business and pay heed to budgets and deadlines .
l fraser , edinburgh , scotland i would n't mind these increases if we actually saw any benefit from them in terms of service improvement .
however , commercial awareness , and indeed common sense , appears to be sadly lacking in many local authorities .
in edinburgh £ 70,000 has just been spent on a vehicle mounted laser device for detecting pot holes in the roads .
surely edinburgh city could have just asked their own staff to report pot holes as part of their responsibilities while carrying out other council business .
i 'm sure they would get results far more quickly , with wider coverage and at minimal cost .
dirk , edinburgh i think it is an absolute disgrace .
i am single and work very hard for what i have .
i am seriously thinking about moving out of glasgow as the council tax is now unaffordable .
aileen wilson , glasgow there would be no need for council tax rises if someone went and did a detailed analysis of where councils are wasting money , or spending money on things that are non essential , and identified what could be cut from their budgets .
dougie birrell , north queensferry , fife so much has been said about the unfairness of the current tax system , but there is very little coming forward in the way of alternatives .
how about the american purchase tax system , where there would be a national goods and service tax and a local tax added on top for the services .
this would ' tax ' the people who have more to spend and would also have the benefit of taking some income from tourists who use the services provided and paid for by the local inhabitants .
it would be good to hear some views on this .
i think scotland could well take a lead on this way to pay for our councils .
murray welsh , edinburgh i pay more than my fair share of tax , i have always worked - very hard !
i do that for me and my family - no-one else !
i 'm not a charity and i 'm hacked off at being treated like one .
there comes a point when there is no more to give .
i 'm there and i earn a good salary .
why should i and those like me always be the first port of call when the government needs more money .
because that 's exactly what happens when council tax is based on the value of your home .
they should be going back to basics and seeing where they can save money .
and i do n't mean by cutting services , i mean by being more efficient .
we have a government that is not accountable and a local government structure that is run by amateurs .
what hope really of improvements ?
we pay too much tax period .
savings are taxed , insurance is taxed , clothing is taxed , fuel is taxed , roads are taxed , entertainment is taxed , the roof over our heads is taxed , the list is quite frankly endless .

denise ferguson , falkirk it goes up every year .
i do n't know how they can justify such a large increase .
my wages have n't changed for the last three years .
sean carr , aberdeen as a single parent who only receives help from the working families tax credit , it would be just another bill that mounts up .
it 's the principle .
maybe the government need to do more to help people as opposed to taking from them .
nicola dow , west lothian , scotland as usual the council tax increase is greater than inflation .

kevin , west lothian i for one would like to know what my council tax is being spent on , and as to why it needs to go up .
after many months on complaining , my local council have still not fixed the dangerously crumbling wall or pavement outside my flat , supplied us with a replacement bin for the one stolen , nor fixed the large open hole by the road nearby .

every time i send an exemption form , it gets lost , and i was told that there is a six month backlog of correspondence .
thanks to them , i 'm getting threatening letters from bailiffs , when i should be exempt from the beginning .
alaina bell , glasgow , scotland the council tax is simply stupid , it does n't increase accountability , it 's not based on ability to pay and it 's far far far too high .
the scottish executive and all the councils seem to think that a 5 % increase is fine , well it 's not .
this is double inflation and it 's been that way for years .
could councils be more efficient ?
of course they could ! !
look at the example of that other useless public body - scottish water .
water charges are three times - that 's 300 % - higher than in england , and the scottish executive has just protected scottish water from competition - why ?
the customer culture , which is so strong in the private sector , simply does not exist in the public sector , and why should it , they will get paid no matter how bad they are .
it 's time for a change , a huge radical change .
do we actually need 32 councils in tiny scotland ?
in fact do we need any at all ?
ian , glasgow council tax is only part of the amount of money councils receive .
i would imagine one reason for the rise is that central government are not pumping more into councils .
ultimately the money comes from you , so take your pick is it your council or income tax you want to rise ?
rod , edinburgh as a council tax payer i think the consensus is that for every increase in council tax there is little improvement for the average householder to see .
as a council worker i see mismanagement of budgets and employees with little to do .
so in effect i feel there are other ways to increase the council revenue .
the councils should treat their organisations more like a business and pay heed to budgets and deadlines .
l fraser , edinburgh , scotland i would n't mind these increases if we actually saw any benefit from them in terms of service improvement .
however , commercial awareness , and indeed common sense , appears to be sadly lacking in many local authorities .
in edinburgh £ 70,000 has just been spent on a vehicle mounted laser device for detecting pot holes in the roads .
surely edinburgh city could have just asked their own staff to report pot holes as part of their responsibilities while carrying out other council business .
i 'm sure they would get results far more quickly , with wider coverage and at minimal cost .
dirk , edinburgh i think it is an absolute disgrace .
i am single and work very hard for what i have .
i am seriously thinking about moving out of glasgow as the council tax is now unaffordable .
aileen wilson , glasgow there would be no need for council tax rises if someone went and did a detailed analysis of where councils are wasting money , or spending money on things that are non essential , and identified what could be cut from their budgets .
dougie birrell , north queensferry , fife so much has been said about the unfairness of the current tax system , but there is very little coming forward in the way of alternatives .
how about the american purchase tax system , where there would be a national goods and service tax and a local tax added on top for the services .
this would ' tax ' the people who have more to spend and would also have the benefit of taking some income from tourists who use the services provided and paid for by the local inhabitants .
it would be good to hear some views on this .
i think scotland could well take a lead on this way to pay for our councils .
murray welsh , edinburgh i pay more than my fair share of tax , i have always worked - very hard !
i do that for me and my family - no-one else !
i 'm not a charity and i 'm hacked off at being treated like one .
there comes a point when there is no more to give .
i 'm there and i earn a good salary .
why should i and those like me always be the first port of call when the government needs more money .
because that 's exactly what happens when council tax is based on the value of your home .
they should be going back to basics and seeing where they can save money .
and i do n't mean by cutting services , i mean by being more efficient .
we have a government that is not accountable and a local government structure that is run by amateurs .
what hope really of improvements ?
we pay too much tax period .
savings are taxed , insurance is taxed , clothing is taxed , fuel is taxed , roads are taxed , entertainment is taxed , the roof over our heads is taxed , the list is quite frankly endless .
the point we are all missing is that the money that pays for all of these things has already been taxed !
denise ferguson , falkirk it goes up every year .
i do n't know how they can justify such a large increase .
my wages have n't changed for the last three years .
sean carr , aberdeen as a single parent who only receives help from the working families tax credit , it would be just another bill that mounts up .
it 's the principle .
maybe the government need to do more to help people as opposed to taking from them .
nicola dow , west lothian , scotland as usual the council tax increase is greater than inflation .
robert , glasgow the system requires a fundamental overhaul , the council should learn to cut its cloth to fit its suit .
kevin , west lothian i for one would like to know what my council tax is being spent on , and as to why it needs to go up .
after many months on complaining , my local council have still not fixed the dangerously crumbling wall or pavement outside my flat , supplied us with a replacement bin for the one stolen , nor fixed the large open hole by the road nearby .
what do we really get out of this ? !
martha , edinburgh , scotland as someone who works in local government i am increasing annoyed at the level of waste and the move away from core services to fund dubious events and initiatives .
as an edinburgh council tax payer i would prefer my council tax to pay for clean streets , improved public transport , investment in education and social services and not to waste on hogmanay street parties .
jane , edinburgh council tax up again , review on the way .
it 's a sham really .
the inefficiency and ineptitude of local councils would be funny if it were n't real .
that 's the heart of the matter , there 's no point changing the system until councils are brought up to scratch in efficiency terms , then we 'd see increases more in line with inflation .
i 'd vote for the introduction of a local tax based on ability to pay , not on the value of your property .
the poll tax was a fairer system , badly implemented .
the irony for me is that tommy sheridan , who was jailed over poll tax , is now campaigning for its return in a revised form .
neil mckinlay , falkirk , scotland my wife and i are both employed in the public sector .
our house has doubled in value in the past five years , however , our salaries have not - thus to base a tax on the value of your property seems inherently unfair .
there has been recent talk of rejigging the bands to take account of the housing market boom .
in 1998 we bought a house we could afford , in 2004 no honest building society would give us a mortgage to buy the same house at its current value .
property values are only pertinent at the time of purchase and over time do not give a true reflection of a person 's ability to pay .
gavin , glasgow i have always believed in paying for services received , but what i do n't believe in is paying for other people to use these services without paying .
why is n't there more pressure on people who do n't bother paying ?
these people are making the rest of us look like fools .
mind you , with people in authority bucking the system why should we care ?
mrs a walker , glasgow every year the tax increases by more than the inflation rates and the quality and amount of services are cut .
the increases affect everyone and the honest taxpayer has to cut his cloth etc . , whereas the council impose increases which everyone find increasingly difficult to pay .
with the house prices rising as they are , and the number of new houses being built especially in my area , you would expect the councils would be rubbing their hands from the extra revenue they must be collecting from these changes alone .
how are buyers encouraged to abide by the law and pay this tax , which it is based on rateable values , which the councils and government are soon to embark on a revaluation exercise which will increase the payments even more .
can we not relook at the " households " ability to pay , in line with the concept of the old poll tax .

council tax bills in scotland are set to increase by an average of 4.4 % for the coming year .
most of the 32 local authorities met on thursday to decide on their charges for the next 12 months .
the individual increases ranged from under 2 % to almost 10 % at band d level .
the announcements came amid mounting calls for the reform or abolition of the system , which will be considered as part of a planned review of local government finance .
bbc news online scotland asked for your views on the council tax rise in your area and how it affects you .
we had a large response to this e-mail discussion and here is selection of your views .
this have your say is now closed .
whatever scheme was in place some groups of people would complain about it .
i live in glasgow and as far as i see we have the highest council tax in scotland , all be it the lowest increase .
so what do we get for this money ?
our bins and rubbish taken away , streets cleaned by an army of cleaners , the roads gritted within minuets of snow and ice , free and well maintained parks to enjoy , free museums and subsidised city parking and much more .
we get the elderly visited every day if need be , schools and nurseries upgraded , we get our water rates included ... what else do you want , if you want a western hip city someone -lrb- us -rrb- have to pay for it , or would you like to live in a slum as was many years ago .
stop moaning and pay up ...
glasgow 's worth it by far .
darren morris , glasgow i am really annoyed .
bought my first house in july and had a difficult six months so far .
anticipate the next six months to be just as hard .
i am loving living on my own , but it 's a real struggle to pay all the bills .
an increase in council tax is all i need ! ! !
morgan johnstone , edinburgh , scotland where were all you people when the scottish socialist party effectively destroyed any chance of the poll tax working ?
that was n't based on the price of your house , poor people got reduced charges and every single adult paid their share .
of course poll tax may well have risen at the same astronomical rates as council tax due to inept , unaccountable councils .
what you should worry more about is the differential between scotland and england averages .
in england the average is around £ 1,000 but that includes water and sewerage , you scots need to pay for water and sewerage on top -lrb- and it 's not like scotland is ever short of water ! -rrb- .
bob , uk to those advocating a return to the poll tax type of setup .
the last time it was in force my wife was unable to work yet she was expected to pay the full tax .
she had no income at all which meant both our taxes had to come out of our already stretched single wage .
the same thing is happening with the council tax .
it keeps climbing and services are being reduced yet councillors can jet all over the place for their little fact-finding missions .
they do n't need to increase this tax or even change it .
they just have to get council spending into line and stop wasting money on someone 's bright ideas .
hugh , dumbarton the big problem is that there 's no way that the level that councillors set the council tax affects them personally .
they can always vote to increase their own salaries and allowances to cover any increase that the rest of us have to pay .
the argument that they can always be booted out at the ballot box is a non-starter in so many councils where there is either near one-party rule or rule by cliques of " independents " where it does n't matter who you vote for a politician always gets in .
what about a simple system - for every percentage point over inflation that a council increases its council tax , the councillors lose a percentage point off their salaries and allowances , and vice versa .
it would clarify their minds wonderfully .
james , moray if pay rises are set at the rate of inflation then on what or whose authority does moray council have the right to raise our taxes by 9.8 % ?
gas , electric , fuel and other items have gone up but wages are not .
how do we afford this new rise ?
ian geddes , elgin councils should be made more accountable on how they spend tax payers ' money .
the only reason glasgow 's council tax has the lowest increase is because they made huge increases in the earlier years , but glaswegians are still paying the highest council tax in scotland .
i am now considering moving outside glasgow to save money .
britain , especially scotland , is becoming a tax state .
it wo n't be long before our salaries are taken at source and pocket money given to us .
john cairns , glasgow it is a disgrace when the area of scotland which is statistically has the lowest wages has the largest increase in council tax .
something is not right here !
helen ford , moray , scotland i work hard for what i have but another increase can not be justified especially since i see nothing for it .
all the talk about changing it to income based will just make things worse as i already pay enough tax .
so get the councils to get their houses in order first before you ask the public to pay any more and you never know we maybe due money back andrew , lanarkshire i 'm a civil servant and this year received a pay rise of £ 41.00 per month , after tax & national insurance contributions .
i am better off by £ 18.00 per month .
council tax is set to rise in my area , about 3.5 % although this is lower than the national average , it 's very worrying for me .
i 've still to take into account water and sewerage rises , rent and general cost of living rises .
after all this is paid i 'll be worse off ! !
it seems to be for the average person in britain , the harder you work the more your penalised .
as usual , the middle man always looses out !
lisa davies , motherwell , scotland i do n't know where the government think we can keep magically producing these above-inflation rises from our monthly salaries which are not even rising in line with inflation .
i 'd also like to know what we are paying for .
living in a rural community , i now have no post office and shop , non-existent transport links and every road out of the village has potholes requiring you to drive down the centre of the road to avoid constant damage to your car .
it seems to me that all my council tax is paying for at the moment is my bin emptied once a week .
something needs to be done to change the system , although i do think that a local income based tax will only serve to make the average family pay more .
what about all those people down south who are managing to pay £ 500,000 or more for houses ?
the old rateable value system seemed fairer to me .
michelle , east ayrshire surely it is time to do something about the regressive nature of our taxation system .
the poorest are paying more of their income proportionally for vat , income tax , national insurance and then the council tax comes as big whammy on top .
i think the time is becoming ripe for withholding the payments until they come up with something fairer .
sean , paisley , scotland it can hardly come as a surprise -lrb- because it was so widely predicted -rrb- that a soviet-style republic is emerging in scotland where the " rich " -lrb- those silly enough to work -rrb- are subject to persecution levels of council tax in order to finance the expanding leisure interests of the burgeoning welfare class .
ubi , aberdeen think it is terrible that the rates go up yet again , east dunbartonshire has the highest rate of payers and still they are increased .
very little has been done to merit the increase .
miss scott , kirkintilloch , east dunbartonshire perhaps if councils remembered that they work for us , the scottish voter , and did n't waste money on schemes which no-one wants or wo n't work , then perhaps the charges wo n't increase .
if edinburgh council can afford a £ 900,000 prize for the person who thinks up a slogan for edinburgh , or stopped wasting money by not taking trips abroad to evaluate how other tram systems work , then perhaps we would n't see suck a large increase .
craig , edinburgh i know councils rely more on government grant than council tax for their funding but they ca n't justify continually having increases two or three times the rate of inflation .
julie , dunfermline this is the perfect government indirect taxation under the guise of a local taxation .
it 's about time that this tax was collected at source based on income then the government would then have to take responsibility for this taxation .
jon , ballencrieff , east lothian i think that before council taxes are risen , the local authorities should sort out the shambolic collection system .
i 've been trying to sort out my council tax with glasgow city council for nearly a year .
every time i send an exemption form , it gets lost , and i was told that there is a six month backlog of correspondence .

in japan , trading conditions have been tougher , because of the weak economy , and the greater severity of food scares such as mad-cow disease and avian flu .
further costs were triggered by its withdrawal from a pret-a-manger sandwich chain joint venture .

it should give engineers early notice of problems and let them start their repairs as soon as a flight has landed .
airlines would call up their planes on the internet to monitor performance and check indicators against a database held at boeing 's seattle headquarters .
the company says the system , which will launch in april , should significantly reduce the delays faced by passengers .
with the tight turnaround now demanded of aircraft , boeing believes its advanced health management -lrb- ahm -rrb- system will prove a big hit with the airline industry .
bob manelski , who helped develop it , told the bbc : " the idea of the system is to make better use of the data that 's available ; to make better operational decisions and do maintenance in a more proactive fashion ; so that we leave on time , you experience fewer delays and you make your connecting flights on time .
future designs " if in the first hour of the flight i have that information , i know what that fault is , i know what the capability is at the destination .
" i can prepare people with the right parts and the right equipment , so when the aeroplane arrives i am simply repairing the fault - rather than waiting for the aeroplane to arrive and finding the right people , understanding what the problem is and then going across the airport to the stores department . "
mr manelski says the system draws on the experience of 9m flights and highlights how particular faults have been best dealt with in the past .
this has been built into a huge historical database which can be mined by engineers .
" with that immense amount of history we can understand what the failure means and what the most effective way would be of correcting that failure .
" in addition the tool has the ability to learn from experience .
as parts are upgraded , for example , it tells you the most effective fix changes . "
the ahm system has been on trial with three major airlines since november and boeing says it has unquestionably reduced repair times and flight delays for passengers .
the plan eventually is to gather continuous information from hundreds of aeroplanes .
the system , boeing says , has the potential to be much more than just a fault diagnosis tool and could eventually be used as a research and development aid on future plane design .

brake spoke to 1,000 drivers and said 45 % had put lives at risk by doing so , with 10 % " tired driving " once a month .
the survey was released as a government campaign warning drivers of the dangers of tiredness was relaunched .
brake said 20 % of crashes on monotonous roads such as motorways were caused by tired drivers and urged ministers to introduce measures to cut the problem .
' lethal combination ' chief executive mary williams said : " the results are extremely disturbing .
" drivers need to wake up to the fact that tiredness and driving are a potentially lethal combination . "
tired drivers are just as impaired as if they were well over the legal drink-drive alcohol limit " professor jim horne " if you risk getting behind the wheel not having had enough sleep you risk killing yourself and other innocent road users . "
crashes involving tired driving tended to be worse because drivers did not brake before the collision , the charity said .
loughborough university sleep research centre said its studies showed that drivers who had had five hours ' sleep had only a one in ten chance of staying fully awake on a lengthy journey .
professor jim horne said : " if these drivers realised that by driving while tired they are just as impaired as if they were well over the legal drink-drive alcohol limit , then they might have second thoughts . "
government campaign the government is now relaunching its " think do n't drive tired " campaign , first unveiled shortly after driver gary hart was jailed for five years for causing the deaths of 10 people in the selby rail crash .
a jury decided that hart fell asleep at the wheel of his land rover in february 2001 before it plunged off the m62 into the path of an oncoming train .
mary dunn , the widow of the train 's driver steve dunn , told gmtv : " the problem is lack of sleep is not as measurable as alcohol is , but they have now proved that driving without sleep is equivalent to being over the legal limit for alcohol . "
she said people tended not to take the issue so seriously because it was more difficult to prove .
the government advises drivers to plan a 15-minute break every two hours of their journey in which they should drink a caffeinated drink and have a nap .
but brake wants the government to do more and is calling for year-round " tired driving " ad campaigns , continuous modern crash barriers on motorways and a review of the frequency of motorway service stations .
it also wants new laws to force companies employing drivers to introduce risk management policies which include scheduling for breaks .

brake spoke to 1,000 drivers and said 45 % had put lives at risk by doing so , with 10 % " tired driving " once a month .
the survey was released as a government campaign warning drivers of the dangers of tiredness was relaunched .
brake said 20 % of crashes on monotonous roads such as motorways were caused by tired drivers and urged ministers to introduce measures to cut the problem .
' lethal combination ' chief executive mary williams said : " the results are extremely disturbing .
" drivers need to wake up to the fact that tiredness and driving are a potentially lethal combination .
tired drivers are just as impaired as if they were well over the legal drink-drive alcohol limit professor jim horne " if you risk getting behind the wheel not having had enough sleep you risk killing yourself and other innocent road users . "
crashes involving tired driving tended to be worse because drivers did not brake before the collision , the charity said .
loughborough university sleep research centre said its studies showed that drivers who had had five hours ' sleep had only a one in ten chance of staying fully awake on a lengthy journey .
professor jim horne said : " if these drivers realised that by driving while tired they are just as impaired as if they were well over the legal drink-drive alcohol limit , then they might have second thoughts . "
driver gary hart fell asleep at the wheel causing the selby crash government campaign the government is now relaunching its " think do n't drive tired " campaign , first unveiled shortly after driver gary hart was jailed for five years for causing the deaths of 10 people in the selby rail crash .
a jury decided that hart fell asleep at the wheel of his land rover in february 2001 before it plunged off the m62 into the path of an oncoming train .
mary dunn , the widow of the train 's driver steve dunn , told gmtv : " the problem is lack of sleep is not as measurable as alcohol is , but they have now proved that driving without sleep is equivalent to being over the legal limit for alcohol . "
she said people tended not to take the issue so seriously because it was more difficult to prove .
the government advises drivers to plan a 15-minute break every two hours of their journey in which they should drink a caffeinated drink and have a nap .
but brake wants the government to do more and is calling for year-round " tired driving " ad campaigns , continuous modern crash barriers on motorways and a review of the frequency of motorway service stations .

that has just changed .
mr eisner 's battle with comcast , the cable firm whose hostile takeover bid that has rattled his cage , is in a different league from his ongoing feud with founding father walt disney 's nephew , roy .
so far , mr eisner has come out on top in the internal feud , despite name calling by roy disney who in his letter of resignation from the disney board described him as a greedy man without a soul .
but roy disney 's departure did little more than bruise the six-foot-three tall mr eisner .
rather , the top dog arose from the dust to gloat .
excuses ?
disney 's share price gained about a third during 2003 and its latest quarterly figures were pleasant reading after a five-year patch of turbulence and distinctly disappointing results .
the 61-year-old mr eisner is not a pushover , having held on to the top job since 1984 .
throughout tricky periods , the new york-born father of three has revealed an enviable knack of blaming tough market conditions and other factors beyond his control .
suffering theme parks ?
well , it has been the fault of the reluctance of the public to travel following 11 september .
and so on .
but although , from time to time , mr eisner 's excuses may have been convincing , it also seems clear that he has made several inexplicable blunders that have cost disney dear - for example , his much publicised failure to salvage disney 's lucrative distribution deal with the computer animation firm pixar .
there is growing reluctance among his critics , including many disney shareholders , to accept his force majeure -style excuses .
under fire but mr eisner is a survivor .
this has been partly attributed to his firm grip on disney 's board of directors .
is michael eisner a greedy man ?
according to the new york times , " the disney board once included michael eisner 's lawyer , his architect and the principal of his kids ' school " .
business week , meanwhile , has raised questions about the board 's independence , insisting that one current board director 's wife is a well paid disney employee while another is a former disney consultant .
off course , none of this seems to matter to mr eisner .
far from having a tender personality , as one might expect from a former english literature and theatre graduate , he is known for his direct , domineering and somewhat harsh management style .
so make no mistake : mr eisner is not about to leave quietly .
after all , this is the man who , during the 1970s and until he joined disney , built paramount into a leading studio , thereby catching the eye of roy disney who hired him .
this is also the man who during the next 15 years built disney into a formidable media power house , boosting its profits six fold and sending its share price soaring almost 6,000 % .
so there is every reason to expect that mr eisner is about to enter the barricades for a very bitter battle that will do little to enhance disney 's squeaky clean corporate image .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- iran : economy in transition home news sport radio tv weather languages low graphics -pipe- accessibility help one-minute world news news services your news when you want it news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk business market data economy companies health science & environment technology entertainment also in the news - video and audio - programmes have your say in pictures country profiles special reports related bbc sites sport weather on this day editors ' blog last updated : friday , 13 february , 2004 , 08:04 gmt e-mail this to a friend printable version iran : economy in transition analysis by myles neligan bbc news online business reporter iran 's parliamentary elections later this month could determine whether the country achieves its potential as a regional economic superpower .
iran 's great strength is its abundant energy resources : it holds 7 % of the world 's proven oil reserves and its supplies of natural gas are second only to russia 's .
moreover , having avoided the conflict that has engulfed neighbouring afghanistan and iraq in the last three years , iran is currently enjoying something of an economic boom .
the economy has grown by more than 7 % for each of the past two years , and is forecast to expand by a further 6.5 % in 2004 and 2005 .
low levels of public debt , a healthy trade surplus and rising government expenditure complete the benign picture .
downside but despite these encouraging signs , analysts remain highly cautious about iran 's future prospects .
whoever is in power will eventually have to come to terms with the same problems dr ali ansari , university of exeter ratings agency fitch describes investing in iran as " highly speculative , " carrying a similar degree of risk as putting money into the ukraine , indonesia , lesotho , or cape verde .
one reason for this health warning is that iran 's fortunes remain closely tied to oil , despite efforts to diversify the economy .
its current strong performance contrasts starkly with a period of stagnation in the late 1990s , when oil prices were a third lower than they are now .
a second difficulty is that the iranian economy is dominated by a sprawling , inefficient state sector , with private enterprise largely limited to small trading and service businesses .
opportunties for foreign trade , meanwhile , are restricted by sanctions imposed nearly nine years ago by the us , which accuses iran of sponsoring terrorism .
these problems are exacerbated in turn by iran 's extraordinarily youthful population .
nearly a third of its 68 million people are below the age of 14 , putting immense pressure on the country 's labour markets .
with unemployment officially estimated at 16 % of the workforce , but thought in reality to be far higher , iran needs to create about 800,000 new jobs a year just to stand still .
this puts the country under pressure to at least maintain , and preferably surpass , its current growth rate .
stand-off but perhaps the greatest source of uncertainty regarding iran 's economic prospects is its unstable political situation .
since 1997 , power in iran has been finely balanced between supporters of reformist president mohammad khatami and conservatives anxious to preserve the ideals of the 1979 islamic revolution .
oil is the lifeblood of iran 's economy " iran is unusual , " says fitch analyst ed parker .
" the economy is doing quite well , but there is a high degree of political risk . "
that risk will be at the forefront of iran-watchers ' minds as the country prepares to go to the polls on 20 february .
the vote will be a crucial test for president khatami , who has attempted to modernise the economy since coming to power in 1997 .
backed by a large majority in the legislative assembly , the president has focused on sweeping away restrictions on foreign investment .
he has also set up a fund aimed at buffering the economy from oil price fluctuations , and he has eliminated many barriers to foreign trade .
voter apathy but his initiatives have run into stiff resistance from unelected conservative elements in the government , especially the powerful council of guardians , a panel tasked with ensuring that all legislation complies with islamic law .
president khatami : reformist agenda more seriously , president khatami 's economic achievements have come as a disappointment to ordinary iranians , most of whom remain no better off than they were before he came to power .
this has diluted the electorate 's previously fervent support for the reformists , with voter turnout falling steadily over the past three years .
now there is speculation that voters who supported pro-khatami candidates last time , disillusioned by their failure to deliver tangible economic improvements , may stay away from the ballot box in record numbers .
this could hand control of the assembly to the conservatives , casting doubt over the entire economic reform process .
iran 's conservatives are in no mood to compromise , as demonstrated by the council of guardians ' decision earlier this month to ban 2,500 reformist candidates from running for office .
no going back ?
however , many analysts believe that even an outright conservative victory need not necessarily spell the end of efforts to overhaul the economy .
iran 's private sector is under-developed dr ali ansari , lecturer in middle east history at the university of exeter , argues that president khatami 's reforms may now have gathered enough momentum to survive a shift in the balance of power .
" fixing the economy will require a considerable effort of political will , " he says .
" but whoever is in power will have to come to terms with the same problems , " he says .

iran 's great strength is its abundant energy resources : it holds 7 % of the world 's proven oil reserves and its supplies of natural gas are second only to russia 's .
moreover , having avoided the conflict that has engulfed neighbouring afghanistan and iraq in the last three years , iran is currently enjoying something of an economic boom .
the economy has grown by more than 7 % for each of the past two years , and is forecast to expand by a further 6.5 % in 2004 and 2005 .
low levels of public debt , a healthy trade surplus and rising government expenditure complete the benign picture .
downside but despite these encouraging signs , analysts remain highly cautious about iran 's future prospects .
whoever is in power will eventually have to come to terms with the same problems dr ali ansari , university of exeter ratings agency fitch describes investing in iran as " highly speculative , " carrying a similar degree of risk as putting money into the ukraine , indonesia , lesotho , or cape verde .
one reason for this health warning is that iran 's fortunes remain closely tied to oil , despite efforts to diversify the economy .
its current strong performance contrasts starkly with a period of stagnation in the late 1990s , when oil prices were a third lower than they are now .
a second difficulty is that the iranian economy is dominated by a sprawling , inefficient state sector , with private enterprise largely limited to small trading and service businesses .
opportunties for foreign trade , meanwhile , are restricted by sanctions imposed nearly nine years ago by the us , which accuses iran of sponsoring terrorism .
these problems are exacerbated in turn by iran 's extraordinarily youthful population .
nearly a third of its 68 million people are below the age of 14 , putting immense pressure on the country 's labour markets .
with unemployment officially estimated at 16 % of the workforce , but thought in reality to be far higher , iran needs to create about 800,000 new jobs a year just to stand still .
this puts the country under pressure to at least maintain , and preferably surpass , its current growth rate .
stand-off but perhaps the greatest source of uncertainty regarding iran 's economic prospects is its unstable political situation .
since 1997 , power in iran has been finely balanced between supporters of reformist president mohammad khatami and conservatives anxious to preserve the ideals of the 1979 islamic revolution .
oil is the lifeblood of iran 's economy " iran is unusual , " says fitch analyst ed parker .
" the economy is doing quite well , but there is a high degree of political risk . "
that risk will be at the forefront of iran-watchers ' minds as the country prepares to go to the polls on 20 february .
the vote will be a crucial test for president khatami , who has attempted to modernise the economy since coming to power in 1997 .
backed by a large majority in the legislative assembly , the president has focused on sweeping away restrictions on foreign investment .
he has also set up a fund aimed at buffering the economy from oil price fluctuations , and he has eliminated many barriers to foreign trade .
voter apathy but his initiatives have run into stiff resistance from unelected conservative elements in the government , especially the powerful council of guardians , a panel tasked with ensuring that all legislation complies with islamic law .
president khatami : reformist agenda more seriously , president khatami 's economic achievements have come as a disappointment to ordinary iranians , most of whom remain no better off than they were before he came to power .
this has diluted the electorate 's previously fervent support for the reformists , with voter turnout falling steadily over the past three years .
now there is speculation that voters who supported pro-khatami candidates last time , disillusioned by their failure to deliver tangible economic improvements , may stay away from the ballot box in record numbers .
this could hand control of the assembly to the conservatives , casting doubt over the entire economic reform process .
iran 's conservatives are in no mood to compromise , as demonstrated by the council of guardians ' decision earlier this month to ban 2,500 reformist candidates from running for office .
no going back ?
however , many analysts believe that even an outright conservative victory need not necessarily spell the end of efforts to overhaul the economy .
iran 's private sector is under-developed dr ali ansari , lecturer in middle east history at the university of exeter , argues that president khatami 's reforms may now have gathered enough momentum to survive a shift in the balance of power .
" fixing the economy will require a considerable effort of political will , " he says .
" but whoever is in power will have to come to terms with the same problems , " he says .

a commons watchdog 's report points to the national centre for popular music in sheffield and the dovecot arts centre in stockton-on-tees .
and it says another £ 78m spent by arts council england is tied up in five projects facing cash problems .
but the mps say the arts council has made changes and overall is now taking a sensible approach .
and they call for lottery funding to be spread among smaller , regional arts projects .
better forecasts of visitor numbers at proposed attractions is also needed before making funding promises , they argue .
' action still needed ' the findings come in a commons public accounts committee report on 15 major projects funded by arts council england .
the mps examined the projects in 1999 and found most of them were running late and the total cost overrun was £ 94m .
five years on , they say the council has improved its handling of capital grants and taken steps to reduce the risks of similar problems on future projects .
" all in all the things that arts council england has done are sensible and in the spirit of the committee 's previous report on these projects , " says the report .
but there are still areas where the council and the department for culture , media and sport need to take action , it argues .
the closure of the two centres and the financial problems facing other schemes means the arts council does not have a " strong track record on project viability " , it adds .
audiences too narrow ?
conservative mp edward leigh , who chairs the committee , said lottery players would be unimpressed with the cash problems .
" arts council england must make sure the changes it has made to its approach pay off in delivering viable projects based on a proper strategy and realistic projections of visitor numbers , " he said .
" i also want to see arts council england getting more lottery funding to small bodies and communities outside london . "
the committee also said the arts council did not seem to collect information routinely on the backgrounds of audiences .
but information given to the mps indicated that audiences " remain disproportionately drawn from particular sections of society " .
peter hewitt , chief executive of arts council england , said : " most of these projects date back to 1996 .
we have acted on all the pac recommendations made since then .
" almost all of the 15 projects considered by the pac , including the sadler 's wells theatre , the royal court theatre , the royal opera house , milton keynes theatre and gallery and manchester royal exchange are a fantastic success with the public . "

a commons watchdog 's report points to the national centre for popular music in sheffield and the dovecot arts centre in stockton-on-tees .
and it says another £ 78m spent by arts council england is tied up in five projects facing cash problems .
but the mps say the arts council has made changes and overall is now taking a sensible approach .
and they call for lottery funding to be spread among smaller , regional arts projects .
better forecasts of visitor numbers at proposed attractions is also needed before making funding promises , they argue .
' action still needed ' the findings come in a commons public accounts committee report on 15 major projects funded by arts council england .
the mps examined the projects in 1999 and found most of them were running late and the total cost overrun was £ 94m .
five years on , they say the council has improved its handling of capital grants and taken steps to reduce the risks of similar problems on future projects .
" all in all the things that arts council england has done are sensible and in the spirit of the committee 's previous report on these projects , " says the report .
but there are still areas where the council and the department for culture , media and sport need to take action , it argues .
the closure of the two centres and the financial problems facing other schemes means the arts council does not have a " strong track record on project viability " , it adds .
audiences too narrow ?
conservative mp edward leigh , who chairs the committee , said lottery players would be unimpressed with the cash problems .
" arts council england must make sure the changes it has made to its approach pay off in delivering viable projects based on a proper strategy and realistic projections of visitor numbers , " he said .
" i also want to see arts council england getting more lottery funding to small bodies and communities outside london . "
the committee also said the arts council did not seem to collect information routinely on the backgrounds of audiences .
but information given to the mps indicated that audiences " remain disproportionately drawn from particular sections of society " .
peter hewitt , chief executive of arts council england , said : " most of these projects date back to 1996 .
we have acted on all the pac recommendations made since then .
" almost all of the 15 projects considered by the pac , including the sadler 's wells theatre , the royal court theatre , the royal opera house , milton keynes theatre and gallery and manchester royal exchange are a fantastic success with the public . "

analysis by stephen evans bbc north america business correspondent when aol merged with time warner , ted turner said it was as good as making love for the first time .
some of the press coverage was breathless : " the visionaries were right : the future is about convergence .
and for many observers , the exciting thing about the aol time warner merger is its sheer size , " said one magazine .
the word " synergy " was everywhere .
mega-deals , bringing together both ends of the media industry - programme-making and programme-delivery to homes - was the dream come true .
as we now know , it was a dream that turned into a bit of a nightmare .
aol , the upstart new-tech predator which gobbled up the rather large prey , has now been dropped from the merged company 's title , so ill-fitting was the match .
comcast executives pointed out that disney was now what one called ' talent repellent ' so when merrill lynch calls a merger of cable tv operator comcast and disney " a perfect , brilliant combination " , we must take a breath , take another breath and do a lot of thinking .
we might also ponder the unhappy experience of daimlerchrysler as we scratch our heads .
mega companies can be an amalgam of cultures that clash .
bitterness comcast , however , does have some persuasive arguments .
its top executives pointed out when they announced the proposed deal that their management - that is , er , themselves - were tried and tested and found sound .
the company had taken over at & t 's cable business and integrated it smoothly into its operation .
they also pointed out that disney was now what one called " talent repellent " .
there does now seem to be an unanswerable imperative towards merger that may be taking it too far , but there 's no doubt that disney is not a happy place and talented people have left with some bitterness .
ironically , one of those people is stephen burke who runs comcast 's cable business after working in three different divisions of disney over 12 years .
comcast knows how disney operates because comcast executives have worked there .
on top of that , aol time warner may not be the best template .
flak perhaps , news corporation 's takeover of directv is a happier precedent .
rupert murdoch has merged two ends of the media business seamlessly without drawing much flak .
arguably , comcast and disney ought to be a better fit because cable rather than the satellite , which directv uses for its network , seems to be the better medium for conveying programmes to homes .
whatever the doubts about size , there does now seem to be an unanswerable imperative towards merger : technology has changed and so , therefore , has the natural configuration of industries .
where programme-making and programme-distribution seemed to be worlds apart now they are clearly part of the same business , so the logic is to create companies that cover the whole patch .
mr murdoch knows that ; mr roberts of comcast knows that ; richard parsons of time warner knows that .
michael eisner of disney may know that , but is unlikely to admit it .
he may draw comfort from an anecdote of nearly a century ago .

the butler inquiry has also confirmed that all its hearings will be held in private to avoid giving the public a partial view of the evidence .
the inquiry committee will start taking evidence in april but will only discuss its work when it reports in the summer .
the liberal democrats say their refusal to take part in the inquiry has been vindicated by the latest news .
key judgements tony blair called the inquiry after mounting pressure , caused by the american decision to hold an inquiry , the remarks of former weapons inspector david kay , and the failure to find any weapons stockpiles in iraq .
anybody with information for the inquiry , which is chaired by former cabinet secretary lord butler , is asked to come forward by 31 march .
the inquiry says it will " focus principally on structures , systems and processes rather than on the actions of individuals " .
mr blair has said the judgement on whether military action was right has to stay with politicians rather than being decided by the inquiry .
and he has argued the inquiry should not be a re-run of the hutton report , which cleared the government of embellishing its dossier on iraq 's alleged weapons of mass destruction .
public dissatisfied ?
unlike the hutton inquiry , witnesses will be questioned by the committee , rather than legal counsel .
lib dem foreign affairs spokesman sir menzies campbell told bbc radio 4 's today programme the inquiry 's latest announcement justified the concerns voiced by his party when it was set up .
he pointed to the focus on systems rather than individuals .
" that inevitably means that there will be no reference either to the competence or to the judgement of the politicians which took the decision that the only way to deal with saddam hussein and the threat it was said he posed was to take military action , " he said .
" that , i do not believe , will satisfy the public , after all for whose satisfaction this inquiry has been set up . "
the conservatives insisted the inquiry 's remit cover the way intelligence was used before the war , saying that meant politicians ' actions would be investigated .
there will be great interest in what the inquiry makes of the way the claim weapons of mass destruction could be launched within 45 minutes , was presented in the september 2002 dossier on iraq .
some newspapers took this to mean that weapons could be launched against cyprus within 45 minutes .

they 're an american couple very much in love .
" yes we are , " says andrea , a trainee lawyer .
" absolutely - sickeningly so , " adds michael , who is a few years older than his bride to be .
but are they really a perfect match ?
the bbc took them to a research centre at the university of washington in seattle that has been dubbed the " love lab " .
its real name is the relationship research institute .
it is here that scientists say they have created a mathematical model that can tell which marriages are doomed to end in divorce .
psychologist john gottman and applied mathematicians james murray and kristin swanson claim their predictions have 94 % accuracy - and this after viewing just the first few moments of a conversation about an area of marital contention .
lies and videotape subjects brought into the lab like michael and andrea have to fill out questionnaires to identify their personality types .
what we 're trying to do is really understand what makes relationships work john gottman , relationship research institute they are then hooked up to equipment to monitor physical and emotional responses during a discussion on a thorny issue such as money .
swanson goes through the data .
she used to be sceptical about the idea of an equation for love .
" there 's quite a bit more to it than just maths , " she said .
" when i initially started working on this , i thought there was no way you could quantify anything like this .
it did n't make any sense to me whatsoever .
" but across four different studies now we 've been able to find for about 500 different couples that we can predict their outcome with over 90 % accuracy . "
the model was developed using data collected from a mountain of videotaped conversations between couples .
physiological data , such as pulse rates , also was collected and analysed .
rocky ratio the spiky conversations are said to reflect underlying problems a couple have and that is why the model is so predictive .
have your say the secret to a happy marriage is selflessness instead of selfishness randal bagwell , texas , usa send us your comments " before this model was developed , divorce prediction was not accurate , " gottman said , " and we had no idea how to analyse what we call the masters and disasters of marriage - those long-term happily married and divorced couples . "
the key turned out to be quantifying the ratio of positive to negative interactions during the talks .
the magic ratio is five to one , and a marriage can be in trouble when it falls below this .
the mathematical model charts this interaction into what the researchers call a " dow-jones industrial average for marital conversation " .
" when the masters of marriage are talking about something important , they may be arguing , but they are also laughing and teasing and there are signs of affection because they have made emotional connections , " gottman said .
" but a lot of people do n't know how to connect or how to build a sense of humour , and this means a lot of fighting that couples engage in is a failure to make emotional connections .
we would n't have known this without the mathematical model . "
heat rising as andrea and michael wait for their numbers to be crunched , are they nervous ?
" i 'm confident , we 'll pass , " laughs michael .
andrea adds : " that conversion was just us - we know we 're going to be together forever , so we just hope the study says the same thing . "
and it seems the love lab agrees .
gottman has good news .
" the prognosis is very good .
we predict you will have a very good relationship - a very real relationship , " he tells them .
" what we 're trying to do is really understand what makes relationships work .
and once people understand that , we can help people build romance and passion . "
gottman and his colleagues described their work on thursday to the annual meeting of the american association for the advancement of science held this year in seattle .
