it was the third wave of so-called " monday demonstrations , " a term used by eastern germans during their protests in 1989 that toppled communism in the region and paved the way for german unification .
curiously enough , the protests in the east this time are directed against a democratically elected government and it ’ s the former communists of the leftist pds that stands to profit most .
" the reforms are hurting the poor while the rich continue to pocket huge profits , " one berlin protester told deutsche welle .
these popular perceptions of schröder ’ s welfare reforms are providing the perfect breeding ground for the comeback of germany ‘ s post-communists .
after crashing out of the national parliament two years ago , they have now surged to a record high in opinion polls , enjoying 7 percent support nationwide .
in economically depressed eastern regions , the pds is now the second-strongest party .
hitting society 's weakest ?
the reformed communists ' charismatic figurehead , gregor gysi , says his party was just putting a finger on the sore spots of schröder ’ s reform policy .
" the economic situation in eastern germany , " he said , " doesn ’ t seem to matter anymore - neither to the government nor to parliament .
in addition , the cuts always hit the weakest in society while the well-to-do are left untouched . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several thousand eastern germans partake in a recent monday demonstration in leipzig anger over the government ’ s welfare cuts is especially strong in eastern germany , because the majority of the 3 million people who are affected by them live there .
the new measures include stiff means-testing and deep cuts in monthly benefit payments for the long-term unemployed .
the chancellor ’ s social democrats are feeling the heat , and with only 21 percent support in the opinion polls , they are trailing the pds by 5 percent ahead of two regional elections in eastern german states .
is populism on the rise ?
spd leaders like party manager uwe benneter are growing nervous and have accused the post communists of stoking popular fears .
" the pds is exploiting the reforms for electioneering purposes in a disgustingly populist manner , " benneter said .
" we must strengthen our campaign to debunk those who are intent only on stoking anger without presenting alternative solutions of their own . "
political analysts believe , however , that the protests are underscoring a persistent trend in the electorate in the east that includes a drift away from the established parties towards those on the extremes .
" there is indeed a danger of that , and it is being sustained by the fact that eastern germans have never had strong party affiliations , " said michael edinger , a political scientist at jena university .
" we ’ re also coming to realize that such loose political ties could be the future of politics in all of germany , raising the specter of large numbers of protest voters quite ready to support extremist parties at the ballot box . "
rightwing-extremist parties are already profiting from the mass protests .
in saxony the national democratic party could enter the regional parliament in september .
the party could increase its votes from one and half to over 5 percent compared the last election , polls have shown .
meanwhile , in brandenburg the german people ’ s union is expected to hold its seats in parliament .
both parties have waged anti-reform campaigns as seeking to stoke resentment towards foreigners . uwe hessler -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de can minimum wage debate pacify protesters ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.08.2004 can minimum wage debate pacify protesters ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests are expected in 140 german towns and cities monday as demonstrators take to germany 's streets again on monday to protest the government ’ s planned labor reforms , the spd is trying to diffuse the discontent by rekindling a public debate on minimum wages . although the government has made it abundantly clear that the planned social cuts will not be watered down any further , germany ’ s ruling social democrats have a vested interest in keeping their popularity from slipping any further ahead of crucial regional elections next month . the poll , in the eastern state of brandenburg may leave the spd with the unparalleled dilemma of trailing behind the leftist party of democratic socialism which - while not offering any sound concepts of its own – is currently riding on a wave of voter disenchantment with the social democrats .
now , in an apparent bid to sweeten the harsh , but necessary social cuts ahead , spd chief franz müntefering has launched a fresh debate on possible legislation governing the country 's minimum wage .
no taboo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd party chief franz muentefering as it stands , there are no relevant state regulations in place , as wages are invariably defined tariff negotiations between management and trade unions .
on sunday , müntefering said that the traditional tariff autonomy should not be treated as a taboo , but warned against jumping to conclusions . “ we ’ re currently debating this issue with the trade unions .
some unions are in favor of legislation on minimum wages , others aren ’ t .
i myself have been hesitant in the past to push for minimum wages , as such a move amounts to an attack on the country ’ s tariff autonomy , if you choose to see it that way .
but of course we also have to see the negative effects of wage dumping policies .
so , my party is willing to debate this at length with the unions , and i ’ m optimistic that we ’ ll reach a consensus in the autumn , ” he said .
müntefering ’ s offer to debate this issue with the trade unions has drawn mixed reactions from policy-makers across the political spectrum .
the opposition liberal democrats have rejected the idea outright , and social democratic economics and labor minister wolfgang clement isn ’ t amused either .
“ i ’ m in favour of looking at the situation in various industries .
i don ’ t think that legislation on minimum wages would make sense for all sectors .
and whether the trade unions are willing to at least partly give up the decades-old principle of tariff autonomy remains to be seen , ” clement said . open to consideration for their part , the trade unions have indicated their willingness to discuss the possibility of legislation in coming weeks .
margret moehring-rahne , deputy head of germany ’ s powerful service sector union , ver.di believes that minimum wages would help to cushion the impact of the labor reforms , meaning the long-term unemployed could not be forced to accept a job if the payment were outside the agreed minimum wage bracket .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal labor agency is stamped with a ' no ' to reforms the question to be considered is whether minimum wages will really assist workers by helping to prevent the exploitation of the lowest paid , or harm them by pricing low-skilled workers out of the labor force altogether .
supporters of minimum wages argue that higher wages will create greater spending power , thus ultimately cranking up the demand for larger workforces . that at least is the theory , and negotiations between the government and the trade unions in the coming weeks will show whether germany gets a chance to put it to the test . hardy graupner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press review : do we need a minimum wage ?

now , in an apparent bid to sweeten the harsh , but necessary social cuts ahead , spd chief franz müntefering has launched a fresh debate on possible legislation governing the country 's minimum wage .
no taboo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd party chief franz muentefering as it stands , there are no relevant state regulations in place , as wages are invariably defined tariff negotiations between management and trade unions .

some unions are in favor of legislation on minimum wages , others aren ’ t .

i don ’ t think that legislation on minimum wages would make sense for all sectors .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal labor agency is stamped with a ' no ' to reforms the question to be considered is whether minimum wages will really assist workers by helping to prevent the exploitation of the lowest paid , or harm them by pricing low-skilled workers out of the labor force altogether .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.08.2004 ex-communists ride high on protest wave großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pds figurehead gregor gysi says reforms are hitting the poorest the success of germany 's " monday demonstrations , " are symbolic of the unexpected return of the reformed communists , who took a drubbing in the last federal elections but are ahead of the chancellor 's party in some polls . some 80,000 protesters took to the streets on monday evening in mass rallies against chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s welfare reforms throughout germany .
it was the third wave of so-called " monday demonstrations , " a term used by eastern germans during their protests in 1989 that toppled communism in the region and paved the way for german unification .
curiously enough , the protests in the east this time are directed against a democratically elected government and it ’ s the former communists of the leftist pds that stands to profit most .
" the reforms are hurting the poor while the rich continue to pocket huge profits , " one berlin protester told deutsche welle .
these popular perceptions of schröder ’ s welfare reforms are providing the perfect breeding ground for the comeback of germany ‘ s post-communists .
after crashing out of the national parliament two years ago , they have now surged to a record high in opinion polls , enjoying 7 percent support nationwide .
in economically depressed eastern regions , the pds is now the second-strongest party .
hitting society 's weakest ?
the reformed communists ' charismatic figurehead , gregor gysi , says his party was just putting a finger on the sore spots of schröder ’ s reform policy .
" the economic situation in eastern germany , " he said , " doesn ’ t seem to matter anymore - neither to the government nor to parliament .
in addition , the cuts always hit the weakest in society while the well-to-do are left untouched . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several thousand eastern germans partake in a recent monday demonstration in leipzig anger over the government ’ s welfare cuts is especially strong in eastern germany , because the majority of the 3 million people who are affected by them live there .
the new measures include stiff means-testing and deep cuts in monthly benefit payments for the long-term unemployed .
the chancellor ’ s social democrats are feeling the heat , and with only 21 percent support in the opinion polls , they are trailing the pds by 5 percent ahead of two regional elections in eastern german states .
is populism on the rise ?
spd leaders like party manager uwe benneter are growing nervous and have accused the post communists of stoking popular fears .
" the pds is exploiting the reforms for electioneering purposes in a disgustingly populist manner , " benneter said .
" we must strengthen our campaign to debunk those who are intent only on stoking anger without presenting alternative solutions of their own . "
political analysts believe , however , that the protests are underscoring a persistent trend in the electorate in the east that includes a drift away from the established parties towards those on the extremes .
" there is indeed a danger of that , and it is being sustained by the fact that eastern germans have never had strong party affiliations , " said michael edinger , a political scientist at jena university .
" we ’ re also coming to realize that such loose political ties could be the future of politics in all of germany , raising the specter of large numbers of protest voters quite ready to support extremist parties at the ballot box . "
rightwing-extremist parties are already profiting from the mass protests .
in saxony the national democratic party could enter the regional parliament in september .
the party could increase its votes from one and half to over 5 percent compared the last election , polls have shown .
meanwhile , in brandenburg the german people ’ s union is expected to hold its seats in parliament .
both parties have waged anti-reform campaigns as seeking to stoke resentment towards foreigners . uwe hessler -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de can minimum wage debate pacify protesters ?

but on monday , germany and the united states come together to contest who will grab that chance to play off for the olympic title . whatever the stage , this is the one game from the athens tournament that has everything : rivalry , revenge and the last hurrah .
because these two teams have a history that makes this match more compelling than just any semi-final . in 2003 , the united states and germany met in the semi-finals of the 2003 world cup , a game the germans won , defeating the reigning world champions at the time in their own backyard and going on to claim the ultimate prize for themselves . sweet revenge and bitter rivalry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if ever there was a chance of sweet revenge , this match is just that with the german team gaining pace in their challenge to add olympic gold to their world title .
a us win would scupper that and set up a chance for the former olympic and world champions to get at least one title back at the expense of their greatest rivals . for a number of the us team , this is the last chance to grab more glory .
for highly decorated players such as the so-called " fab five " - mia hamm , julie foudy , joy fawcett , kristine lilly and brandi chastain - this is the last throw of the dice .
another loss at the feet of the germans would bring their international careers top a close on a painful low rather than a joyful high . respect and resolve this is the game the american players wanted .
that 3-0 world cup loss to germany , in a match that was close until the latter minutes , still smarts with the u.s. team and spectators will be primed for one of the potentially great matches of these and possibly any games .

but on monday , germany and the united states come together to contest who will grab that chance to play off for the olympic title . whatever the stage , this is the one game from the athens tournament that has everything : rivalry , revenge and the last hurrah .
because these two teams have a history that makes this match more compelling than just any semi-final . in 2003 , the united states and germany met in the semi-finals of the 2003 world cup , a game the germans won , defeating the reigning world champions at the time in their own backyard and going on to claim the ultimate prize for themselves . sweet revenge and bitter rivalry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if ever there was a chance of sweet revenge , this match is just that with the german team gaining pace in their challenge to add olympic gold to their world title .
a us win would scupper that and set up a chance for the former olympic and world champions to get at least one title back at the expense of their greatest rivals . for a number of the us team , this is the last chance to grab more glory .
for highly decorated players such as the so-called " fab five " - mia hamm , julie foudy , joy fawcett , kristine lilly and brandi chastain - this is the last throw of the dice .
another loss at the feet of the germans would bring their international careers top a close on a painful low rather than a joyful high . respect and resolve this is the game the american players wanted .
that 3-0 world cup loss to germany , in a match that was close until the latter minutes , still smarts with the u.s. team and spectators will be primed for one of the potentially great matches of these and possibly any games .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " they are an incredible team with an incredible amount of talent , but we want revenge , " us goalkeeper briana scurry told reporters .
" i 'd be lying if i said i did n't want them to feel the same way we felt after they beat us last summer . "
the match could well turn out to be the tale of two strikers .
the us are spearheaded by abby wambach who has led her team in the scoring stakes with three goals so far and has 18 in her 19 international matches this year .
wambach will be going all out to bring some joy to the seething americans . on the other side will be birgit prinz , who will aim to bring the pain to the americans once again .
prinz is now slouch in the scoring stakes either with an overall olympic tally of six goals , including four in one game .
a tale of two strikers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both are world class strikers in their prime , although prinz , who turns 27 later this year , has much more international experience , having made her debut for the germany team as a 16-year-old .
prinz is a veteran of three women 's world cups and three olympics .
she has scored 78 goals in only 121 matches , five off the german record of 83 , set by the now-retired heidi mohr . wambach , 24 , debuted with the us as a 21-year-old in a 4-1 win over germany in chicago in 2001 .
gaining international tournament experience at the 2003 world cup and these summer games , wambach has scored 30 goals in 42 international games .
wambach has been on target in each of the three olympics matches she has played and has become the most imposing american force up front . with so much riding on this game - the end result , the chance to go for olympic gold , the resolution of old grudges and the healing of tender wounds , monday 's semi-final is much more than a soccer match . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans drub china in women 's soccer opener germany 's women thrashed their chinese counterparts with an unexpected 8-0 win wednesday at the athens olympics women 's soccer opener , providing a thrilling start to the games .

it was the third wave of so-called " monday demonstrations , " a term used by eastern germans during their protests in 1989 that toppled communism in the region and paved the way for german unification .
curiously enough , the protests in the east this time are directed against a democratically elected government and it ’ s the former communists of the leftist pds that stands to profit most .
" the reforms are hurting the poor while the rich continue to pocket huge profits , " one berlin protester told deutsche welle .
these popular perceptions of schröder ’ s welfare reforms are providing the perfect breeding ground for the comeback of germany ‘ s post-communists .
after crashing out of the national parliament two years ago , they have now surged to a record high in opinion polls , enjoying 7 percent support nationwide .
in economically depressed eastern regions , the pds is now the second-strongest party .
hitting society 's weakest ?
the reformed communists ' charismatic figurehead , gregor gysi , says his party was just putting a finger on the sore spots of schröder ’ s reform policy .
" the economic situation in eastern germany , " he said , " doesn ’ t seem to matter anymore - neither to the government nor to parliament .
in addition , the cuts always hit the weakest in society while the well-to-do are left untouched . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several thousand eastern germans partake in a recent monday demonstration in leipzig anger over the government ’ s welfare cuts is especially strong in eastern germany , because the majority of the 3 million people who are affected by them live there .
the new measures include stiff means-testing and deep cuts in monthly benefit payments for the long-term unemployed .
the chancellor ’ s social democrats are feeling the heat , and with only 21 percent support in the opinion polls , they are trailing the pds by 5 percent ahead of two regional elections in eastern german states .
is populism on the rise ?
spd leaders like party manager uwe benneter are growing nervous and have accused the post communists of stoking popular fears .
" the pds is exploiting the reforms for electioneering purposes in a disgustingly populist manner , " benneter said .
" we must strengthen our campaign to debunk those who are intent only on stoking anger without presenting alternative solutions of their own . "
political analysts believe , however , that the protests are underscoring a persistent trend in the electorate in the east that includes a drift away from the established parties towards those on the extremes .
" there is indeed a danger of that , and it is being sustained by the fact that eastern germans have never had strong party affiliations , " said michael edinger , a political scientist at jena university .
" we ’ re also coming to realize that such loose political ties could be the future of politics in all of germany , raising the specter of large numbers of protest voters quite ready to support extremist parties at the ballot box . "
rightwing-extremist parties are already profiting from the mass protests .
in saxony the national democratic party could enter the regional parliament in september .
the party could increase its votes from one and half to over 5 percent compared the last election , polls have shown .

now , in an apparent bid to sweeten the harsh , but necessary social cuts ahead , spd chief franz müntefering has launched a fresh debate on possible legislation governing the country 's minimum wage .
no taboo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd party chief franz muentefering as it stands , there are no relevant state regulations in place , as wages are invariably defined tariff negotiations between management and trade unions .
on sunday , müntefering said that the traditional tariff autonomy should not be treated as a taboo , but warned against jumping to conclusions . “ we ’ re currently debating this issue with the trade unions .
some unions are in favor of legislation on minimum wages , others aren ’ t .
i myself have been hesitant in the past to push for minimum wages , as such a move amounts to an attack on the country ’ s tariff autonomy , if you choose to see it that way .
but of course we also have to see the negative effects of wage dumping policies .
so , my party is willing to debate this at length with the unions , and i ’ m optimistic that we ’ ll reach a consensus in the autumn , ” he said .
müntefering ’ s offer to debate this issue with the trade unions has drawn mixed reactions from policy-makers across the political spectrum .
the opposition liberal democrats have rejected the idea outright , and social democratic economics and labor minister wolfgang clement isn ’ t amused either .
“ i ’ m in favour of looking at the situation in various industries .
i don ’ t think that legislation on minimum wages would make sense for all sectors .
and whether the trade unions are willing to at least partly give up the decades-old principle of tariff autonomy remains to be seen , ” clement said . open to consideration for their part , the trade unions have indicated their willingness to discuss the possibility of legislation in coming weeks .
margret moehring-rahne , deputy head of germany ’ s powerful service sector union , ver.di believes that minimum wages would help to cushion the impact of the labor reforms , meaning the long-term unemployed could not be forced to accept a job if the payment were outside the agreed minimum wage bracket .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal labor agency is stamped with a ' no ' to reforms the question to be considered is whether minimum wages will really assist workers by helping to prevent the exploitation of the lowest paid , or harm them by pricing low-skilled workers out of the labor force altogether .
supporters of minimum wages argue that higher wages will create greater spending power , thus ultimately cranking up the demand for larger workforces . that at least is the theory , and negotiations between the government and the trade unions in the coming weeks will show whether germany gets a chance to put it to the test . hardy graupner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press review : do we need a minimum wage ?

now , in an apparent bid to sweeten the harsh , but necessary social cuts ahead , spd chief franz müntefering has launched a fresh debate on possible legislation governing the country 's minimum wage .
no taboo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd party chief franz muentefering as it stands , there are no relevant state regulations in place , as wages are invariably defined tariff negotiations between management and trade unions .
on sunday , müntefering said that the traditional tariff autonomy should not be treated as a taboo , but warned against jumping to conclusions . “ we ’ re currently debating this issue with the trade unions .
some unions are in favor of legislation on minimum wages , others aren ’ t .
i myself have been hesitant in the past to push for minimum wages , as such a move amounts to an attack on the country ’ s tariff autonomy , if you choose to see it that way .
but of course we also have to see the negative effects of wage dumping policies .
so , my party is willing to debate this at length with the unions , and i ’ m optimistic that we ’ ll reach a consensus in the autumn , ” he said .
müntefering ’ s offer to debate this issue with the trade unions has drawn mixed reactions from policy-makers across the political spectrum .
the opposition liberal democrats have rejected the idea outright , and social democratic economics and labor minister wolfgang clement isn ’ t amused either .
“ i ’ m in favour of looking at the situation in various industries .
i don ’ t think that legislation on minimum wages would make sense for all sectors .
and whether the trade unions are willing to at least partly give up the decades-old principle of tariff autonomy remains to be seen , ” clement said . open to consideration for their part , the trade unions have indicated their willingness to discuss the possibility of legislation in coming weeks .
margret moehring-rahne , deputy head of germany ’ s powerful service sector union , ver.di believes that minimum wages would help to cushion the impact of the labor reforms , meaning the long-term unemployed could not be forced to accept a job if the payment were outside the agreed minimum wage bracket .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal labor agency is stamped with a ' no ' to reforms the question to be considered is whether minimum wages will really assist workers by helping to prevent the exploitation of the lowest paid , or harm them by pricing low-skilled workers out of the labor force altogether .
supporters of minimum wages argue that higher wages will create greater spending power , thus ultimately cranking up the demand for larger workforces . that at least is the theory , and negotiations between the government and the trade unions in the coming weeks will show whether germany gets a chance to put it to the test . hardy graupner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press review : do we need a minimum wage ?

but on monday , germany and the united states come together to contest who will grab that chance to play off for the olympic title . whatever the stage , this is the one game from the athens tournament that has everything : rivalry , revenge and the last hurrah .
because these two teams have a history that makes this match more compelling than just any semi-final . in 2003 , the united states and germany met in the semi-finals of the 2003 world cup , a game the germans won , defeating the reigning world champions at the time in their own backyard and going on to claim the ultimate prize for themselves . sweet revenge and bitter rivalry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if ever there was a chance of sweet revenge , this match is just that with the german team gaining pace in their challenge to add olympic gold to their world title .
a us win would scupper that and set up a chance for the former olympic and world champions to get at least one title back at the expense of their greatest rivals . for a number of the us team , this is the last chance to grab more glory .
for highly decorated players such as the so-called " fab five " - mia hamm , julie foudy , joy fawcett , kristine lilly and brandi chastain - this is the last throw of the dice .
another loss at the feet of the germans would bring their international careers top a close on a painful low rather than a joyful high . respect and resolve this is the game the american players wanted .
that 3-0 world cup loss to germany , in a match that was close until the latter minutes , still smarts with the u.s. team and spectators will be primed for one of the potentially great matches of these and possibly any games .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " they are an incredible team with an incredible amount of talent , but we want revenge , " us goalkeeper briana scurry told reporters .
" i 'd be lying if i said i did n't want them to feel the same way we felt after they beat us last summer . "
the match could well turn out to be the tale of two strikers .
the us are spearheaded by abby wambach who has led her team in the scoring stakes with three goals so far and has 18 in her 19 international matches this year .
wambach will be going all out to bring some joy to the seething americans . on the other side will be birgit prinz , who will aim to bring the pain to the americans once again .
prinz is now slouch in the scoring stakes either with an overall olympic tally of six goals , including four in one game .
a tale of two strikers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both are world class strikers in their prime , although prinz , who turns 27 later this year , has much more international experience , having made her debut for the germany team as a 16-year-old .
prinz is a veteran of three women 's world cups and three olympics .
she has scored 78 goals in only 121 matches , five off the german record of 83 , set by the now-retired heidi mohr . wambach , 24 , debuted with the us as a 21-year-old in a 4-1 win over germany in chicago in 2001 .
gaining international tournament experience at the 2003 world cup and these summer games , wambach has scored 30 goals in 42 international games .
wambach has been on target in each of the three olympics matches she has played and has become the most imposing american force up front . with so much riding on this game - the end result , the chance to go for olympic gold , the resolution of old grudges and the healing of tender wounds , monday 's semi-final is much more than a soccer match . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans drub china in women 's soccer opener germany 's women thrashed their chinese counterparts with an unexpected 8-0 win wednesday at the athens olympics women 's soccer opener , providing a thrilling start to the games .

it was the third wave of so-called " monday demonstrations , " a term used by eastern germans during their protests in 1989 that toppled communism in the region and paved the way for german unification .
curiously enough , the protests in the east this time are directed against a democratically elected government and it ’ s the former communists of the leftist pds that stands to profit most .
" the reforms are hurting the poor while the rich continue to pocket huge profits , " one berlin protester told deutsche welle .
these popular perceptions of schröder ’ s welfare reforms are providing the perfect breeding ground for the comeback of germany ‘ s post-communists .
after crashing out of the national parliament two years ago , they have now surged to a record high in opinion polls , enjoying 7 percent support nationwide .
in economically depressed eastern regions , the pds is now the second-strongest party .
hitting society 's weakest ?
the reformed communists ' charismatic figurehead , gregor gysi , says his party was just putting a finger on the sore spots of schröder ’ s reform policy .
" the economic situation in eastern germany , " he said , " doesn ’ t seem to matter anymore - neither to the government nor to parliament .
in addition , the cuts always hit the weakest in society while the well-to-do are left untouched . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several thousand eastern germans partake in a recent monday demonstration in leipzig anger over the government ’ s welfare cuts is especially strong in eastern germany , because the majority of the 3 million people who are affected by them live there .
the new measures include stiff means-testing and deep cuts in monthly benefit payments for the long-term unemployed .
the chancellor ’ s social democrats are feeling the heat , and with only 21 percent support in the opinion polls , they are trailing the pds by 5 percent ahead of two regional elections in eastern german states .
is populism on the rise ?
spd leaders like party manager uwe benneter are growing nervous and have accused the post communists of stoking popular fears .
" the pds is exploiting the reforms for electioneering purposes in a disgustingly populist manner , " benneter said .
" we must strengthen our campaign to debunk those who are intent only on stoking anger without presenting alternative solutions of their own . "
political analysts believe , however , that the protests are underscoring a persistent trend in the electorate in the east that includes a drift away from the established parties towards those on the extremes .
" there is indeed a danger of that , and it is being sustained by the fact that eastern germans have never had strong party affiliations , " said michael edinger , a political scientist at jena university .
" we ’ re also coming to realize that such loose political ties could be the future of politics in all of germany , raising the specter of large numbers of protest voters quite ready to support extremist parties at the ballot box . "
rightwing-extremist parties are already profiting from the mass protests .
in saxony the national democratic party could enter the regional parliament in september .
the party could increase its votes from one and half to over 5 percent compared the last election , polls have shown .
meanwhile , in brandenburg the german people ’ s union is expected to hold its seats in parliament .
both parties have waged anti-reform campaigns as seeking to stoke resentment towards foreigners . uwe hessler -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de can minimum wage debate pacify protesters ?

over 100,000 visitors came , saw and played cutting edge games , experienced the latest in edu- and infotainment and sampled the newest consoles and hardware from over 270 exhibitors from 13 countries while the conventions played host to no less than 68 world premieres . the expanding popularity of the german convention was in evidence as the convention center swelled with the biggest names in the industry .
thomas dlugaiczyk of the games academy , an institution for the promotion of creative electronic arts , observed the differences from the two previous years .
" -lrb- the german companies -rrb- always attended conferences in the usa and canada , now their people come to us , " dlugaiczyk told dw-world . this was in evidence as more international games developers and hardware manufacturers took the opportunity to announce new products and sales figures at the convention , as the industry prepared for the run-up to the all important , rapidly approaching christmas period . big names in attendance game companies such as electronic arts , ubisoft and buena vista revealed rising sales figures as well as new products while the major console companies used the convention as the tactical arena for the coming competition during the festive season . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : x-box mania in leipzig .
sony , microsoft and nintendo were all out in force in leipzig and laying down the battle lines for the price war to come .
microsoft revealed that its x-box console , currently selling for € 199 , will be reduced to € 149 at the end of august in an attempt to attract pre-christmas shoppers .
microsoft told those who gathered at its stand in the convention hall that it hoped to expand its worldwide x-box sales from 15.5 million to 20 million through the deal . over at the sony stand , the makers of playstation struck back during their own show at the convention by following suit , dropping the playstation 2 to the same price . piracy hits german industry but despite the popularity of the convention and the entertainment genre it promotes , the figures belie a worrying downward trend in the computer game industry in germany . in an industry that relies much on exports , germany is seen as a developing country in the context of the european computer game arena .
in the first half of this year , german computer game sales abroad totaled € 111 million , a decline of 36.9 percent on the same six month period in 2003 . there are a number of factors being attributed to this .
one is piracy .
each year , the german computer game industry loses as much as € 400 million through the copying of games and the online sharing of products , with as many as 54 million illegal copies per year being made and sold in germany . another is user-friendliness .
tom putzki , chairperson of g.a.m.e. , the german federation of computer game developers , told dw-world that one reason could be that designers try too hard in the creation of new products and that constantly trying to reinvent the wheel may push creative boundaries but actually alienate consumers . complexity alienates users bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some games take too long to learn , say developers .
bob bates , a game writer from the united states who attended the developer 's conference at the trade fair , said that german games are too complex .
" you demand too much of the consumers .
it takes too long until the player understands the game . "
bates said that u.s. game players give a new game a probation period of five minutes at the most .
" if they have n't understood the game by then and have not enjoyed themselves , then the game is not bought . " david reeves , president and coo of sony computer entertainment europe , told those who gathered to hear his speech that there was still plenty of market growth slumbering in the german games business , stressing that a wider target group and acceptance of gaming as a mainstream entertainment product would be key factors to future success . finding the german target reeves raised the issue that despite germany 's appetite for consuming videogames , very little development actually took place within german borders .
reeves believes that just like racing games in spain and tennis games in france , there are game genres that can hit the sweet spot in germany .
he urged industry representatives to invest in mass market-friendly themes and support development of locally relevant software within germany . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany : the trade fair capital despite its economic crisis , germany has maintained its position as the world 's premier trade fair location .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 23.08.2004 german press review : do we need a minimum wage ? monday 's editorial pages weighed in on the debate about whether germany should institute a minimum wage and the controversy surrounding germany 's equestrian team , which lost two medals to appeals . the süddeutsche zeitung told its readers on its front page that the purpose of the minimum wage is to entice the trade unions into supporting the controversial hartz iv welfare reform for the long-term unemployed .
the paper then took the proposal by franz müntefering , head of the ruling social democratic party , as an opportunity to examine the plight of eastern germany , where unemployment is especially high .
it opened a leading article with the words " are eastern germans second-class citizens ? "
the süddeutsche answered its own question and wrote that the two halves of the country are beginning to drift even farther apart under the pressure of the reforms .
protests and demonstrations against hartz iv are quite legitimate - especially in eastern germany , where citizens were forced to refrain from any sort of protest for years on end .
the paper concluded with what it evidently regarded as the key issue : " what is the point of the government piling the pressure on the unemployed , when there simply is n't enough work to go round in many parts of the country ? "
the neue osnabrücker zeitung tackled the proposal for a minimum wage head on .
its verdict : it 's not a very realistic idea .
first , because it would mean interfering with free collective bargaining , which would annoy the trade unions .
they would quite rightly argue that local union branches and employers know far better than anybody else which wage levels are appropriate in their part of the country .
second , the conservative opposition , as a firm supporter of deregulation , is going to balk at any hint of state intervention .
in addition , the impact of a minimum wage is extremely difficult to predict .
it could indeed increase the purchasing power of those who have jobs , but the effect on the number of people in work is less certain , the paper wrote .
the badische zeitung said germany 's trade unions are divided over the minimum wage .
the engineering workers union ig metall has rejected it outright , fearing that it will weaken the system of free collective bargaining .
but the catering union came out in favor .
its members work largely for small businesses - which is also one of the reasons their union is not nearly as strong as ig metall .
the state , the daily commented , can not be responsible for everything and certainly not for setting wage levels .
that is the responsibility of the trade unions - and the employers .
many german papers also found space for the brawl at the olympics over equestrian gold , silver and bronze that was settled at the court of arbitration on saturday , three days after the three-day event finished .
german bettina hoy lost two gold medals after a challenge from france , britain and the united states .
the nordwest zeitung in oldenburg remarked that the debate has nothing to do with fairness .
the histrionics underline the dilemma facing contemporary sport , whose rules are becoming increasingly complicated .
seen legally , saturday 's decision may be water-tight .
it does , however , nothing to promote integrity or honesty in sport , the paper opined . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de € 1 jobs for germany 's unemployed ?

over 100,000 visitors came , saw and played cutting edge games , experienced the latest in edu- and infotainment and sampled the newest consoles and hardware from over 270 exhibitors from 13 countries while the conventions played host to no less than 68 world premieres . the expanding popularity of the german convention was in evidence as the convention center swelled with the biggest names in the industry .
thomas dlugaiczyk of the games academy , an institution for the promotion of creative electronic arts , observed the differences from the two previous years .
" -lrb- the german companies -rrb- always attended conferences in the usa and canada , now their people come to us , " dlugaiczyk told dw-world . this was in evidence as more international games developers and hardware manufacturers took the opportunity to announce new products and sales figures at the convention , as the industry prepared for the run-up to the all important , rapidly approaching christmas period . big names in attendance game companies such as electronic arts , ubisoft and buena vista revealed rising sales figures as well as new products while the major console companies used the convention as the tactical arena for the coming competition during the festive season . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : x-box mania in leipzig .
sony , microsoft and nintendo were all out in force in leipzig and laying down the battle lines for the price war to come .
microsoft revealed that its x-box console , currently selling for € 199 , will be reduced to € 149 at the end of august in an attempt to attract pre-christmas shoppers .
microsoft told those who gathered at its stand in the convention hall that it hoped to expand its worldwide x-box sales from 15.5 million to 20 million through the deal . over at the sony stand , the makers of playstation struck back during their own show at the convention by following suit , dropping the playstation 2 to the same price . piracy hits german industry but despite the popularity of the convention and the entertainment genre it promotes , the figures belie a worrying downward trend in the computer game industry in germany . in an industry that relies much on exports , germany is seen as a developing country in the context of the european computer game arena .
in the first half of this year , german computer game sales abroad totaled € 111 million , a decline of 36.9 percent on the same six month period in 2003 . there are a number of factors being attributed to this .
one is piracy .
each year , the german computer game industry loses as much as € 400 million through the copying of games and the online sharing of products , with as many as 54 million illegal copies per year being made and sold in germany . another is user-friendliness .
tom putzki , chairperson of g.a.m.e. , the german federation of computer game developers , told dw-world that one reason could be that designers try too hard in the creation of new products and that constantly trying to reinvent the wheel may push creative boundaries but actually alienate consumers . complexity alienates users bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some games take too long to learn , say developers .
bob bates , a game writer from the united states who attended the developer 's conference at the trade fair , said that german games are too complex .
" you demand too much of the consumers .
it takes too long until the player understands the game . "
bates said that u.s. game players give a new game a probation period of five minutes at the most .
" if they have n't understood the game by then and have not enjoyed themselves , then the game is not bought . " david reeves , president and coo of sony computer entertainment europe , told those who gathered to hear his speech that there was still plenty of market growth slumbering in the german games business , stressing that a wider target group and acceptance of gaming as a mainstream entertainment product would be key factors to future success . finding the german target reeves raised the issue that despite germany 's appetite for consuming videogames , very little development actually took place within german borders .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 23.08.2004 german press review : do we need a minimum wage ? monday 's editorial pages weighed in on the debate about whether germany should institute a minimum wage and the controversy surrounding germany 's equestrian team , which lost two medals to appeals . the süddeutsche zeitung told its readers on its front page that the purpose of the minimum wage is to entice the trade unions into supporting the controversial hartz iv welfare reform for the long-term unemployed .
the paper then took the proposal by franz müntefering , head of the ruling social democratic party , as an opportunity to examine the plight of eastern germany , where unemployment is especially high .
it opened a leading article with the words " are eastern germans second-class citizens ? "
the süddeutsche answered its own question and wrote that the two halves of the country are beginning to drift even farther apart under the pressure of the reforms .
protests and demonstrations against hartz iv are quite legitimate - especially in eastern germany , where citizens were forced to refrain from any sort of protest for years on end .
the paper concluded with what it evidently regarded as the key issue : " what is the point of the government piling the pressure on the unemployed , when there simply is n't enough work to go round in many parts of the country ? "
the neue osnabrücker zeitung tackled the proposal for a minimum wage head on .
its verdict : it 's not a very realistic idea .
first , because it would mean interfering with free collective bargaining , which would annoy the trade unions .
they would quite rightly argue that local union branches and employers know far better than anybody else which wage levels are appropriate in their part of the country .
second , the conservative opposition , as a firm supporter of deregulation , is going to balk at any hint of state intervention .
in addition , the impact of a minimum wage is extremely difficult to predict .
it could indeed increase the purchasing power of those who have jobs , but the effect on the number of people in work is less certain , the paper wrote .
the badische zeitung said germany 's trade unions are divided over the minimum wage .
the engineering workers union ig metall has rejected it outright , fearing that it will weaken the system of free collective bargaining .
but the catering union came out in favor .
its members work largely for small businesses - which is also one of the reasons their union is not nearly as strong as ig metall .
the state , the daily commented , can not be responsible for everything and certainly not for setting wage levels .
that is the responsibility of the trade unions - and the employers .
many german papers also found space for the brawl at the olympics over equestrian gold , silver and bronze that was settled at the court of arbitration on saturday , three days after the three-day event finished .
german bettina hoy lost two gold medals after a challenge from france , britain and the united states .
the nordwest zeitung in oldenburg remarked that the debate has nothing to do with fairness .
the histrionics underline the dilemma facing contemporary sport , whose rules are becoming increasingly complicated .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 23.08.2004 german press review : do we need a minimum wage ? monday 's editorial pages weighed in on the debate about whether germany should institute a minimum wage and the controversy surrounding germany 's equestrian team , which lost two medals to appeals . the süddeutsche zeitung told its readers on its front page that the purpose of the minimum wage is to entice the trade unions into supporting the controversial hartz iv welfare reform for the long-term unemployed .
the paper then took the proposal by franz müntefering , head of the ruling social democratic party , as an opportunity to examine the plight of eastern germany , where unemployment is especially high .
it opened a leading article with the words " are eastern germans second-class citizens ? "
the süddeutsche answered its own question and wrote that the two halves of the country are beginning to drift even farther apart under the pressure of the reforms .
protests and demonstrations against hartz iv are quite legitimate - especially in eastern germany , where citizens were forced to refrain from any sort of protest for years on end .
the paper concluded with what it evidently regarded as the key issue : " what is the point of the government piling the pressure on the unemployed , when there simply is n't enough work to go round in many parts of the country ? "
the neue osnabrücker zeitung tackled the proposal for a minimum wage head on .
its verdict : it 's not a very realistic idea .
first , because it would mean interfering with free collective bargaining , which would annoy the trade unions .
they would quite rightly argue that local union branches and employers know far better than anybody else which wage levels are appropriate in their part of the country .
second , the conservative opposition , as a firm supporter of deregulation , is going to balk at any hint of state intervention .
in addition , the impact of a minimum wage is extremely difficult to predict .
it could indeed increase the purchasing power of those who have jobs , but the effect on the number of people in work is less certain , the paper wrote .

it was the third wave of so-called " monday demonstrations , " a term used by eastern germans during their protests in 1989 that toppled communism in the region and paved the way for german unification .
curiously enough , the protests in the east this time are directed against a democratically elected government and it ’ s the former communists of the leftist pds that stands to profit most .
" the reforms are hurting the poor while the rich continue to pocket huge profits , " one berlin protester told deutsche welle .
these popular perceptions of schröder ’ s welfare reforms are providing the perfect breeding ground for the comeback of germany ‘ s post-communists .
after crashing out of the national parliament two years ago , they have now surged to a record high in opinion polls , enjoying 7 percent support nationwide .
in economically depressed eastern regions , the pds is now the second-strongest party .
hitting society 's weakest ?
the reformed communists ' charismatic figurehead , gregor gysi , says his party was just putting a finger on the sore spots of schröder ’ s reform policy .
" the economic situation in eastern germany , " he said , " doesn ’ t seem to matter anymore - neither to the government nor to parliament .
in addition , the cuts always hit the weakest in society while the well-to-do are left untouched . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several thousand eastern germans partake in a recent monday demonstration in leipzig anger over the government ’ s welfare cuts is especially strong in eastern germany , because the majority of the 3 million people who are affected by them live there .
the new measures include stiff means-testing and deep cuts in monthly benefit payments for the long-term unemployed .
the chancellor ’ s social democrats are feeling the heat , and with only 21 percent support in the opinion polls , they are trailing the pds by 5 percent ahead of two regional elections in eastern german states .
is populism on the rise ?
spd leaders like party manager uwe benneter are growing nervous and have accused the post communists of stoking popular fears .
" the pds is exploiting the reforms for electioneering purposes in a disgustingly populist manner , " benneter said .
" we must strengthen our campaign to debunk those who are intent only on stoking anger without presenting alternative solutions of their own . "
political analysts believe , however , that the protests are underscoring a persistent trend in the electorate in the east that includes a drift away from the established parties towards those on the extremes .
" there is indeed a danger of that , and it is being sustained by the fact that eastern germans have never had strong party affiliations , " said michael edinger , a political scientist at jena university .
" we ’ re also coming to realize that such loose political ties could be the future of politics in all of germany , raising the specter of large numbers of protest voters quite ready to support extremist parties at the ballot box . "
rightwing-extremist parties are already profiting from the mass protests .
in saxony the national democratic party could enter the regional parliament in september .
the party could increase its votes from one and half to over 5 percent compared the last election , polls have shown .
meanwhile , in brandenburg the german people ’ s union is expected to hold its seats in parliament .
both parties have waged anti-reform campaigns as seeking to stoke resentment towards foreigners . uwe hessler -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de can minimum wage debate pacify protesters ?

now , in an apparent bid to sweeten the harsh , but necessary social cuts ahead , spd chief franz müntefering has launched a fresh debate on possible legislation governing the country 's minimum wage .
no taboo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd party chief franz muentefering as it stands , there are no relevant state regulations in place , as wages are invariably defined tariff negotiations between management and trade unions .
on sunday , müntefering said that the traditional tariff autonomy should not be treated as a taboo , but warned against jumping to conclusions . “ we ’ re currently debating this issue with the trade unions .
some unions are in favor of legislation on minimum wages , others aren ’ t .
i myself have been hesitant in the past to push for minimum wages , as such a move amounts to an attack on the country ’ s tariff autonomy , if you choose to see it that way .
but of course we also have to see the negative effects of wage dumping policies .
so , my party is willing to debate this at length with the unions , and i ’ m optimistic that we ’ ll reach a consensus in the autumn , ” he said .
müntefering ’ s offer to debate this issue with the trade unions has drawn mixed reactions from policy-makers across the political spectrum .
the opposition liberal democrats have rejected the idea outright , and social democratic economics and labor minister wolfgang clement isn ’ t amused either .
“ i ’ m in favour of looking at the situation in various industries .
i don ’ t think that legislation on minimum wages would make sense for all sectors .
and whether the trade unions are willing to at least partly give up the decades-old principle of tariff autonomy remains to be seen , ” clement said . open to consideration for their part , the trade unions have indicated their willingness to discuss the possibility of legislation in coming weeks .
margret moehring-rahne , deputy head of germany ’ s powerful service sector union , ver.di believes that minimum wages would help to cushion the impact of the labor reforms , meaning the long-term unemployed could not be forced to accept a job if the payment were outside the agreed minimum wage bracket .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal labor agency is stamped with a ' no ' to reforms the question to be considered is whether minimum wages will really assist workers by helping to prevent the exploitation of the lowest paid , or harm them by pricing low-skilled workers out of the labor force altogether .
supporters of minimum wages argue that higher wages will create greater spending power , thus ultimately cranking up the demand for larger workforces . that at least is the theory , and negotiations between the government and the trade unions in the coming weeks will show whether germany gets a chance to put it to the test . hardy graupner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press review : do we need a minimum wage ?
monday 's editorial pages found plenty to write about concerning the debate about whether germany should institute a minimum wage and the brouhaha surrounding germany 's equestrian team , which lost two medals to appeals .

but on monday , germany and the united states come together to contest who will grab that chance to play off for the olympic title . whatever the stage , this is the one game from the athens tournament that has everything : rivalry , revenge and the last hurrah .
because these two teams have a history that makes this match more compelling than just any semi-final . in 2003 , the united states and germany met in the semi-finals of the 2003 world cup , a game the germans won , defeating the reigning world champions at the time in their own backyard and going on to claim the ultimate prize for themselves . sweet revenge and bitter rivalry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if ever there was a chance of sweet revenge , this match is just that with the german team gaining pace in their challenge to add olympic gold to their world title .
a us win would scupper that and set up a chance for the former olympic and world champions to get at least one title back at the expense of their greatest rivals . for a number of the us team , this is the last chance to grab more glory .
for highly decorated players such as the so-called " fab five " - mia hamm , julie foudy , joy fawcett , kristine lilly and brandi chastain - this is the last throw of the dice .
another loss at the feet of the germans would bring their international careers top a close on a painful low rather than a joyful high . respect and resolve this is the game the american players wanted .
that 3-0 world cup loss to germany , in a match that was close until the latter minutes , still smarts with the u.s. team and spectators will be primed for one of the potentially great matches of these and possibly any games .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " they are an incredible team with an incredible amount of talent , but we want revenge , " us goalkeeper briana scurry told reporters .
" i 'd be lying if i said i did n't want them to feel the same way we felt after they beat us last summer . "
the match could well turn out to be the tale of two strikers .
the us are spearheaded by abby wambach who has led her team in the scoring stakes with three goals so far and has 18 in her 19 international matches this year .
wambach will be going all out to bring some joy to the seething americans . on the other side will be birgit prinz , who will aim to bring the pain to the americans once again .
prinz is now slouch in the scoring stakes either with an overall olympic tally of six goals , including four in one game .
a tale of two strikers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both are world class strikers in their prime , although prinz , who turns 27 later this year , has much more international experience , having made her debut for the germany team as a 16-year-old .
prinz is a veteran of three women 's world cups and three olympics .
she has scored 78 goals in only 121 matches , five off the german record of 83 , set by the now-retired heidi mohr . wambach , 24 , debuted with the us as a 21-year-old in a 4-1 win over germany in chicago in 2001 .
gaining international tournament experience at the 2003 world cup and these summer games , wambach has scored 30 goals in 42 international games .
wambach has been on target in each of the three olympics matches she has played and has become the most imposing american force up front . with so much riding on this game - the end result , the chance to go for olympic gold , the resolution of old grudges and the healing of tender wounds , monday 's semi-final is much more than a soccer match . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans drub china in women 's soccer opener germany 's women thrashed their chinese counterparts with an unexpected 8-0 win wednesday at the athens olympics women 's soccer opener , providing a thrilling start to the games .

but on monday , germany and the united states come together to contest who will grab that chance to play off for the olympic title . whatever the stage , this is the one game from the athens tournament that has everything : rivalry , revenge and the last hurrah .
because these two teams have a history that makes this match more compelling than just any semi-final . in 2003 , the united states and germany met in the semi-finals of the 2003 world cup , a game the germans won , defeating the reigning world champions at the time in their own backyard and going on to claim the ultimate prize for themselves . sweet revenge and bitter rivalry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if ever there was a chance of sweet revenge , this match is just that with the german team gaining pace in their challenge to add olympic gold to their world title .
a us win would scupper that and set up a chance for the former olympic and world champions to get at least one title back at the expense of their greatest rivals . for a number of the us team , this is the last chance to grab more glory .
for highly decorated players such as the so-called " fab five " - mia hamm , julie foudy , joy fawcett , kristine lilly and brandi chastain - this is the last throw of the dice .
another loss at the feet of the germans would bring their international careers top a close on a painful low rather than a joyful high . respect and resolve this is the game the american players wanted .
that 3-0 world cup loss to germany , in a match that was close until the latter minutes , still smarts with the u.s. team and spectators will be primed for one of the potentially great matches of these and possibly any games .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " they are an incredible team with an incredible amount of talent , but we want revenge , " us goalkeeper briana scurry told reporters .
" i 'd be lying if i said i did n't want them to feel the same way we felt after they beat us last summer . "
the match could well turn out to be the tale of two strikers .
the us are spearheaded by abby wambach who has led her team in the scoring stakes with three goals so far and has 18 in her 19 international matches this year .
wambach will be going all out to bring some joy to the seething americans . on the other side will be birgit prinz , who will aim to bring the pain to the americans once again .
prinz is now slouch in the scoring stakes either with an overall olympic tally of six goals , including four in one game .
a tale of two strikers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both are world class strikers in their prime , although prinz , who turns 27 later this year , has much more international experience , having made her debut for the germany team as a 16-year-old .
prinz is a veteran of three women 's world cups and three olympics .
she has scored 78 goals in only 121 matches , five off the german record of 83 , set by the now-retired heidi mohr . wambach , 24 , debuted with the us as a 21-year-old in a 4-1 win over germany in chicago in 2001 .
gaining international tournament experience at the 2003 world cup and these summer games , wambach has scored 30 goals in 42 international games .
wambach has been on target in each of the three olympics matches she has played and has become the most imposing american force up front . with so much riding on this game - the end result , the chance to go for olympic gold , the resolution of old grudges and the healing of tender wounds , monday 's semi-final is much more than a soccer match . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans drub china in women 's soccer opener germany 's women thrashed their chinese counterparts with an unexpected 8-0 win wednesday at the athens olympics women 's soccer opener , providing a thrilling start to the games .

it was the third wave of so-called " monday demonstrations , " a term used by eastern germans during their protests in 1989 that toppled communism in the region and paved the way for german unification .
curiously enough , the protests in the east this time are directed against a democratically elected government and it ’ s the former communists of the leftist pds that stands to profit most .
" the reforms are hurting the poor while the rich continue to pocket huge profits , " one berlin protester told deutsche welle .
these popular perceptions of schröder ’ s welfare reforms are providing the perfect breeding ground for the comeback of germany ‘ s post-communists .
after crashing out of the national parliament two years ago , they have now surged to a record high in opinion polls , enjoying 7 percent support nationwide .
in economically depressed eastern regions , the pds is now the second-strongest party .
hitting society 's weakest ?
the reformed communists ' charismatic figurehead , gregor gysi , says his party was just putting a finger on the sore spots of schröder ’ s reform policy .
" the economic situation in eastern germany , " he said , " doesn ’ t seem to matter anymore - neither to the government nor to parliament .
in addition , the cuts always hit the weakest in society while the well-to-do are left untouched . "

the new measures include stiff means-testing and deep cuts in monthly benefit payments for the long-term unemployed .
the chancellor ’ s social democrats are feeling the heat , and with only 21 percent support in the opinion polls , they are trailing the pds by 5 percent ahead of two regional elections in eastern german states .
is populism on the rise ?
spd leaders like party manager uwe benneter are growing nervous and have accused the post communists of stoking popular fears .
" the pds is exploiting the reforms for electioneering purposes in a disgustingly populist manner , " benneter said .
" we must strengthen our campaign to debunk those who are intent only on stoking anger without presenting alternative solutions of their own . "
political analysts believe , however , that the protests are underscoring a persistent trend in the electorate in the east that includes a drift away from the established parties towards those on the extremes .
" there is indeed a danger of that , and it is being sustained by the fact that eastern germans have never had strong party affiliations , " said michael edinger , a political scientist at jena university .
" we ’ re also coming to realize that such loose political ties could be the future of politics in all of germany , raising the specter of large numbers of protest voters quite ready to support extremist parties at the ballot box . "
rightwing-extremist parties are already profiting from the mass protests .
in saxony the national democratic party could enter the regional parliament in september .
the party could increase its votes from one and half to over 5 percent compared the last election , polls have shown .

it was the third wave of so-called " monday demonstrations , " a term used by eastern germans during their protests in 1989 that toppled communism in the region and paved the way for german unification .
curiously enough , the protests in the east this time are directed against a democratically elected government and it ’ s the former communists of the leftist pds that stands to profit most .
" the reforms are hurting the poor while the rich continue to pocket huge profits , " one berlin protester told deutsche welle .
these popular perceptions of schröder ’ s welfare reforms are providing the perfect breeding ground for the comeback of germany ‘ s post-communists .
after crashing out of the national parliament two years ago , they have now surged to a record high in opinion polls , enjoying 7 percent support nationwide .
in economically depressed eastern regions , the pds is now the second-strongest party .
hitting society 's weakest ?
the reformed communists ' charismatic figurehead , gregor gysi , says his party was just putting a finger on the sore spots of schröder ’ s reform policy .
" the economic situation in eastern germany , " he said , " doesn ’ t seem to matter anymore - neither to the government nor to parliament .
in addition , the cuts always hit the weakest in society while the well-to-do are left untouched . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several thousand eastern germans partake in a recent monday demonstration in leipzig anger over the government ’ s welfare cuts is especially strong in eastern germany , because the majority of the 3 million people who are affected by them live there .
the new measures include stiff means-testing and deep cuts in monthly benefit payments for the long-term unemployed .
the chancellor ’ s social democrats are feeling the heat , and with only 21 percent support in the opinion polls , they are trailing the pds by 5 percent ahead of two regional elections in eastern german states .
is populism on the rise ?
spd leaders like party manager uwe benneter are growing nervous and have accused the post communists of stoking popular fears .
" the pds is exploiting the reforms for electioneering purposes in a disgustingly populist manner , " benneter said .
" we must strengthen our campaign to debunk those who are intent only on stoking anger without presenting alternative solutions of their own . "
political analysts believe , however , that the protests are underscoring a persistent trend in the electorate in the east that includes a drift away from the established parties towards those on the extremes .
" there is indeed a danger of that , and it is being sustained by the fact that eastern germans have never had strong party affiliations , " said michael edinger , a political scientist at jena university .
" we ’ re also coming to realize that such loose political ties could be the future of politics in all of germany , raising the specter of large numbers of protest voters quite ready to support extremist parties at the ballot box . "
rightwing-extremist parties are already profiting from the mass protests .
in saxony the national democratic party could enter the regional parliament in september .
the party could increase its votes from one and half to over 5 percent compared the last election , polls have shown .
meanwhile , in brandenburg the german people ’ s union is expected to hold its seats in parliament .

microsoft told those who gathered at its stand in the convention hall that it hoped to expand its worldwide x-box sales from 15.5 million to 20 million through the deal . over at the sony stand , the makers of playstation struck back during their own show at the convention by following suit , dropping the playstation 2 to the same price . piracy hits german industry but despite the popularity of the convention and the entertainment genre it promotes , the figures belie a worrying downward trend in the computer game industry in germany . in an industry that relies much on exports , germany is seen as a developing country in the context of the european computer game arena .

bob bates , a game writer from the united states who attended the developer 's conference at the trade fair , said that german games are too complex .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 23.08.2004 german press review : do we need a minimum wage ? monday 's editorial pages weighed in on the debate about whether germany should institute a minimum wage and the controversy surrounding germany 's equestrian team , which lost two medals to appeals . the süddeutsche zeitung told its readers on its front page that the purpose of the minimum wage is to entice the trade unions into supporting the controversial hartz iv welfare reform for the long-term unemployed .
the paper then took the proposal by franz müntefering , head of the ruling social democratic party , as an opportunity to examine the plight of eastern germany , where unemployment is especially high .
it opened a leading article with the words " are eastern germans second-class citizens ? "
the süddeutsche answered its own question and wrote that the two halves of the country are beginning to drift even farther apart under the pressure of the reforms .
protests and demonstrations against hartz iv are quite legitimate - especially in eastern germany , where citizens were forced to refrain from any sort of protest for years on end .
the paper concluded with what it evidently regarded as the key issue : " what is the point of the government piling the pressure on the unemployed , when there simply is n't enough work to go round in many parts of the country ? "
the neue osnabrücker zeitung tackled the proposal for a minimum wage head on .
its verdict : it 's not a very realistic idea .
first , because it would mean interfering with free collective bargaining , which would annoy the trade unions .
they would quite rightly argue that local union branches and employers know far better than anybody else which wage levels are appropriate in their part of the country .
second , the conservative opposition , as a firm supporter of deregulation , is going to balk at any hint of state intervention .
in addition , the impact of a minimum wage is extremely difficult to predict .
it could indeed increase the purchasing power of those who have jobs , but the effect on the number of people in work is less certain , the paper wrote .
the badische zeitung said germany 's trade unions are divided over the minimum wage .
the engineering workers union ig metall has rejected it outright , fearing that it will weaken the system of free collective bargaining .
but the catering union came out in favor .
its members work largely for small businesses - which is also one of the reasons their union is not nearly as strong as ig metall .
the state , the daily commented , can not be responsible for everything and certainly not for setting wage levels .
that is the responsibility of the trade unions - and the employers .
many german papers also found space for the brawl at the olympics over equestrian gold , silver and bronze that was settled at the court of arbitration on saturday , three days after the three-day event finished .
german bettina hoy lost two gold medals after a challenge from france , britain and the united states .
the nordwest zeitung in oldenburg remarked that the debate has nothing to do with fairness .
the histrionics underline the dilemma facing contemporary sport , whose rules are becoming increasingly complicated .
seen legally , saturday 's decision may be water-tight .
it does , however , nothing to promote integrity or honesty in sport , the paper opined . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de € 1 jobs for germany 's unemployed ?

now , in an apparent bid to sweeten the harsh , but necessary social cuts ahead , spd chief franz müntefering has launched a fresh debate on possible legislation governing the country 's minimum wage .
no taboo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd party chief franz muentefering as it stands , there are no relevant state regulations in place , as wages are invariably defined tariff negotiations between management and trade unions .
on sunday , müntefering said that the traditional tariff autonomy should not be treated as a taboo , but warned against jumping to conclusions . “ we ’ re currently debating this issue with the trade unions .
some unions are in favor of legislation on minimum wages , others aren ’ t .
i myself have been hesitant in the past to push for minimum wages , as such a move amounts to an attack on the country ’ s tariff autonomy , if you choose to see it that way .
but of course we also have to see the negative effects of wage dumping policies .
so , my party is willing to debate this at length with the unions , and i ’ m optimistic that we ’ ll reach a consensus in the autumn , ” he said .
müntefering ’ s offer to debate this issue with the trade unions has drawn mixed reactions from policy-makers across the political spectrum .
the opposition liberal democrats have rejected the idea outright , and social democratic economics and labor minister wolfgang clement isn ’ t amused either .
“ i ’ m in favour of looking at the situation in various industries .
i don ’ t think that legislation on minimum wages would make sense for all sectors .
and whether the trade unions are willing to at least partly give up the decades-old principle of tariff autonomy remains to be seen , ” clement said . open to consideration for their part , the trade unions have indicated their willingness to discuss the possibility of legislation in coming weeks .
margret moehring-rahne , deputy head of germany ’ s powerful service sector union , ver.di believes that minimum wages would help to cushion the impact of the labor reforms , meaning the long-term unemployed could not be forced to accept a job if the payment were outside the agreed minimum wage bracket .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal labor agency is stamped with a ' no ' to reforms the question to be considered is whether minimum wages will really assist workers by helping to prevent the exploitation of the lowest paid , or harm them by pricing low-skilled workers out of the labor force altogether .
supporters of minimum wages argue that higher wages will create greater spending power , thus ultimately cranking up the demand for larger workforces . that at least is the theory , and negotiations between the government and the trade unions in the coming weeks will show whether germany gets a chance to put it to the test . hardy graupner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press review : do we need a minimum wage ?

it was the third wave of so-called " monday demonstrations , " a term used by eastern germans during their protests in 1989 that toppled communism in the region and paved the way for german unification .
curiously enough , the protests in the east this time are directed against a democratically elected government and it ’ s the former communists of the leftist pds that stands to profit most .
" the reforms are hurting the poor while the rich continue to pocket huge profits , " one berlin protester told deutsche welle .
these popular perceptions of schröder ’ s welfare reforms are providing the perfect breeding ground for the comeback of germany ‘ s post-communists .
after crashing out of the national parliament two years ago , they have now surged to a record high in opinion polls , enjoying 7 percent support nationwide .
in economically depressed eastern regions , the pds is now the second-strongest party .
hitting society 's weakest ?
the reformed communists ' charismatic figurehead , gregor gysi , says his party was just putting a finger on the sore spots of schröder ’ s reform policy .
" the economic situation in eastern germany , " he said , " doesn ’ t seem to matter anymore - neither to the government nor to parliament .
in addition , the cuts always hit the weakest in society while the well-to-do are left untouched . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several thousand eastern germans partake in a recent monday demonstration in leipzig anger over the government ’ s welfare cuts is especially strong in eastern germany , because the majority of the 3 million people who are affected by them live there .
the new measures include stiff means-testing and deep cuts in monthly benefit payments for the long-term unemployed .
the chancellor ’ s social democrats are feeling the heat , and with only 21 percent support in the opinion polls , they are trailing the pds by 5 percent ahead of two regional elections in eastern german states .
is populism on the rise ?
spd leaders like party manager uwe benneter are growing nervous and have accused the post communists of stoking popular fears .
" the pds is exploiting the reforms for electioneering purposes in a disgustingly populist manner , " benneter said .
" we must strengthen our campaign to debunk those who are intent only on stoking anger without presenting alternative solutions of their own . "
political analysts believe , however , that the protests are underscoring a persistent trend in the electorate in the east that includes a drift away from the established parties towards those on the extremes .
" there is indeed a danger of that , and it is being sustained by the fact that eastern germans have never had strong party affiliations , " said michael edinger , a political scientist at jena university .
" we ’ re also coming to realize that such loose political ties could be the future of politics in all of germany , raising the specter of large numbers of protest voters quite ready to support extremist parties at the ballot box . "
rightwing-extremist parties are already profiting from the mass protests .
in saxony the national democratic party could enter the regional parliament in september .
the party could increase its votes from one and half to over 5 percent compared the last election , polls have shown .
meanwhile , in brandenburg the german people ’ s union is expected to hold its seats in parliament .

it was the third wave of so-called " monday demonstrations , " a term used by eastern germans during their protests in 1989 that toppled communism in the region and paved the way for german unification .
curiously enough , the protests in the east this time are directed against a democratically elected government and it ’ s the former communists of the leftist pds that stands to profit most .
" the reforms are hurting the poor while the rich continue to pocket huge profits , " one berlin protester told deutsche welle .
these popular perceptions of schröder ’ s welfare reforms are providing the perfect breeding ground for the comeback of germany ‘ s post-communists .
after crashing out of the national parliament two years ago , they have now surged to a record high in opinion polls , enjoying 7 percent support nationwide .
in economically depressed eastern regions , the pds is now the second-strongest party .
hitting society 's weakest ?
the reformed communists ' charismatic figurehead , gregor gysi , says his party was just putting a finger on the sore spots of schröder ’ s reform policy .
" the economic situation in eastern germany , " he said , " doesn ’ t seem to matter anymore - neither to the government nor to parliament .
in addition , the cuts always hit the weakest in society while the well-to-do are left untouched . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several thousand eastern germans partake in a recent monday demonstration in leipzig anger over the government ’ s welfare cuts is especially strong in eastern germany , because the majority of the 3 million people who are affected by them live there .
the new measures include stiff means-testing and deep cuts in monthly benefit payments for the long-term unemployed .
the chancellor ’ s social democrats are feeling the heat , and with only 21 percent support in the opinion polls , they are trailing the pds by 5 percent ahead of two regional elections in eastern german states .
is populism on the rise ?
spd leaders like party manager uwe benneter are growing nervous and have accused the post communists of stoking popular fears .
" the pds is exploiting the reforms for electioneering purposes in a disgustingly populist manner , " benneter said .
" we must strengthen our campaign to debunk those who are intent only on stoking anger without presenting alternative solutions of their own . "
political analysts believe , however , that the protests are underscoring a persistent trend in the electorate in the east that includes a drift away from the established parties towards those on the extremes .
" there is indeed a danger of that , and it is being sustained by the fact that eastern germans have never had strong party affiliations , " said michael edinger , a political scientist at jena university .
" we ’ re also coming to realize that such loose political ties could be the future of politics in all of germany , raising the specter of large numbers of protest voters quite ready to support extremist parties at the ballot box . "
rightwing-extremist parties are already profiting from the mass protests .
in saxony the national democratic party could enter the regional parliament in september .
the party could increase its votes from one and half to over 5 percent compared the last election , polls have shown .
meanwhile , in brandenburg the german people ’ s union is expected to hold its seats in parliament .

but on monday , germany and the united states come together to contest who will grab that chance to play off for the olympic title . whatever the stage , this is the one game from the athens tournament that has everything : rivalry , revenge and the last hurrah .
because these two teams have a history that makes this match more compelling than just any semi-final . in 2003 , the united states and germany met in the semi-finals of the 2003 world cup , a game the germans won , defeating the reigning world champions at the time in their own backyard and going on to claim the ultimate prize for themselves . sweet revenge and bitter rivalry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if ever there was a chance of sweet revenge , this match is just that with the german team gaining pace in their challenge to add olympic gold to their world title .
a us win would scupper that and set up a chance for the former olympic and world champions to get at least one title back at the expense of their greatest rivals . for a number of the us team , this is the last chance to grab more glory .
for highly decorated players such as the so-called " fab five " - mia hamm , julie foudy , joy fawcett , kristine lilly and brandi chastain - this is the last throw of the dice .
another loss at the feet of the germans would bring their international careers top a close on a painful low rather than a joyful high . respect and resolve this is the game the american players wanted .
that 3-0 world cup loss to germany , in a match that was close until the latter minutes , still smarts with the u.s. team and spectators will be primed for one of the potentially great matches of these and possibly any games .

gaining international tournament experience at the 2003 world cup and these summer games , wambach has scored 30 goals in 42 international games .

but on monday , germany and the united states come together to contest who will grab that chance to play off for the olympic title . whatever the stage , this is the one game from the athens tournament that has everything : rivalry , revenge and the last hurrah .
because these two teams have a history that makes this match more compelling than just any semi-final . in 2003 , the united states and germany met in the semi-finals of the 2003 world cup , a game the germans won , defeating the reigning world champions at the time in their own backyard and going on to claim the ultimate prize for themselves . sweet revenge and bitter rivalry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if ever there was a chance of sweet revenge , this match is just that with the german team gaining pace in their challenge to add olympic gold to their world title .
a us win would scupper that and set up a chance for the former olympic and world champions to get at least one title back at the expense of their greatest rivals . for a number of the us team , this is the last chance to grab more glory .
for highly decorated players such as the so-called " fab five " - mia hamm , julie foudy , joy fawcett , kristine lilly and brandi chastain - this is the last throw of the dice .
another loss at the feet of the germans would bring their international careers top a close on a painful low rather than a joyful high . respect and resolve this is the game the american players wanted .
that 3-0 world cup loss to germany , in a match that was close until the latter minutes , still smarts with the u.s. team and spectators will be primed for one of the potentially great matches of these and possibly any games .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " they are an incredible team with an incredible amount of talent , but we want revenge , " us goalkeeper briana scurry told reporters .
" i 'd be lying if i said i did n't want them to feel the same way we felt after they beat us last summer . "
the match could well turn out to be the tale of two strikers .
the us are spearheaded by abby wambach who has led her team in the scoring stakes with three goals so far and has 18 in her 19 international matches this year .
wambach will be going all out to bring some joy to the seething americans . on the other side will be birgit prinz , who will aim to bring the pain to the americans once again .
prinz is now slouch in the scoring stakes either with an overall olympic tally of six goals , including four in one game .
a tale of two strikers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both are world class strikers in their prime , although prinz , who turns 27 later this year , has much more international experience , having made her debut for the germany team as a 16-year-old .
prinz is a veteran of three women 's world cups and three olympics .
she has scored 78 goals in only 121 matches , five off the german record of 83 , set by the now-retired heidi mohr . wambach , 24 , debuted with the us as a 21-year-old in a 4-1 win over germany in chicago in 2001 .
gaining international tournament experience at the 2003 world cup and these summer games , wambach has scored 30 goals in 42 international games .
wambach has been on target in each of the three olympics matches she has played and has become the most imposing american force up front . with so much riding on this game - the end result , the chance to go for olympic gold , the resolution of old grudges and the healing of tender wounds , monday 's semi-final is much more than a soccer match . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans drub china in women 's soccer opener germany 's women thrashed their chinese counterparts with an unexpected 8-0 win wednesday at the athens olympics women 's soccer opener , providing a thrilling start to the games .

thomas dlugaiczyk of the games academy , an institution for the promotion of creative electronic arts , observed the differences from the two previous years .
" -lrb- the german companies -rrb- always attended conferences in the usa and canada , now their people come to us , " dlugaiczyk told dw-world . this was in evidence as more international games developers and hardware manufacturers took the opportunity to announce new products and sales figures at the convention , as the industry prepared for the run-up to the all important , rapidly approaching christmas period . big names in attendance game companies such as electronic arts , ubisoft and buena vista revealed rising sales figures as well as new products while the major console companies used the convention as the tactical arena for the coming competition during the festive season . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : x-box mania in leipzig .
sony , microsoft and nintendo were all out in force in leipzig and laying down the battle lines for the price war to come .
microsoft revealed that its x-box console , currently selling for € 199 , will be reduced to € 149 at the end of august in an attempt to attract pre-christmas shoppers .
microsoft told those who gathered at its stand in the convention hall that it hoped to expand its worldwide x-box sales from 15.5 million to 20 million through the deal . over at the sony stand , the makers of playstation struck back during their own show at the convention by following suit , dropping the playstation 2 to the same price . piracy hits german industry but despite the popularity of the convention and the entertainment genre it promotes , the figures belie a worrying downward trend in the computer game industry in germany . in an industry that relies much on exports , germany is seen as a developing country in the context of the european computer game arena .
in the first half of this year , german computer game sales abroad totaled € 111 million , a decline of 36.9 percent on the same six month period in 2003 . there are a number of factors being attributed to this .
one is piracy .
each year , the german computer game industry loses as much as € 400 million through the copying of games and the online sharing of products , with as many as 54 million illegal copies per year being made and sold in germany . another is user-friendliness .
tom putzki , chairperson of g.a.m.e. , the german federation of computer game developers , told dw-world that one reason could be that designers try too hard in the creation of new products and that constantly trying to reinvent the wheel may push creative boundaries but actually alienate consumers . complexity alienates users bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some games take too long to learn , say developers .
bob bates , a game writer from the united states who attended the developer 's conference at the trade fair , said that german games are too complex .
" you demand too much of the consumers .
it takes too long until the player understands the game . "
bates said that u.s. game players give a new game a probation period of five minutes at the most .
" if they have n't understood the game by then and have not enjoyed themselves , then the game is not bought . " david reeves , president and coo of sony computer entertainment europe , told those who gathered to hear his speech that there was still plenty of market growth slumbering in the german games business , stressing that a wider target group and acceptance of gaming as a mainstream entertainment product would be key factors to future success . finding the german target reeves raised the issue that despite germany 's appetite for consuming videogames , very little development actually took place within german borders .

microsoft revealed that its x-box console , currently selling for € 199 , will be reduced to € 149 at the end of august in an attempt to attract pre-christmas shoppers .
microsoft told those who gathered at its stand in the convention hall that it hoped to expand its worldwide x-box sales from 15.5 million to 20 million through the deal . over at the sony stand , the makers of playstation struck back during their own show at the convention by following suit , dropping the playstation 2 to the same price . piracy hits german industry but despite the popularity of the convention and the entertainment genre it promotes , the figures belie a worrying downward trend in the computer game industry in germany . in an industry that relies much on exports , germany is seen as a developing country in the context of the european computer game arena .

bob bates , a game writer from the united states who attended the developer 's conference at the trade fair , said that german games are too complex .
" you demand too much of the consumers .
it takes too long until the player understands the game . "
bates said that u.s. game players give a new game a probation period of five minutes at the most .
" if they have n't understood the game by then and have not enjoyed themselves , then the game is not bought .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 23.08.2004 german press review : do we need a minimum wage ? monday 's editorial pages weighed in on the debate about whether germany should institute a minimum wage and the controversy surrounding germany 's equestrian team , which lost two medals to appeals . the süddeutsche zeitung told its readers on its front page that the purpose of the minimum wage is to entice the trade unions into supporting the controversial hartz iv welfare reform for the long-term unemployed .
the paper then took the proposal by franz müntefering , head of the ruling social democratic party , as an opportunity to examine the plight of eastern germany , where unemployment is especially high .
it opened a leading article with the words " are eastern germans second-class citizens ? "
the süddeutsche answered its own question and wrote that the two halves of the country are beginning to drift even farther apart under the pressure of the reforms .
protests and demonstrations against hartz iv are quite legitimate - especially in eastern germany , where citizens were forced to refrain from any sort of protest for years on end .
the paper concluded with what it evidently regarded as the key issue : " what is the point of the government piling the pressure on the unemployed , when there simply is n't enough work to go round in many parts of the country ? "
the neue osnabrücker zeitung tackled the proposal for a minimum wage head on .
its verdict : it 's not a very realistic idea .
first , because it would mean interfering with free collective bargaining , which would annoy the trade unions .
they would quite rightly argue that local union branches and employers know far better than anybody else which wage levels are appropriate in their part of the country .
second , the conservative opposition , as a firm supporter of deregulation , is going to balk at any hint of state intervention .
in addition , the impact of a minimum wage is extremely difficult to predict .
it could indeed increase the purchasing power of those who have jobs , but the effect on the number of people in work is less certain , the paper wrote .
the badische zeitung said germany 's trade unions are divided over the minimum wage .
the engineering workers union ig metall has rejected it outright , fearing that it will weaken the system of free collective bargaining .
but the catering union came out in favor .
its members work largely for small businesses - which is also one of the reasons their union is not nearly as strong as ig metall .
the state , the daily commented , can not be responsible for everything and certainly not for setting wage levels .
that is the responsibility of the trade unions - and the employers .

the nordwest zeitung in oldenburg remarked that the debate has nothing to do with fairness .

the süddeutsche answered its own question and wrote that the two halves of the country are beginning to drift even farther apart under the pressure of the reforms .
protests and demonstrations against hartz iv are quite legitimate - especially in eastern germany , where citizens were forced to refrain from any sort of protest for years on end .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de olympics -pipe- 23.08.2004 rivalry and revenge großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany took the world cup from the us team in its own backyard the olympic women 's soccer tournament reaches fever pitch on monday as world champions germany and bitter rival united states clash for a place in the final . it is the match that most neutrals would want to see as the final game for the gold medal in the women 's soccer tournament .
but on monday , germany and the united states come together to contest who will grab that chance to play off for the olympic title . whatever the stage , this is the one game from the athens tournament that has everything : rivalry , revenge and the last hurrah .
because these two teams have a history that makes this match more compelling than just any semi-final . in 2003 , the united states and germany met in the semi-finals of the 2003 world cup , a game the germans won , defeating the reigning world champions at the time in their own backyard and going on to claim the ultimate prize for themselves . sweet revenge and bitter rivalry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if ever there was a chance of sweet revenge , this match is just that with the german team gaining pace in their challenge to add olympic gold to their world title .
a us win would scupper that and set up a chance for the former olympic and world champions to get at least one title back at the expense of their greatest rivals . for a number of the us team , this is the last chance to grab more glory .
for highly decorated players such as the so-called " fab five " - mia hamm , julie foudy , joy fawcett , kristine lilly and brandi chastain - this is the last throw of the dice .
another loss at the feet of the germans would bring their international careers top a close on a painful low rather than a joyful high . respect and resolve this is the game the american players wanted .
that 3-0 world cup loss to germany , in a match that was close until the latter minutes , still smarts with the u.s. team and spectators will be primed for one of the potentially great matches of these and possibly any games .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " they are an incredible team with an incredible amount of talent , but we want revenge , " us goalkeeper briana scurry told reporters .
" i 'd be lying if i said i did n't want them to feel the same way we felt after they beat us last summer . "
the match could well turn out to be the tale of two strikers .
the us are spearheaded by abby wambach who has led her team in the scoring stakes with three goals so far and has 18 in her 19 international matches this year .
wambach will be going all out to bring some joy to the seething americans . on the other side will be birgit prinz , who will aim to bring the pain to the americans once again .
prinz is now slouch in the scoring stakes either with an overall olympic tally of six goals , including four in one game .
a tale of two strikers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both are world class strikers in their prime , although prinz , who turns 27 later this year , has much more international experience , having made her debut for the germany team as a 16-year-old .
prinz is a veteran of three women 's world cups and three olympics .
she has scored 78 goals in only 121 matches , five off the german record of 83 , set by the now-retired heidi mohr . wambach , 24 , debuted with the us as a 21-year-old in a 4-1 win over germany in chicago in 2001 .
gaining international tournament experience at the 2003 world cup and these summer games , wambach has scored 30 goals in 42 international games .
wambach has been on target in each of the three olympics matches she has played and has become the most imposing american force up front . with so much riding on this game - the end result , the chance to go for olympic gold , the resolution of old grudges and the healing of tender wounds , monday 's semi-final is much more than a soccer match . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans drub china in women 's soccer opener germany 's women thrashed their chinese counterparts with an unexpected 8-0 win wednesday at the athens olympics women 's soccer opener , providing a thrilling start to the games .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 23.08.2004 video game fair spotlights european market großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the convention was a success but it raised questions for german firms the third computer games convention came to an end in leipzig on sunday with positive feedback for the future of the event itself but less than good news for the german gaming industry . the third annual computer games convention , the biggest trade fair for interactive entertainment in europe , came to a close in leipzig on sunday .
over 100,000 visitors came , saw and played cutting edge games , experienced the latest in edu- and infotainment and sampled the newest consoles and hardware from over 270 exhibitors from 13 countries while the conventions played host to no less than 68 world premieres . the expanding popularity of the german convention was in evidence as the convention center swelled with the biggest names in the industry .
thomas dlugaiczyk of the games academy , an institution for the promotion of creative electronic arts , observed the differences from the two previous years .
" -lrb- the german companies -rrb- always attended conferences in the usa and canada , now their people come to us , " dlugaiczyk told dw-world . this was in evidence as more international games developers and hardware manufacturers took the opportunity to announce new products and sales figures at the convention , as the industry prepared for the run-up to the all important , rapidly approaching christmas period . big names in attendance game companies such as electronic arts , ubisoft and buena vista revealed rising sales figures as well as new products while the major console companies used the convention as the tactical arena for the coming competition during the festive season . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : x-box mania in leipzig .
sony , microsoft and nintendo were all out in force in leipzig and laying down the battle lines for the price war to come .
microsoft revealed that its x-box console , currently selling for € 199 , will be reduced to € 149 at the end of august in an attempt to attract pre-christmas shoppers .
microsoft told those who gathered at its stand in the convention hall that it hoped to expand its worldwide x-box sales from 15.5 million to 20 million through the deal . over at the sony stand , the makers of playstation struck back during their own show at the convention by following suit , dropping the playstation 2 to the same price . piracy hits german industry but despite the popularity of the convention and the entertainment genre it promotes , the figures belie a worrying downward trend in the computer game industry in germany . in an industry that relies much on exports , germany is seen as a developing country in the context of the european computer game arena .
in the first half of this year , german computer game sales abroad totaled € 111 million , a decline of 36.9 percent on the same six month period in 2003 . there are a number of factors being attributed to this .
one is piracy .
each year , the german computer game industry loses as much as € 400 million through the copying of games and the online sharing of products , with as many as 54 million illegal copies per year being made and sold in germany . another is user-friendliness .
tom putzki , chairperson of g.a.m.e. , the german federation of computer game developers , told dw-world that one reason could be that designers try too hard in the creation of new products and that constantly trying to reinvent the wheel may push creative boundaries but actually alienate consumers . complexity alienates users bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some games take too long to learn , say developers .
bob bates , a game writer from the united states who attended the developer 's conference at the trade fair , said that german games are too complex .
" you demand too much of the consumers .
it takes too long until the player understands the game . "
bates said that u.s. game players give a new game a probation period of five minutes at the most .
" if they have n't understood the game by then and have not enjoyed themselves , then the game is not bought . " david reeves , president and coo of sony computer entertainment europe , told those who gathered to hear his speech that there was still plenty of market growth slumbering in the german games business , stressing that a wider target group and acceptance of gaming as a mainstream entertainment product would be key factors to future success . finding the german target reeves raised the issue that despite germany 's appetite for consuming videogames , very little development actually took place within german borders .
reeves believes that just like racing games in spain and tennis games in france , there are game genres that can hit the sweet spot in germany .
he urged industry representatives to invest in mass market-friendly themes and support development of locally relevant software within germany . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany : the trade fair capital despite its economic crisis , germany has maintained its position as the world 's premier trade fair location .

the süddeutsche answered its own question and wrote that the two halves of the country are beginning to drift even farther apart under the pressure of the reforms .
protests and demonstrations against hartz iv are quite legitimate - especially in eastern germany , where citizens were forced to refrain from any sort of protest for years on end .
the paper concluded with what it evidently regarded as the key issue : " what is the point of the government piling the pressure on the unemployed , when there simply is n't enough work to go round in many parts of the country ? "
the neue osnabrücker zeitung tackled the proposal for a minimum wage head on .
its verdict : it 's not a very realistic idea .
first , because it would mean interfering with free collective bargaining , which would annoy the trade unions .
they would quite rightly argue that local union branches and employers know far better than anybody else which wage levels are appropriate in their part of the country .
second , the conservative opposition , as a firm supporter of deregulation , is going to balk at any hint of state intervention .
in addition , the impact of a minimum wage is extremely difficult to predict .
it could indeed increase the purchasing power of those who have jobs , but the effect on the number of people in work is less certain , the paper wrote .
the badische zeitung said germany 's trade unions are divided over the minimum wage .
the engineering workers union ig metall has rejected it outright , fearing that it will weaken the system of free collective bargaining .
but the catering union came out in favor .
its members work largely for small businesses - which is also one of the reasons their union is not nearly as strong as ig metall .
the state , the daily commented , can not be responsible for everything and certainly not for setting wage levels .
that is the responsibility of the trade unions - and the employers .
many german papers also found space for the brawl at the olympics over equestrian gold , silver and bronze that was settled at the court of arbitration on saturday , three days after the three-day event finished .
german bettina hoy lost two gold medals after a challenge from france , britain and the united states .
the nordwest zeitung in oldenburg remarked that the debate has nothing to do with fairness .
the histrionics underline the dilemma facing contemporary sport , whose rules are becoming increasingly complicated .
seen legally , saturday 's decision may be water-tight .
it does , however , nothing to promote integrity or honesty in sport , the paper opined . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de € 1 jobs for germany 's unemployed ?
to ease the pain of its new unemployment benefit cuts , germany 's economics minister , wolfgang clement , has floated a proposal to create so-called one-euro community jobs for the long-term unemployed .

but on monday , germany and the united states come together to contest who will grab that chance to play off for the olympic title . whatever the stage , this is the one game from the athens tournament that has everything : rivalry , revenge and the last hurrah .
because these two teams have a history that makes this match more compelling than just any semi-final . in 2003 , the united states and germany met in the semi-finals of the 2003 world cup , a game the germans won , defeating the reigning world champions at the time in their own backyard and going on to claim the ultimate prize for themselves . sweet revenge and bitter rivalry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if ever there was a chance of sweet revenge , this match is just that with the german team gaining pace in their challenge to add olympic gold to their world title .
a us win would scupper that and set up a chance for the former olympic and world champions to get at least one title back at the expense of their greatest rivals . for a number of the us team , this is the last chance to grab more glory .
for highly decorated players such as the so-called " fab five " - mia hamm , julie foudy , joy fawcett , kristine lilly and brandi chastain - this is the last throw of the dice .
another loss at the feet of the germans would bring their international careers top a close on a painful low rather than a joyful high . respect and resolve this is the game the american players wanted .
that 3-0 world cup loss to germany , in a match that was close until the latter minutes , still smarts with the u.s. team and spectators will be primed for one of the potentially great matches of these and possibly any games .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " they are an incredible team with an incredible amount of talent , but we want revenge , " us goalkeeper briana scurry told reporters .
" i 'd be lying if i said i did n't want them to feel the same way we felt after they beat us last summer . "
the match could well turn out to be the tale of two strikers .
the us are spearheaded by abby wambach who has led her team in the scoring stakes with three goals so far and has 18 in her 19 international matches this year .
wambach will be going all out to bring some joy to the seething americans . on the other side will be birgit prinz , who will aim to bring the pain to the americans once again .
prinz is now slouch in the scoring stakes either with an overall olympic tally of six goals , including four in one game .
a tale of two strikers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both are world class strikers in their prime , although prinz , who turns 27 later this year , has much more international experience , having made her debut for the germany team as a 16-year-old .
prinz is a veteran of three women 's world cups and three olympics .
she has scored 78 goals in only 121 matches , five off the german record of 83 , set by the now-retired heidi mohr . wambach , 24 , debuted with the us as a 21-year-old in a 4-1 win over germany in chicago in 2001 .
gaining international tournament experience at the 2003 world cup and these summer games , wambach has scored 30 goals in 42 international games .
wambach has been on target in each of the three olympics matches she has played and has become the most imposing american force up front . with so much riding on this game - the end result , the chance to go for olympic gold , the resolution of old grudges and the healing of tender wounds , monday 's semi-final is much more than a soccer match . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans drub china in women 's soccer opener germany 's women thrashed their chinese counterparts with an unexpected 8-0 win wednesday at the athens olympics women 's soccer opener , providing a thrilling start to the games .

now , in an apparent bid to sweeten the harsh , but necessary social cuts ahead , spd chief franz müntefering has launched a fresh debate on possible legislation governing the country 's minimum wage .
no taboo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd party chief franz muentefering as it stands , there are no relevant state regulations in place , as wages are invariably defined tariff negotiations between management and trade unions .
on sunday , müntefering said that the traditional tariff autonomy should not be treated as a taboo , but warned against jumping to conclusions . “ we ’ re currently debating this issue with the trade unions .
some unions are in favor of legislation on minimum wages , others aren ’ t .
i myself have been hesitant in the past to push for minimum wages , as such a move amounts to an attack on the country ’ s tariff autonomy , if you choose to see it that way .
but of course we also have to see the negative effects of wage dumping policies .
so , my party is willing to debate this at length with the unions , and i ’ m optimistic that we ’ ll reach a consensus in the autumn , ” he said .
müntefering ’ s offer to debate this issue with the trade unions has drawn mixed reactions from policy-makers across the political spectrum .
the opposition liberal democrats have rejected the idea outright , and social democratic economics and labor minister wolfgang clement isn ’ t amused either .
“ i ’ m in favour of looking at the situation in various industries .
i don ’ t think that legislation on minimum wages would make sense for all sectors .
and whether the trade unions are willing to at least partly give up the decades-old principle of tariff autonomy remains to be seen , ” clement said . open to consideration for their part , the trade unions have indicated their willingness to discuss the possibility of legislation in coming weeks .
margret moehring-rahne , deputy head of germany ’ s powerful service sector union , ver.di believes that minimum wages would help to cushion the impact of the labor reforms , meaning the long-term unemployed could not be forced to accept a job if the payment were outside the agreed minimum wage bracket .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal labor agency is stamped with a ' no ' to reforms the question to be considered is whether minimum wages will really assist workers by helping to prevent the exploitation of the lowest paid , or harm them by pricing low-skilled workers out of the labor force altogether .
supporters of minimum wages argue that higher wages will create greater spending power , thus ultimately cranking up the demand for larger workforces . that at least is the theory , and negotiations between the government and the trade unions in the coming weeks will show whether germany gets a chance to put it to the test . hardy graupner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press review : do we need a minimum wage ?
monday 's editorial pages found plenty to write about concerning the debate about whether germany should institute a minimum wage and the brouhaha surrounding germany 's equestrian team , which lost two medals to appeals .

a us win would scupper that and set up a chance for the former olympic and world champions to get at least one title back at the expense of their greatest rivals . for a number of the us team , this is the last chance to grab more glory .
for highly decorated players such as the so-called " fab five " - mia hamm , julie foudy , joy fawcett , kristine lilly and brandi chastain - this is the last throw of the dice .
another loss at the feet of the germans would bring their international careers top a close on a painful low rather than a joyful high . respect and resolve this is the game the american players wanted .
that 3-0 world cup loss to germany , in a match that was close until the latter minutes , still smarts with the u.s. team and spectators will be primed for one of the potentially great matches of these and possibly any games .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " they are an incredible team with an incredible amount of talent , but we want revenge , " us goalkeeper briana scurry told reporters .
" i 'd be lying if i said i did n't want them to feel the same way we felt after they beat us last summer . "
the match could well turn out to be the tale of two strikers .
the us are spearheaded by abby wambach who has led her team in the scoring stakes with three goals so far and has 18 in her 19 international matches this year .
wambach will be going all out to bring some joy to the seething americans . on the other side will be birgit prinz , who will aim to bring the pain to the americans once again .
prinz is now slouch in the scoring stakes either with an overall olympic tally of six goals , including four in one game .
a tale of two strikers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both are world class strikers in their prime , although prinz , who turns 27 later this year , has much more international experience , having made her debut for the germany team as a 16-year-old .
prinz is a veteran of three women 's world cups and three olympics .
she has scored 78 goals in only 121 matches , five off the german record of 83 , set by the now-retired heidi mohr . wambach , 24 , debuted with the us as a 21-year-old in a 4-1 win over germany in chicago in 2001 .
gaining international tournament experience at the 2003 world cup and these summer games , wambach has scored 30 goals in 42 international games .
wambach has been on target in each of the three olympics matches she has played and has become the most imposing american force up front . with so much riding on this game - the end result , the chance to go for olympic gold , the resolution of old grudges and the healing of tender wounds , monday 's semi-final is much more than a soccer match . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans drub china in women 's soccer opener germany 's women thrashed their chinese counterparts with an unexpected 8-0 win wednesday at the athens olympics women 's soccer opener , providing a thrilling start to the games .

now , in an apparent bid to sweeten the harsh , but necessary social cuts ahead , spd chief franz müntefering has launched a fresh debate on possible legislation governing the country 's minimum wage .
no taboo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd party chief franz muentefering as it stands , there are no relevant state regulations in place , as wages are invariably defined tariff negotiations between management and trade unions .
on sunday , müntefering said that the traditional tariff autonomy should not be treated as a taboo , but warned against jumping to conclusions . “ we ’ re currently debating this issue with the trade unions .
some unions are in favor of legislation on minimum wages , others aren ’ t .
i myself have been hesitant in the past to push for minimum wages , as such a move amounts to an attack on the country ’ s tariff autonomy , if you choose to see it that way .
but of course we also have to see the negative effects of wage dumping policies .
so , my party is willing to debate this at length with the unions , and i ’ m optimistic that we ’ ll reach a consensus in the autumn , ” he said .
müntefering ’ s offer to debate this issue with the trade unions has drawn mixed reactions from policy-makers across the political spectrum .
the opposition liberal democrats have rejected the idea outright , and social democratic economics and labor minister wolfgang clement isn ’ t amused either .
“ i ’ m in favour of looking at the situation in various industries .
i don ’ t think that legislation on minimum wages would make sense for all sectors .
and whether the trade unions are willing to at least partly give up the decades-old principle of tariff autonomy remains to be seen , ” clement said . open to consideration for their part , the trade unions have indicated their willingness to discuss the possibility of legislation in coming weeks .
margret moehring-rahne , deputy head of germany ’ s powerful service sector union , ver.di believes that minimum wages would help to cushion the impact of the labor reforms , meaning the long-term unemployed could not be forced to accept a job if the payment were outside the agreed minimum wage bracket .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal labor agency is stamped with a ' no ' to reforms the question to be considered is whether minimum wages will really assist workers by helping to prevent the exploitation of the lowest paid , or harm them by pricing low-skilled workers out of the labor force altogether .
supporters of minimum wages argue that higher wages will create greater spending power , thus ultimately cranking up the demand for larger workforces . that at least is the theory , and negotiations between the government and the trade unions in the coming weeks will show whether germany gets a chance to put it to the test . hardy graupner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press review : do we need a minimum wage ?

it was the third wave of so-called " monday demonstrations , " a term used by eastern germans during their protests in 1989 that toppled communism in the region and paved the way for german unification .
curiously enough , the protests in the east this time are directed against a democratically elected government and it ’ s the former communists of the leftist pds that stands to profit most .
" the reforms are hurting the poor while the rich continue to pocket huge profits , " one berlin protester told deutsche welle .
these popular perceptions of schröder ’ s welfare reforms are providing the perfect breeding ground for the comeback of germany ‘ s post-communists .
after crashing out of the national parliament two years ago , they have now surged to a record high in opinion polls , enjoying 7 percent support nationwide .
in economically depressed eastern regions , the pds is now the second-strongest party .
hitting society 's weakest ?
the reformed communists ' charismatic figurehead , gregor gysi , says his party was just putting a finger on the sore spots of schröder ’ s reform policy .
" the economic situation in eastern germany , " he said , " doesn ’ t seem to matter anymore - neither to the government nor to parliament .
in addition , the cuts always hit the weakest in society while the well-to-do are left untouched . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several thousand eastern germans partake in a recent monday demonstration in leipzig anger over the government ’ s welfare cuts is especially strong in eastern germany , because the majority of the 3 million people who are affected by them live there .
the new measures include stiff means-testing and deep cuts in monthly benefit payments for the long-term unemployed .
the chancellor ’ s social democrats are feeling the heat , and with only 21 percent support in the opinion polls , they are trailing the pds by 5 percent ahead of two regional elections in eastern german states .
is populism on the rise ?
spd leaders like party manager uwe benneter are growing nervous and have accused the post communists of stoking popular fears .
" the pds is exploiting the reforms for electioneering purposes in a disgustingly populist manner , " benneter said .
" we must strengthen our campaign to debunk those who are intent only on stoking anger without presenting alternative solutions of their own . "
political analysts believe , however , that the protests are underscoring a persistent trend in the electorate in the east that includes a drift away from the established parties towards those on the extremes .
" there is indeed a danger of that , and it is being sustained by the fact that eastern germans have never had strong party affiliations , " said michael edinger , a political scientist at jena university .
" we ’ re also coming to realize that such loose political ties could be the future of politics in all of germany , raising the specter of large numbers of protest voters quite ready to support extremist parties at the ballot box . "
rightwing-extremist parties are already profiting from the mass protests .
in saxony the national democratic party could enter the regional parliament in september .
the party could increase its votes from one and half to over 5 percent compared the last election , polls have shown .
meanwhile , in brandenburg the german people ’ s union is expected to hold its seats in parliament .
both parties have waged anti-reform campaigns as seeking to stoke resentment towards foreigners . uwe hessler -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de can minimum wage debate pacify protesters ?

now , in an apparent bid to sweeten the harsh , but necessary social cuts ahead , spd chief franz müntefering has launched a fresh debate on possible legislation governing the country 's minimum wage .
no taboo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd party chief franz muentefering as it stands , there are no relevant state regulations in place , as wages are invariably defined tariff negotiations between management and trade unions .
on sunday , müntefering said that the traditional tariff autonomy should not be treated as a taboo , but warned against jumping to conclusions . “ we ’ re currently debating this issue with the trade unions .
some unions are in favor of legislation on minimum wages , others aren ’ t .
i myself have been hesitant in the past to push for minimum wages , as such a move amounts to an attack on the country ’ s tariff autonomy , if you choose to see it that way .
but of course we also have to see the negative effects of wage dumping policies .
so , my party is willing to debate this at length with the unions , and i ’ m optimistic that we ’ ll reach a consensus in the autumn , ” he said .
müntefering ’ s offer to debate this issue with the trade unions has drawn mixed reactions from policy-makers across the political spectrum .
the opposition liberal democrats have rejected the idea outright , and social democratic economics and labor minister wolfgang clement isn ’ t amused either .
“ i ’ m in favour of looking at the situation in various industries .
i don ’ t think that legislation on minimum wages would make sense for all sectors .
and whether the trade unions are willing to at least partly give up the decades-old principle of tariff autonomy remains to be seen , ” clement said . open to consideration for their part , the trade unions have indicated their willingness to discuss the possibility of legislation in coming weeks .
margret moehring-rahne , deputy head of germany ’ s powerful service sector union , ver.di believes that minimum wages would help to cushion the impact of the labor reforms , meaning the long-term unemployed could not be forced to accept a job if the payment were outside the agreed minimum wage bracket .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal labor agency is stamped with a ' no ' to reforms the question to be considered is whether minimum wages will really assist workers by helping to prevent the exploitation of the lowest paid , or harm them by pricing low-skilled workers out of the labor force altogether .
supporters of minimum wages argue that higher wages will create greater spending power , thus ultimately cranking up the demand for larger workforces . that at least is the theory , and negotiations between the government and the trade unions in the coming weeks will show whether germany gets a chance to put it to the test . hardy graupner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press review : do we need a minimum wage ?
monday 's editorial pages found plenty to write about concerning the debate about whether germany should institute a minimum wage and the brouhaha surrounding germany 's equestrian team , which lost two medals to appeals .

but on monday , germany and the united states come together to contest who will grab that chance to play off for the olympic title . whatever the stage , this is the one game from the athens tournament that has everything : rivalry , revenge and the last hurrah .
because these two teams have a history that makes this match more compelling than just any semi-final . in 2003 , the united states and germany met in the semi-finals of the 2003 world cup , a game the germans won , defeating the reigning world champions at the time in their own backyard and going on to claim the ultimate prize for themselves . sweet revenge and bitter rivalry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if ever there was a chance of sweet revenge , this match is just that with the german team gaining pace in their challenge to add olympic gold to their world title .
a us win would scupper that and set up a chance for the former olympic and world champions to get at least one title back at the expense of their greatest rivals . for a number of the us team , this is the last chance to grab more glory .
for highly decorated players such as the so-called " fab five " - mia hamm , julie foudy , joy fawcett , kristine lilly and brandi chastain - this is the last throw of the dice .
another loss at the feet of the germans would bring their international careers top a close on a painful low rather than a joyful high . respect and resolve this is the game the american players wanted .
that 3-0 world cup loss to germany , in a match that was close until the latter minutes , still smarts with the u.s. team and spectators will be primed for one of the potentially great matches of these and possibly any games .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " they are an incredible team with an incredible amount of talent , but we want revenge , " us goalkeeper briana scurry told reporters .
" i 'd be lying if i said i did n't want them to feel the same way we felt after they beat us last summer . "
the match could well turn out to be the tale of two strikers .
the us are spearheaded by abby wambach who has led her team in the scoring stakes with three goals so far and has 18 in her 19 international matches this year .
wambach will be going all out to bring some joy to the seething americans . on the other side will be birgit prinz , who will aim to bring the pain to the americans once again .
prinz is now slouch in the scoring stakes either with an overall olympic tally of six goals , including four in one game .
a tale of two strikers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both are world class strikers in their prime , although prinz , who turns 27 later this year , has much more international experience , having made her debut for the germany team as a 16-year-old .
prinz is a veteran of three women 's world cups and three olympics .
she has scored 78 goals in only 121 matches , five off the german record of 83 , set by the now-retired heidi mohr . wambach , 24 , debuted with the us as a 21-year-old in a 4-1 win over germany in chicago in 2001 .
gaining international tournament experience at the 2003 world cup and these summer games , wambach has scored 30 goals in 42 international games .
wambach has been on target in each of the three olympics matches she has played and has become the most imposing american force up front . with so much riding on this game - the end result , the chance to go for olympic gold , the resolution of old grudges and the healing of tender wounds , monday 's semi-final is much more than a soccer match . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans drub china in women 's soccer opener germany 's women thrashed their chinese counterparts with an unexpected 8-0 win wednesday at the athens olympics women 's soccer opener , providing a thrilling start to the games .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 23.08.2004 video game fair spotlights european market großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the convention was a success but it raised questions for german firms the third computer games convention came to an end in leipzig on sunday with positive feedback for the future of the event itself but less than good news for the german gaming industry . the third annual computer games convention , the biggest trade fair for interactive entertainment in europe , came to a close in leipzig on sunday .
over 100,000 visitors came , saw and played cutting edge games , experienced the latest in edu- and infotainment and sampled the newest consoles and hardware from over 270 exhibitors from 13 countries while the conventions played host to no less than 68 world premieres . the expanding popularity of the german convention was in evidence as the convention center swelled with the biggest names in the industry .
thomas dlugaiczyk of the games academy , an institution for the promotion of creative electronic arts , observed the differences from the two previous years .
" -lrb- the german companies -rrb- always attended conferences in the usa and canada , now their people come to us , " dlugaiczyk told dw-world . this was in evidence as more international games developers and hardware manufacturers took the opportunity to announce new products and sales figures at the convention , as the industry prepared for the run-up to the all important , rapidly approaching christmas period . big names in attendance game companies such as electronic arts , ubisoft and buena vista revealed rising sales figures as well as new products while the major console companies used the convention as the tactical arena for the coming competition during the festive season . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : x-box mania in leipzig .
sony , microsoft and nintendo were all out in force in leipzig and laying down the battle lines for the price war to come .
microsoft revealed that its x-box console , currently selling for € 199 , will be reduced to € 149 at the end of august in an attempt to attract pre-christmas shoppers .
microsoft told those who gathered at its stand in the convention hall that it hoped to expand its worldwide x-box sales from 15.5 million to 20 million through the deal . over at the sony stand , the makers of playstation struck back during their own show at the convention by following suit , dropping the playstation 2 to the same price . piracy hits german industry but despite the popularity of the convention and the entertainment genre it promotes , the figures belie a worrying downward trend in the computer game industry in germany . in an industry that relies much on exports , germany is seen as a developing country in the context of the european computer game arena .
in the first half of this year , german computer game sales abroad totaled € 111 million , a decline of 36.9 percent on the same six month period in 2003 . there are a number of factors being attributed to this .
one is piracy .
each year , the german computer game industry loses as much as € 400 million through the copying of games and the online sharing of products , with as many as 54 million illegal copies per year being made and sold in germany . another is user-friendliness .
tom putzki , chairperson of g.a.m.e. , the german federation of computer game developers , told dw-world that one reason could be that designers try too hard in the creation of new products and that constantly trying to reinvent the wheel may push creative boundaries but actually alienate consumers . complexity alienates users bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some games take too long to learn , say developers .
bob bates , a game writer from the united states who attended the developer 's conference at the trade fair , said that german games are too complex .
" you demand too much of the consumers .
it takes too long until the player understands the game . "
bates said that u.s. game players give a new game a probation period of five minutes at the most .
" if they have n't understood the game by then and have not enjoyed themselves , then the game is not bought . " david reeves , president and coo of sony computer entertainment europe , told those who gathered to hear his speech that there was still plenty of market growth slumbering in the german games business , stressing that a wider target group and acceptance of gaming as a mainstream entertainment product would be key factors to future success . finding the german target reeves raised the issue that despite germany 's appetite for consuming videogames , very little development actually took place within german borders .
reeves believes that just like racing games in spain and tennis games in france , there are game genres that can hit the sweet spot in germany .
he urged industry representatives to invest in mass market-friendly themes and support development of locally relevant software within germany . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany : the trade fair capital despite its economic crisis , germany has maintained its position as the world 's premier trade fair location .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.08.2004 ex-communists ride high on protest wave großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pds figurehead gregor gysi says reforms are hitting the poorest the success of germany 's " monday demonstrations , " are symbolic of the unexpected return of the reformed communists , who took a drubbing in the last federal elections but are ahead of the chancellor 's party in some polls . some 80,000 protesters took to the streets on monday evening in mass rallies against chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s welfare reforms throughout germany .
it was the third wave of so-called " monday demonstrations , " a term used by eastern germans during their protests in 1989 that toppled communism in the region and paved the way for german unification .
curiously enough , the protests in the east this time are directed against a democratically elected government and it ’ s the former communists of the leftist pds that stands to profit most .
" the reforms are hurting the poor while the rich continue to pocket huge profits , " one berlin protester told deutsche welle .
these popular perceptions of schröder ’ s welfare reforms are providing the perfect breeding ground for the comeback of germany ‘ s post-communists .
after crashing out of the national parliament two years ago , they have now surged to a record high in opinion polls , enjoying 7 percent support nationwide .
in economically depressed eastern regions , the pds is now the second-strongest party .
hitting society 's weakest ?
the reformed communists ' charismatic figurehead , gregor gysi , says his party was just putting a finger on the sore spots of schröder ’ s reform policy .
" the economic situation in eastern germany , " he said , " doesn ’ t seem to matter anymore - neither to the government nor to parliament .
in addition , the cuts always hit the weakest in society while the well-to-do are left untouched . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several thousand eastern germans partake in a recent monday demonstration in leipzig anger over the government ’ s welfare cuts is especially strong in eastern germany , because the majority of the 3 million people who are affected by them live there .
the new measures include stiff means-testing and deep cuts in monthly benefit payments for the long-term unemployed .
the chancellor ’ s social democrats are feeling the heat , and with only 21 percent support in the opinion polls , they are trailing the pds by 5 percent ahead of two regional elections in eastern german states .
is populism on the rise ?
spd leaders like party manager uwe benneter are growing nervous and have accused the post communists of stoking popular fears .
" the pds is exploiting the reforms for electioneering purposes in a disgustingly populist manner , " benneter said .
" we must strengthen our campaign to debunk those who are intent only on stoking anger without presenting alternative solutions of their own . "
political analysts believe , however , that the protests are underscoring a persistent trend in the electorate in the east that includes a drift away from the established parties towards those on the extremes .
" there is indeed a danger of that , and it is being sustained by the fact that eastern germans have never had strong party affiliations , " said michael edinger , a political scientist at jena university .
" we ’ re also coming to realize that such loose political ties could be the future of politics in all of germany , raising the specter of large numbers of protest voters quite ready to support extremist parties at the ballot box . "
rightwing-extremist parties are already profiting from the mass protests .
in saxony the national democratic party could enter the regional parliament in september .
the party could increase its votes from one and half to over 5 percent compared the last election , polls have shown .
meanwhile , in brandenburg the german people ’ s union is expected to hold its seats in parliament .
both parties have waged anti-reform campaigns as seeking to stoke resentment towards foreigners . uwe hessler -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de can minimum wage debate pacify protesters ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 23.08.2004 german press review : do we need a minimum wage ? monday 's editorial pages weighed in on the debate about whether germany should institute a minimum wage and the controversy surrounding germany 's equestrian team , which lost two medals to appeals . the süddeutsche zeitung told its readers on its front page that the purpose of the minimum wage is to entice the trade unions into supporting the controversial hartz iv welfare reform for the long-term unemployed .
the paper then took the proposal by franz müntefering , head of the ruling social democratic party , as an opportunity to examine the plight of eastern germany , where unemployment is especially high .
it opened a leading article with the words " are eastern germans second-class citizens ? "
the süddeutsche answered its own question and wrote that the two halves of the country are beginning to drift even farther apart under the pressure of the reforms .
protests and demonstrations against hartz iv are quite legitimate - especially in eastern germany , where citizens were forced to refrain from any sort of protest for years on end .
the paper concluded with what it evidently regarded as the key issue : " what is the point of the government piling the pressure on the unemployed , when there simply is n't enough work to go round in many parts of the country ? "
the neue osnabrücker zeitung tackled the proposal for a minimum wage head on .
its verdict : it 's not a very realistic idea .
first , because it would mean interfering with free collective bargaining , which would annoy the trade unions .
they would quite rightly argue that local union branches and employers know far better than anybody else which wage levels are appropriate in their part of the country .
second , the conservative opposition , as a firm supporter of deregulation , is going to balk at any hint of state intervention .
in addition , the impact of a minimum wage is extremely difficult to predict .
it could indeed increase the purchasing power of those who have jobs , but the effect on the number of people in work is less certain , the paper wrote .
the badische zeitung said germany 's trade unions are divided over the minimum wage .
the engineering workers union ig metall has rejected it outright , fearing that it will weaken the system of free collective bargaining .
but the catering union came out in favor .
its members work largely for small businesses - which is also one of the reasons their union is not nearly as strong as ig metall .
the state , the daily commented , can not be responsible for everything and certainly not for setting wage levels .
that is the responsibility of the trade unions - and the employers .
many german papers also found space for the brawl at the olympics over equestrian gold , silver and bronze that was settled at the court of arbitration on saturday , three days after the three-day event finished .
german bettina hoy lost two gold medals after a challenge from france , britain and the united states .
the nordwest zeitung in oldenburg remarked that the debate has nothing to do with fairness .
the histrionics underline the dilemma facing contemporary sport , whose rules are becoming increasingly complicated .
seen legally , saturday 's decision may be water-tight .
it does , however , nothing to promote integrity or honesty in sport , the paper opined . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de € 1 jobs for germany 's unemployed ?

microsoft told those who gathered at its stand in the convention hall that it hoped to expand its worldwide x-box sales from 15.5 million to 20 million through the deal . over at the sony stand , the makers of playstation struck back during their own show at the convention by following suit , dropping the playstation 2 to the same price . piracy hits german industry but despite the popularity of the convention and the entertainment genre it promotes , the figures belie a worrying downward trend in the computer game industry in germany . in an industry that relies much on exports , germany is seen as a developing country in the context of the european computer game arena .

bob bates , a game writer from the united states who attended the developer 's conference at the trade fair , said that german games are too complex .

" -lrb- the german companies -rrb- always attended conferences in the usa and canada , now their people come to us , " dlugaiczyk told dw-world . this was in evidence as more international games developers and hardware manufacturers took the opportunity to announce new products and sales figures at the convention , as the industry prepared for the run-up to the all important , rapidly approaching christmas period . big names in attendance game companies such as electronic arts , ubisoft and buena vista revealed rising sales figures as well as new products while the major console companies used the convention as the tactical arena for the coming competition during the festive season . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : x-box mania in leipzig .
sony , microsoft and nintendo were all out in force in leipzig and laying down the battle lines for the price war to come .
microsoft revealed that its x-box console , currently selling for € 199 , will be reduced to € 149 at the end of august in an attempt to attract pre-christmas shoppers .
microsoft told those who gathered at its stand in the convention hall that it hoped to expand its worldwide x-box sales from 15.5 million to 20 million through the deal . over at the sony stand , the makers of playstation struck back during their own show at the convention by following suit , dropping the playstation 2 to the same price . piracy hits german industry but despite the popularity of the convention and the entertainment genre it promotes , the figures belie a worrying downward trend in the computer game industry in germany . in an industry that relies much on exports , germany is seen as a developing country in the context of the european computer game arena .
in the first half of this year , german computer game sales abroad totaled € 111 million , a decline of 36.9 percent on the same six month period in 2003 . there are a number of factors being attributed to this .
one is piracy .
each year , the german computer game industry loses as much as € 400 million through the copying of games and the online sharing of products , with as many as 54 million illegal copies per year being made and sold in germany . another is user-friendliness .
tom putzki , chairperson of g.a.m.e. , the german federation of computer game developers , told dw-world that one reason could be that designers try too hard in the creation of new products and that constantly trying to reinvent the wheel may push creative boundaries but actually alienate consumers . complexity alienates users bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some games take too long to learn , say developers .
bob bates , a game writer from the united states who attended the developer 's conference at the trade fair , said that german games are too complex .
" you demand too much of the consumers .
it takes too long until the player understands the game . "
bates said that u.s. game players give a new game a probation period of five minutes at the most .
" if they have n't understood the game by then and have not enjoyed themselves , then the game is not bought . " david reeves , president and coo of sony computer entertainment europe , told those who gathered to hear his speech that there was still plenty of market growth slumbering in the german games business , stressing that a wider target group and acceptance of gaming as a mainstream entertainment product would be key factors to future success . finding the german target reeves raised the issue that despite germany 's appetite for consuming videogames , very little development actually took place within german borders .
reeves believes that just like racing games in spain and tennis games in france , there are game genres that can hit the sweet spot in germany .
he urged industry representatives to invest in mass market-friendly themes and support development of locally relevant software within germany . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany : the trade fair capital despite its economic crisis , germany has maintained its position as the world 's premier trade fair location .

it was the third wave of so-called " monday demonstrations , " a term used by eastern germans during their protests in 1989 that toppled communism in the region and paved the way for german unification .
curiously enough , the protests in the east this time are directed against a democratically elected government and it ’ s the former communists of the leftist pds that stands to profit most .
" the reforms are hurting the poor while the rich continue to pocket huge profits , " one berlin protester told deutsche welle .
these popular perceptions of schröder ’ s welfare reforms are providing the perfect breeding ground for the comeback of germany ‘ s post-communists .
after crashing out of the national parliament two years ago , they have now surged to a record high in opinion polls , enjoying 7 percent support nationwide .
in economically depressed eastern regions , the pds is now the second-strongest party .
hitting society 's weakest ?
the reformed communists ' charismatic figurehead , gregor gysi , says his party was just putting a finger on the sore spots of schröder ’ s reform policy .
" the economic situation in eastern germany , " he said , " doesn ’ t seem to matter anymore - neither to the government nor to parliament .

the new measures include stiff means-testing and deep cuts in monthly benefit payments for the long-term unemployed .
the chancellor ’ s social democrats are feeling the heat , and with only 21 percent support in the opinion polls , they are trailing the pds by 5 percent ahead of two regional elections in eastern german states .
is populism on the rise ?
spd leaders like party manager uwe benneter are growing nervous and have accused the post communists of stoking popular fears .
" the pds is exploiting the reforms for electioneering purposes in a disgustingly populist manner , " benneter said .
" we must strengthen our campaign to debunk those who are intent only on stoking anger without presenting alternative solutions of their own . "
political analysts believe , however , that the protests are underscoring a persistent trend in the electorate in the east that includes a drift away from the established parties towards those on the extremes .
" there is indeed a danger of that , and it is being sustained by the fact that eastern germans have never had strong party affiliations , " said michael edinger , a political scientist at jena university .
" we ’ re also coming to realize that such loose political ties could be the future of politics in all of germany , raising the specter of large numbers of protest voters quite ready to support extremist parties at the ballot box . "
rightwing-extremist parties are already profiting from the mass protests .
in saxony the national democratic party could enter the regional parliament in september .
the party could increase its votes from one and half to over 5 percent compared the last election , polls have shown .

it was the third wave of so-called " monday demonstrations , " a term used by eastern germans during their protests in 1989 that toppled communism in the region and paved the way for german unification .
curiously enough , the protests in the east this time are directed against a democratically elected government and it ’ s the former communists of the leftist pds that stands to profit most .
" the reforms are hurting the poor while the rich continue to pocket huge profits , " one berlin protester told deutsche welle .
these popular perceptions of schröder ’ s welfare reforms are providing the perfect breeding ground for the comeback of germany ‘ s post-communists .
after crashing out of the national parliament two years ago , they have now surged to a record high in opinion polls , enjoying 7 percent support nationwide .
in economically depressed eastern regions , the pds is now the second-strongest party .
hitting society 's weakest ?
the reformed communists ' charismatic figurehead , gregor gysi , says his party was just putting a finger on the sore spots of schröder ’ s reform policy .
" the economic situation in eastern germany , " he said , " doesn ’ t seem to matter anymore - neither to the government nor to parliament .
in addition , the cuts always hit the weakest in society while the well-to-do are left untouched . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several thousand eastern germans partake in a recent monday demonstration in leipzig anger over the government ’ s welfare cuts is especially strong in eastern germany , because the majority of the 3 million people who are affected by them live there .
the new measures include stiff means-testing and deep cuts in monthly benefit payments for the long-term unemployed .
the chancellor ’ s social democrats are feeling the heat , and with only 21 percent support in the opinion polls , they are trailing the pds by 5 percent ahead of two regional elections in eastern german states .
is populism on the rise ?
spd leaders like party manager uwe benneter are growing nervous and have accused the post communists of stoking popular fears .
" the pds is exploiting the reforms for electioneering purposes in a disgustingly populist manner , " benneter said .
" we must strengthen our campaign to debunk those who are intent only on stoking anger without presenting alternative solutions of their own . "
political analysts believe , however , that the protests are underscoring a persistent trend in the electorate in the east that includes a drift away from the established parties towards those on the extremes .
" there is indeed a danger of that , and it is being sustained by the fact that eastern germans have never had strong party affiliations , " said michael edinger , a political scientist at jena university .
" we ’ re also coming to realize that such loose political ties could be the future of politics in all of germany , raising the specter of large numbers of protest voters quite ready to support extremist parties at the ballot box . "
rightwing-extremist parties are already profiting from the mass protests .
in saxony the national democratic party could enter the regional parliament in september .
the party could increase its votes from one and half to over 5 percent compared the last election , polls have shown .
meanwhile , in brandenburg the german people ’ s union is expected to hold its seats in parliament .
both parties have waged anti-reform campaigns as seeking to stoke resentment towards foreigners . uwe hessler -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de can minimum wage debate pacify protesters ?

now , in an apparent bid to sweeten the harsh , but necessary social cuts ahead , spd chief franz müntefering has launched a fresh debate on possible legislation governing the country 's minimum wage .
no taboo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd party chief franz muentefering as it stands , there are no relevant state regulations in place , as wages are invariably defined tariff negotiations between management and trade unions .
on sunday , müntefering said that the traditional tariff autonomy should not be treated as a taboo , but warned against jumping to conclusions . “ we ’ re currently debating this issue with the trade unions .
some unions are in favor of legislation on minimum wages , others aren ’ t .
i myself have been hesitant in the past to push for minimum wages , as such a move amounts to an attack on the country ’ s tariff autonomy , if you choose to see it that way .
but of course we also have to see the negative effects of wage dumping policies .
so , my party is willing to debate this at length with the unions , and i ’ m optimistic that we ’ ll reach a consensus in the autumn , ” he said .
müntefering ’ s offer to debate this issue with the trade unions has drawn mixed reactions from policy-makers across the political spectrum .
the opposition liberal democrats have rejected the idea outright , and social democratic economics and labor minister wolfgang clement isn ’ t amused either .
“ i ’ m in favour of looking at the situation in various industries .
i don ’ t think that legislation on minimum wages would make sense for all sectors .
and whether the trade unions are willing to at least partly give up the decades-old principle of tariff autonomy remains to be seen , ” clement said . open to consideration for their part , the trade unions have indicated their willingness to discuss the possibility of legislation in coming weeks .
margret moehring-rahne , deputy head of germany ’ s powerful service sector union , ver.di believes that minimum wages would help to cushion the impact of the labor reforms , meaning the long-term unemployed could not be forced to accept a job if the payment were outside the agreed minimum wage bracket .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal labor agency is stamped with a ' no ' to reforms the question to be considered is whether minimum wages will really assist workers by helping to prevent the exploitation of the lowest paid , or harm them by pricing low-skilled workers out of the labor force altogether .
supporters of minimum wages argue that higher wages will create greater spending power , thus ultimately cranking up the demand for larger workforces . that at least is the theory , and negotiations between the government and the trade unions in the coming weeks will show whether germany gets a chance to put it to the test . hardy graupner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press review : do we need a minimum wage ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 23.08.2004 german press review : do we need a minimum wage ? monday 's editorial pages weighed in on the debate about whether germany should institute a minimum wage and the controversy surrounding germany 's equestrian team , which lost two medals to appeals . the süddeutsche zeitung told its readers on its front page that the purpose of the minimum wage is to entice the trade unions into supporting the controversial hartz iv welfare reform for the long-term unemployed .
the paper then took the proposal by franz müntefering , head of the ruling social democratic party , as an opportunity to examine the plight of eastern germany , where unemployment is especially high .
it opened a leading article with the words " are eastern germans second-class citizens ? "
the süddeutsche answered its own question and wrote that the two halves of the country are beginning to drift even farther apart under the pressure of the reforms .
protests and demonstrations against hartz iv are quite legitimate - especially in eastern germany , where citizens were forced to refrain from any sort of protest for years on end .
the paper concluded with what it evidently regarded as the key issue : " what is the point of the government piling the pressure on the unemployed , when there simply is n't enough work to go round in many parts of the country ? "
the neue osnabrücker zeitung tackled the proposal for a minimum wage head on .
its verdict : it 's not a very realistic idea .
first , because it would mean interfering with free collective bargaining , which would annoy the trade unions .
they would quite rightly argue that local union branches and employers know far better than anybody else which wage levels are appropriate in their part of the country .
second , the conservative opposition , as a firm supporter of deregulation , is going to balk at any hint of state intervention .
in addition , the impact of a minimum wage is extremely difficult to predict .
it could indeed increase the purchasing power of those who have jobs , but the effect on the number of people in work is less certain , the paper wrote .
the badische zeitung said germany 's trade unions are divided over the minimum wage .
the engineering workers union ig metall has rejected it outright , fearing that it will weaken the system of free collective bargaining .
but the catering union came out in favor .
its members work largely for small businesses - which is also one of the reasons their union is not nearly as strong as ig metall .
the state , the daily commented , can not be responsible for everything and certainly not for setting wage levels .
that is the responsibility of the trade unions - and the employers .
many german papers also found space for the brawl at the olympics over equestrian gold , silver and bronze that was settled at the court of arbitration on saturday , three days after the three-day event finished .
german bettina hoy lost two gold medals after a challenge from france , britain and the united states .
the nordwest zeitung in oldenburg remarked that the debate has nothing to do with fairness .
the histrionics underline the dilemma facing contemporary sport , whose rules are becoming increasingly complicated .
seen legally , saturday 's decision may be water-tight .
it does , however , nothing to promote integrity or honesty in sport , the paper opined . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de € 1 jobs for germany 's unemployed ?
to ease the pain of its new unemployment benefit cuts , germany 's economics minister , wolfgang clement , has floated a proposal to create so-called one-euro community jobs for the long-term unemployed .

it was the third wave of so-called " monday demonstrations , " a term used by eastern germans during their protests in 1989 that toppled communism in the region and paved the way for german unification .
curiously enough , the protests in the east this time are directed against a democratically elected government and it ’ s the former communists of the leftist pds that stands to profit most .
" the reforms are hurting the poor while the rich continue to pocket huge profits , " one berlin protester told deutsche welle .
these popular perceptions of schröder ’ s welfare reforms are providing the perfect breeding ground for the comeback of germany ‘ s post-communists .
after crashing out of the national parliament two years ago , they have now surged to a record high in opinion polls , enjoying 7 percent support nationwide .
in economically depressed eastern regions , the pds is now the second-strongest party .
hitting society 's weakest ?
the reformed communists ' charismatic figurehead , gregor gysi , says his party was just putting a finger on the sore spots of schröder ’ s reform policy .
" the economic situation in eastern germany , " he said , " doesn ’ t seem to matter anymore - neither to the government nor to parliament .
in addition , the cuts always hit the weakest in society while the well-to-do are left untouched . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several thousand eastern germans partake in a recent monday demonstration in leipzig anger over the government ’ s welfare cuts is especially strong in eastern germany , because the majority of the 3 million people who are affected by them live there .
the new measures include stiff means-testing and deep cuts in monthly benefit payments for the long-term unemployed .
the chancellor ’ s social democrats are feeling the heat , and with only 21 percent support in the opinion polls , they are trailing the pds by 5 percent ahead of two regional elections in eastern german states .
is populism on the rise ?
spd leaders like party manager uwe benneter are growing nervous and have accused the post communists of stoking popular fears .
" the pds is exploiting the reforms for electioneering purposes in a disgustingly populist manner , " benneter said .
" we must strengthen our campaign to debunk those who are intent only on stoking anger without presenting alternative solutions of their own . "

it was the third wave of so-called " monday demonstrations , " a term used by eastern germans during their protests in 1989 that toppled communism in the region and paved the way for german unification .
curiously enough , the protests in the east this time are directed against a democratically elected government and it ’ s the former communists of the leftist pds that stands to profit most .
" the reforms are hurting the poor while the rich continue to pocket huge profits , " one berlin protester told deutsche welle .
these popular perceptions of schröder ’ s welfare reforms are providing the perfect breeding ground for the comeback of germany ‘ s post-communists .
after crashing out of the national parliament two years ago , they have now surged to a record high in opinion polls , enjoying 7 percent support nationwide .
in economically depressed eastern regions , the pds is now the second-strongest party .
hitting society 's weakest ?
the reformed communists ' charismatic figurehead , gregor gysi , says his party was just putting a finger on the sore spots of schröder ’ s reform policy .
" the economic situation in eastern germany , " he said , " doesn ’ t seem to matter anymore - neither to the government nor to parliament .
in addition , the cuts always hit the weakest in society while the well-to-do are left untouched . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several thousand eastern germans partake in a recent monday demonstration in leipzig anger over the government ’ s welfare cuts is especially strong in eastern germany , because the majority of the 3 million people who are affected by them live there .
the new measures include stiff means-testing and deep cuts in monthly benefit payments for the long-term unemployed .
the chancellor ’ s social democrats are feeling the heat , and with only 21 percent support in the opinion polls , they are trailing the pds by 5 percent ahead of two regional elections in eastern german states .
is populism on the rise ?
spd leaders like party manager uwe benneter are growing nervous and have accused the post communists of stoking popular fears .
" the pds is exploiting the reforms for electioneering purposes in a disgustingly populist manner , " benneter said .
" we must strengthen our campaign to debunk those who are intent only on stoking anger without presenting alternative solutions of their own . "
political analysts believe , however , that the protests are underscoring a persistent trend in the electorate in the east that includes a drift away from the established parties towards those on the extremes .
" there is indeed a danger of that , and it is being sustained by the fact that eastern germans have never had strong party affiliations , " said michael edinger , a political scientist at jena university .
" we ’ re also coming to realize that such loose political ties could be the future of politics in all of germany , raising the specter of large numbers of protest voters quite ready to support extremist parties at the ballot box . "
rightwing-extremist parties are already profiting from the mass protests .
in saxony the national democratic party could enter the regional parliament in september .
the party could increase its votes from one and half to over 5 percent compared the last election , polls have shown .
meanwhile , in brandenburg the german people ’ s union is expected to hold its seats in parliament .

in the netherlands , a pilot project without small change has proved so popular , it could soon go national . it is a topic of debate which is gathering pace across the euro zone .
in germany , retailers are loath to do it , while those in finland have already gone through with it .
in the netherlands , the public seems split .
so , should the countries that use the single currency drop the small , copper coins that weigh down millions of consumer pockets ? traders across europe are torn by the idea of ridding the single currency of the one and two cent coins that make up the lowest end of the euro range , an idea favored by many consumers and banks .
some retailers , particularly those in germany , fear psychological effects on their customers when they see prices they have long come to expect rounded up to even numbers , a consequence of taking away coins that would allow the apparently cheaper price of € 1.99 rather than the scarily inflated € 2.00 . many banks would be happy to see the back of the tiny coins , making practices smoother and abolishing what many consider unnecessary banking costs .
in finland , their abolition is underway .
on the whole , consumers there would be glad to see the almost parasitic small change eradicated , saving their homes and pockets free from multiplying piles of metal . customers hold little worth in coins bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the netherlands , the discussion is turning into a burning topic , as the government considers the abolition of one and two cent pieces .
for albert heijn , the branch manager of the bart bartels supermarket in woerden , there is little reason to keep the mini coins .
" we sometimes have one and two cent coins thrown on the ground here and not a single customer has bent down afterwards to pick them up .
that shows how much worth people attach to them , " heijn told deutsche welle . over 130 businesses in woerden have started rounding-up prices since the end of april .
for those who fear price increases , even by just two cents , the system in the provincial town has been based on a compromise .
a bottle of cabernet sauvignon now costs € 4.45 rather than € 4.47 , while a packet of biscuits will set the customer back € 2.00 rather than € 1.98 .
though in some cases , the customer loses out , in others the customer wins .
the same goes for the businesses . ruud noonen , a branch manager for a chain of fashion discount stores , looks at the advantages and disadvantages in a philosophical way and reveals that not dealing with the tiny coins is offset by only a minimal loss .
" we count it up every day .
and really , the profit or loss for us is around 24 cents either way .
the difference it makes is negligible , " noonen said overwhelming support for pilot scheme the pilot project covers businesses from the smallest kiosk to the largest department store and the results so far show that customers are overwhelmingly in favor of abolishing the one and two cent coins .
in fact , 83 percent of consumers polled have greeted the possible demise of the copper curse with glee . " it 's a great idea , " said one customer shopping at bartels .
" in my opinion , the small euro cents can gladly be abolished .
apart from getting in the way , consider how much time and work goes down the drain , fiddling around with the cents .
without these coins , everything would be much easier . " advantages will be seen quickly , say advocates the test period in woerden has been so successful that the dutch retail trade federation has called on all its members to try out the model .
now , 40,000 businesses across the netherlands are rounding up and down and gradually phasing out the one and two cent coins .
by september , it may end up as a nationwide experiment .
ruud noomen was confident that the consumers will see the advantages very quickly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we expect the customers in the cashier queue to see the effects first .
up to now , the customers have looked long and hard for the right coins because the one and two cent pieces are so difficult to separate .
without small change , the queues will move faster .
and at the end of the day , counting up will be faster . " the dutch national bank estimates that if the project gets national approval , it will save € 30 million -lrb- $ 36.6 million -rrb- annually .
not only will it make business more efficient , but charges on small change at banks will save both parties time and money . however , not everyone will be happy to say goodbye to the coins .
" to round up to one cent , i agree to that , " said one old man shopping at bartels .
" but by two cents is too much .
if we were to convert that back to guilders , that would be almost five cents .

it was the third wave of so-called " monday demonstrations , " a term used by eastern germans during their protests in 1989 that toppled communism in the region and paved the way for german unification .
curiously enough , the protests in the east this time are directed against a democratically elected government and it ’ s the former communists of the leftist pds that stands to profit most .
" the reforms are hurting the poor while the rich continue to pocket huge profits , " one berlin protester told deutsche welle .
these popular perceptions of schröder ’ s welfare reforms are providing the perfect breeding ground for the comeback of germany ‘ s post-communists .
after crashing out of the national parliament two years ago , they have now surged to a record high in opinion polls , enjoying 7 percent support nationwide .
in economically depressed eastern regions , the pds is now the second-strongest party .
hitting society 's weakest ?
the reformed communists ' charismatic figurehead , gregor gysi , says his party was just putting a finger on the sore spots of schröder ’ s reform policy .
" the economic situation in eastern germany , " he said , " doesn ’ t seem to matter anymore - neither to the government nor to parliament .
in addition , the cuts always hit the weakest in society while the well-to-do are left untouched . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several thousand eastern germans partake in a recent monday demonstration in leipzig anger over the government ’ s welfare cuts is especially strong in eastern germany , because the majority of the 3 million people who are affected by them live there .
the new measures include stiff means-testing and deep cuts in monthly benefit payments for the long-term unemployed .
the chancellor ’ s social democrats are feeling the heat , and with only 21 percent support in the opinion polls , they are trailing the pds by 5 percent ahead of two regional elections in eastern german states .
is populism on the rise ?
spd leaders like party manager uwe benneter are growing nervous and have accused the post communists of stoking popular fears .
" the pds is exploiting the reforms for electioneering purposes in a disgustingly populist manner , " benneter said .
" we must strengthen our campaign to debunk those who are intent only on stoking anger without presenting alternative solutions of their own . "
political analysts believe , however , that the protests are underscoring a persistent trend in the electorate in the east that includes a drift away from the established parties towards those on the extremes .
" there is indeed a danger of that , and it is being sustained by the fact that eastern germans have never had strong party affiliations , " said michael edinger , a political scientist at jena university .
" we ’ re also coming to realize that such loose political ties could be the future of politics in all of germany , raising the specter of large numbers of protest voters quite ready to support extremist parties at the ballot box . "
rightwing-extremist parties are already profiting from the mass protests .
in saxony the national democratic party could enter the regional parliament in september .
the party could increase its votes from one and half to over 5 percent compared the last election , polls have shown .
meanwhile , in brandenburg the german people ’ s union is expected to hold its seats in parliament .
both parties have waged anti-reform campaigns as seeking to stoke resentment towards foreigners . uwe hessler -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de can minimum wage debate pacify protesters ?

but on monday , germany and the united states come together to contest who will grab that chance to play off for the olympic title . whatever the stage , this is the one game from the athens tournament that has everything : rivalry , revenge and the last hurrah .
because these two teams have a history that makes this match more compelling than just any semi-final . in 2003 , the united states and germany met in the semi-finals of the 2003 world cup , a game the germans won , defeating the reigning world champions at the time in their own backyard and going on to claim the ultimate prize for themselves . sweet revenge and bitter rivalry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if ever there was a chance of sweet revenge , this match is just that with the german team gaining pace in their challenge to add olympic gold to their world title .
a us win would scupper that and set up a chance for the former olympic and world champions to get at least one title back at the expense of their greatest rivals . for a number of the us team , this is the last chance to grab more glory .
for highly decorated players such as the so-called " fab five " - mia hamm , julie foudy , joy fawcett , kristine lilly and brandi chastain - this is the last throw of the dice .
another loss at the feet of the germans would bring their international careers top a close on a painful low rather than a joyful high . respect and resolve this is the game the american players wanted .
that 3-0 world cup loss to germany , in a match that was close until the latter minutes , still smarts with the u.s. team and spectators will be primed for one of the potentially great matches of these and possibly any games .

gaining international tournament experience at the 2003 world cup and these summer games , wambach has scored 30 goals in 42 international games .
wambach has been on target in each of the three olympics matches she has played and has become the most imposing american force up front . with so much riding on this game - the end result , the chance to go for olympic gold , the resolution of old grudges and the healing of tender wounds , monday 's semi-final is much more than a soccer match . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans drub china in women 's soccer opener germany 's women thrashed their chinese counterparts with an unexpected 8-0 win wednesday at the athens olympics women 's soccer opener , providing a thrilling start to the games .

because these two teams have a history that makes this match more compelling than just any semi-final . in 2003 , the united states and germany met in the semi-finals of the 2003 world cup , a game the germans won , defeating the reigning world champions at the time in their own backyard and going on to claim the ultimate prize for themselves . sweet revenge and bitter rivalry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if ever there was a chance of sweet revenge , this match is just that with the german team gaining pace in their challenge to add olympic gold to their world title .
a us win would scupper that and set up a chance for the former olympic and world champions to get at least one title back at the expense of their greatest rivals . for a number of the us team , this is the last chance to grab more glory .
for highly decorated players such as the so-called " fab five " - mia hamm , julie foudy , joy fawcett , kristine lilly and brandi chastain - this is the last throw of the dice .
another loss at the feet of the germans would bring their international careers top a close on a painful low rather than a joyful high . respect and resolve this is the game the american players wanted .
that 3-0 world cup loss to germany , in a match that was close until the latter minutes , still smarts with the u.s. team and spectators will be primed for one of the potentially great matches of these and possibly any games .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " they are an incredible team with an incredible amount of talent , but we want revenge , " us goalkeeper briana scurry told reporters .
" i 'd be lying if i said i did n't want them to feel the same way we felt after they beat us last summer . "
the match could well turn out to be the tale of two strikers .
the us are spearheaded by abby wambach who has led her team in the scoring stakes with three goals so far and has 18 in her 19 international matches this year .
wambach will be going all out to bring some joy to the seething americans . on the other side will be birgit prinz , who will aim to bring the pain to the americans once again .

prinz is a veteran of three women 's world cups and three olympics .
she has scored 78 goals in only 121 matches , five off the german record of 83 , set by the now-retired heidi mohr . wambach , 24 , debuted with the us as a 21-year-old in a 4-1 win over germany in chicago in 2001 .
gaining international tournament experience at the 2003 world cup and these summer games , wambach has scored 30 goals in 42 international games .
wambach has been on target in each of the three olympics matches she has played and has become the most imposing american force up front . with so much riding on this game - the end result , the chance to go for olympic gold , the resolution of old grudges and the healing of tender wounds , monday 's semi-final is much more than a soccer match . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans drub china in women 's soccer opener germany 's women thrashed their chinese counterparts with an unexpected 8-0 win wednesday at the athens olympics women 's soccer opener , providing a thrilling start to the games .

in the netherlands , a pilot project without small change has proved so popular , it could soon go national . it is a topic of debate which is gathering pace across the euro zone .
in germany , retailers are loath to do it , while those in finland have already gone through with it .
in the netherlands , the public seems split .
so , should the countries that use the single currency drop the small , copper coins that weigh down millions of consumer pockets ? traders across europe are torn by the idea of ridding the single currency of the one and two cent coins that make up the lowest end of the euro range , an idea favored by many consumers and banks .
some retailers , particularly those in germany , fear psychological effects on their customers when they see prices they have long come to expect rounded up to even numbers , a consequence of taking away coins that would allow the apparently cheaper price of € 1.99 rather than the scarily inflated € 2.00 . many banks would be happy to see the back of the tiny coins , making practices smoother and abolishing what many consider unnecessary banking costs .
in finland , their abolition is underway .
on the whole , consumers there would be glad to see the almost parasitic small change eradicated , saving their homes and pockets free from multiplying piles of metal . customers hold little worth in coins bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the netherlands , the discussion is turning into a burning topic , as the government considers the abolition of one and two cent pieces .
for albert heijn , the branch manager of the bart bartels supermarket in woerden , there is little reason to keep the mini coins .
" we sometimes have one and two cent coins thrown on the ground here and not a single customer has bent down afterwards to pick them up .
that shows how much worth people attach to them , " heijn told deutsche welle . over 130 businesses in woerden have started rounding-up prices since the end of april .
for those who fear price increases , even by just two cents , the system in the provincial town has been based on a compromise .
a bottle of cabernet sauvignon now costs € 4.45 rather than € 4.47 , while a packet of biscuits will set the customer back € 2.00 rather than € 1.98 .
though in some cases , the customer loses out , in others the customer wins .
the same goes for the businesses . ruud noonen , a branch manager for a chain of fashion discount stores , looks at the advantages and disadvantages in a philosophical way and reveals that not dealing with the tiny coins is offset by only a minimal loss .
" we count it up every day .
and really , the profit or loss for us is around 24 cents either way .
the difference it makes is negligible , " noonen said overwhelming support for pilot scheme the pilot project covers businesses from the smallest kiosk to the largest department store and the results so far show that customers are overwhelmingly in favor of abolishing the one and two cent coins .
in fact , 83 percent of consumers polled have greeted the possible demise of the copper curse with glee . " it 's a great idea , " said one customer shopping at bartels .
" in my opinion , the small euro cents can gladly be abolished .
apart from getting in the way , consider how much time and work goes down the drain , fiddling around with the cents .
without these coins , everything would be much easier . " advantages will be seen quickly , say advocates the test period in woerden has been so successful that the dutch retail trade federation has called on all its members to try out the model .
now , 40,000 businesses across the netherlands are rounding up and down and gradually phasing out the one and two cent coins .
by september , it may end up as a nationwide experiment .
ruud noomen was confident that the consumers will see the advantages very quickly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we expect the customers in the cashier queue to see the effects first .
up to now , the customers have looked long and hard for the right coins because the one and two cent pieces are so difficult to separate .

and at the end of the day , counting up will be faster . " the dutch national bank estimates that if the project gets national approval , it will save € 30 million -lrb- $ 36.6 million -rrb- annually .
not only will it make business more efficient , but charges on small change at banks will save both parties time and money . however , not everyone will be happy to say goodbye to the coins .
" to round up to one cent , i agree to that , " said one old man shopping at bartels .

in the netherlands , a pilot project without small change has proved so popular , it could soon go national . it is a topic of debate which is gathering pace across the euro zone .
in germany , retailers are loath to do it , while those in finland have already gone through with it .
in the netherlands , the public seems split .
so , should the countries that use the single currency drop the small , copper coins that weigh down millions of consumer pockets ? traders across europe are torn by the idea of ridding the single currency of the one and two cent coins that make up the lowest end of the euro range , an idea favored by many consumers and banks .
some retailers , particularly those in germany , fear psychological effects on their customers when they see prices they have long come to expect rounded up to even numbers , a consequence of taking away coins that would allow the apparently cheaper price of € 1.99 rather than the scarily inflated € 2.00 . many banks would be happy to see the back of the tiny coins , making practices smoother and abolishing what many consider unnecessary banking costs .
in finland , their abolition is underway .
on the whole , consumers there would be glad to see the almost parasitic small change eradicated , saving their homes and pockets free from multiplying piles of metal . customers hold little worth in coins bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the netherlands , the discussion is turning into a burning topic , as the government considers the abolition of one and two cent pieces .
for albert heijn , the branch manager of the bart bartels supermarket in woerden , there is little reason to keep the mini coins .
" we sometimes have one and two cent coins thrown on the ground here and not a single customer has bent down afterwards to pick them up .
that shows how much worth people attach to them , " heijn told deutsche welle . over 130 businesses in woerden have started rounding-up prices since the end of april .
for those who fear price increases , even by just two cents , the system in the provincial town has been based on a compromise .
a bottle of cabernet sauvignon now costs € 4.45 rather than € 4.47 , while a packet of biscuits will set the customer back € 2.00 rather than € 1.98 .
though in some cases , the customer loses out , in others the customer wins .
the same goes for the businesses . ruud noonen , a branch manager for a chain of fashion discount stores , looks at the advantages and disadvantages in a philosophical way and reveals that not dealing with the tiny coins is offset by only a minimal loss .
" we count it up every day .
and really , the profit or loss for us is around 24 cents either way .
the difference it makes is negligible , " noonen said overwhelming support for pilot scheme the pilot project covers businesses from the smallest kiosk to the largest department store and the results so far show that customers are overwhelmingly in favor of abolishing the one and two cent coins .
in fact , 83 percent of consumers polled have greeted the possible demise of the copper curse with glee . " it 's a great idea , " said one customer shopping at bartels .
" in my opinion , the small euro cents can gladly be abolished .
apart from getting in the way , consider how much time and work goes down the drain , fiddling around with the cents .
without these coins , everything would be much easier . " advantages will be seen quickly , say advocates the test period in woerden has been so successful that the dutch retail trade federation has called on all its members to try out the model .
now , 40,000 businesses across the netherlands are rounding up and down and gradually phasing out the one and two cent coins .
by september , it may end up as a nationwide experiment .
ruud noomen was confident that the consumers will see the advantages very quickly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we expect the customers in the cashier queue to see the effects first .
up to now , the customers have looked long and hard for the right coins because the one and two cent pieces are so difficult to separate .
without small change , the queues will move faster .
and at the end of the day , counting up will be faster . " the dutch national bank estimates that if the project gets national approval , it will save € 30 million -lrb- $ 36.6 million -rrb- annually .
not only will it make business more efficient , but charges on small change at banks will save both parties time and money . however , not everyone will be happy to say goodbye to the coins .

but on monday , germany and the united states come together to contest who will grab that chance to play off for the olympic title . whatever the stage , this is the one game from the athens tournament that has everything : rivalry , revenge and the last hurrah .
because these two teams have a history that makes this match more compelling than just any semi-final . in 2003 , the united states and germany met in the semi-finals of the 2003 world cup , a game the germans won , defeating the reigning world champions at the time in their own backyard and going on to claim the ultimate prize for themselves . sweet revenge and bitter rivalry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if ever there was a chance of sweet revenge , this match is just that with the german team gaining pace in their challenge to add olympic gold to their world title .
a us win would scupper that and set up a chance for the former olympic and world champions to get at least one title back at the expense of their greatest rivals . for a number of the us team , this is the last chance to grab more glory .
for highly decorated players such as the so-called " fab five " - mia hamm , julie foudy , joy fawcett , kristine lilly and brandi chastain - this is the last throw of the dice .
another loss at the feet of the germans would bring their international careers top a close on a painful low rather than a joyful high . respect and resolve this is the game the american players wanted .
that 3-0 world cup loss to germany , in a match that was close until the latter minutes , still smarts with the u.s. team and spectators will be primed for one of the potentially great matches of these and possibly any games .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " they are an incredible team with an incredible amount of talent , but we want revenge , " us goalkeeper briana scurry told reporters .
" i 'd be lying if i said i did n't want them to feel the same way we felt after they beat us last summer . "
the match could well turn out to be the tale of two strikers .
the us are spearheaded by abby wambach who has led her team in the scoring stakes with three goals so far and has 18 in her 19 international matches this year .
wambach will be going all out to bring some joy to the seething americans . on the other side will be birgit prinz , who will aim to bring the pain to the americans once again .
prinz is now slouch in the scoring stakes either with an overall olympic tally of six goals , including four in one game .
a tale of two strikers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both are world class strikers in their prime , although prinz , who turns 27 later this year , has much more international experience , having made her debut for the germany team as a 16-year-old .
prinz is a veteran of three women 's world cups and three olympics .
she has scored 78 goals in only 121 matches , five off the german record of 83 , set by the now-retired heidi mohr . wambach , 24 , debuted with the us as a 21-year-old in a 4-1 win over germany in chicago in 2001 .
gaining international tournament experience at the 2003 world cup and these summer games , wambach has scored 30 goals in 42 international games .
wambach has been on target in each of the three olympics matches she has played and has become the most imposing american force up front . with so much riding on this game - the end result , the chance to go for olympic gold , the resolution of old grudges and the healing of tender wounds , monday 's semi-final is much more than a soccer match . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans drub china in women 's soccer opener germany 's women thrashed their chinese counterparts with an unexpected 8-0 win wednesday at the athens olympics women 's soccer opener , providing a thrilling start to the games .

over 100,000 visitors came , saw and played cutting edge games , experienced the latest in edu- and infotainment and sampled the newest consoles and hardware from over 270 exhibitors from 13 countries while the conventions played host to no less than 68 world premieres . the expanding popularity of the german convention was in evidence as the convention center swelled with the biggest names in the industry .
thomas dlugaiczyk of the games academy , an institution for the promotion of creative electronic arts , observed the differences from the two previous years .
" -lrb- the german companies -rrb- always attended conferences in the usa and canada , now their people come to us , " dlugaiczyk told dw-world . this was in evidence as more international games developers and hardware manufacturers took the opportunity to announce new products and sales figures at the convention , as the industry prepared for the run-up to the all important , rapidly approaching christmas period . big names in attendance game companies such as electronic arts , ubisoft and buena vista revealed rising sales figures as well as new products while the major console companies used the convention as the tactical arena for the coming competition during the festive season . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : x-box mania in leipzig .
sony , microsoft and nintendo were all out in force in leipzig and laying down the battle lines for the price war to come .
microsoft revealed that its x-box console , currently selling for € 199 , will be reduced to € 149 at the end of august in an attempt to attract pre-christmas shoppers .
microsoft told those who gathered at its stand in the convention hall that it hoped to expand its worldwide x-box sales from 15.5 million to 20 million through the deal . over at the sony stand , the makers of playstation struck back during their own show at the convention by following suit , dropping the playstation 2 to the same price . piracy hits german industry but despite the popularity of the convention and the entertainment genre it promotes , the figures belie a worrying downward trend in the computer game industry in germany . in an industry that relies much on exports , germany is seen as a developing country in the context of the european computer game arena .
in the first half of this year , german computer game sales abroad totaled € 111 million , a decline of 36.9 percent on the same six month period in 2003 . there are a number of factors being attributed to this .
one is piracy .
each year , the german computer game industry loses as much as € 400 million through the copying of games and the online sharing of products , with as many as 54 million illegal copies per year being made and sold in germany . another is user-friendliness .
tom putzki , chairperson of g.a.m.e. , the german federation of computer game developers , told dw-world that one reason could be that designers try too hard in the creation of new products and that constantly trying to reinvent the wheel may push creative boundaries but actually alienate consumers . complexity alienates users bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some games take too long to learn , say developers .
bob bates , a game writer from the united states who attended the developer 's conference at the trade fair , said that german games are too complex .
" you demand too much of the consumers .
it takes too long until the player understands the game . "
bates said that u.s. game players give a new game a probation period of five minutes at the most .
" if they have n't understood the game by then and have not enjoyed themselves , then the game is not bought . " david reeves , president and coo of sony computer entertainment europe , told those who gathered to hear his speech that there was still plenty of market growth slumbering in the german games business , stressing that a wider target group and acceptance of gaming as a mainstream entertainment product would be key factors to future success . finding the german target reeves raised the issue that despite germany 's appetite for consuming videogames , very little development actually took place within german borders .
reeves believes that just like racing games in spain and tennis games in france , there are game genres that can hit the sweet spot in germany .

over 100,000 visitors came , saw and played cutting edge games , experienced the latest in edu- and infotainment and sampled the newest consoles and hardware from over 270 exhibitors from 13 countries while the conventions played host to no less than 68 world premieres . the expanding popularity of the german convention was in evidence as the convention center swelled with the biggest names in the industry .
thomas dlugaiczyk of the games academy , an institution for the promotion of creative electronic arts , observed the differences from the two previous years .
" -lrb- the german companies -rrb- always attended conferences in the usa and canada , now their people come to us , " dlugaiczyk told dw-world . this was in evidence as more international games developers and hardware manufacturers took the opportunity to announce new products and sales figures at the convention , as the industry prepared for the run-up to the all important , rapidly approaching christmas period . big names in attendance game companies such as electronic arts , ubisoft and buena vista revealed rising sales figures as well as new products while the major console companies used the convention as the tactical arena for the coming competition during the festive season . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : x-box mania in leipzig .

microsoft revealed that its x-box console , currently selling for € 199 , will be reduced to € 149 at the end of august in an attempt to attract pre-christmas shoppers .
microsoft told those who gathered at its stand in the convention hall that it hoped to expand its worldwide x-box sales from 15.5 million to 20 million through the deal . over at the sony stand , the makers of playstation struck back during their own show at the convention by following suit , dropping the playstation 2 to the same price . piracy hits german industry but despite the popularity of the convention and the entertainment genre it promotes , the figures belie a worrying downward trend in the computer game industry in germany . in an industry that relies much on exports , germany is seen as a developing country in the context of the european computer game arena .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 23.08.2004 german press review : do we need a minimum wage ? monday 's editorial pages weighed in on the debate about whether germany should institute a minimum wage and the controversy surrounding germany 's equestrian team , which lost two medals to appeals . the süddeutsche zeitung told its readers on its front page that the purpose of the minimum wage is to entice the trade unions into supporting the controversial hartz iv welfare reform for the long-term unemployed .
the paper then took the proposal by franz müntefering , head of the ruling social democratic party , as an opportunity to examine the plight of eastern germany , where unemployment is especially high .
it opened a leading article with the words " are eastern germans second-class citizens ? "
the süddeutsche answered its own question and wrote that the two halves of the country are beginning to drift even farther apart under the pressure of the reforms .
protests and demonstrations against hartz iv are quite legitimate - especially in eastern germany , where citizens were forced to refrain from any sort of protest for years on end .
the paper concluded with what it evidently regarded as the key issue : " what is the point of the government piling the pressure on the unemployed , when there simply is n't enough work to go round in many parts of the country ? "
the neue osnabrücker zeitung tackled the proposal for a minimum wage head on .
its verdict : it 's not a very realistic idea .
first , because it would mean interfering with free collective bargaining , which would annoy the trade unions .
they would quite rightly argue that local union branches and employers know far better than anybody else which wage levels are appropriate in their part of the country .
second , the conservative opposition , as a firm supporter of deregulation , is going to balk at any hint of state intervention .
in addition , the impact of a minimum wage is extremely difficult to predict .
it could indeed increase the purchasing power of those who have jobs , but the effect on the number of people in work is less certain , the paper wrote .
the badische zeitung said germany 's trade unions are divided over the minimum wage .
the engineering workers union ig metall has rejected it outright , fearing that it will weaken the system of free collective bargaining .
but the catering union came out in favor .
its members work largely for small businesses - which is also one of the reasons their union is not nearly as strong as ig metall .
the state , the daily commented , can not be responsible for everything and certainly not for setting wage levels .
that is the responsibility of the trade unions - and the employers .

the paper then took the proposal by franz müntefering , head of the ruling social democratic party , as an opportunity to examine the plight of eastern germany , where unemployment is especially high .
it opened a leading article with the words " are eastern germans second-class citizens ? "
the süddeutsche answered its own question and wrote that the two halves of the country are beginning to drift even farther apart under the pressure of the reforms .
protests and demonstrations against hartz iv are quite legitimate - especially in eastern germany , where citizens were forced to refrain from any sort of protest for years on end .
the paper concluded with what it evidently regarded as the key issue : " what is the point of the government piling the pressure on the unemployed , when there simply is n't enough work to go round in many parts of the country ? "
the neue osnabrücker zeitung tackled the proposal for a minimum wage head on .
its verdict : it 's not a very realistic idea .
first , because it would mean interfering with free collective bargaining , which would annoy the trade unions .
they would quite rightly argue that local union branches and employers know far better than anybody else which wage levels are appropriate in their part of the country .
second , the conservative opposition , as a firm supporter of deregulation , is going to balk at any hint of state intervention .
in addition , the impact of a minimum wage is extremely difficult to predict .
it could indeed increase the purchasing power of those who have jobs , but the effect on the number of people in work is less certain , the paper wrote .
the badische zeitung said germany 's trade unions are divided over the minimum wage .
the engineering workers union ig metall has rejected it outright , fearing that it will weaken the system of free collective bargaining .
but the catering union came out in favor .
its members work largely for small businesses - which is also one of the reasons their union is not nearly as strong as ig metall .
the state , the daily commented , can not be responsible for everything and certainly not for setting wage levels .

now , in an apparent bid to sweeten the harsh , but necessary social cuts ahead , spd chief franz müntefering has launched a fresh debate on possible legislation governing the country 's minimum wage .
no taboo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd party chief franz muentefering as it stands , there are no relevant state regulations in place , as wages are invariably defined tariff negotiations between management and trade unions .
on sunday , müntefering said that the traditional tariff autonomy should not be treated as a taboo , but warned against jumping to conclusions . “ we ’ re currently debating this issue with the trade unions .
some unions are in favor of legislation on minimum wages , others aren ’ t .
i myself have been hesitant in the past to push for minimum wages , as such a move amounts to an attack on the country ’ s tariff autonomy , if you choose to see it that way .
but of course we also have to see the negative effects of wage dumping policies .
so , my party is willing to debate this at length with the unions , and i ’ m optimistic that we ’ ll reach a consensus in the autumn , ” he said .
müntefering ’ s offer to debate this issue with the trade unions has drawn mixed reactions from policy-makers across the political spectrum .
the opposition liberal democrats have rejected the idea outright , and social democratic economics and labor minister wolfgang clement isn ’ t amused either .
“ i ’ m in favour of looking at the situation in various industries .
i don ’ t think that legislation on minimum wages would make sense for all sectors .
and whether the trade unions are willing to at least partly give up the decades-old principle of tariff autonomy remains to be seen , ” clement said . open to consideration for their part , the trade unions have indicated their willingness to discuss the possibility of legislation in coming weeks .
margret moehring-rahne , deputy head of germany ’ s powerful service sector union , ver.di believes that minimum wages would help to cushion the impact of the labor reforms , meaning the long-term unemployed could not be forced to accept a job if the payment were outside the agreed minimum wage bracket .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal labor agency is stamped with a ' no ' to reforms the question to be considered is whether minimum wages will really assist workers by helping to prevent the exploitation of the lowest paid , or harm them by pricing low-skilled workers out of the labor force altogether .
supporters of minimum wages argue that higher wages will create greater spending power , thus ultimately cranking up the demand for larger workforces . that at least is the theory , and negotiations between the government and the trade unions in the coming weeks will show whether germany gets a chance to put it to the test . hardy graupner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press review : do we need a minimum wage ?

now , in an apparent bid to sweeten the harsh , but necessary social cuts ahead , spd chief franz müntefering has launched a fresh debate on possible legislation governing the country 's minimum wage .
no taboo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd party chief franz muentefering as it stands , there are no relevant state regulations in place , as wages are invariably defined tariff negotiations between management and trade unions .
on sunday , müntefering said that the traditional tariff autonomy should not be treated as a taboo , but warned against jumping to conclusions . “ we ’ re currently debating this issue with the trade unions .
some unions are in favor of legislation on minimum wages , others aren ’ t .
i myself have been hesitant in the past to push for minimum wages , as such a move amounts to an attack on the country ’ s tariff autonomy , if you choose to see it that way .
but of course we also have to see the negative effects of wage dumping policies .
so , my party is willing to debate this at length with the unions , and i ’ m optimistic that we ’ ll reach a consensus in the autumn , ” he said .
müntefering ’ s offer to debate this issue with the trade unions has drawn mixed reactions from policy-makers across the political spectrum .
the opposition liberal democrats have rejected the idea outright , and social democratic economics and labor minister wolfgang clement isn ’ t amused either .
“ i ’ m in favour of looking at the situation in various industries .
i don ’ t think that legislation on minimum wages would make sense for all sectors .
and whether the trade unions are willing to at least partly give up the decades-old principle of tariff autonomy remains to be seen , ” clement said . open to consideration for their part , the trade unions have indicated their willingness to discuss the possibility of legislation in coming weeks .
margret moehring-rahne , deputy head of germany ’ s powerful service sector union , ver.di believes that minimum wages would help to cushion the impact of the labor reforms , meaning the long-term unemployed could not be forced to accept a job if the payment were outside the agreed minimum wage bracket .

in an interview with the bbc , mandelson said if uk or france rejected the constitution it would spark a " major crisis , " but it would n't be the end if voters concerns were addressed .
" it does n't mean abandoning the project , " the trade commissioner designate said .
the opposition was quick to criticize mandelson 's view .
" if , as we expect , there is a ' no ' vote in the referendum , he must accept that that is the end of this wretched and dangerous constitution , " michael ancram , opposition foreign affairs spokesman , said .
ratification of the constitution is one of the big issues facing the union .

but on monday , germany and the united states come together to contest who will grab that chance to play off for the olympic title . whatever the stage , this is the one game from the athens tournament that has everything : rivalry , revenge and the last hurrah .
because these two teams have a history that makes this match more compelling than just any semi-final . in 2003 , the united states and germany met in the semi-finals of the 2003 world cup , a game the germans won , defeating the reigning world champions at the time in their own backyard and going on to claim the ultimate prize for themselves . sweet revenge and bitter rivalry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if ever there was a chance of sweet revenge , this match is just that with the german team gaining pace in their challenge to add olympic gold to their world title .
a us win would scupper that and set up a chance for the former olympic and world champions to get at least one title back at the expense of their greatest rivals . for a number of the us team , this is the last chance to grab more glory .
for highly decorated players such as the so-called " fab five " - mia hamm , julie foudy , joy fawcett , kristine lilly and brandi chastain - this is the last throw of the dice .
another loss at the feet of the germans would bring their international careers top a close on a painful low rather than a joyful high . respect and resolve this is the game the american players wanted .
that 3-0 world cup loss to germany , in a match that was close until the latter minutes , still smarts with the u.s. team and spectators will be primed for one of the potentially great matches of these and possibly any games .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " they are an incredible team with an incredible amount of talent , but we want revenge , " us goalkeeper briana scurry told reporters .
" i 'd be lying if i said i did n't want them to feel the same way we felt after they beat us last summer . "
the match could well turn out to be the tale of two strikers .
the us are spearheaded by abby wambach who has led her team in the scoring stakes with three goals so far and has 18 in her 19 international matches this year .
wambach will be going all out to bring some joy to the seething americans . on the other side will be birgit prinz , who will aim to bring the pain to the americans once again .

a tale of two strikers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both are world class strikers in their prime , although prinz , who turns 27 later this year , has much more international experience , having made her debut for the germany team as a 16-year-old .
prinz is a veteran of three women 's world cups and three olympics .
she has scored 78 goals in only 121 matches , five off the german record of 83 , set by the now-retired heidi mohr . wambach , 24 , debuted with the us as a 21-year-old in a 4-1 win over germany in chicago in 2001 .
gaining international tournament experience at the 2003 world cup and these summer games , wambach has scored 30 goals in 42 international games .
wambach has been on target in each of the three olympics matches she has played and has become the most imposing american force up front . with so much riding on this game - the end result , the chance to go for olympic gold , the resolution of old grudges and the healing of tender wounds , monday 's semi-final is much more than a soccer match . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans drub china in women 's soccer opener germany 's women thrashed their chinese counterparts with an unexpected 8-0 win wednesday at the athens olympics women 's soccer opener , providing a thrilling start to the games .

over 100,000 visitors came , saw and played cutting edge games , experienced the latest in edu- and infotainment and sampled the newest consoles and hardware from over 270 exhibitors from 13 countries while the conventions played host to no less than 68 world premieres . the expanding popularity of the german convention was in evidence as the convention center swelled with the biggest names in the industry .
thomas dlugaiczyk of the games academy , an institution for the promotion of creative electronic arts , observed the differences from the two previous years .
" -lrb- the german companies -rrb- always attended conferences in the usa and canada , now their people come to us , " dlugaiczyk told dw-world . this was in evidence as more international games developers and hardware manufacturers took the opportunity to announce new products and sales figures at the convention , as the industry prepared for the run-up to the all important , rapidly approaching christmas period . big names in attendance game companies such as electronic arts , ubisoft and buena vista revealed rising sales figures as well as new products while the major console companies used the convention as the tactical arena for the coming competition during the festive season . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : x-box mania in leipzig .
sony , microsoft and nintendo were all out in force in leipzig and laying down the battle lines for the price war to come .
microsoft revealed that its x-box console , currently selling for € 199 , will be reduced to € 149 at the end of august in an attempt to attract pre-christmas shoppers .
microsoft told those who gathered at its stand in the convention hall that it hoped to expand its worldwide x-box sales from 15.5 million to 20 million through the deal . over at the sony stand , the makers of playstation struck back during their own show at the convention by following suit , dropping the playstation 2 to the same price . piracy hits german industry but despite the popularity of the convention and the entertainment genre it promotes , the figures belie a worrying downward trend in the computer game industry in germany . in an industry that relies much on exports , germany is seen as a developing country in the context of the european computer game arena .
in the first half of this year , german computer game sales abroad totaled € 111 million , a decline of 36.9 percent on the same six month period in 2003 . there are a number of factors being attributed to this .
one is piracy .
each year , the german computer game industry loses as much as € 400 million through the copying of games and the online sharing of products , with as many as 54 million illegal copies per year being made and sold in germany . another is user-friendliness .
tom putzki , chairperson of g.a.m.e. , the german federation of computer game developers , told dw-world that one reason could be that designers try too hard in the creation of new products and that constantly trying to reinvent the wheel may push creative boundaries but actually alienate consumers . complexity alienates users bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some games take too long to learn , say developers .
bob bates , a game writer from the united states who attended the developer 's conference at the trade fair , said that german games are too complex .
" you demand too much of the consumers .
it takes too long until the player understands the game . "
bates said that u.s. game players give a new game a probation period of five minutes at the most .
" if they have n't understood the game by then and have not enjoyed themselves , then the game is not bought . " david reeves , president and coo of sony computer entertainment europe , told those who gathered to hear his speech that there was still plenty of market growth slumbering in the german games business , stressing that a wider target group and acceptance of gaming as a mainstream entertainment product would be key factors to future success . finding the german target reeves raised the issue that despite germany 's appetite for consuming videogames , very little development actually took place within german borders .
reeves believes that just like racing games in spain and tennis games in france , there are game genres that can hit the sweet spot in germany .
he urged industry representatives to invest in mass market-friendly themes and support development of locally relevant software within germany . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany : the trade fair capital despite its economic crisis , germany has maintained its position as the world 's premier trade fair location .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 23.08.2004 german press review : do we need a minimum wage ? monday 's editorial pages weighed in on the debate about whether germany should institute a minimum wage and the controversy surrounding germany 's equestrian team , which lost two medals to appeals . the süddeutsche zeitung told its readers on its front page that the purpose of the minimum wage is to entice the trade unions into supporting the controversial hartz iv welfare reform for the long-term unemployed .
the paper then took the proposal by franz müntefering , head of the ruling social democratic party , as an opportunity to examine the plight of eastern germany , where unemployment is especially high .
it opened a leading article with the words " are eastern germans second-class citizens ? "
the süddeutsche answered its own question and wrote that the two halves of the country are beginning to drift even farther apart under the pressure of the reforms .
protests and demonstrations against hartz iv are quite legitimate - especially in eastern germany , where citizens were forced to refrain from any sort of protest for years on end .
the paper concluded with what it evidently regarded as the key issue : " what is the point of the government piling the pressure on the unemployed , when there simply is n't enough work to go round in many parts of the country ? "
the neue osnabrücker zeitung tackled the proposal for a minimum wage head on .
its verdict : it 's not a very realistic idea .
first , because it would mean interfering with free collective bargaining , which would annoy the trade unions .
they would quite rightly argue that local union branches and employers know far better than anybody else which wage levels are appropriate in their part of the country .
second , the conservative opposition , as a firm supporter of deregulation , is going to balk at any hint of state intervention .
in addition , the impact of a minimum wage is extremely difficult to predict .
it could indeed increase the purchasing power of those who have jobs , but the effect on the number of people in work is less certain , the paper wrote .
the badische zeitung said germany 's trade unions are divided over the minimum wage .
the engineering workers union ig metall has rejected it outright , fearing that it will weaken the system of free collective bargaining .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 23.08.2004 german press review : do we need a minimum wage ? monday 's editorial pages weighed in on the debate about whether germany should institute a minimum wage and the controversy surrounding germany 's equestrian team , which lost two medals to appeals . the süddeutsche zeitung told its readers on its front page that the purpose of the minimum wage is to entice the trade unions into supporting the controversial hartz iv welfare reform for the long-term unemployed .
the paper then took the proposal by franz müntefering , head of the ruling social democratic party , as an opportunity to examine the plight of eastern germany , where unemployment is especially high .
it opened a leading article with the words " are eastern germans second-class citizens ? "
the süddeutsche answered its own question and wrote that the two halves of the country are beginning to drift even farther apart under the pressure of the reforms .
protests and demonstrations against hartz iv are quite legitimate - especially in eastern germany , where citizens were forced to refrain from any sort of protest for years on end .
the paper concluded with what it evidently regarded as the key issue : " what is the point of the government piling the pressure on the unemployed , when there simply is n't enough work to go round in many parts of the country ? "
the neue osnabrücker zeitung tackled the proposal for a minimum wage head on .
its verdict : it 's not a very realistic idea .
first , because it would mean interfering with free collective bargaining , which would annoy the trade unions .
they would quite rightly argue that local union branches and employers know far better than anybody else which wage levels are appropriate in their part of the country .
second , the conservative opposition , as a firm supporter of deregulation , is going to balk at any hint of state intervention .
in addition , the impact of a minimum wage is extremely difficult to predict .
it could indeed increase the purchasing power of those who have jobs , but the effect on the number of people in work is less certain , the paper wrote .
the badische zeitung said germany 's trade unions are divided over the minimum wage .
the engineering workers union ig metall has rejected it outright , fearing that it will weaken the system of free collective bargaining .
but the catering union came out in favor .
its members work largely for small businesses - which is also one of the reasons their union is not nearly as strong as ig metall .
the state , the daily commented , can not be responsible for everything and certainly not for setting wage levels .
that is the responsibility of the trade unions - and the employers .
many german papers also found space for the brawl at the olympics over equestrian gold , silver and bronze that was settled at the court of arbitration on saturday , three days after the three-day event finished .
german bettina hoy lost two gold medals after a challenge from france , britain and the united states .
the nordwest zeitung in oldenburg remarked that the debate has nothing to do with fairness .
the histrionics underline the dilemma facing contemporary sport , whose rules are becoming increasingly complicated .
seen legally , saturday 's decision may be water-tight .
it does , however , nothing to promote integrity or honesty in sport , the paper opined . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de € 1 jobs for germany 's unemployed ?
to ease the pain of its new unemployment benefit cuts , germany 's economics minister , wolfgang clement , has floated a proposal to create so-called one-euro community jobs for the long-term unemployed .

now , in an apparent bid to sweeten the harsh , but necessary social cuts ahead , spd chief franz müntefering has launched a fresh debate on possible legislation governing the country 's minimum wage .
no taboo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd party chief franz muentefering as it stands , there are no relevant state regulations in place , as wages are invariably defined tariff negotiations between management and trade unions .
on sunday , müntefering said that the traditional tariff autonomy should not be treated as a taboo , but warned against jumping to conclusions . “ we ’ re currently debating this issue with the trade unions .
some unions are in favor of legislation on minimum wages , others aren ’ t .
i myself have been hesitant in the past to push for minimum wages , as such a move amounts to an attack on the country ’ s tariff autonomy , if you choose to see it that way .
but of course we also have to see the negative effects of wage dumping policies .
so , my party is willing to debate this at length with the unions , and i ’ m optimistic that we ’ ll reach a consensus in the autumn , ” he said .
müntefering ’ s offer to debate this issue with the trade unions has drawn mixed reactions from policy-makers across the political spectrum .
the opposition liberal democrats have rejected the idea outright , and social democratic economics and labor minister wolfgang clement isn ’ t amused either .
“ i ’ m in favour of looking at the situation in various industries .
i don ’ t think that legislation on minimum wages would make sense for all sectors .
and whether the trade unions are willing to at least partly give up the decades-old principle of tariff autonomy remains to be seen , ” clement said . open to consideration for their part , the trade unions have indicated their willingness to discuss the possibility of legislation in coming weeks .
margret moehring-rahne , deputy head of germany ’ s powerful service sector union , ver.di believes that minimum wages would help to cushion the impact of the labor reforms , meaning the long-term unemployed could not be forced to accept a job if the payment were outside the agreed minimum wage bracket .

it was the third wave of so-called " monday demonstrations , " a term used by eastern germans during their protests in 1989 that toppled communism in the region and paved the way for german unification .
curiously enough , the protests in the east this time are directed against a democratically elected government and it ’ s the former communists of the leftist pds that stands to profit most .
" the reforms are hurting the poor while the rich continue to pocket huge profits , " one berlin protester told deutsche welle .
these popular perceptions of schröder ’ s welfare reforms are providing the perfect breeding ground for the comeback of germany ‘ s post-communists .
after crashing out of the national parliament two years ago , they have now surged to a record high in opinion polls , enjoying 7 percent support nationwide .
in economically depressed eastern regions , the pds is now the second-strongest party .
hitting society 's weakest ?
the reformed communists ' charismatic figurehead , gregor gysi , says his party was just putting a finger on the sore spots of schröder ’ s reform policy .
" the economic situation in eastern germany , " he said , " doesn ’ t seem to matter anymore - neither to the government nor to parliament .
in addition , the cuts always hit the weakest in society while the well-to-do are left untouched . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several thousand eastern germans partake in a recent monday demonstration in leipzig anger over the government ’ s welfare cuts is especially strong in eastern germany , because the majority of the 3 million people who are affected by them live there .
the new measures include stiff means-testing and deep cuts in monthly benefit payments for the long-term unemployed .
the chancellor ’ s social democrats are feeling the heat , and with only 21 percent support in the opinion polls , they are trailing the pds by 5 percent ahead of two regional elections in eastern german states .
is populism on the rise ?
spd leaders like party manager uwe benneter are growing nervous and have accused the post communists of stoking popular fears .
" the pds is exploiting the reforms for electioneering purposes in a disgustingly populist manner , " benneter said .
" we must strengthen our campaign to debunk those who are intent only on stoking anger without presenting alternative solutions of their own . "
political analysts believe , however , that the protests are underscoring a persistent trend in the electorate in the east that includes a drift away from the established parties towards those on the extremes .
" there is indeed a danger of that , and it is being sustained by the fact that eastern germans have never had strong party affiliations , " said michael edinger , a political scientist at jena university .

it was the third wave of so-called " monday demonstrations , " a term used by eastern germans during their protests in 1989 that toppled communism in the region and paved the way for german unification .
curiously enough , the protests in the east this time are directed against a democratically elected government and it ’ s the former communists of the leftist pds that stands to profit most .
" the reforms are hurting the poor while the rich continue to pocket huge profits , " one berlin protester told deutsche welle .
these popular perceptions of schröder ’ s welfare reforms are providing the perfect breeding ground for the comeback of germany ‘ s post-communists .
after crashing out of the national parliament two years ago , they have now surged to a record high in opinion polls , enjoying 7 percent support nationwide .
in economically depressed eastern regions , the pds is now the second-strongest party .
hitting society 's weakest ?
the reformed communists ' charismatic figurehead , gregor gysi , says his party was just putting a finger on the sore spots of schröder ’ s reform policy .
" the economic situation in eastern germany , " he said , " doesn ’ t seem to matter anymore - neither to the government nor to parliament .
in addition , the cuts always hit the weakest in society while the well-to-do are left untouched . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several thousand eastern germans partake in a recent monday demonstration in leipzig anger over the government ’ s welfare cuts is especially strong in eastern germany , because the majority of the 3 million people who are affected by them live there .
the new measures include stiff means-testing and deep cuts in monthly benefit payments for the long-term unemployed .
the chancellor ’ s social democrats are feeling the heat , and with only 21 percent support in the opinion polls , they are trailing the pds by 5 percent ahead of two regional elections in eastern german states .
is populism on the rise ?
spd leaders like party manager uwe benneter are growing nervous and have accused the post communists of stoking popular fears .
" the pds is exploiting the reforms for electioneering purposes in a disgustingly populist manner , " benneter said .
" we must strengthen our campaign to debunk those who are intent only on stoking anger without presenting alternative solutions of their own . "
political analysts believe , however , that the protests are underscoring a persistent trend in the electorate in the east that includes a drift away from the established parties towards those on the extremes .
" there is indeed a danger of that , and it is being sustained by the fact that eastern germans have never had strong party affiliations , " said michael edinger , a political scientist at jena university .

but on monday , germany and the united states come together to contest who will grab that chance to play off for the olympic title . whatever the stage , this is the one game from the athens tournament that has everything : rivalry , revenge and the last hurrah .
because these two teams have a history that makes this match more compelling than just any semi-final . in 2003 , the united states and germany met in the semi-finals of the 2003 world cup , a game the germans won , defeating the reigning world champions at the time in their own backyard and going on to claim the ultimate prize for themselves . sweet revenge and bitter rivalry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if ever there was a chance of sweet revenge , this match is just that with the german team gaining pace in their challenge to add olympic gold to their world title .
a us win would scupper that and set up a chance for the former olympic and world champions to get at least one title back at the expense of their greatest rivals . for a number of the us team , this is the last chance to grab more glory .
for highly decorated players such as the so-called " fab five " - mia hamm , julie foudy , joy fawcett , kristine lilly and brandi chastain - this is the last throw of the dice .
another loss at the feet of the germans would bring their international careers top a close on a painful low rather than a joyful high . respect and resolve this is the game the american players wanted .
that 3-0 world cup loss to germany , in a match that was close until the latter minutes , still smarts with the u.s. team and spectators will be primed for one of the potentially great matches of these and possibly any games .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " they are an incredible team with an incredible amount of talent , but we want revenge , " us goalkeeper briana scurry told reporters .
" i 'd be lying if i said i did n't want them to feel the same way we felt after they beat us last summer . "
the match could well turn out to be the tale of two strikers .
the us are spearheaded by abby wambach who has led her team in the scoring stakes with three goals so far and has 18 in her 19 international matches this year .
wambach will be going all out to bring some joy to the seething americans . on the other side will be birgit prinz , who will aim to bring the pain to the americans once again .
prinz is now slouch in the scoring stakes either with an overall olympic tally of six goals , including four in one game .
a tale of two strikers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both are world class strikers in their prime , although prinz , who turns 27 later this year , has much more international experience , having made her debut for the germany team as a 16-year-old .
prinz is a veteran of three women 's world cups and three olympics .
she has scored 78 goals in only 121 matches , five off the german record of 83 , set by the now-retired heidi mohr . wambach , 24 , debuted with the us as a 21-year-old in a 4-1 win over germany in chicago in 2001 .
gaining international tournament experience at the 2003 world cup and these summer games , wambach has scored 30 goals in 42 international games .
wambach has been on target in each of the three olympics matches she has played and has become the most imposing american force up front . with so much riding on this game - the end result , the chance to go for olympic gold , the resolution of old grudges and the healing of tender wounds , monday 's semi-final is much more than a soccer match . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans drub china in women 's soccer opener germany 's women thrashed their chinese counterparts with an unexpected 8-0 win wednesday at the athens olympics women 's soccer opener , providing a thrilling start to the games .

it was the third wave of so-called " monday demonstrations , " a term used by eastern germans during their protests in 1989 that toppled communism in the region and paved the way for german unification .
curiously enough , the protests in the east this time are directed against a democratically elected government and it ’ s the former communists of the leftist pds that stands to profit most .
" the reforms are hurting the poor while the rich continue to pocket huge profits , " one berlin protester told deutsche welle .
these popular perceptions of schröder ’ s welfare reforms are providing the perfect breeding ground for the comeback of germany ‘ s post-communists .
after crashing out of the national parliament two years ago , they have now surged to a record high in opinion polls , enjoying 7 percent support nationwide .
in economically depressed eastern regions , the pds is now the second-strongest party .
hitting society 's weakest ?
the reformed communists ' charismatic figurehead , gregor gysi , says his party was just putting a finger on the sore spots of schröder ’ s reform policy .
" the economic situation in eastern germany , " he said , " doesn ’ t seem to matter anymore - neither to the government nor to parliament .
in addition , the cuts always hit the weakest in society while the well-to-do are left untouched . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several thousand eastern germans partake in a recent monday demonstration in leipzig anger over the government ’ s welfare cuts is especially strong in eastern germany , because the majority of the 3 million people who are affected by them live there .
the new measures include stiff means-testing and deep cuts in monthly benefit payments for the long-term unemployed .
the chancellor ’ s social democrats are feeling the heat , and with only 21 percent support in the opinion polls , they are trailing the pds by 5 percent ahead of two regional elections in eastern german states .
is populism on the rise ?
spd leaders like party manager uwe benneter are growing nervous and have accused the post communists of stoking popular fears .
" the pds is exploiting the reforms for electioneering purposes in a disgustingly populist manner , " benneter said .
" we must strengthen our campaign to debunk those who are intent only on stoking anger without presenting alternative solutions of their own . "
political analysts believe , however , that the protests are underscoring a persistent trend in the electorate in the east that includes a drift away from the established parties towards those on the extremes .
" there is indeed a danger of that , and it is being sustained by the fact that eastern germans have never had strong party affiliations , " said michael edinger , a political scientist at jena university .
" we ’ re also coming to realize that such loose political ties could be the future of politics in all of germany , raising the specter of large numbers of protest voters quite ready to support extremist parties at the ballot box . "
rightwing-extremist parties are already profiting from the mass protests .
in saxony the national democratic party could enter the regional parliament in september .
the party could increase its votes from one and half to over 5 percent compared the last election , polls have shown .
meanwhile , in brandenburg the german people ’ s union is expected to hold its seats in parliament .

but on monday , germany and the united states come together to contest who will grab that chance to play off for the olympic title . whatever the stage , this is the one game from the athens tournament that has everything : rivalry , revenge and the last hurrah .
because these two teams have a history that makes this match more compelling than just any semi-final . in 2003 , the united states and germany met in the semi-finals of the 2003 world cup , a game the germans won , defeating the reigning world champions at the time in their own backyard and going on to claim the ultimate prize for themselves . sweet revenge and bitter rivalry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if ever there was a chance of sweet revenge , this match is just that with the german team gaining pace in their challenge to add olympic gold to their world title .
a us win would scupper that and set up a chance for the former olympic and world champions to get at least one title back at the expense of their greatest rivals . for a number of the us team , this is the last chance to grab more glory .
for highly decorated players such as the so-called " fab five " - mia hamm , julie foudy , joy fawcett , kristine lilly and brandi chastain - this is the last throw of the dice .
another loss at the feet of the germans would bring their international careers top a close on a painful low rather than a joyful high . respect and resolve this is the game the american players wanted .
that 3-0 world cup loss to germany , in a match that was close until the latter minutes , still smarts with the u.s. team and spectators will be primed for one of the potentially great matches of these and possibly any games .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " they are an incredible team with an incredible amount of talent , but we want revenge , " us goalkeeper briana scurry told reporters .
" i 'd be lying if i said i did n't want them to feel the same way we felt after they beat us last summer . "
the match could well turn out to be the tale of two strikers .
the us are spearheaded by abby wambach who has led her team in the scoring stakes with three goals so far and has 18 in her 19 international matches this year .
wambach will be going all out to bring some joy to the seething americans . on the other side will be birgit prinz , who will aim to bring the pain to the americans once again .
prinz is now slouch in the scoring stakes either with an overall olympic tally of six goals , including four in one game .
a tale of two strikers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both are world class strikers in their prime , although prinz , who turns 27 later this year , has much more international experience , having made her debut for the germany team as a 16-year-old .
prinz is a veteran of three women 's world cups and three olympics .
she has scored 78 goals in only 121 matches , five off the german record of 83 , set by the now-retired heidi mohr . wambach , 24 , debuted with the us as a 21-year-old in a 4-1 win over germany in chicago in 2001 .
gaining international tournament experience at the 2003 world cup and these summer games , wambach has scored 30 goals in 42 international games .
wambach has been on target in each of the three olympics matches she has played and has become the most imposing american force up front . with so much riding on this game - the end result , the chance to go for olympic gold , the resolution of old grudges and the healing of tender wounds , monday 's semi-final is much more than a soccer match . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans drub china in women 's soccer opener germany 's women thrashed their chinese counterparts with an unexpected 8-0 win wednesday at the athens olympics women 's soccer opener , providing a thrilling start to the games .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 23.08.2004 video game fair spotlights european market großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the convention was a success but it raised questions for german firms the third computer games convention came to an end in leipzig on sunday with positive feedback for the future of the event itself but less than good news for the german gaming industry . the third annual computer games convention , the biggest trade fair for interactive entertainment in europe , came to a close in leipzig on sunday .
over 100,000 visitors came , saw and played cutting edge games , experienced the latest in edu- and infotainment and sampled the newest consoles and hardware from over 270 exhibitors from 13 countries while the conventions played host to no less than 68 world premieres . the expanding popularity of the german convention was in evidence as the convention center swelled with the biggest names in the industry .
thomas dlugaiczyk of the games academy , an institution for the promotion of creative electronic arts , observed the differences from the two previous years .
" -lrb- the german companies -rrb- always attended conferences in the usa and canada , now their people come to us , " dlugaiczyk told dw-world . this was in evidence as more international games developers and hardware manufacturers took the opportunity to announce new products and sales figures at the convention , as the industry prepared for the run-up to the all important , rapidly approaching christmas period . big names in attendance game companies such as electronic arts , ubisoft and buena vista revealed rising sales figures as well as new products while the major console companies used the convention as the tactical arena for the coming competition during the festive season . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : x-box mania in leipzig .
sony , microsoft and nintendo were all out in force in leipzig and laying down the battle lines for the price war to come .
microsoft revealed that its x-box console , currently selling for € 199 , will be reduced to € 149 at the end of august in an attempt to attract pre-christmas shoppers .
microsoft told those who gathered at its stand in the convention hall that it hoped to expand its worldwide x-box sales from 15.5 million to 20 million through the deal . over at the sony stand , the makers of playstation struck back during their own show at the convention by following suit , dropping the playstation 2 to the same price . piracy hits german industry but despite the popularity of the convention and the entertainment genre it promotes , the figures belie a worrying downward trend in the computer game industry in germany . in an industry that relies much on exports , germany is seen as a developing country in the context of the european computer game arena .
in the first half of this year , german computer game sales abroad totaled € 111 million , a decline of 36.9 percent on the same six month period in 2003 . there are a number of factors being attributed to this .
one is piracy .
each year , the german computer game industry loses as much as € 400 million through the copying of games and the online sharing of products , with as many as 54 million illegal copies per year being made and sold in germany . another is user-friendliness .
tom putzki , chairperson of g.a.m.e. , the german federation of computer game developers , told dw-world that one reason could be that designers try too hard in the creation of new products and that constantly trying to reinvent the wheel may push creative boundaries but actually alienate consumers . complexity alienates users bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some games take too long to learn , say developers .
bob bates , a game writer from the united states who attended the developer 's conference at the trade fair , said that german games are too complex .
" you demand too much of the consumers .
it takes too long until the player understands the game . "
bates said that u.s. game players give a new game a probation period of five minutes at the most .
" if they have n't understood the game by then and have not enjoyed themselves , then the game is not bought . " david reeves , president and coo of sony computer entertainment europe , told those who gathered to hear his speech that there was still plenty of market growth slumbering in the german games business , stressing that a wider target group and acceptance of gaming as a mainstream entertainment product would be key factors to future success . finding the german target reeves raised the issue that despite germany 's appetite for consuming videogames , very little development actually took place within german borders .
reeves believes that just like racing games in spain and tennis games in france , there are game genres that can hit the sweet spot in germany .
he urged industry representatives to invest in mass market-friendly themes and support development of locally relevant software within germany . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany : the trade fair capital despite its economic crisis , germany has maintained its position as the world 's premier trade fair location .

figures showed that 20 % of teenagers questioned said their friends were pressured into faking drug-taking in order to fit in with their peers .
the report which questioned more than 1,000 11 to 18-year-olds across the uk , also said boys were twice as likely as girls to pretend they took drugs .

" music tastes and appearance are the obvious ways to define oneself , but the ways in which young people talk about themselves to their peers also helps them to create a sense of self .
' no fashion statement ' " to be an individual , we first need to be one of the lads or lasses . "
darren hall , spokesman for frank , said it was encouraging that while young people talked about drug-taking , that they were not necessarily experimenting with drugs themselves .

the transporter plane has played a pivotal role in most key military and relief campaigns of modern times .
it can land on a range of surfaces , including snow , ice , sand , fields , roads and even aircraft carriers .
the first test plane made its maiden flight in burbank , california , on 23 august 1954.the raf 's fleet has been based at lyneham since the 1970s .
multiple tasks its work has included transporting troops , fuel , ammunition and humanitarian relief .
in the 1980s , two hercules aircraft worked 14 hours a day , seven days a week , to deliver thousands of tons of food and medical supplies to ethiopia - many crews volunteered for the job .
during the first gulf war , the hercules was the only aircraft that could land on desert strips .
troops were taken to the front line of the kuwait invasion and at the end of desert storm were taken home at the rate of 1,000 a day .
tragedy struck the fleet in 1993 , when nine crew members from lyneham were killed after their hercules crashed after stalling on a low-level flying exercise in scotland .
in 1999 , a new computer-controlled j model of the hercules came into service and has played significant roles in recent conflicts in afghanistan and iraq .
