program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.07.2004 young germans face rising hiv rates großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the early 90s , aggresive hiv campaigns were the norm after falling for several years , rates of hiv infection , particularly among young gay men , are rising again .
risky behavior is increasing as a new generation appears willing to close its eyes to the dangers of hiv / aids . at 20 years old , many young adults are busy getting their college degrees or beginning their work lives , often excited at the broad expanse of possibilities in front of them .
however , for 20-year-old andreas , a gay berlin resident , a dark cloud has formed on his horizon ; he found out recently he has been infected with hiv , the virus that causes aids . andreas , who asked that his real name not be used , is having difficulty coming to terms with a diagnosis that has changed his future irrevocably .
while hiv is no longer the death sentence it once was , andreas will have to begin a demanding drug regime to keep aids at bay - and there are no guarantees .
the disease still kills 600 people in germany every year . " there is too little information out there , " he told dw-world .
" i never thought it could happen to me . " " new dynamic " to epidemic for some time in the mid to late 1990s , researchers and health care professionals working in the areas of hiv / aids could take comfort in the statistics : the number of hiv infections was falling annually ; the message of safer sex seemed to have gotten out . but a report out by the robert koch institute , a federal organization that researches disease control and prevention , warns that the epidemic of hiv in germany could acquire a " new dynamic " since the number of infections since 2001 has been rising steadily . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researching hiv in the lab - there 's medicine , but no cure three years ago , the institute reported 1,470 hiv infections in germany ; in 2002 , that number rose to 1,716 ; last year , 1,958 people contracted the virus .
that is a 33 percent rise in three years .
the trend toward rising infection rates also affects heterosexuals , half of those infected were men who had sex with men . experts say the reason behind the rise in infections is an increase in unsafe sex and a swing in attitudes toward the dangers of aids . since 1987 , the koch institute has carried out an annual survey about aids awareness in the general public .
in 2003 , the survey found that condom usage in general was falling .
among those surveyed who had multiple sexual partners in 2003 , 78 percent used condoms , down five percent over two years .
manufacturers are even selling fewer condoms in germany .
young people seem especially susceptible to letting their guard down in the heat of the moment . " the general tendency among young people today is to not see fully the risks involved in risky sexual behavior , " rolf gindorf , founder and past president of dgss , a sexuality research center in düsseldorf , told dw-world . " older gay men , say around 40 and up , are aware of the danger because they came of age at a time when death rates were high and aids information was very visible and always on people 's minds , " he said . "
but younger people today , they do n't have that experience .
knowing that the disease can be treated tends to make them carefree when it comes to sex . " the result is a generation gap that has developed between older and younger gay men .
protected sex has become second nature to older gay men , but among today 's youth , while they generally known the rules of safer sex , they often do n't follow them in sexual situations , according to birgit krenz of berlin aids hilfe , an organization that provides counseling and care for people with the disease . the results are becoming clear .
in 2001 , less than 1 percent of the hiv-infected people counseled at berlin aids hilfe were under the age of 20 .
by 2003 , that number had risen to 5 percent . less information after the deluge of aids information up until the late 1990s , according to dr. marita völker-albert of the federal center for health education -lrb- bzga -rrb- , there has been a strong decline over the past five years in public discussion of the disease . " priorities change , and issues like bse or sept .
11 have largely driven aids out of the media and the public mind , " she told dw-world .
" it 's harder to reach people now . " public money made available for education has also fallen off .
in 1987 , when the bzga began its aids awareness campaign , it had an annual budget of 50 million marks -lrb- $ 31.4 million -rrb- .
today , the center 's public awareness campaign has just over a third of that to spend - € 9 million -lrb- $ 11 million -rrb- a year . although he said he knew how to protect himself , andreas still partially blames the lack of a strong public message and vigorous discussion about aids for his infection . " it did n't do much good for me to see some celebrity up there talking about wearing condoms or something , " he said .
" i needed something blatant that could shock me into making the right decisions . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de researchers warn about aids in eastern europe of the 280,000 new aids infections in europe during the past year , more than 200,000 were reported in areas formerly belonging to the soviet bloc .
the figures are triggering alarm bells among researchers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.07.2004 young germans face rising hiv rates großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the early 90s , aggresive hiv campaigns were the norm after falling for several years , rates of hiv infection , particularly among young gay men , are rising again .
risky behavior is increasing as a new generation appears willing to close its eyes to the dangers of hiv / aids . at 20 years old , many young adults are busy getting their college degrees or beginning their work lives , often excited at the broad expanse of possibilities in front of them .
however , for 20-year-old andreas , a gay berlin resident , a dark cloud has formed on his horizon ; he found out recently he has been infected with hiv , the virus that causes aids . andreas , who asked that his real name not be used , is having difficulty coming to terms with a diagnosis that has changed his future irrevocably .
while hiv is no longer the death sentence it once was , andreas will have to begin a demanding drug regime to keep aids at bay - and there are no guarantees .
the disease still kills 600 people in germany every year . " there is too little information out there , " he told dw-world .
" i never thought it could happen to me . " " new dynamic " to epidemic for some time in the mid to late 1990s , researchers and health care professionals working in the areas of hiv / aids could take comfort in the statistics : the number of hiv infections was falling annually ; the message of safer sex seemed to have gotten out . but a report out by the robert koch institute , a federal organization that researches disease control and prevention , warns that the epidemic of hiv in germany could acquire a " new dynamic " since the number of infections since 2001 has been rising steadily . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researching hiv in the lab - there 's medicine , but no cure three years ago , the institute reported 1,470 hiv infections in germany ; in 2002 , that number rose to 1,716 ; last year , 1,958 people contracted the virus .
that is a 33 percent rise in three years .
the trend toward rising infection rates also affects heterosexuals , half of those infected were men who had sex with men . experts say the reason behind the rise in infections is an increase in unsafe sex and a swing in attitudes toward the dangers of aids . since 1987 , the koch institute has carried out an annual survey about aids awareness in the general public .
in 2003 , the survey found that condom usage in general was falling .
among those surveyed who had multiple sexual partners in 2003 , 78 percent used condoms , down five percent over two years .
manufacturers are even selling fewer condoms in germany .
young people seem especially susceptible to letting their guard down in the heat of the moment . " the general tendency among young people today is to not see fully the risks involved in risky sexual behavior , " rolf gindorf , founder and past president of dgss , a sexuality research center in düsseldorf , told dw-world . " older gay men , say around 40 and up , are aware of the danger because they came of age at a time when death rates were high and aids information was very visible and always on people 's minds , " he said . "
but younger people today , they do n't have that experience .
knowing that the disease can be treated tends to make them carefree when it comes to sex . " the result is a generation gap that has developed between older and younger gay men .
protected sex has become second nature to older gay men , but among today 's youth , while they generally known the rules of safer sex , they often do n't follow them in sexual situations , according to birgit krenz of berlin aids hilfe , an organization that provides counseling and care for people with the disease . the results are becoming clear .
in 2001 , less than 1 percent of the hiv-infected people counseled at berlin aids hilfe were under the age of 20 .
by 2003 , that number had risen to 5 percent . less information after the deluge of aids information up until the late 1990s , according to dr. marita völker-albert of the federal center for health education -lrb- bzga -rrb- , there has been a strong decline over the past five years in public discussion of the disease . " priorities change , and issues like bse or sept .
11 have largely driven aids out of the media and the public mind , " she told dw-world .
" it 's harder to reach people now . " public money made available for education has also fallen off .
in 1987 , when the bzga began its aids awareness campaign , it had an annual budget of 50 million marks -lrb- $ 31.4 million -rrb- .
today , the center 's public awareness campaign has just over a third of that to spend - € 9 million -lrb- $ 11 million -rrb- a year . although he said he knew how to protect himself , andreas still partially blames the lack of a strong public message and vigorous discussion about aids for his infection . " it did n't do much good for me to see some celebrity up there talking about wearing condoms or something , " he said .
" i needed something blatant that could shock me into making the right decisions .

what started as an operation for saving ski areas has turned out to be a successful environmental measure to protect glaciers from melting away .
germany 's zugspitze now spends most of the year undercover . while most people in germany are complaining about the unseasonable temperatures this summer , the cool , wet weather has been a boon to germany 's highest mountain , the zugspitze .
after a fresh dusting of snow on germany 's most famous glacier this past week , environmentalists let out a sigh of relief .
but things are n't always this cool in the icy heights of the german alps .
summers usually bring rising temperatures and glaring sunshine .
although the balmy weather may be just what the calendar calls for in the rest of the country , on the zugspitze warm days are frowned upon .
with every rise in the mercury , precious centimeters of one of germany 's few remaining glaciers melt away .
it 's estimated that global warming results in a loss of about 10 centimeters of the glacier every year .
at that rate , not much is expected to survive through the next century , says the society for environmental research in munich in its online glacier archive .
to preserve this unique environment , dedicated workers at the zugspitzbahn , the cable car operator up to the peak , have devised a giant sun shade to protect the ice on top of the 2,962 meter-high mountain .
every year for the past 10 years , they spread out about 6,000 square meters -lrb- 19,000 sq. feet -rrb- of mats and tarpaulins on the glacier 's surface .
the white material reflects sunlight and insulates against the heat , preventing further melting of the snow and ice .
keeping the glacier under wraps bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : covering up the zugspitze the canvas also helps protect the glacier from warm summer rain , " which virtually devours the snow , " says stephanie vogel of the zugspitzbahn .
vogel and her colleagues at the peak 's cable car are in favor of the giant sunshade .
although she admits it is work to cover the glacier , it is import for preserving the fragile condition on the mountain top for posterity .
originally the idea was developed to protect snow in popular ski areas , but vogel says it has moved beyond the economic aspects related to tourism and has turned out to be a successful environmental measure .
to critics she acknowledges the sun shield is an " intervention in nature . "
any attempt to save an at-risk environment implies intervention , she argues .
the tarps , she believes , are the least dramatic interference .
in other places , snow guns are used to keep mountain peaks and especially ski resorts covered in white powder .
germany , however , is against relying on artificial snow because of the environmental concerns and the cost of energy involved .
consequences of glacial melting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at 2,963 meters , the zugspitze in bavaria is germany 's highest mountain .
the zugspitze is not alone in its battle against global warming .
environmentalists say glaciers are some of the most threatened ecosystems on earth .
they function as " global thermometers " and are extremely sensitive to the world 's rising temperature .
global warming , the lack of snow in winter , hot summers as well as air pollution and acid rain are responsible for shrinking glaciers , says the society for environmental research in munich .
more than just the loss of a valuable landscape , the defrosting of the permanent glacial ice - the permafrost - causes landslides and avalanches as the rocky undersurface is revealed and erodes in the rough wind .
resources of potable water provided by glacial ice also become more scarce , the society warns on its web site .
given current rates of greenhouse gas emissions , the anti-glare shield on the zugspitze may in the end only represent a last-ditch effort to slow down the almost inevitable glacier diminution .
" as contemporary witnesses of this rapid melting we are at least able to experience real glaciers .
it is possible our descendants wo n't see this phenomenon , " fears the society for environmental research . rieke brendel -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de historic alps postcards : a tool in documenting glacial melt armed with surveying equipment , satellite maps and historical postcards , german geologists are retracing diminishing alpine glaciers .

what started as an operation for saving ski areas has turned out to be a successful environmental measure to protect glaciers from melting away .
germany 's zugspitze now spends most of the year undercover . while most people in germany are complaining about the unseasonable temperatures this summer , the cool , wet weather has been a boon to germany 's highest mountain , the zugspitze .
after a fresh dusting of snow on germany 's most famous glacier this past week , environmentalists let out a sigh of relief .
but things are n't always this cool in the icy heights of the german alps .
summers usually bring rising temperatures and glaring sunshine .
although the balmy weather may be just what the calendar calls for in the rest of the country , on the zugspitze warm days are frowned upon .
with every rise in the mercury , precious centimeters of one of germany 's few remaining glaciers melt away .
it 's estimated that global warming results in a loss of about 10 centimeters of the glacier every year .
at that rate , not much is expected to survive through the next century , says the society for environmental research in munich in its online glacier archive .
to preserve this unique environment , dedicated workers at the zugspitzbahn , the cable car operator up to the peak , have devised a giant sun shade to protect the ice on top of the 2,962 meter-high mountain .
every year for the past 10 years , they spread out about 6,000 square meters -lrb- 19,000 sq. feet -rrb- of mats and tarpaulins on the glacier 's surface .
the white material reflects sunlight and insulates against the heat , preventing further melting of the snow and ice .
keeping the glacier under wraps bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : covering up the zugspitze the canvas also helps protect the glacier from warm summer rain , " which virtually devours the snow , " says stephanie vogel of the zugspitzbahn .
vogel and her colleagues at the peak 's cable car are in favor of the giant sunshade .
although she admits it is work to cover the glacier , it is import for preserving the fragile condition on the mountain top for posterity .
originally the idea was developed to protect snow in popular ski areas , but vogel says it has moved beyond the economic aspects related to tourism and has turned out to be a successful environmental measure .
to critics she acknowledges the sun shield is an " intervention in nature . "
any attempt to save an at-risk environment implies intervention , she argues .
the tarps , she believes , are the least dramatic interference .
in other places , snow guns are used to keep mountain peaks and especially ski resorts covered in white powder .
germany , however , is against relying on artificial snow because of the environmental concerns and the cost of energy involved .
consequences of glacial melting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at 2,963 meters , the zugspitze in bavaria is germany 's highest mountain .
the zugspitze is not alone in its battle against global warming .
environmentalists say glaciers are some of the most threatened ecosystems on earth .
they function as " global thermometers " and are extremely sensitive to the world 's rising temperature .
global warming , the lack of snow in winter , hot summers as well as air pollution and acid rain are responsible for shrinking glaciers , says the society for environmental research in munich .
more than just the loss of a valuable landscape , the defrosting of the permanent glacial ice - the permafrost - causes landslides and avalanches as the rocky undersurface is revealed and erodes in the rough wind .
resources of potable water provided by glacial ice also become more scarce , the society warns on its web site .
given current rates of greenhouse gas emissions , the anti-glare shield on the zugspitze may in the end only represent a last-ditch effort to slow down the almost inevitable glacier diminution .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.07.2004 young germans face rising hiv rates großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the early 90s , aggresive hiv campaigns were the norm after falling for several years , rates of hiv infection , particularly among young gay men , are rising again .
risky behavior is increasing as a new generation appears willing to close its eyes to the dangers of hiv / aids . at 20 years old , many young adults are busy getting their college degrees or beginning their work lives , often excited at the broad expanse of possibilities in front of them .
however , for 20-year-old andreas , a gay berlin resident , a dark cloud has formed on his horizon ; he found out recently he has been infected with hiv , the virus that causes aids . andreas , who asked that his real name not be used , is having difficulty coming to terms with a diagnosis that has changed his future irrevocably .
while hiv is no longer the death sentence it once was , andreas will have to begin a demanding drug regime to keep aids at bay - and there are no guarantees .
the disease still kills 600 people in germany every year . " there is too little information out there , " he told dw-world .
" i never thought it could happen to me . " " new dynamic " to epidemic for some time in the mid to late 1990s , researchers and health care professionals working in the areas of hiv / aids could take comfort in the statistics : the number of hiv infections was falling annually ; the message of safer sex seemed to have gotten out . but a report out by the robert koch institute , a federal organization that researches disease control and prevention , warns that the epidemic of hiv in germany could acquire a " new dynamic " since the number of infections since 2001 has been rising steadily . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researching hiv in the lab - there 's medicine , but no cure three years ago , the institute reported 1,470 hiv infections in germany ; in 2002 , that number rose to 1,716 ; last year , 1,958 people contracted the virus .
that is a 33 percent rise in three years .
the trend toward rising infection rates also affects heterosexuals , half of those infected were men who had sex with men . experts say the reason behind the rise in infections is an increase in unsafe sex and a swing in attitudes toward the dangers of aids . since 1987 , the koch institute has carried out an annual survey about aids awareness in the general public .
in 2003 , the survey found that condom usage in general was falling .
among those surveyed who had multiple sexual partners in 2003 , 78 percent used condoms , down five percent over two years .
manufacturers are even selling fewer condoms in germany .
young people seem especially susceptible to letting their guard down in the heat of the moment . " the general tendency among young people today is to not see fully the risks involved in risky sexual behavior , " rolf gindorf , founder and past president of dgss , a sexuality research center in düsseldorf , told dw-world . " older gay men , say around 40 and up , are aware of the danger because they came of age at a time when death rates were high and aids information was very visible and always on people 's minds , " he said . "
but younger people today , they do n't have that experience .
knowing that the disease can be treated tends to make them carefree when it comes to sex . " the result is a generation gap that has developed between older and younger gay men .
protected sex has become second nature to older gay men , but among today 's youth , while they generally known the rules of safer sex , they often do n't follow them in sexual situations , according to birgit krenz of berlin aids hilfe , an organization that provides counseling and care for people with the disease . the results are becoming clear .
in 2001 , less than 1 percent of the hiv-infected people counseled at berlin aids hilfe were under the age of 20 .
by 2003 , that number had risen to 5 percent . less information after the deluge of aids information up until the late 1990s , according to dr. marita völker-albert of the federal center for health education -lrb- bzga -rrb- , there has been a strong decline over the past five years in public discussion of the disease . " priorities change , and issues like bse or sept .
11 have largely driven aids out of the media and the public mind , " she told dw-world .
" it 's harder to reach people now . " public money made available for education has also fallen off .
in 1987 , when the bzga began its aids awareness campaign , it had an annual budget of 50 million marks -lrb- $ 31.4 million -rrb- .
today , the center 's public awareness campaign has just over a third of that to spend - € 9 million -lrb- $ 11 million -rrb- a year . although he said he knew how to protect himself , andreas still partially blames the lack of a strong public message and vigorous discussion about aids for his infection . " it did n't do much good for me to see some celebrity up there talking about wearing condoms or something , " he said .
" i needed something blatant that could shock me into making the right decisions .

risky behavior is increasing as a new generation appears willing to close its eyes to the dangers of hiv / aids . at 20 years old , many young adults are busy getting their college degrees or beginning their work lives , often excited at the broad expanse of possibilities in front of them .
however , for 20-year-old andreas , a gay berlin resident , a dark cloud has formed on his horizon ; he found out recently he has been infected with hiv , the virus that causes aids . andreas , who asked that his real name not be used , is having difficulty coming to terms with a diagnosis that has changed his future irrevocably .
while hiv is no longer the death sentence it once was , andreas will have to begin a demanding drug regime to keep aids at bay - and there are no guarantees .
the disease still kills 600 people in germany every year . " there is too little information out there , " he told dw-world .
" i never thought it could happen to me . " " new dynamic " to epidemic for some time in the mid to late 1990s , researchers and health care professionals working in the areas of hiv / aids could take comfort in the statistics : the number of hiv infections was falling annually ; the message of safer sex seemed to have gotten out . but a report out by the robert koch institute , a federal organization that researches disease control and prevention , warns that the epidemic of hiv in germany could acquire a " new dynamic " since the number of infections since 2001 has been rising steadily . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researching hiv in the lab - there 's medicine , but no cure three years ago , the institute reported 1,470 hiv infections in germany ; in 2002 , that number rose to 1,716 ; last year , 1,958 people contracted the virus .
that is a 33 percent rise in three years .
the trend toward rising infection rates also affects heterosexuals , half of those infected were men who had sex with men . experts say the reason behind the rise in infections is an increase in unsafe sex and a swing in attitudes toward the dangers of aids . since 1987 , the koch institute has carried out an annual survey about aids awareness in the general public .
in 2003 , the survey found that condom usage in general was falling .
among those surveyed who had multiple sexual partners in 2003 , 78 percent used condoms , down five percent over two years .
manufacturers are even selling fewer condoms in germany .

what started as an operation for saving ski areas has turned out to be a successful environmental measure to protect glaciers from melting away .
germany 's zugspitze now spends most of the year undercover . while most people in germany are complaining about the unseasonable temperatures this summer , the cool , wet weather has been a boon to germany 's highest mountain , the zugspitze .
after a fresh dusting of snow on germany 's most famous glacier this past week , environmentalists let out a sigh of relief .
but things are n't always this cool in the icy heights of the german alps .
summers usually bring rising temperatures and glaring sunshine .
although the balmy weather may be just what the calendar calls for in the rest of the country , on the zugspitze warm days are frowned upon .
with every rise in the mercury , precious centimeters of one of germany 's few remaining glaciers melt away .
it 's estimated that global warming results in a loss of about 10 centimeters of the glacier every year .
at that rate , not much is expected to survive through the next century , says the society for environmental research in munich in its online glacier archive .
to preserve this unique environment , dedicated workers at the zugspitzbahn , the cable car operator up to the peak , have devised a giant sun shade to protect the ice on top of the 2,962 meter-high mountain .
every year for the past 10 years , they spread out about 6,000 square meters -lrb- 19,000 sq. feet -rrb- of mats and tarpaulins on the glacier 's surface .
the white material reflects sunlight and insulates against the heat , preventing further melting of the snow and ice .
keeping the glacier under wraps bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : covering up the zugspitze the canvas also helps protect the glacier from warm summer rain , " which virtually devours the snow , " says stephanie vogel of the zugspitzbahn .
vogel and her colleagues at the peak 's cable car are in favor of the giant sunshade .
although she admits it is work to cover the glacier , it is import for preserving the fragile condition on the mountain top for posterity .
originally the idea was developed to protect snow in popular ski areas , but vogel says it has moved beyond the economic aspects related to tourism and has turned out to be a successful environmental measure .
to critics she acknowledges the sun shield is an " intervention in nature . "
any attempt to save an at-risk environment implies intervention , she argues .
the tarps , she believes , are the least dramatic interference .
in other places , snow guns are used to keep mountain peaks and especially ski resorts covered in white powder .
germany , however , is against relying on artificial snow because of the environmental concerns and the cost of energy involved .
consequences of glacial melting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at 2,963 meters , the zugspitze in bavaria is germany 's highest mountain .
the zugspitze is not alone in its battle against global warming .
environmentalists say glaciers are some of the most threatened ecosystems on earth .
they function as " global thermometers " and are extremely sensitive to the world 's rising temperature .
global warming , the lack of snow in winter , hot summers as well as air pollution and acid rain are responsible for shrinking glaciers , says the society for environmental research in munich .
more than just the loss of a valuable landscape , the defrosting of the permanent glacial ice - the permafrost - causes landslides and avalanches as the rocky undersurface is revealed and erodes in the rough wind .
resources of potable water provided by glacial ice also become more scarce , the society warns on its web site .
given current rates of greenhouse gas emissions , the anti-glare shield on the zugspitze may in the end only represent a last-ditch effort to slow down the almost inevitable glacier diminution .

what started as an operation for saving ski areas has turned out to be a successful environmental measure to protect glaciers from melting away .
germany 's zugspitze now spends most of the year undercover . while most people in germany are complaining about the unseasonable temperatures this summer , the cool , wet weather has been a boon to germany 's highest mountain , the zugspitze .
after a fresh dusting of snow on germany 's most famous glacier this past week , environmentalists let out a sigh of relief .
but things are n't always this cool in the icy heights of the german alps .
summers usually bring rising temperatures and glaring sunshine .
although the balmy weather may be just what the calendar calls for in the rest of the country , on the zugspitze warm days are frowned upon .
with every rise in the mercury , precious centimeters of one of germany 's few remaining glaciers melt away .
it 's estimated that global warming results in a loss of about 10 centimeters of the glacier every year .
at that rate , not much is expected to survive through the next century , says the society for environmental research in munich in its online glacier archive .
to preserve this unique environment , dedicated workers at the zugspitzbahn , the cable car operator up to the peak , have devised a giant sun shade to protect the ice on top of the 2,962 meter-high mountain .
every year for the past 10 years , they spread out about 6,000 square meters -lrb- 19,000 sq. feet -rrb- of mats and tarpaulins on the glacier 's surface .
the white material reflects sunlight and insulates against the heat , preventing further melting of the snow and ice .
keeping the glacier under wraps bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : covering up the zugspitze the canvas also helps protect the glacier from warm summer rain , " which virtually devours the snow , " says stephanie vogel of the zugspitzbahn .
vogel and her colleagues at the peak 's cable car are in favor of the giant sunshade .
although she admits it is work to cover the glacier , it is import for preserving the fragile condition on the mountain top for posterity .
originally the idea was developed to protect snow in popular ski areas , but vogel says it has moved beyond the economic aspects related to tourism and has turned out to be a successful environmental measure .
to critics she acknowledges the sun shield is an " intervention in nature . "
any attempt to save an at-risk environment implies intervention , she argues .
the tarps , she believes , are the least dramatic interference .
in other places , snow guns are used to keep mountain peaks and especially ski resorts covered in white powder .
germany , however , is against relying on artificial snow because of the environmental concerns and the cost of energy involved .
consequences of glacial melting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at 2,963 meters , the zugspitze in bavaria is germany 's highest mountain .
the zugspitze is not alone in its battle against global warming .
environmentalists say glaciers are some of the most threatened ecosystems on earth .
they function as " global thermometers " and are extremely sensitive to the world 's rising temperature .
global warming , the lack of snow in winter , hot summers as well as air pollution and acid rain are responsible for shrinking glaciers , says the society for environmental research in munich .
more than just the loss of a valuable landscape , the defrosting of the permanent glacial ice - the permafrost - causes landslides and avalanches as the rocky undersurface is revealed and erodes in the rough wind .
resources of potable water provided by glacial ice also become more scarce , the society warns on its web site .
given current rates of greenhouse gas emissions , the anti-glare shield on the zugspitze may in the end only represent a last-ditch effort to slow down the almost inevitable glacier diminution .
" as contemporary witnesses of this rapid melting we are at least able to experience real glaciers .
it is possible our descendants wo n't see this phenomenon , " fears the society for environmental research . rieke brendel -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de historic alps postcards : a tool in documenting glacial melt armed with surveying equipment , satellite maps and historical postcards , german geologists are retracing diminishing alpine glaciers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.07.2004 britain protests eu budget plans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : budget commissioner michaele schreyer 's plans have caused anger british officials have labelled eu budget plans which would see britain 's € 4 billion rebate scrapped " unfair " after the european commission revealed the proposals for spending between 2007 and 2013 . the commission 's plans include redirecting money in the 25-member union from old members like france and spain to the new eastern and central european countries . the budget plans also include cutting britain 's budget rebate , a highly contentious issue between british officials and brussels which has heightened tensions outside and inside the commission . presenting the financial perspective , european budget commissioner michaele schreyer , together with president romano prodi , set out the eu budget plan , an ambitious blueprint for how to spend some € 1,000 billion -lrb- $ 1,238 billion -rrb- . but with three-quarters of the eu budget already committed to farming and regional policies , there is little money for innovative and forward-looking programs , especially in the new member states .
still , the most contentious part of schreyer 's plan is not the total expenditure , nor the lack of vision , but the proposed reduction of the € 4 billion rebate given to britain annually . new states would have to pay for britain the 10 new poorer members of the eu feel britain 's 20-year old rebate , which as new members they also have to finance , is unfair .
unlike in the 1980s , britain today is the second-richest eu country in terms of per capita income .
back in 1984 , margaret thatcher , then uk prime minister , when fighting for the rebate , stated : " i want my money back . "
but schreyer explained the situation is much different now than it was two decades ago .
" the sums allocated to new , poorer member states is growing and the british rebate is also growing to the burden of others , " the german commissioner said .
britain now had a " magnificent " economy and no longer needed the rebate , she added .
the british government is fighting tooth and nail against any move to scrap the rebate .
the two british commissioners , neil kinnock and chris patten , should in theory represent the greater ' european ' interest .
but even they tried to persuade romano prodi , president of the commission , to water down schreyer 's rebate plans . patten fears eu backlash in britain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirs patten fears anti-eu sentiment will be fuelled by plans .
external relations commissioner patten wants more understanding of the british position , fearing that if schreyer 's plans are adopted in full , it will not help the knife-edge situation regarding the british public 's views on european union membership . " i am deeply disappointed and concerned that the proposals will set back our ability to argue a positive european case in the uk , " he said . patten also reportedly told schreyer that the plans were " manifestly unfair " and " not the basis for debate .

some 600 workers at a mercedes plant in düsseldorf kicked off the action with an overnight demonstration by torchlight through the city streets . at daimlerchrysler 's main site in sindelfingen , near stuttgart in southern germany , around 20,00 employees answered the call to strike and stopped work for two hours earlier in the morning .
further stoppages have been staged at car and truck factories throughout the country during the course of the day , notably in berlin , bremen and hamburg , said ig metall and the employee 's council .
the carmaker employs around 160,000 people in germany and some reports suggest that as much as half the workforce could join in the protests .
" it 's war " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 600 night-shift workers at a mercedes plant in düsseldorf demonstrate in the early hours of thursday , july 15 , 2004 .
the strikes at all the german mercedes factories are a direct response to daimlerchrysler 's threats to shift production of its new mercedes c-class sedan away from sindelfingen to south africa if unions do not agree to € 500 million -lrb- $ 615 million -rrb- in personnel cost costs .
such a move could result in the loss of 6,000 jobs in sindelfingen .
ig metall slammed the threat as " blackmail " and vowed to fight the company 's plans .

in a somewhat unusual step , esser also quoted a poem by german writer joseph von eichendorff to describe his mood . " prosecutors say they used the takeover battle to make money . ex-mannesmann board see no wrong-doing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus zwickel -lrb- left -rrb- and josef ackermann esser is not the only one on trial .
with him in the dock are former chairman of the supervisory board , joachim funk , who also received a big payment , and two of the board 's members , josef ackermann , ceo of deutsche bank , and klaus zwickel , then general-secretary of the metal workers union , who are accused of not going through the proper procedures to approve the payments . ackermann has claimed from the start that the high payments involved were perfectly reasonable , and he repeated during his closing statement that " effort and success must be properly rewarded . " he said he hoped " that it will continue to be allowed to be worth the effort to fight for an increase in the value of a company . " but the case revealed to the public the amount of compensation which a very few top managers were receiving , and created considerable public outrage . german civil law requires managerial compensation to be " fair and appropriate to the social situation . " there is some debate whether esser 's € 15 million reward adheres to that . most observers expect the defendants to be let off when the court gives its verdict , expected to come on thursday next week . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de six face charges in mannesmann takeover prosecutors in düsseldorf have ended a nearly two-year investigation by filing indictments over severance packages paid in vodafone 's successful hostile takeover .

but the bad news has n't dampened us corporate investors shopping for bargains . given all the complaining in german business circles lately , it hardly seems likely foreign investors would want to dish out money in this country .
with unemployment steadily on the rise , the national budget deficit in stark violation of eu norms , economic growth squeezing by at less than two percent and employees on strike to keep 35-hour work weeks , there is n't much to encourage a positive future outlook for business .
but nobody seems to have shared the negative forecast with american private equity firms looking for a good money-making deal in germany .
us corporate investors have a decidedly different view of the german economy than many of the business leaders here do .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are all gloom and doom when they talk about the economy .
at a recent trans-atlantic business conference in stuttgart , us investors said they generally don ’ t find germany to be as bad off as many germans make it out to be .
instead , a healthy dose of american-flavored optimism was what they recommended to help get the patient back on its feet again .
instituting an emotional turn-around government officials and economic analysts across the country never tire talking about the need for germany to undergo structural economic change .
but the president of the american chamber of commerce in germany , fred irwin , said what the country really needs is an emotional turnaround .
" everyone in the media talks about needing to reform taxes and needing to reform business laws here , " he said .
" but actually nothing is going to dramatically change here if germans don ’ t decide that they ’ re willing to take a risk and that it ’ s necessary to change . "
irwin added that part of germany 's problems stem from a societal stubbornness to change , an affinity for keeping the status quo .
" it ’ s a conservative society , but all around it things are changing , " he said , pointing to germany 's neighbors in europe and markets oversees .
" we have a global market , and so where other countries are changing , germany is standing still , which is very unfortunate . "
american bargain hunters according to irwin , while germany is standing still , americans are busy looking for a good bargain .
many have been successful and have purchased good chunks of the market as corporate restructuring and streamlining within some large german conglomerates is throws up the occasional investment opportunity for big american firms .
the us private equity firm blackstone ’ s recent acquisition of the german chemicals company celanese , is one example .
and with attractive interest rates in germany , blackstone says it ’ s hungry for more takeovers .
the half-full glass why are american investors prepared to spend their money in germany , but germans apparently are not ?
walter raizner , the head of ibm deutschland , the german subsidiary of the american computer giant , pointed to differences in the business culture between the united states and germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : americans are still enthusiastic about the chance for economic recovery .
" first of all , the overall optimism in the united states , in the workforce , is much , much higher , " he said .
" i always describe it as how we look at the glass .
in germany , we always look at the glass as half-empty .
and our american friends always look at the glass as being half-full .
and i think this describes very nicely what the general mindset is , how you approach things in business but also in life . "
americans are also more pragmatic in implementing business decisions , raizner added .
" germans tend to discuss everything to the end , " he said .
" and even if you ’ ve made a decision you keep going on and discussing whether the decision was right or wrong or should we start all over again , " he added , describing the slow momentum in german business negotiations .
in contrast , the americans have a whole different attitude , according to raizner .
" they say , let ’ s move along this pass , " he said .
" if it proves to be wrong , well , we can adjust our course and come to the objective anyhow . "
adding the spice of america german corporate lawyer roderich thümmel , who works with companies on both sides of the atlantic , agrees that germany would be much better off economically if it had a dash of american business confidence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a stock trader toasts with champagne at the stock market in frankfurt , dec .
30 as the dax shows its highest level for the year at end of trading in 2003 . " we germans should be more confident in what we can do , " he stresses .
" we should become more active and we should take an active role in bringing things forward and that is what happens every day in many companies , but the perception in the general public , i think , is more negative than necessary . "
more spending needed the american chamber of commerce in germany says germans have to start spending money , rather than continuing to save it .
and the chamber ’ s president is following that advice and encouraging the company he works for , citigroup , to invest more in germany .
while most german banks are continuing to lay off staff in order to reduce costs , the us banking , insurance and investment corporation citigroup is hiring people in germany .
last year the company ’ s banking sector , citibank , created more than 350 extra positions in order to expand its network of branches .
recently , citibank announced that 200 more jobs will be created this year as part of a further expansion of services mainly in southern germany .
an american-led recovery ?
does this mean american businesses could be leading an economic recovery in germany ?
fred irwin does n't want to go that far , but he does think american businesses can show germans the path they need to take .
" we have in germany a consensus mentality society , " he said .
" and as long as you have an economic boom , a consensus society is very positive because everybody profits from it .
but when you ’ re having some difficulties , we need vision , we need leadership and we need execution . "
american businesses have the vision right now and they are the ones making things happen , irwin believes .

but the bad news has n't dampened us corporate investors shopping for bargains . given all the complaining in german business circles lately , it hardly seems likely foreign investors would want to dish out money in this country .
with unemployment steadily on the rise , the national budget deficit in stark violation of eu norms , economic growth squeezing by at less than two percent and employees on strike to keep 35-hour work weeks , there is n't much to encourage a positive future outlook for business .
but nobody seems to have shared the negative forecast with american private equity firms looking for a good money-making deal in germany .
us corporate investors have a decidedly different view of the german economy than many of the business leaders here do .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are all gloom and doom when they talk about the economy .
at a recent trans-atlantic business conference in stuttgart , us investors said they generally don ’ t find germany to be as bad off as many germans make it out to be .
instead , a healthy dose of american-flavored optimism was what they recommended to help get the patient back on its feet again .
instituting an emotional turn-around government officials and economic analysts across the country never tire talking about the need for germany to undergo structural economic change .
but the president of the american chamber of commerce in germany , fred irwin , said what the country really needs is an emotional turnaround .
" everyone in the media talks about needing to reform taxes and needing to reform business laws here , " he said .
" but actually nothing is going to dramatically change here if germans don ’ t decide that they ’ re willing to take a risk and that it ’ s necessary to change . "
irwin added that part of germany 's problems stem from a societal stubbornness to change , an affinity for keeping the status quo .
" it ’ s a conservative society , but all around it things are changing , " he said , pointing to germany 's neighbors in europe and markets oversees .
" we have a global market , and so where other countries are changing , germany is standing still , which is very unfortunate . "
american bargain hunters according to irwin , while germany is standing still , americans are busy looking for a good bargain .
many have been successful and have purchased good chunks of the market as corporate restructuring and streamlining within some large german conglomerates is throws up the occasional investment opportunity for big american firms .
the us private equity firm blackstone ’ s recent acquisition of the german chemicals company celanese , is one example .
and with attractive interest rates in germany , blackstone says it ’ s hungry for more takeovers .
the half-full glass why are american investors prepared to spend their money in germany , but germans apparently are not ?
walter raizner , the head of ibm deutschland , the german subsidiary of the american computer giant , pointed to differences in the business culture between the united states and germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : americans are still enthusiastic about the chance for economic recovery .
" first of all , the overall optimism in the united states , in the workforce , is much , much higher , " he said .
" i always describe it as how we look at the glass .
in germany , we always look at the glass as half-empty .
and our american friends always look at the glass as being half-full .
and i think this describes very nicely what the general mindset is , how you approach things in business but also in life . "
americans are also more pragmatic in implementing business decisions , raizner added .
" germans tend to discuss everything to the end , " he said .
" and even if you ’ ve made a decision you keep going on and discussing whether the decision was right or wrong or should we start all over again , " he added , describing the slow momentum in german business negotiations .
in contrast , the americans have a whole different attitude , according to raizner .
" they say , let ’ s move along this pass , " he said .
" if it proves to be wrong , well , we can adjust our course and come to the objective anyhow . "
adding the spice of america german corporate lawyer roderich thümmel , who works with companies on both sides of the atlantic , agrees that germany would be much better off economically if it had a dash of american business confidence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a stock trader toasts with champagne at the stock market in frankfurt , dec .
30 as the dax shows its highest level for the year at end of trading in 2003 . " we germans should be more confident in what we can do , " he stresses .
" we should become more active and we should take an active role in bringing things forward and that is what happens every day in many companies , but the perception in the general public , i think , is more negative than necessary . "
more spending needed the american chamber of commerce in germany says germans have to start spending money , rather than continuing to save it .
and the chamber ’ s president is following that advice and encouraging the company he works for , citigroup , to invest more in germany .
while most german banks are continuing to lay off staff in order to reduce costs , the us banking , insurance and investment corporation citigroup is hiring people in germany .
last year the company ’ s banking sector , citibank , created more than 350 extra positions in order to expand its network of branches .
recently , citibank announced that 200 more jobs will be created this year as part of a further expansion of services mainly in southern germany .
an american-led recovery ?
does this mean american businesses could be leading an economic recovery in germany ?
fred irwin does n't want to go that far , but he does think american businesses can show germans the path they need to take .
" we have in germany a consensus mentality society , " he said .
" and as long as you have an economic boom , a consensus society is very positive because everybody profits from it .
but when you ’ re having some difficulties , we need vision , we need leadership and we need execution . "
american businesses have the vision right now and they are the ones making things happen , irwin believes .
so while german chancellor gerhard schröder continues to blame the country 's economic woes on sluggish world economic conditions , and analysts bemoan investment conditions and economic confidence within germany , american corporations are busy investing in what is still europe ’ s biggest economy . geoff rodoreda send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany still attractive to u.s. industry germans are fond of moaning about their country 's business environment , but many us firms here have a more positive outlook .

" in germany , the constitution forbids the referendum and we will respect the constitution , " the chancellor said . just a day earlier , french president jacques chirac announced he would let france vote on the eu charter , a move that is considered risky despite opinion polls showing a majority of french citizens backing the constitution . spain , portugal , denmark , ireland and luxembourg have also said they will hold referendums on the constitution .
" what the others do is the decision of the respective national governments , " schröder said when pressed on the issue . after nearly two years of wrangling , european union leaders agreed to the first-ever constitution for the bloc at a historic summit in brussels last month . the document , which is designed to streamline the complex web of institutions in an expanded eu and prevent decision-making deadlock among the bloc 's 25 members , must be ratified by all eu member states in the next two years before it comes into full force . german-british ties in good form schröder , one of the staunchest opponents of the us-led war to oust saddam hussein in march 2003 , met blair a day after an official inquiry lambasted the british government 's intelligence on iraq 's weapons of mass destruction as " seriously flawed " and " unreliable " , but absolved blair of responsibility for the failings . the results , which provided some relief to a beleaguered blair , came in the middle of what has been labeled one of blair 's toughest weeks in office since coming to power in 1997 . on thursday , schröder sought to present a united front with blair and stressed that german-british relations had not been strained by their disagreement last month on nominating a successor to romano prodi , the eu commission president . schröder said discussions with blair were as friendly as ever and pointed out that eu leaders had finally agreed on portuguese leader jose manuel barroso for the post .
" we are now going to collectively see that he is a success , " schröder said . " germany a brilliant investment location " after meeting with blair , schröder went on to speak with british business representatives and investors informing them on the economic reforms underway in germany . the german government launched a drive last year to pass the " agenda 2010 " reform package , intended to overhaul germany 's creaking social welfare systems and drive down unemployment , balance the budget and jumpstart the spluttering economy . " germany is a brilliant investment location that should not shy away from any global comparison and does not , " schröder said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report clears blair , assails british intelligence an official british inquiry wednesday lambasted the state of pre-war intelligence on iraq 's weapons of mass destruction but cleared prime minister tony blair of responsibility for the failings .

still , the most contentious part of schreyer 's plan is not the total expenditure , nor the lack of vision , but the proposed reduction of the € 4 billion rebate given to britain annually . new states would have to pay for britain the 10 new poorer members of the eu feel britain 's 20-year old rebate , which as new members they also have to finance , is unfair .
unlike in the 1980s , britain today is the second-richest eu country in terms of per capita income .
back in 1984 , margaret thatcher , then uk prime minister , when fighting for the rebate , stated : " i want my money back . "
but schreyer explained the situation is much different now than it was two decades ago .
" the sums allocated to new , poorer member states is growing and the british rebate is also growing to the burden of others , " the german commissioner said .
britain now had a " magnificent " economy and no longer needed the rebate , she added .
the british government is fighting tooth and nail against any move to scrap the rebate .
the two british commissioners , neil kinnock and chris patten , should in theory represent the greater ' european ' interest .
but even they tried to persuade romano prodi , president of the commission , to water down schreyer 's rebate plans . patten fears eu backlash in britain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirs patten fears anti-eu sentiment will be fuelled by plans .
external relations commissioner patten wants more understanding of the british position , fearing that if schreyer 's plans are adopted in full , it will not help the knife-edge situation regarding the british public 's views on european union membership . " i am deeply disappointed and concerned that the proposals will set back our ability to argue a positive european case in the uk , " he said . patten also reportedly told schreyer that the plans were " manifestly unfair " and " not the basis for debate .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.07.2004 young germans face rising hiv rates großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the early 90s , aggresive hiv campaigns were the norm after falling for several years , rates of hiv infection , particularly among young gay men , are rising again .
risky behavior is increasing as a new generation appears willing to close its eyes to the dangers of hiv / aids . at 20 years old , many young adults are busy getting their college degrees or beginning their work lives , often excited at the broad expanse of possibilities in front of them .
however , for 20-year-old andreas , a gay berlin resident , a dark cloud has formed on his horizon ; he found out recently he has been infected with hiv , the virus that causes aids . andreas , who asked that his real name not be used , is having difficulty coming to terms with a diagnosis that has changed his future irrevocably .
while hiv is no longer the death sentence it once was , andreas will have to begin a demanding drug regime to keep aids at bay - and there are no guarantees .
the disease still kills 600 people in germany every year . " there is too little information out there , " he told dw-world .
" i never thought it could happen to me . " " new dynamic " to epidemic for some time in the mid to late 1990s , researchers and health care professionals working in the areas of hiv / aids could take comfort in the statistics : the number of hiv infections was falling annually ; the message of safer sex seemed to have gotten out . but a report out by the robert koch institute , a federal organization that researches disease control and prevention , warns that the epidemic of hiv in germany could acquire a " new dynamic " since the number of infections since 2001 has been rising steadily . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researching hiv in the lab - there 's medicine , but no cure three years ago , the institute reported 1,470 hiv infections in germany ; in 2002 , that number rose to 1,716 ; last year , 1,958 people contracted the virus .
that is a 33 percent rise in three years .
the trend toward rising infection rates also affects heterosexuals , half of those infected were men who had sex with men . experts say the reason behind the rise in infections is an increase in unsafe sex and a swing in attitudes toward the dangers of aids . since 1987 , the koch institute has carried out an annual survey about aids awareness in the general public .
in 2003 , the survey found that condom usage in general was falling .
among those surveyed who had multiple sexual partners in 2003 , 78 percent used condoms , down five percent over two years .
manufacturers are even selling fewer condoms in germany .
young people seem especially susceptible to letting their guard down in the heat of the moment . " the general tendency among young people today is to not see fully the risks involved in risky sexual behavior , " rolf gindorf , founder and past president of dgss , a sexuality research center in düsseldorf , told dw-world . " older gay men , say around 40 and up , are aware of the danger because they came of age at a time when death rates were high and aids information was very visible and always on people 's minds , " he said . "
but younger people today , they do n't have that experience .
knowing that the disease can be treated tends to make them carefree when it comes to sex . " the result is a generation gap that has developed between older and younger gay men .
protected sex has become second nature to older gay men , but among today 's youth , while they generally known the rules of safer sex , they often do n't follow them in sexual situations , according to birgit krenz of berlin aids hilfe , an organization that provides counseling and care for people with the disease . the results are becoming clear .
in 2001 , less than 1 percent of the hiv-infected people counseled at berlin aids hilfe were under the age of 20 .
by 2003 , that number had risen to 5 percent . less information after the deluge of aids information up until the late 1990s , according to dr. marita völker-albert of the federal center for health education -lrb- bzga -rrb- , there has been a strong decline over the past five years in public discussion of the disease . " priorities change , and issues like bse or sept .
11 have largely driven aids out of the media and the public mind , " she told dw-world .
" it 's harder to reach people now . " public money made available for education has also fallen off .
in 1987 , when the bzga began its aids awareness campaign , it had an annual budget of 50 million marks -lrb- $ 31.4 million -rrb- .
today , the center 's public awareness campaign has just over a third of that to spend - € 9 million -lrb- $ 11 million -rrb- a year . although he said he knew how to protect himself , andreas still partially blames the lack of a strong public message and vigorous discussion about aids for his infection . " it did n't do much good for me to see some celebrity up there talking about wearing condoms or something , " he said .
" i needed something blatant that could shock me into making the right decisions . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de researchers warn about aids in eastern europe of the 280,000 new aids infections in europe during the past year , more than 200,000 were reported in areas formerly belonging to the soviet bloc .
the figures are triggering alarm bells among researchers .

although fischer acknowledged the country had made progress since the 1989 tiananmen square massacre , he also expressed misgivings over beijing 's use of he death penalty , administrative imprisonment for dissidents and " re-education programs . "
" we note the progress made but also have major concerns about human rights in china , " fischer said after meeting with his chinese counterpart , li zhaoxing .
the chinese foreign minister dismissed the criticism at a press conference , saying his country did not need " lessons from the west . "
china has a huge population of more than 1.3 billion people , li told reporters , " but china has great respect for each individual 's human rights . "
more freedom for tibet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer with chinese foreign minister li zhaoxing li -lrb- photo -rrb- thanked fischer for german support of the " one china " policy against granting independence to taiwan , which chancellor gerhard schröder endorsed on his trip to beijing late last year .
at the same time , however , he rejected fischer 's calls for granting more religious and political freedom to tibet .
the west 's concerns about tibet should not undermine chinese authority in the region , li replied after fischer appealed to him to engage in peaceful dialogue with the dalai lama , the buddhist leader of the tibetan government-in-exile .
the chinese foreign minister accused the dalai lama of " subversive " activity that threatened to undermine chinese sovereignty in tibet .
" that is unacceptable for us , " he said .

" in germany , the constitution forbids the referendum and we will respect the constitution , " the chancellor said . just a day earlier , french president jacques chirac announced he would let france vote on the eu charter , a move that is considered risky despite opinion polls showing a majority of french citizens backing the constitution . spain , portugal , denmark , ireland and luxembourg have also said they will hold referendums on the constitution .
" what the others do is the decision of the respective national governments , " schröder said when pressed on the issue . after nearly two years of wrangling , european union leaders agreed to the first-ever constitution for the bloc at a historic summit in brussels last month . the document , which is designed to streamline the complex web of institutions in an expanded eu and prevent decision-making deadlock among the bloc 's 25 members , must be ratified by all eu member states in the next two years before it comes into full force . german-british ties in good form schröder , one of the staunchest opponents of the us-led war to oust saddam hussein in march 2003 , met blair a day after an official inquiry lambasted the british government 's intelligence on iraq 's weapons of mass destruction as " seriously flawed " and " unreliable " , but absolved blair of responsibility for the failings . the results , which provided some relief to a beleaguered blair , came in the middle of what has been labeled one of blair 's toughest weeks in office since coming to power in 1997 . on thursday , schröder sought to present a united front with blair and stressed that german-british relations had not been strained by their disagreement last month on nominating a successor to romano prodi , the eu commission president . schröder said discussions with blair were as friendly as ever and pointed out that eu leaders had finally agreed on portuguese leader jose manuel barroso for the post .
" we are now going to collectively see that he is a success , " schröder said . " germany a brilliant investment location " after meeting with blair , schröder went on to speak with british business representatives and investors informing them on the economic reforms underway in germany . the german government launched a drive last year to pass the " agenda 2010 " reform package , intended to overhaul germany 's creaking social welfare systems and drive down unemployment , balance the budget and jumpstart the spluttering economy . " germany is a brilliant investment location that should not shy away from any global comparison and does not , " schröder said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report clears blair , assails british intelligence an official british inquiry wednesday lambasted the state of pre-war intelligence on iraq 's weapons of mass destruction but cleared prime minister tony blair of responsibility for the failings .

but the bad news has n't dampened us corporate investors shopping for bargains . given all the complaining in german business circles lately , it hardly seems likely foreign investors would want to dish out money in this country .
with unemployment steadily on the rise , the national budget deficit in stark violation of eu norms , economic growth squeezing by at less than two percent and employees on strike to keep 35-hour work weeks , there is n't much to encourage a positive future outlook for business .
but nobody seems to have shared the negative forecast with american private equity firms looking for a good money-making deal in germany .
us corporate investors have a decidedly different view of the german economy than many of the business leaders here do .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are all gloom and doom when they talk about the economy .
at a recent trans-atlantic business conference in stuttgart , us investors said they generally don ’ t find germany to be as bad off as many germans make it out to be .
instead , a healthy dose of american-flavored optimism was what they recommended to help get the patient back on its feet again .
instituting an emotional turn-around government officials and economic analysts across the country never tire talking about the need for germany to undergo structural economic change .
but the president of the american chamber of commerce in germany , fred irwin , said what the country really needs is an emotional turnaround .
" everyone in the media talks about needing to reform taxes and needing to reform business laws here , " he said .
" but actually nothing is going to dramatically change here if germans don ’ t decide that they ’ re willing to take a risk and that it ’ s necessary to change . "
irwin added that part of germany 's problems stem from a societal stubbornness to change , an affinity for keeping the status quo .
" it ’ s a conservative society , but all around it things are changing , " he said , pointing to germany 's neighbors in europe and markets oversees .
" we have a global market , and so where other countries are changing , germany is standing still , which is very unfortunate . "
american bargain hunters according to irwin , while germany is standing still , americans are busy looking for a good bargain .
many have been successful and have purchased good chunks of the market as corporate restructuring and streamlining within some large german conglomerates is throws up the occasional investment opportunity for big american firms .
the us private equity firm blackstone ’ s recent acquisition of the german chemicals company celanese , is one example .
and with attractive interest rates in germany , blackstone says it ’ s hungry for more takeovers .
the half-full glass why are american investors prepared to spend their money in germany , but germans apparently are not ?
walter raizner , the head of ibm deutschland , the german subsidiary of the american computer giant , pointed to differences in the business culture between the united states and germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : americans are still enthusiastic about the chance for economic recovery .
" first of all , the overall optimism in the united states , in the workforce , is much , much higher , " he said .
" i always describe it as how we look at the glass .
in germany , we always look at the glass as half-empty .
and our american friends always look at the glass as being half-full .
and i think this describes very nicely what the general mindset is , how you approach things in business but also in life . "
americans are also more pragmatic in implementing business decisions , raizner added .
" germans tend to discuss everything to the end , " he said .
" and even if you ’ ve made a decision you keep going on and discussing whether the decision was right or wrong or should we start all over again , " he added , describing the slow momentum in german business negotiations .
in contrast , the americans have a whole different attitude , according to raizner .
" they say , let ’ s move along this pass , " he said .
" if it proves to be wrong , well , we can adjust our course and come to the objective anyhow . "
adding the spice of america german corporate lawyer roderich thümmel , who works with companies on both sides of the atlantic , agrees that germany would be much better off economically if it had a dash of american business confidence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a stock trader toasts with champagne at the stock market in frankfurt , dec .
30 as the dax shows its highest level for the year at end of trading in 2003 . " we germans should be more confident in what we can do , " he stresses .
" we should become more active and we should take an active role in bringing things forward and that is what happens every day in many companies , but the perception in the general public , i think , is more negative than necessary . "
more spending needed the american chamber of commerce in germany says germans have to start spending money , rather than continuing to save it .
and the chamber ’ s president is following that advice and encouraging the company he works for , citigroup , to invest more in germany .
while most german banks are continuing to lay off staff in order to reduce costs , the us banking , insurance and investment corporation citigroup is hiring people in germany .
last year the company ’ s banking sector , citibank , created more than 350 extra positions in order to expand its network of branches .
recently , citibank announced that 200 more jobs will be created this year as part of a further expansion of services mainly in southern germany .
an american-led recovery ?
does this mean american businesses could be leading an economic recovery in germany ?
fred irwin does n't want to go that far , but he does think american businesses can show germans the path they need to take .
" we have in germany a consensus mentality society , " he said .
" and as long as you have an economic boom , a consensus society is very positive because everybody profits from it .
but when you ’ re having some difficulties , we need vision , we need leadership and we need execution . "
american businesses have the vision right now and they are the ones making things happen , irwin believes .

sounds sad ?
it is , but if psychologists are to be believed , it 's just a temporary phenomenon .
reading simply has too many advantages , they say .
if only you can find the time for it . the book industry in germany is lamenting the " general reluctance of consumers to loosen their purse strings . "
the united states is threatening to become a nation of non-readers .
according to one study , not even every second adult there reads novels , letalone poetry . it 's a dire situation in need of remedy . ups and downs but before succumbing to despair , it might be worthwhile listening to thomas anz , professor of psychology at the university of marburg who 's researched the psychology of reading and authored a book called " literature and enjoyment - the ups and downs of reading . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman reads a book anz has concluded that reading is the " joy of being blown away " , a kind of trance situation , from which a person can switch back to reality anytime . reading , says anz , is the hunger for tension , for laughter , the horrible and the shocking .
in other words , it 's the joy of emotions . but reading is also the joy of discovering intellectual links and references .
" reading is like a game that the reader shares with the author , " says anz .
even the writing of a book is closely related to the pleasure of playing a game , he adds . " much like other games , one has to train the " reading " game , " says the psychologist and adds that the better one trains , the smoother the reading experience is .
" many give up in the training phase and do n't reach the real pleasure level of reading . " linked to social approval just because fewer people are taking time to read does n't automatically mean there 's a crisis brewing . the significance of reading to a society has historically been linked to social approval .
in the 18th century europe , reading was considered a highly immoral addiction .
at the time , only about 10 percent of all europeans could read .

but the bad news has n't dampened us corporate investors shopping for bargains . given all the complaining in german business circles lately , it hardly seems likely foreign investors would want to dish out money in this country .
with unemployment steadily on the rise , the national budget deficit in stark violation of eu norms , economic growth squeezing by at less than two percent and employees on strike to keep 35-hour work weeks , there is n't much to encourage a positive future outlook for business .
but nobody seems to have shared the negative forecast with american private equity firms looking for a good money-making deal in germany .
us corporate investors have a decidedly different view of the german economy than many of the business leaders here do .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are all gloom and doom when they talk about the economy .
at a recent trans-atlantic business conference in stuttgart , us investors said they generally don ’ t find germany to be as bad off as many germans make it out to be .
instead , a healthy dose of american-flavored optimism was what they recommended to help get the patient back on its feet again .
instituting an emotional turn-around government officials and economic analysts across the country never tire talking about the need for germany to undergo structural economic change .
but the president of the american chamber of commerce in germany , fred irwin , said what the country really needs is an emotional turnaround .
" everyone in the media talks about needing to reform taxes and needing to reform business laws here , " he said .
" but actually nothing is going to dramatically change here if germans don ’ t decide that they ’ re willing to take a risk and that it ’ s necessary to change . "
irwin added that part of germany 's problems stem from a societal stubbornness to change , an affinity for keeping the status quo .
" it ’ s a conservative society , but all around it things are changing , " he said , pointing to germany 's neighbors in europe and markets oversees .
" we have a global market , and so where other countries are changing , germany is standing still , which is very unfortunate . "
american bargain hunters according to irwin , while germany is standing still , americans are busy looking for a good bargain .
many have been successful and have purchased good chunks of the market as corporate restructuring and streamlining within some large german conglomerates is throws up the occasional investment opportunity for big american firms .
the us private equity firm blackstone ’ s recent acquisition of the german chemicals company celanese , is one example .
and with attractive interest rates in germany , blackstone says it ’ s hungry for more takeovers .
the half-full glass why are american investors prepared to spend their money in germany , but germans apparently are not ?
walter raizner , the head of ibm deutschland , the german subsidiary of the american computer giant , pointed to differences in the business culture between the united states and germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : americans are still enthusiastic about the chance for economic recovery .
" first of all , the overall optimism in the united states , in the workforce , is much , much higher , " he said .
" i always describe it as how we look at the glass .
in germany , we always look at the glass as half-empty .
and our american friends always look at the glass as being half-full .
and i think this describes very nicely what the general mindset is , how you approach things in business but also in life . "
americans are also more pragmatic in implementing business decisions , raizner added .
" germans tend to discuss everything to the end , " he said .
" and even if you ’ ve made a decision you keep going on and discussing whether the decision was right or wrong or should we start all over again , " he added , describing the slow momentum in german business negotiations .
in contrast , the americans have a whole different attitude , according to raizner .
" they say , let ’ s move along this pass , " he said .
" if it proves to be wrong , well , we can adjust our course and come to the objective anyhow . "
adding the spice of america german corporate lawyer roderich thümmel , who works with companies on both sides of the atlantic , agrees that germany would be much better off economically if it had a dash of american business confidence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a stock trader toasts with champagne at the stock market in frankfurt , dec .
30 as the dax shows its highest level for the year at end of trading in 2003 . " we germans should be more confident in what we can do , " he stresses .
" we should become more active and we should take an active role in bringing things forward and that is what happens every day in many companies , but the perception in the general public , i think , is more negative than necessary . "
more spending needed the american chamber of commerce in germany says germans have to start spending money , rather than continuing to save it .
and the chamber ’ s president is following that advice and encouraging the company he works for , citigroup , to invest more in germany .
while most german banks are continuing to lay off staff in order to reduce costs , the us banking , insurance and investment corporation citigroup is hiring people in germany .
last year the company ’ s banking sector , citibank , created more than 350 extra positions in order to expand its network of branches .
recently , citibank announced that 200 more jobs will be created this year as part of a further expansion of services mainly in southern germany .
an american-led recovery ?
does this mean american businesses could be leading an economic recovery in germany ?
fred irwin does n't want to go that far , but he does think american businesses can show germans the path they need to take .
" we have in germany a consensus mentality society , " he said .
" and as long as you have an economic boom , a consensus society is very positive because everybody profits from it .
but when you ’ re having some difficulties , we need vision , we need leadership and we need execution . "
american businesses have the vision right now and they are the ones making things happen , irwin believes .

what started as an operation for saving ski areas has turned out to be a successful environmental measure to protect glaciers from melting away .
germany 's zugspitze now spends most of the year undercover . while most people in germany are complaining about the unseasonable temperatures this summer , the cool , wet weather has been a boon to germany 's highest mountain , the zugspitze .
after a fresh dusting of snow on germany 's most famous glacier this past week , environmentalists let out a sigh of relief .
but things are n't always this cool in the icy heights of the german alps .
summers usually bring rising temperatures and glaring sunshine .
although the balmy weather may be just what the calendar calls for in the rest of the country , on the zugspitze warm days are frowned upon .
with every rise in the mercury , precious centimeters of one of germany 's few remaining glaciers melt away .
it 's estimated that global warming results in a loss of about 10 centimeters of the glacier every year .
at that rate , not much is expected to survive through the next century , says the society for environmental research in munich in its online glacier archive .
to preserve this unique environment , dedicated workers at the zugspitzbahn , the cable car operator up to the peak , have devised a giant sun shade to protect the ice on top of the 2,962 meter-high mountain .
every year for the past 10 years , they spread out about 6,000 square meters -lrb- 19,000 sq. feet -rrb- of mats and tarpaulins on the glacier 's surface .
the white material reflects sunlight and insulates against the heat , preventing further melting of the snow and ice .
keeping the glacier under wraps bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : covering up the zugspitze the canvas also helps protect the glacier from warm summer rain , " which virtually devours the snow , " says stephanie vogel of the zugspitzbahn .
vogel and her colleagues at the peak 's cable car are in favor of the giant sunshade .
although she admits it is work to cover the glacier , it is import for preserving the fragile condition on the mountain top for posterity .
originally the idea was developed to protect snow in popular ski areas , but vogel says it has moved beyond the economic aspects related to tourism and has turned out to be a successful environmental measure .
to critics she acknowledges the sun shield is an " intervention in nature . "
any attempt to save an at-risk environment implies intervention , she argues .
the tarps , she believes , are the least dramatic interference .
in other places , snow guns are used to keep mountain peaks and especially ski resorts covered in white powder .
germany , however , is against relying on artificial snow because of the environmental concerns and the cost of energy involved .

they function as " global thermometers " and are extremely sensitive to the world 's rising temperature .

resources of potable water provided by glacial ice also become more scarce , the society warns on its web site .

what started as an operation for saving ski areas has turned out to be a successful environmental measure to protect glaciers from melting away .
germany 's zugspitze now spends most of the year undercover . while most people in germany are complaining about the unseasonable temperatures this summer , the cool , wet weather has been a boon to germany 's highest mountain , the zugspitze .
after a fresh dusting of snow on germany 's most famous glacier this past week , environmentalists let out a sigh of relief .
but things are n't always this cool in the icy heights of the german alps .
summers usually bring rising temperatures and glaring sunshine .
although the balmy weather may be just what the calendar calls for in the rest of the country , on the zugspitze warm days are frowned upon .
with every rise in the mercury , precious centimeters of one of germany 's few remaining glaciers melt away .
it 's estimated that global warming results in a loss of about 10 centimeters of the glacier every year .
at that rate , not much is expected to survive through the next century , says the society for environmental research in munich in its online glacier archive .
to preserve this unique environment , dedicated workers at the zugspitzbahn , the cable car operator up to the peak , have devised a giant sun shade to protect the ice on top of the 2,962 meter-high mountain .
every year for the past 10 years , they spread out about 6,000 square meters -lrb- 19,000 sq. feet -rrb- of mats and tarpaulins on the glacier 's surface .
the white material reflects sunlight and insulates against the heat , preventing further melting of the snow and ice .
keeping the glacier under wraps bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : covering up the zugspitze the canvas also helps protect the glacier from warm summer rain , " which virtually devours the snow , " says stephanie vogel of the zugspitzbahn .
vogel and her colleagues at the peak 's cable car are in favor of the giant sunshade .
although she admits it is work to cover the glacier , it is import for preserving the fragile condition on the mountain top for posterity .
originally the idea was developed to protect snow in popular ski areas , but vogel says it has moved beyond the economic aspects related to tourism and has turned out to be a successful environmental measure .
to critics she acknowledges the sun shield is an " intervention in nature . "
any attempt to save an at-risk environment implies intervention , she argues .
the tarps , she believes , are the least dramatic interference .
in other places , snow guns are used to keep mountain peaks and especially ski resorts covered in white powder .
germany , however , is against relying on artificial snow because of the environmental concerns and the cost of energy involved .
consequences of glacial melting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at 2,963 meters , the zugspitze in bavaria is germany 's highest mountain .
the zugspitze is not alone in its battle against global warming .
environmentalists say glaciers are some of the most threatened ecosystems on earth .
they function as " global thermometers " and are extremely sensitive to the world 's rising temperature .
global warming , the lack of snow in winter , hot summers as well as air pollution and acid rain are responsible for shrinking glaciers , says the society for environmental research in munich .
more than just the loss of a valuable landscape , the defrosting of the permanent glacial ice - the permafrost - causes landslides and avalanches as the rocky undersurface is revealed and erodes in the rough wind .
resources of potable water provided by glacial ice also become more scarce , the society warns on its web site .
given current rates of greenhouse gas emissions , the anti-glare shield on the zugspitze may in the end only represent a last-ditch effort to slow down the almost inevitable glacier diminution .

what started as an operation for saving ski areas has turned out to be a successful environmental measure to protect glaciers from melting away .
germany 's zugspitze now spends most of the year undercover . while most people in germany are complaining about the unseasonable temperatures this summer , the cool , wet weather has been a boon to germany 's highest mountain , the zugspitze .
after a fresh dusting of snow on germany 's most famous glacier this past week , environmentalists let out a sigh of relief .
but things are n't always this cool in the icy heights of the german alps .
summers usually bring rising temperatures and glaring sunshine .
although the balmy weather may be just what the calendar calls for in the rest of the country , on the zugspitze warm days are frowned upon .
with every rise in the mercury , precious centimeters of one of germany 's few remaining glaciers melt away .
it 's estimated that global warming results in a loss of about 10 centimeters of the glacier every year .
at that rate , not much is expected to survive through the next century , says the society for environmental research in munich in its online glacier archive .
to preserve this unique environment , dedicated workers at the zugspitzbahn , the cable car operator up to the peak , have devised a giant sun shade to protect the ice on top of the 2,962 meter-high mountain .
every year for the past 10 years , they spread out about 6,000 square meters -lrb- 19,000 sq. feet -rrb- of mats and tarpaulins on the glacier 's surface .
the white material reflects sunlight and insulates against the heat , preventing further melting of the snow and ice .
keeping the glacier under wraps bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : covering up the zugspitze the canvas also helps protect the glacier from warm summer rain , " which virtually devours the snow , " says stephanie vogel of the zugspitzbahn .
vogel and her colleagues at the peak 's cable car are in favor of the giant sunshade .
although she admits it is work to cover the glacier , it is import for preserving the fragile condition on the mountain top for posterity .
originally the idea was developed to protect snow in popular ski areas , but vogel says it has moved beyond the economic aspects related to tourism and has turned out to be a successful environmental measure .
to critics she acknowledges the sun shield is an " intervention in nature . "
any attempt to save an at-risk environment implies intervention , she argues .
the tarps , she believes , are the least dramatic interference .
in other places , snow guns are used to keep mountain peaks and especially ski resorts covered in white powder .

risky behavior is increasing as a new generation appears willing to close its eyes to the dangers of hiv / aids . at 20 years old , many young adults are busy getting their college degrees or beginning their work lives , often excited at the broad expanse of possibilities in front of them .
however , for 20-year-old andreas , a gay berlin resident , a dark cloud has formed on his horizon ; he found out recently he has been infected with hiv , the virus that causes aids . andreas , who asked that his real name not be used , is having difficulty coming to terms with a diagnosis that has changed his future irrevocably .
while hiv is no longer the death sentence it once was , andreas will have to begin a demanding drug regime to keep aids at bay - and there are no guarantees .
the disease still kills 600 people in germany every year . " there is too little information out there , " he told dw-world .
" i never thought it could happen to me . " " new dynamic " to epidemic for some time in the mid to late 1990s , researchers and health care professionals working in the areas of hiv / aids could take comfort in the statistics : the number of hiv infections was falling annually ; the message of safer sex seemed to have gotten out . but a report out by the robert koch institute , a federal organization that researches disease control and prevention , warns that the epidemic of hiv in germany could acquire a " new dynamic " since the number of infections since 2001 has been rising steadily . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researching hiv in the lab - there 's medicine , but no cure three years ago , the institute reported 1,470 hiv infections in germany ; in 2002 , that number rose to 1,716 ; last year , 1,958 people contracted the virus .
that is a 33 percent rise in three years .
the trend toward rising infection rates also affects heterosexuals , half of those infected were men who had sex with men . experts say the reason behind the rise in infections is an increase in unsafe sex and a swing in attitudes toward the dangers of aids . since 1987 , the koch institute has carried out an annual survey about aids awareness in the general public .
in 2003 , the survey found that condom usage in general was falling .
among those surveyed who had multiple sexual partners in 2003 , 78 percent used condoms , down five percent over two years .
manufacturers are even selling fewer condoms in germany .
young people seem especially susceptible to letting their guard down in the heat of the moment . " the general tendency among young people today is to not see fully the risks involved in risky sexual behavior , " rolf gindorf , founder and past president of dgss , a sexuality research center in düsseldorf , told dw-world . " older gay men , say around 40 and up , are aware of the danger because they came of age at a time when death rates were high and aids information was very visible and always on people 's minds , " he said . "
but younger people today , they do n't have that experience .
knowing that the disease can be treated tends to make them carefree when it comes to sex . " the result is a generation gap that has developed between older and younger gay men .
protected sex has become second nature to older gay men , but among today 's youth , while they generally known the rules of safer sex , they often do n't follow them in sexual situations , according to birgit krenz of berlin aids hilfe , an organization that provides counseling and care for people with the disease . the results are becoming clear .
in 2001 , less than 1 percent of the hiv-infected people counseled at berlin aids hilfe were under the age of 20 .
by 2003 , that number had risen to 5 percent . less information after the deluge of aids information up until the late 1990s , according to dr. marita völker-albert of the federal center for health education -lrb- bzga -rrb- , there has been a strong decline over the past five years in public discussion of the disease . " priorities change , and issues like bse or sept .
11 have largely driven aids out of the media and the public mind , " she told dw-world .
" it 's harder to reach people now . " public money made available for education has also fallen off .
in 1987 , when the bzga began its aids awareness campaign , it had an annual budget of 50 million marks -lrb- $ 31.4 million -rrb- .
today , the center 's public awareness campaign has just over a third of that to spend - € 9 million -lrb- $ 11 million -rrb- a year . although he said he knew how to protect himself , andreas still partially blames the lack of a strong public message and vigorous discussion about aids for his infection . " it did n't do much good for me to see some celebrity up there talking about wearing condoms or something , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.07.2004 young germans face rising hiv rates großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the early 90s , aggresive hiv campaigns were the norm after falling for several years , rates of hiv infection , particularly among young gay men , are rising again .
risky behavior is increasing as a new generation appears willing to close its eyes to the dangers of hiv / aids . at 20 years old , many young adults are busy getting their college degrees or beginning their work lives , often excited at the broad expanse of possibilities in front of them .
however , for 20-year-old andreas , a gay berlin resident , a dark cloud has formed on his horizon ; he found out recently he has been infected with hiv , the virus that causes aids . andreas , who asked that his real name not be used , is having difficulty coming to terms with a diagnosis that has changed his future irrevocably .
while hiv is no longer the death sentence it once was , andreas will have to begin a demanding drug regime to keep aids at bay - and there are no guarantees .
the disease still kills 600 people in germany every year . " there is too little information out there , " he told dw-world .
" i never thought it could happen to me . " " new dynamic " to epidemic for some time in the mid to late 1990s , researchers and health care professionals working in the areas of hiv / aids could take comfort in the statistics : the number of hiv infections was falling annually ; the message of safer sex seemed to have gotten out . but a report out by the robert koch institute , a federal organization that researches disease control and prevention , warns that the epidemic of hiv in germany could acquire a " new dynamic " since the number of infections since 2001 has been rising steadily . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researching hiv in the lab - there 's medicine , but no cure three years ago , the institute reported 1,470 hiv infections in germany ; in 2002 , that number rose to 1,716 ; last year , 1,958 people contracted the virus .
that is a 33 percent rise in three years .
the trend toward rising infection rates also affects heterosexuals , half of those infected were men who had sex with men . experts say the reason behind the rise in infections is an increase in unsafe sex and a swing in attitudes toward the dangers of aids . since 1987 , the koch institute has carried out an annual survey about aids awareness in the general public .
in 2003 , the survey found that condom usage in general was falling .
among those surveyed who had multiple sexual partners in 2003 , 78 percent used condoms , down five percent over two years .
manufacturers are even selling fewer condoms in germany .
young people seem especially susceptible to letting their guard down in the heat of the moment . " the general tendency among young people today is to not see fully the risks involved in risky sexual behavior , " rolf gindorf , founder and past president of dgss , a sexuality research center in düsseldorf , told dw-world . " older gay men , say around 40 and up , are aware of the danger because they came of age at a time when death rates were high and aids information was very visible and always on people 's minds , " he said . "
but younger people today , they do n't have that experience .
knowing that the disease can be treated tends to make them carefree when it comes to sex . " the result is a generation gap that has developed between older and younger gay men .
protected sex has become second nature to older gay men , but among today 's youth , while they generally known the rules of safer sex , they often do n't follow them in sexual situations , according to birgit krenz of berlin aids hilfe , an organization that provides counseling and care for people with the disease . the results are becoming clear .
in 2001 , less than 1 percent of the hiv-infected people counseled at berlin aids hilfe were under the age of 20 .
by 2003 , that number had risen to 5 percent . less information after the deluge of aids information up until the late 1990s , according to dr. marita völker-albert of the federal center for health education -lrb- bzga -rrb- , there has been a strong decline over the past five years in public discussion of the disease . " priorities change , and issues like bse or sept .
11 have largely driven aids out of the media and the public mind , " she told dw-world .
" it 's harder to reach people now . " public money made available for education has also fallen off .
in 1987 , when the bzga began its aids awareness campaign , it had an annual budget of 50 million marks -lrb- $ 31.4 million -rrb- .
today , the center 's public awareness campaign has just over a third of that to spend - € 9 million -lrb- $ 11 million -rrb- a year . although he said he knew how to protect himself , andreas still partially blames the lack of a strong public message and vigorous discussion about aids for his infection . " it did n't do much good for me to see some celebrity up there talking about wearing condoms or something , " he said .
" i needed something blatant that could shock me into making the right decisions . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de researchers warn about aids in eastern europe of the 280,000 new aids infections in europe during the past year , more than 200,000 were reported in areas formerly belonging to the soviet bloc .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.07.2004 young germans face rising hiv rates großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the early 90s , aggresive hiv campaigns were the norm after falling for several years , rates of hiv infection , particularly among young gay men , are rising again .
risky behavior is increasing as a new generation appears willing to close its eyes to the dangers of hiv / aids . at 20 years old , many young adults are busy getting their college degrees or beginning their work lives , often excited at the broad expanse of possibilities in front of them .
however , for 20-year-old andreas , a gay berlin resident , a dark cloud has formed on his horizon ; he found out recently he has been infected with hiv , the virus that causes aids . andreas , who asked that his real name not be used , is having difficulty coming to terms with a diagnosis that has changed his future irrevocably .
while hiv is no longer the death sentence it once was , andreas will have to begin a demanding drug regime to keep aids at bay - and there are no guarantees .
the disease still kills 600 people in germany every year . " there is too little information out there , " he told dw-world .
" i never thought it could happen to me . " " new dynamic " to epidemic for some time in the mid to late 1990s , researchers and health care professionals working in the areas of hiv / aids could take comfort in the statistics : the number of hiv infections was falling annually ; the message of safer sex seemed to have gotten out . but a report out by the robert koch institute , a federal organization that researches disease control and prevention , warns that the epidemic of hiv in germany could acquire a " new dynamic " since the number of infections since 2001 has been rising steadily . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researching hiv in the lab - there 's medicine , but no cure three years ago , the institute reported 1,470 hiv infections in germany ; in 2002 , that number rose to 1,716 ; last year , 1,958 people contracted the virus .
that is a 33 percent rise in three years .
the trend toward rising infection rates also affects heterosexuals , half of those infected were men who had sex with men . experts say the reason behind the rise in infections is an increase in unsafe sex and a swing in attitudes toward the dangers of aids . since 1987 , the koch institute has carried out an annual survey about aids awareness in the general public .
in 2003 , the survey found that condom usage in general was falling .
among those surveyed who had multiple sexual partners in 2003 , 78 percent used condoms , down five percent over two years .
manufacturers are even selling fewer condoms in germany .
young people seem especially susceptible to letting their guard down in the heat of the moment . " the general tendency among young people today is to not see fully the risks involved in risky sexual behavior , " rolf gindorf , founder and past president of dgss , a sexuality research center in düsseldorf , told dw-world . " older gay men , say around 40 and up , are aware of the danger because they came of age at a time when death rates were high and aids information was very visible and always on people 's minds , " he said . "
but younger people today , they do n't have that experience .
knowing that the disease can be treated tends to make them carefree when it comes to sex . " the result is a generation gap that has developed between older and younger gay men .
protected sex has become second nature to older gay men , but among today 's youth , while they generally known the rules of safer sex , they often do n't follow them in sexual situations , according to birgit krenz of berlin aids hilfe , an organization that provides counseling and care for people with the disease . the results are becoming clear .
in 2001 , less than 1 percent of the hiv-infected people counseled at berlin aids hilfe were under the age of 20 .
by 2003 , that number had risen to 5 percent . less information after the deluge of aids information up until the late 1990s , according to dr. marita völker-albert of the federal center for health education -lrb- bzga -rrb- , there has been a strong decline over the past five years in public discussion of the disease . " priorities change , and issues like bse or sept .
11 have largely driven aids out of the media and the public mind , " she told dw-world .
" it 's harder to reach people now . " public money made available for education has also fallen off .
in 1987 , when the bzga began its aids awareness campaign , it had an annual budget of 50 million marks -lrb- $ 31.4 million -rrb- .
today , the center 's public awareness campaign has just over a third of that to spend - € 9 million -lrb- $ 11 million -rrb- a year . although he said he knew how to protect himself , andreas still partially blames the lack of a strong public message and vigorous discussion about aids for his infection . " it did n't do much good for me to see some celebrity up there talking about wearing condoms or something , " he said .
" i needed something blatant that could shock me into making the right decisions . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de researchers warn about aids in eastern europe of the 280,000 new aids infections in europe during the past year , more than 200,000 were reported in areas formerly belonging to the soviet bloc .

further stoppages have been staged at car and truck factories throughout the country during the course of the day , notably in berlin , bremen and hamburg , said ig metall and the employee 's council .

some 600 workers at a mercedes plant in düsseldorf kicked off the action with an overnight demonstration by torchlight through the city streets . at daimlerchrysler 's main site in sindelfingen , near stuttgart in southern germany , around 20,00 employees answered the call to strike and stopped work for two hours earlier in the morning .
further stoppages have been staged at car and truck factories throughout the country during the course of the day , notably in berlin , bremen and hamburg , said ig metall and the employee 's council .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.07.2004 -pipe- 10:00 utc new eu students eye uk and ireland a report to be released thursday by the british universities and colleges admissions service -lrb- ucas -rrb- shows that applications of students from the new eu countries to uk universities have shot up this year by almost 140 percent .
since 10 countries joined the eu on may 1 this year , applicants from these countries fall under the category " eu students " - who pay the same limited tuition fees as their british counterparts .
overseas students generally pay much higher rates .
however , the relatively high costs of studying in the uk still seems to scare off many " new " europeans , as their number of applications remained relatively small - 3,174 out of a total number of 66,275 applications from abroad .

but nobody seems to have shared the negative forecast with american private equity firms looking for a good money-making deal in germany .
us corporate investors have a decidedly different view of the german economy than many of the business leaders here do .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are all gloom and doom when they talk about the economy .
at a recent trans-atlantic business conference in stuttgart , us investors said they generally don ’ t find germany to be as bad off as many germans make it out to be .
instead , a healthy dose of american-flavored optimism was what they recommended to help get the patient back on its feet again .
instituting an emotional turn-around government officials and economic analysts across the country never tire talking about the need for germany to undergo structural economic change .
but the president of the american chamber of commerce in germany , fred irwin , said what the country really needs is an emotional turnaround .
" everyone in the media talks about needing to reform taxes and needing to reform business laws here , " he said .
" but actually nothing is going to dramatically change here if germans don ’ t decide that they ’ re willing to take a risk and that it ’ s necessary to change . "
irwin added that part of germany 's problems stem from a societal stubbornness to change , an affinity for keeping the status quo .
" it ’ s a conservative society , but all around it things are changing , " he said , pointing to germany 's neighbors in europe and markets oversees .
" we have a global market , and so where other countries are changing , germany is standing still , which is very unfortunate . "
american bargain hunters according to irwin , while germany is standing still , americans are busy looking for a good bargain .
many have been successful and have purchased good chunks of the market as corporate restructuring and streamlining within some large german conglomerates is throws up the occasional investment opportunity for big american firms .
the us private equity firm blackstone ’ s recent acquisition of the german chemicals company celanese , is one example .
and with attractive interest rates in germany , blackstone says it ’ s hungry for more takeovers .
the half-full glass why are american investors prepared to spend their money in germany , but germans apparently are not ?
walter raizner , the head of ibm deutschland , the german subsidiary of the american computer giant , pointed to differences in the business culture between the united states and germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : americans are still enthusiastic about the chance for economic recovery .
" first of all , the overall optimism in the united states , in the workforce , is much , much higher , " he said .
" i always describe it as how we look at the glass .
in germany , we always look at the glass as half-empty .
and our american friends always look at the glass as being half-full .
and i think this describes very nicely what the general mindset is , how you approach things in business but also in life . "
americans are also more pragmatic in implementing business decisions , raizner added .
" germans tend to discuss everything to the end , " he said .
" and even if you ’ ve made a decision you keep going on and discussing whether the decision was right or wrong or should we start all over again , " he added , describing the slow momentum in german business negotiations .
in contrast , the americans have a whole different attitude , according to raizner .
" they say , let ’ s move along this pass , " he said .
" if it proves to be wrong , well , we can adjust our course and come to the objective anyhow . "
adding the spice of america german corporate lawyer roderich thümmel , who works with companies on both sides of the atlantic , agrees that germany would be much better off economically if it had a dash of american business confidence .

30 as the dax shows its highest level for the year at end of trading in 2003 . " we germans should be more confident in what we can do , " he stresses .
" we should become more active and we should take an active role in bringing things forward and that is what happens every day in many companies , but the perception in the general public , i think , is more negative than necessary . "
more spending needed the american chamber of commerce in germany says germans have to start spending money , rather than continuing to save it .
and the chamber ’ s president is following that advice and encouraging the company he works for , citigroup , to invest more in germany .
while most german banks are continuing to lay off staff in order to reduce costs , the us banking , insurance and investment corporation citigroup is hiring people in germany .
last year the company ’ s banking sector , citibank , created more than 350 extra positions in order to expand its network of branches .
recently , citibank announced that 200 more jobs will be created this year as part of a further expansion of services mainly in southern germany .
an american-led recovery ?
does this mean american businesses could be leading an economic recovery in germany ?
fred irwin does n't want to go that far , but he does think american businesses can show germans the path they need to take .
" we have in germany a consensus mentality society , " he said .
" and as long as you have an economic boom , a consensus society is very positive because everybody profits from it .
but when you ’ re having some difficulties , we need vision , we need leadership and we need execution . "
american businesses have the vision right now and they are the ones making things happen , irwin believes .

but the bad news has n't dampened us corporate investors shopping for bargains . given all the complaining in german business circles lately , it hardly seems likely foreign investors would want to dish out money in this country .
with unemployment steadily on the rise , the national budget deficit in stark violation of eu norms , economic growth squeezing by at less than two percent and employees on strike to keep 35-hour work weeks , there is n't much to encourage a positive future outlook for business .
but nobody seems to have shared the negative forecast with american private equity firms looking for a good money-making deal in germany .
us corporate investors have a decidedly different view of the german economy than many of the business leaders here do .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are all gloom and doom when they talk about the economy .
at a recent trans-atlantic business conference in stuttgart , us investors said they generally don ’ t find germany to be as bad off as many germans make it out to be .
instead , a healthy dose of american-flavored optimism was what they recommended to help get the patient back on its feet again .
instituting an emotional turn-around government officials and economic analysts across the country never tire talking about the need for germany to undergo structural economic change .
but the president of the american chamber of commerce in germany , fred irwin , said what the country really needs is an emotional turnaround .
" everyone in the media talks about needing to reform taxes and needing to reform business laws here , " he said .
" but actually nothing is going to dramatically change here if germans don ’ t decide that they ’ re willing to take a risk and that it ’ s necessary to change . "
irwin added that part of germany 's problems stem from a societal stubbornness to change , an affinity for keeping the status quo .
" it ’ s a conservative society , but all around it things are changing , " he said , pointing to germany 's neighbors in europe and markets oversees .
" we have a global market , and so where other countries are changing , germany is standing still , which is very unfortunate . "
american bargain hunters according to irwin , while germany is standing still , americans are busy looking for a good bargain .
many have been successful and have purchased good chunks of the market as corporate restructuring and streamlining within some large german conglomerates is throws up the occasional investment opportunity for big american firms .
the us private equity firm blackstone ’ s recent acquisition of the german chemicals company celanese , is one example .
and with attractive interest rates in germany , blackstone says it ’ s hungry for more takeovers .
the half-full glass why are american investors prepared to spend their money in germany , but germans apparently are not ?
walter raizner , the head of ibm deutschland , the german subsidiary of the american computer giant , pointed to differences in the business culture between the united states and germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : americans are still enthusiastic about the chance for economic recovery .
" first of all , the overall optimism in the united states , in the workforce , is much , much higher , " he said .
" i always describe it as how we look at the glass .
in germany , we always look at the glass as half-empty .
and our american friends always look at the glass as being half-full .
and i think this describes very nicely what the general mindset is , how you approach things in business but also in life . "
americans are also more pragmatic in implementing business decisions , raizner added .
" germans tend to discuss everything to the end , " he said .
" and even if you ’ ve made a decision you keep going on and discussing whether the decision was right or wrong or should we start all over again , " he added , describing the slow momentum in german business negotiations .
in contrast , the americans have a whole different attitude , according to raizner .
" they say , let ’ s move along this pass , " he said .

in its " economic freedom of the world " report , the liberal foundation placed 95 countries ahead of germany , which came in second-to-last place .
the biggest problem area identified in the report was germany 's extremely over-regulated labor market .
the " hesitant steps toward reform taken by the government " have n't yet led to any increased economic freedom , the report said .
the economic freedom index was developed by over 100 leading scholars , and is produced by over 60 institutes around the world .
the report examines the connection between economic freedom , investment , and economic growth by measuring the institutions essential for ensuring the rule of law , property rights , and freedom to trade , among other indicators . more briefs 14.07.2004 -pipe- no new savings measures , eichel promises 14.07.2004 -pipe- germany 's infineon expands in portugal 14.07.2004 -pipe- tabacco expenditures sink in second quarter 13.07.2004 -pipe- germany may sell more russian debt bonds 13.07.2004 -pipe- travel agencies sue lufthansa 13.07.2004 -pipe- sap acquires a2i 12.07.2004 -pipe- fewer corporate bankruptcies in germany 12.07.2004 -pipe- tchibo takes on mobile phone market radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

" in germany , the constitution forbids the referendum and we will respect the constitution , " the chancellor said . just a day earlier , french president jacques chirac announced he would let france vote on the eu charter , a move that is considered risky despite opinion polls showing a majority of french citizens backing the constitution . spain , portugal , denmark , ireland and luxembourg have also said they will hold referendums on the constitution .
" what the others do is the decision of the respective national governments , " schröder said when pressed on the issue . after nearly two years of wrangling , european union leaders agreed to the first-ever constitution for the bloc at a historic summit in brussels last month . the document , which is designed to streamline the complex web of institutions in an expanded eu and prevent decision-making deadlock among the bloc 's 25 members , must be ratified by all eu member states in the next two years before it comes into full force . german-british ties in good form schröder , one of the staunchest opponents of the us-led war to oust saddam hussein in march 2003 , met blair a day after an official inquiry lambasted the british government 's intelligence on iraq 's weapons of mass destruction as " seriously flawed " and " unreliable " , but absolved blair of responsibility for the failings . the results , which provided some relief to a beleaguered blair , came in the middle of what has been labeled one of blair 's toughest weeks in office since coming to power in 1997 . on thursday , schröder sought to present a united front with blair and stressed that german-british relations had not been strained by their disagreement last month on nominating a successor to romano prodi , the eu commission president . schröder said discussions with blair were as friendly as ever and pointed out that eu leaders had finally agreed on portuguese leader jose manuel barroso for the post .
" we are now going to collectively see that he is a success , " schröder said . " germany a brilliant investment location " after meeting with blair , schröder went on to speak with british business representatives and investors informing them on the economic reforms underway in germany . the german government launched a drive last year to pass the " agenda 2010 " reform package , intended to overhaul germany 's creaking social welfare systems and drive down unemployment , balance the budget and jumpstart the spluttering economy . " germany is a brilliant investment location that should not shy away from any global comparison and does not , " schröder said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report clears blair , assails british intelligence an official british inquiry wednesday lambasted the state of pre-war intelligence on iraq 's weapons of mass destruction but cleared prime minister tony blair of responsibility for the failings .

in a somewhat unusual step , esser also quoted a poem by german writer joseph von eichendorff to describe his mood . " prosecutors say they used the takeover battle to make money . ex-mannesmann board see no wrong-doing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus zwickel -lrb- left -rrb- and josef ackermann esser is not the only one on trial .
with him in the dock are former chairman of the supervisory board , joachim funk , who also received a big payment , and two of the board 's members , josef ackermann , ceo of deutsche bank , and klaus zwickel , then general-secretary of the metal workers union , who are accused of not going through the proper procedures to approve the payments . ackermann has claimed from the start that the high payments involved were perfectly reasonable , and he repeated during his closing statement that " effort and success must be properly rewarded . " he said he hoped " that it will continue to be allowed to be worth the effort to fight for an increase in the value of a company . " but the case revealed to the public the amount of compensation which a very few top managers were receiving , and created considerable public outrage . german civil law requires managerial compensation to be " fair and appropriate to the social situation . " there is some debate whether esser 's € 15 million reward adheres to that . most observers expect the defendants to be let off when the court gives its verdict , expected to come on thursday next week . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de six face charges in mannesmann takeover prosecutors in düsseldorf have ended a nearly two-year investigation by filing indictments over severance packages paid in vodafone 's successful hostile takeover .

still , the most contentious part of schreyer 's plan is not the total expenditure , nor the lack of vision , but the proposed reduction of the € 4 billion rebate given to britain annually . new states would have to pay for britain the 10 new poorer members of the eu feel britain 's 20-year old rebate , which as new members they also have to finance , is unfair .
unlike in the 1980s , britain today is the second-richest eu country in terms of per capita income .
back in 1984 , margaret thatcher , then uk prime minister , when fighting for the rebate , stated : " i want my money back . "
but schreyer explained the situation is much different now than it was two decades ago .
" the sums allocated to new , poorer member states is growing and the british rebate is also growing to the burden of others , " the german commissioner said .

although fischer acknowledged the country had made progress since the 1989 tiananmen square massacre , he also expressed misgivings over beijing 's use of he death penalty , administrative imprisonment for dissidents and " re-education programs . "
" we note the progress made but also have major concerns about human rights in china , " fischer said after meeting with his chinese counterpart , li zhaoxing .
the chinese foreign minister dismissed the criticism at a press conference , saying his country did not need " lessons from the west . "
china has a huge population of more than 1.3 billion people , li told reporters , " but china has great respect for each individual 's human rights . "
more freedom for tibet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer with chinese foreign minister li zhaoxing li -lrb- photo -rrb- thanked fischer for german support of the " one china " policy against granting independence to taiwan , which chancellor gerhard schröder endorsed on his trip to beijing late last year .
at the same time , however , he rejected fischer 's calls for granting more religious and political freedom to tibet .
the west 's concerns about tibet should not undermine chinese authority in the region , li replied after fischer appealed to him to engage in peaceful dialogue with the dalai lama , the buddhist leader of the tibetan government-in-exile .
the chinese foreign minister accused the dalai lama of " subversive " activity that threatened to undermine chinese sovereignty in tibet .
" that is unacceptable for us , " he said .
common ground after exchanging sharp barbs on human rights , the two ministers moved on to more friendly ground and stressed common goals for their countries .
germany is china 's biggest trading partner in the european union , and the two countries work closely together on the u.n. security council , li stressed at the press conference .
fischer echoed this view saying the two countries had worked together in promoting greater " multilateralism " as opposed to " unilateralism " on global issues such as the recent iraq war .
china , which is one of five permanent members on the security council , said it backed a larger role for germany at the united nations including berlin 's bid for a permanent seat on the influential council .
currently , germany holds one of 10 rotating seats , but fischer 's five-country tour through asia is intended to drum up support for a reform of the council 's make-up later this year . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de different worlds , same goal german efforts to gain support for a permanent seat at a reformed un security council found resonance on wednesday when foreign minister fischer visited india , south asia 's giant aspirant to a similar place .

still , the most contentious part of schreyer 's plan is not the total expenditure , nor the lack of vision , but the proposed reduction of the € 4 billion rebate given to britain annually . new states would have to pay for britain the 10 new poorer members of the eu feel britain 's 20-year old rebate , which as new members they also have to finance , is unfair .
unlike in the 1980s , britain today is the second-richest eu country in terms of per capita income .
back in 1984 , margaret thatcher , then uk prime minister , when fighting for the rebate , stated : " i want my money back . "
but schreyer explained the situation is much different now than it was two decades ago .
" the sums allocated to new , poorer member states is growing and the british rebate is also growing to the burden of others , " the german commissioner said .
britain now had a " magnificent " economy and no longer needed the rebate , she added .
the british government is fighting tooth and nail against any move to scrap the rebate .

in a somewhat unusual step , esser also quoted a poem by german writer joseph von eichendorff to describe his mood . " prosecutors say they used the takeover battle to make money . ex-mannesmann board see no wrong-doing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus zwickel -lrb- left -rrb- and josef ackermann esser is not the only one on trial .
with him in the dock are former chairman of the supervisory board , joachim funk , who also received a big payment , and two of the board 's members , josef ackermann , ceo of deutsche bank , and klaus zwickel , then general-secretary of the metal workers union , who are accused of not going through the proper procedures to approve the payments . ackermann has claimed from the start that the high payments involved were perfectly reasonable , and he repeated during his closing statement that " effort and success must be properly rewarded . " he said he hoped " that it will continue to be allowed to be worth the effort to fight for an increase in the value of a company . " but the case revealed to the public the amount of compensation which a very few top managers were receiving , and created considerable public outrage . german civil law requires managerial compensation to be " fair and appropriate to the social situation . " there is some debate whether esser 's € 15 million reward adheres to that . most observers expect the defendants to be let off when the court gives its verdict , expected to come on thursday next week . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de six face charges in mannesmann takeover prosecutors in düsseldorf have ended a nearly two-year investigation by filing indictments over severance packages paid in vodafone 's successful hostile takeover .

although fischer acknowledged the country had made progress since the 1989 tiananmen square massacre , he also expressed misgivings over beijing 's use of he death penalty , administrative imprisonment for dissidents and " re-education programs . "
" we note the progress made but also have major concerns about human rights in china , " fischer said after meeting with his chinese counterpart , li zhaoxing .
the chinese foreign minister dismissed the criticism at a press conference , saying his country did not need " lessons from the west . "
china has a huge population of more than 1.3 billion people , li told reporters , " but china has great respect for each individual 's human rights . "
more freedom for tibet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer with chinese foreign minister li zhaoxing li -lrb- photo -rrb- thanked fischer for german support of the " one china " policy against granting independence to taiwan , which chancellor gerhard schröder endorsed on his trip to beijing late last year .
at the same time , however , he rejected fischer 's calls for granting more religious and political freedom to tibet .
the west 's concerns about tibet should not undermine chinese authority in the region , li replied after fischer appealed to him to engage in peaceful dialogue with the dalai lama , the buddhist leader of the tibetan government-in-exile .
the chinese foreign minister accused the dalai lama of " subversive " activity that threatened to undermine chinese sovereignty in tibet .
" that is unacceptable for us , " he said .
common ground after exchanging sharp barbs on human rights , the two ministers moved on to more friendly ground and stressed common goals for their countries .
germany is china 's biggest trading partner in the european union , and the two countries work closely together on the u.n. security council , li stressed at the press conference .
fischer echoed this view saying the two countries had worked together in promoting greater " multilateralism " as opposed to " unilateralism " on global issues such as the recent iraq war .
china , which is one of five permanent members on the security council , said it backed a larger role for germany at the united nations including berlin 's bid for a permanent seat on the influential council .
currently , germany holds one of 10 rotating seats , but fischer 's five-country tour through asia is intended to drum up support for a reform of the council 's make-up later this year . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de different worlds , same goal german efforts to gain support for a permanent seat at a reformed un security council found resonance on wednesday when foreign minister fischer visited india , south asia 's giant aspirant to a similar place .

in a somewhat unusual step , esser also quoted a poem by german writer joseph von eichendorff to describe his mood . " prosecutors say they used the takeover battle to make money . ex-mannesmann board see no wrong-doing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus zwickel -lrb- left -rrb- and josef ackermann esser is not the only one on trial .
with him in the dock are former chairman of the supervisory board , joachim funk , who also received a big payment , and two of the board 's members , josef ackermann , ceo of deutsche bank , and klaus zwickel , then general-secretary of the metal workers union , who are accused of not going through the proper procedures to approve the payments . ackermann has claimed from the start that the high payments involved were perfectly reasonable , and he repeated during his closing statement that " effort and success must be properly rewarded . " he said he hoped " that it will continue to be allowed to be worth the effort to fight for an increase in the value of a company . " but the case revealed to the public the amount of compensation which a very few top managers were receiving , and created considerable public outrage . german civil law requires managerial compensation to be " fair and appropriate to the social situation . " there is some debate whether esser 's € 15 million reward adheres to that . most observers expect the defendants to be let off when the court gives its verdict , expected to come on thursday next week . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de six face charges in mannesmann takeover prosecutors in düsseldorf have ended a nearly two-year investigation by filing indictments over severance packages paid in vodafone 's successful hostile takeover .

what started as an operation for saving ski areas has turned out to be a successful environmental measure to protect glaciers from melting away .
germany 's zugspitze now spends most of the year undercover . while most people in germany are complaining about the unseasonable temperatures this summer , the cool , wet weather has been a boon to germany 's highest mountain , the zugspitze .
after a fresh dusting of snow on germany 's most famous glacier this past week , environmentalists let out a sigh of relief .
but things are n't always this cool in the icy heights of the german alps .
summers usually bring rising temperatures and glaring sunshine .
although the balmy weather may be just what the calendar calls for in the rest of the country , on the zugspitze warm days are frowned upon .
with every rise in the mercury , precious centimeters of one of germany 's few remaining glaciers melt away .
it 's estimated that global warming results in a loss of about 10 centimeters of the glacier every year .
at that rate , not much is expected to survive through the next century , says the society for environmental research in munich in its online glacier archive .
to preserve this unique environment , dedicated workers at the zugspitzbahn , the cable car operator up to the peak , have devised a giant sun shade to protect the ice on top of the 2,962 meter-high mountain .
every year for the past 10 years , they spread out about 6,000 square meters -lrb- 19,000 sq. feet -rrb- of mats and tarpaulins on the glacier 's surface .
the white material reflects sunlight and insulates against the heat , preventing further melting of the snow and ice .
keeping the glacier under wraps bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : covering up the zugspitze the canvas also helps protect the glacier from warm summer rain , " which virtually devours the snow , " says stephanie vogel of the zugspitzbahn .
vogel and her colleagues at the peak 's cable car are in favor of the giant sunshade .
although she admits it is work to cover the glacier , it is import for preserving the fragile condition on the mountain top for posterity .
originally the idea was developed to protect snow in popular ski areas , but vogel says it has moved beyond the economic aspects related to tourism and has turned out to be a successful environmental measure .
to critics she acknowledges the sun shield is an " intervention in nature . "
any attempt to save an at-risk environment implies intervention , she argues .
the tarps , she believes , are the least dramatic interference .
in other places , snow guns are used to keep mountain peaks and especially ski resorts covered in white powder .
germany , however , is against relying on artificial snow because of the environmental concerns and the cost of energy involved .
consequences of glacial melting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at 2,963 meters , the zugspitze in bavaria is germany 's highest mountain .
the zugspitze is not alone in its battle against global warming .
environmentalists say glaciers are some of the most threatened ecosystems on earth .
they function as " global thermometers " and are extremely sensitive to the world 's rising temperature .
global warming , the lack of snow in winter , hot summers as well as air pollution and acid rain are responsible for shrinking glaciers , says the society for environmental research in munich .
more than just the loss of a valuable landscape , the defrosting of the permanent glacial ice - the permafrost - causes landslides and avalanches as the rocky undersurface is revealed and erodes in the rough wind .
resources of potable water provided by glacial ice also become more scarce , the society warns on its web site .
given current rates of greenhouse gas emissions , the anti-glare shield on the zugspitze may in the end only represent a last-ditch effort to slow down the almost inevitable glacier diminution .

given current rates of greenhouse gas emissions , the anti-glare shield on the zugspitze may in the end only represent a last-ditch effort to slow down the almost inevitable glacier diminution .

still , the most contentious part of schreyer 's plan is not the total expenditure , nor the lack of vision , but the proposed reduction of the € 4 billion rebate given to britain annually . new states would have to pay for britain the 10 new poorer members of the eu feel britain 's 20-year old rebate , which as new members they also have to finance , is unfair .
unlike in the 1980s , britain today is the second-richest eu country in terms of per capita income .
back in 1984 , margaret thatcher , then uk prime minister , when fighting for the rebate , stated : " i want my money back . "
but schreyer explained the situation is much different now than it was two decades ago .
" the sums allocated to new , poorer member states is growing and the british rebate is also growing to the burden of others , " the german commissioner said .
britain now had a " magnificent " economy and no longer needed the rebate , she added .
the british government is fighting tooth and nail against any move to scrap the rebate .
the two british commissioners , neil kinnock and chris patten , should in theory represent the greater ' european ' interest .
but even they tried to persuade romano prodi , president of the commission , to water down schreyer 's rebate plans . patten fears eu backlash in britain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirs patten fears anti-eu sentiment will be fuelled by plans .
external relations commissioner patten wants more understanding of the british position , fearing that if schreyer 's plans are adopted in full , it will not help the knife-edge situation regarding the british public 's views on european union membership . " i am deeply disappointed and concerned that the proposals will set back our ability to argue a positive european case in the uk , " he said . patten also reportedly told schreyer that the plans were " manifestly unfair " and " not the basis for debate .

" in germany , the constitution forbids the referendum and we will respect the constitution , " the chancellor said . just a day earlier , french president jacques chirac announced he would let france vote on the eu charter , a move that is considered risky despite opinion polls showing a majority of french citizens backing the constitution . spain , portugal , denmark , ireland and luxembourg have also said they will hold referendums on the constitution .
" what the others do is the decision of the respective national governments , " schröder said when pressed on the issue . after nearly two years of wrangling , european union leaders agreed to the first-ever constitution for the bloc at a historic summit in brussels last month . the document , which is designed to streamline the complex web of institutions in an expanded eu and prevent decision-making deadlock among the bloc 's 25 members , must be ratified by all eu member states in the next two years before it comes into full force . german-british ties in good form schröder , one of the staunchest opponents of the us-led war to oust saddam hussein in march 2003 , met blair a day after an official inquiry lambasted the british government 's intelligence on iraq 's weapons of mass destruction as " seriously flawed " and " unreliable " , but absolved blair of responsibility for the failings . the results , which provided some relief to a beleaguered blair , came in the middle of what has been labeled one of blair 's toughest weeks in office since coming to power in 1997 . on thursday , schröder sought to present a united front with blair and stressed that german-british relations had not been strained by their disagreement last month on nominating a successor to romano prodi , the eu commission president . schröder said discussions with blair were as friendly as ever and pointed out that eu leaders had finally agreed on portuguese leader jose manuel barroso for the post .
" we are now going to collectively see that he is a success , " schröder said . " germany a brilliant investment location " after meeting with blair , schröder went on to speak with british business representatives and investors informing them on the economic reforms underway in germany . the german government launched a drive last year to pass the " agenda 2010 " reform package , intended to overhaul germany 's creaking social welfare systems and drive down unemployment , balance the budget and jumpstart the spluttering economy .

some 600 workers at a mercedes plant in düsseldorf kicked off the action with an overnight demonstration by torchlight through the city streets . at daimlerchrysler 's main site in sindelfingen , near stuttgart in southern germany , around 20,00 employees answered the call to strike and stopped work for two hours earlier in the morning .
further stoppages have been staged at car and truck factories throughout the country during the course of the day , notably in berlin , bremen and hamburg , said ig metall and the employee 's council .
the carmaker employs around 160,000 people in germany and some reports suggest that as much as half the workforce could join in the protests .
" it 's war " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 600 night-shift workers at a mercedes plant in düsseldorf demonstrate in the early hours of thursday , july 15 , 2004 .
the strikes at all the german mercedes factories are a direct response to daimlerchrysler 's threats to shift production of its new mercedes c-class sedan away from sindelfingen to south africa if unions do not agree to € 500 million -lrb- $ 615 million -rrb- in personnel cost costs .
such a move could result in the loss of 6,000 jobs in sindelfingen .
ig metall slammed the threat as " blackmail " and vowed to fight the company 's plans .
protestors in sindelfingen , a factory which employs close to 30,000 people , rallied around the union and displayed signs crying out , " it 's war . "
the head of the employee 's council in sindelfingen , erich klemm , said the union was willing to offer pay reductions up to € 180 million , but not management 's " outrageous " demands for half a billion in reductions .
a climate of fear daimlerchrysler has also threatened to move some jobs from sindelfingen to bremen , where production costs are lower , and to change contracts to eliminate extra pay for late shifts and five-minute breaks on every hour , effectively leading to an increase of the work week without more pay .
" such proposals make me sick , " said klemm , who vowed that all the mercedes factories would stick together in a show of solidarity .
the president of germany 's parliament , wolfgang thierse , lashed out at daimlerchrysler management for " creating a climate of fear . "
" it 's repulsive to exert pressure on employees by making ultimatums , " he told the daily tagesspiegel on thursday . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de industry 's upper hand at the negotiating table siemens two weeks ago , daimlerchrysler this week .

some 600 workers at a mercedes plant in düsseldorf kicked off the action with an overnight demonstration by torchlight through the city streets . at daimlerchrysler 's main site in sindelfingen , near stuttgart in southern germany , around 20,00 employees answered the call to strike and stopped work for two hours earlier in the morning .
further stoppages have been staged at car and truck factories throughout the country during the course of the day , notably in berlin , bremen and hamburg , said ig metall and the employee 's council .

such a move could result in the loss of 6,000 jobs in sindelfingen .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.07.2004 young germans face rising hiv rates großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the early 90s , aggresive hiv campaigns were the norm after falling for several years , rates of hiv infection , particularly among young gay men , are rising again .
risky behavior is increasing as a new generation appears willing to close its eyes to the dangers of hiv / aids . at 20 years old , many young adults are busy getting their college degrees or beginning their work lives , often excited at the broad expanse of possibilities in front of them .
however , for 20-year-old andreas , a gay berlin resident , a dark cloud has formed on his horizon ; he found out recently he has been infected with hiv , the virus that causes aids . andreas , who asked that his real name not be used , is having difficulty coming to terms with a diagnosis that has changed his future irrevocably .
while hiv is no longer the death sentence it once was , andreas will have to begin a demanding drug regime to keep aids at bay - and there are no guarantees .
the disease still kills 600 people in germany every year . " there is too little information out there , " he told dw-world .
" i never thought it could happen to me . " " new dynamic " to epidemic for some time in the mid to late 1990s , researchers and health care professionals working in the areas of hiv / aids could take comfort in the statistics : the number of hiv infections was falling annually ; the message of safer sex seemed to have gotten out . but a report out by the robert koch institute , a federal organization that researches disease control and prevention , warns that the epidemic of hiv in germany could acquire a " new dynamic " since the number of infections since 2001 has been rising steadily . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researching hiv in the lab - there 's medicine , but no cure three years ago , the institute reported 1,470 hiv infections in germany ; in 2002 , that number rose to 1,716 ; last year , 1,958 people contracted the virus .
that is a 33 percent rise in three years .
the trend toward rising infection rates also affects heterosexuals , half of those infected were men who had sex with men . experts say the reason behind the rise in infections is an increase in unsafe sex and a swing in attitudes toward the dangers of aids . since 1987 , the koch institute has carried out an annual survey about aids awareness in the general public .
in 2003 , the survey found that condom usage in general was falling .
among those surveyed who had multiple sexual partners in 2003 , 78 percent used condoms , down five percent over two years .
manufacturers are even selling fewer condoms in germany .
young people seem especially susceptible to letting their guard down in the heat of the moment . " the general tendency among young people today is to not see fully the risks involved in risky sexual behavior , " rolf gindorf , founder and past president of dgss , a sexuality research center in düsseldorf , told dw-world . " older gay men , say around 40 and up , are aware of the danger because they came of age at a time when death rates were high and aids information was very visible and always on people 's minds , " he said . "
but younger people today , they do n't have that experience .
knowing that the disease can be treated tends to make them carefree when it comes to sex . " the result is a generation gap that has developed between older and younger gay men .
protected sex has become second nature to older gay men , but among today 's youth , while they generally known the rules of safer sex , they often do n't follow them in sexual situations , according to birgit krenz of berlin aids hilfe , an organization that provides counseling and care for people with the disease . the results are becoming clear .
in 2001 , less than 1 percent of the hiv-infected people counseled at berlin aids hilfe were under the age of 20 .
by 2003 , that number had risen to 5 percent . less information after the deluge of aids information up until the late 1990s , according to dr. marita völker-albert of the federal center for health education -lrb- bzga -rrb- , there has been a strong decline over the past five years in public discussion of the disease . " priorities change , and issues like bse or sept .
11 have largely driven aids out of the media and the public mind , " she told dw-world .
" it 's harder to reach people now . " public money made available for education has also fallen off .
in 1987 , when the bzga began its aids awareness campaign , it had an annual budget of 50 million marks -lrb- $ 31.4 million -rrb- .
today , the center 's public awareness campaign has just over a third of that to spend - € 9 million -lrb- $ 11 million -rrb- a year . although he said he knew how to protect himself , andreas still partially blames the lack of a strong public message and vigorous discussion about aids for his infection . " it did n't do much good for me to see some celebrity up there talking about wearing condoms or something , " he said .
" i needed something blatant that could shock me into making the right decisions . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de researchers warn about aids in eastern europe of the 280,000 new aids infections in europe during the past year , more than 200,000 were reported in areas formerly belonging to the soviet bloc .
the figures are triggering alarm bells among researchers .

sounds sad ?
it is , but if psychologists are to be believed , it 's just a temporary phenomenon .
reading simply has too many advantages , they say .
if only you can find the time for it . the book industry in germany is lamenting the " general reluctance of consumers to loosen their purse strings . "
the united states is threatening to become a nation of non-readers .
according to one study , not even every second adult there reads novels , letalone poetry . it 's a dire situation in need of remedy . ups and downs but before succumbing to despair , it might be worthwhile listening to thomas anz , professor of psychology at the university of marburg who 's researched the psychology of reading and authored a book called " literature and enjoyment - the ups and downs of reading . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman reads a book anz has concluded that reading is the " joy of being blown away " , a kind of trance situation , from which a person can switch back to reality anytime . reading , says anz , is the hunger for tension , for laughter , the horrible and the shocking .
in other words , it 's the joy of emotions . but reading is also the joy of discovering intellectual links and references .
" reading is like a game that the reader shares with the author , " says anz .
even the writing of a book is closely related to the pleasure of playing a game , he adds . " much like other games , one has to train the " reading " game , " says the psychologist and adds that the better one trains , the smoother the reading experience is .
" many give up in the training phase and do n't reach the real pleasure level of reading . " linked to social approval just because fewer people are taking time to read does n't automatically mean there 's a crisis brewing . the significance of reading to a society has historically been linked to social approval .
in the 18th century europe , reading was considered a highly immoral addiction .
at the time , only about 10 percent of all europeans could read .
knowledge and culture was largely transmitted through the theatre . now , anz expects reading to come into vogue again as a sort of backlash against the excessive presence of television , videos , and films in western society . " today reading is considered necessary in western society , and people consider too much video-watching as alarming , " said anz . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young harry potter fans read in front of a 1942-built locomotive at the kiel railway station on nov .
8 , 2003 the psychologist is certain that the joy of reading will make a comeback , even if it 's kids hungry for the next harry potter adventure who at the fore of the turnaround . after all , it was harry 's creator , j.k. rowling who received an honorary doctorate from the university of edinburgh because her novels proved to have the magic touch that could lure youngsters away from the small screen , and back to books . monika hülsken-stobbe -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de building bridges with books building a bridge between the middle east and the west is no small task , but its something the organizers of this year 's book fair in frankfurt hope to accomplish .

if they are to repeat their dominance of years past , it will be without their big-name stars . it used to be so automatic . the question at track and field events at recent summer olympic games was not whether the us team would win any medals , but how many , and what color .
in 1996 , the team won 23 medals , 13 of them gold .
in 2000 in sydney , the numbers were 19 and 10 . this year , doping allegations and disqualifications have cast a shadow over the star-studded track and field team .
at least eight of the stars from games past either face doping bans or have not qualified for the games in events they typically dominated . big names fall alvin harrison , silver medalist in the 400m in sydney , jerome young , world champ in the 400m in paris in 2003 and marion jones , who won every 100m race between 1997 and 2001 , all failed to qualify for the olympics at the us track and field trials in the past week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marion jones lands in the sand pit during the long jump competition at the us olympic track and field trials in sacramento in 2000 of the three , only jones , who has been haunted by doping allegations , can still qualify for the games , in the long jump or 200m .
her boyfriend and the father of her one-year-old son , the sprint star tim montgomery , faces a lifetime ban from the united states anti-doping agency -lrb- usada -rrb- for a doping offense . he finished a disappointing sixth in the trials , failing to qualify for the 100m sprint , an event in which he holds the world record . doping rumors everywhere the athletes blame the negative publicity and pressure on them since federal investigators uncovered a san francisco bay area laboratory that supplied athletes with steroids .
since the scandal surrounding the bay area laboratory co-operative -lrb- balco -rrb- broke last fall , four athletes have admitted to using designer drugs to boost their performance . champion shot-putter kevin toth as well as hammer-throwers melissa price and john mcewen accepted two-year bans .
in may , kelli white , the reigning world champion in the 100m and 200m , also accepted a two-year ban after admitting to using drugs provided by balco . since the scandal broke , us track and field stars have been battling a storm of negative publicity .
the strain appears to have taken a toll on athletes like jones , who has n't been able to shake off doping suspicions despite never testing positive . stress is too much " stress can burst a pipe , " said chryste gaines , a 100m sprinter who along with 200m indoor champion michelle collins is under the microscope of the usada .
both failed to qualify for the olympics . " so you can imagine what it can do to a person , " she said . time is ticking down for the us track and field association to pick a squad for the olympic games .
olympic committees have until july 25 to provide organizers with a list of competing athletes .
the early exits of some of the team 's brightest stars should relieve some of the pressure . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links olympic games 2004 dw-world 's special on the athen games .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.07.2004 young germans face rising hiv rates großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the early 90s , aggresive hiv campaigns were the norm after falling for several years , rates of hiv infection , particularly among young gay men , are rising again .
risky behavior is increasing as a new generation appears willing to close its eyes to the dangers of hiv / aids . at 20 years old , many young adults are busy getting their college degrees or beginning their work lives , often excited at the broad expanse of possibilities in front of them .
however , for 20-year-old andreas , a gay berlin resident , a dark cloud has formed on his horizon ; he found out recently he has been infected with hiv , the virus that causes aids . andreas , who asked that his real name not be used , is having difficulty coming to terms with a diagnosis that has changed his future irrevocably .
while hiv is no longer the death sentence it once was , andreas will have to begin a demanding drug regime to keep aids at bay - and there are no guarantees .
the disease still kills 600 people in germany every year . " there is too little information out there , " he told dw-world .
" i never thought it could happen to me . " " new dynamic " to epidemic for some time in the mid to late 1990s , researchers and health care professionals working in the areas of hiv / aids could take comfort in the statistics : the number of hiv infections was falling annually ; the message of safer sex seemed to have gotten out . but a report out by the robert koch institute , a federal organization that researches disease control and prevention , warns that the epidemic of hiv in germany could acquire a " new dynamic " since the number of infections since 2001 has been rising steadily . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researching hiv in the lab - there 's medicine , but no cure three years ago , the institute reported 1,470 hiv infections in germany ; in 2002 , that number rose to 1,716 ; last year , 1,958 people contracted the virus .
that is a 33 percent rise in three years .
the trend toward rising infection rates also affects heterosexuals , half of those infected were men who had sex with men . experts say the reason behind the rise in infections is an increase in unsafe sex and a swing in attitudes toward the dangers of aids . since 1987 , the koch institute has carried out an annual survey about aids awareness in the general public .
in 2003 , the survey found that condom usage in general was falling .
among those surveyed who had multiple sexual partners in 2003 , 78 percent used condoms , down five percent over two years .
manufacturers are even selling fewer condoms in germany .
young people seem especially susceptible to letting their guard down in the heat of the moment . " the general tendency among young people today is to not see fully the risks involved in risky sexual behavior , " rolf gindorf , founder and past president of dgss , a sexuality research center in düsseldorf , told dw-world . " older gay men , say around 40 and up , are aware of the danger because they came of age at a time when death rates were high and aids information was very visible and always on people 's minds , " he said . "
but younger people today , they do n't have that experience .
knowing that the disease can be treated tends to make them carefree when it comes to sex . " the result is a generation gap that has developed between older and younger gay men .
protected sex has become second nature to older gay men , but among today 's youth , while they generally known the rules of safer sex , they often do n't follow them in sexual situations , according to birgit krenz of berlin aids hilfe , an organization that provides counseling and care for people with the disease . the results are becoming clear .
in 2001 , less than 1 percent of the hiv-infected people counseled at berlin aids hilfe were under the age of 20 .
by 2003 , that number had risen to 5 percent . less information after the deluge of aids information up until the late 1990s , according to dr. marita völker-albert of the federal center for health education -lrb- bzga -rrb- , there has been a strong decline over the past five years in public discussion of the disease . " priorities change , and issues like bse or sept .
11 have largely driven aids out of the media and the public mind , " she told dw-world .
" it 's harder to reach people now . " public money made available for education has also fallen off .
in 1987 , when the bzga began its aids awareness campaign , it had an annual budget of 50 million marks -lrb- $ 31.4 million -rrb- .
today , the center 's public awareness campaign has just over a third of that to spend - € 9 million -lrb- $ 11 million -rrb- a year . although he said he knew how to protect himself , andreas still partially blames the lack of a strong public message and vigorous discussion about aids for his infection . " it did n't do much good for me to see some celebrity up there talking about wearing condoms or something , " he said .

if they are to repeat their dominance of years past , it will be without their big-name stars . it used to be so automatic . the question at track and field events at recent summer olympic games was not whether the us team would win any medals , but how many , and what color .
in 1996 , the team won 23 medals , 13 of them gold .
in 2000 in sydney , the numbers were 19 and 10 . this year , doping allegations and disqualifications have cast a shadow over the star-studded track and field team .
at least eight of the stars from games past either face doping bans or have not qualified for the games in events they typically dominated . big names fall alvin harrison , silver medalist in the 400m in sydney , jerome young , world champ in the 400m in paris in 2003 and marion jones , who won every 100m race between 1997 and 2001 , all failed to qualify for the olympics at the us track and field trials in the past week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marion jones lands in the sand pit during the long jump competition at the us olympic track and field trials in sacramento in 2000 of the three , only jones , who has been haunted by doping allegations , can still qualify for the games , in the long jump or 200m .
her boyfriend and the father of her one-year-old son , the sprint star tim montgomery , faces a lifetime ban from the united states anti-doping agency -lrb- usada -rrb- for a doping offense . he finished a disappointing sixth in the trials , failing to qualify for the 100m sprint , an event in which he holds the world record . doping rumors everywhere the athletes blame the negative publicity and pressure on them since federal investigators uncovered a san francisco bay area laboratory that supplied athletes with steroids .
since the scandal surrounding the bay area laboratory co-operative -lrb- balco -rrb- broke last fall , four athletes have admitted to using designer drugs to boost their performance . champion shot-putter kevin toth as well as hammer-throwers melissa price and john mcewen accepted two-year bans .
in may , kelli white , the reigning world champion in the 100m and 200m , also accepted a two-year ban after admitting to using drugs provided by balco . since the scandal broke , us track and field stars have been battling a storm of negative publicity .
the strain appears to have taken a toll on athletes like jones , who has n't been able to shake off doping suspicions despite never testing positive . stress is too much " stress can burst a pipe , " said chryste gaines , a 100m sprinter who along with 200m indoor champion michelle collins is under the microscope of the usada .
both failed to qualify for the olympics . " so you can imagine what it can do to a person , " she said . time is ticking down for the us track and field association to pick a squad for the olympic games .
olympic committees have until july 25 to provide organizers with a list of competing athletes .
the early exits of some of the team 's brightest stars should relieve some of the pressure . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links olympic games 2004 dw-world 's special on the athen games .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.07.2004 young germans face rising hiv rates großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the early 90s , aggresive hiv campaigns were the norm after falling for several years , rates of hiv infection , particularly among young gay men , are rising again .
risky behavior is increasing as a new generation appears willing to close its eyes to the dangers of hiv / aids . at 20 years old , many young adults are busy getting their college degrees or beginning their work lives , often excited at the broad expanse of possibilities in front of them .
however , for 20-year-old andreas , a gay berlin resident , a dark cloud has formed on his horizon ; he found out recently he has been infected with hiv , the virus that causes aids . andreas , who asked that his real name not be used , is having difficulty coming to terms with a diagnosis that has changed his future irrevocably .
while hiv is no longer the death sentence it once was , andreas will have to begin a demanding drug regime to keep aids at bay - and there are no guarantees .
the disease still kills 600 people in germany every year . " there is too little information out there , " he told dw-world .
" i never thought it could happen to me . " " new dynamic " to epidemic for some time in the mid to late 1990s , researchers and health care professionals working in the areas of hiv / aids could take comfort in the statistics : the number of hiv infections was falling annually ; the message of safer sex seemed to have gotten out . but a report out by the robert koch institute , a federal organization that researches disease control and prevention , warns that the epidemic of hiv in germany could acquire a " new dynamic " since the number of infections since 2001 has been rising steadily . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researching hiv in the lab - there 's medicine , but no cure three years ago , the institute reported 1,470 hiv infections in germany ; in 2002 , that number rose to 1,716 ; last year , 1,958 people contracted the virus .
that is a 33 percent rise in three years .
the trend toward rising infection rates also affects heterosexuals , half of those infected were men who had sex with men . experts say the reason behind the rise in infections is an increase in unsafe sex and a swing in attitudes toward the dangers of aids . since 1987 , the koch institute has carried out an annual survey about aids awareness in the general public .
in 2003 , the survey found that condom usage in general was falling .
among those surveyed who had multiple sexual partners in 2003 , 78 percent used condoms , down five percent over two years .
manufacturers are even selling fewer condoms in germany .
young people seem especially susceptible to letting their guard down in the heat of the moment . " the general tendency among young people today is to not see fully the risks involved in risky sexual behavior , " rolf gindorf , founder and past president of dgss , a sexuality research center in düsseldorf , told dw-world . " older gay men , say around 40 and up , are aware of the danger because they came of age at a time when death rates were high and aids information was very visible and always on people 's minds , " he said . "
but younger people today , they do n't have that experience .
knowing that the disease can be treated tends to make them carefree when it comes to sex . " the result is a generation gap that has developed between older and younger gay men .
protected sex has become second nature to older gay men , but among today 's youth , while they generally known the rules of safer sex , they often do n't follow them in sexual situations , according to birgit krenz of berlin aids hilfe , an organization that provides counseling and care for people with the disease . the results are becoming clear .
in 2001 , less than 1 percent of the hiv-infected people counseled at berlin aids hilfe were under the age of 20 .
by 2003 , that number had risen to 5 percent . less information after the deluge of aids information up until the late 1990s , according to dr. marita völker-albert of the federal center for health education -lrb- bzga -rrb- , there has been a strong decline over the past five years in public discussion of the disease . " priorities change , and issues like bse or sept .
11 have largely driven aids out of the media and the public mind , " she told dw-world .
" it 's harder to reach people now . " public money made available for education has also fallen off .
in 1987 , when the bzga began its aids awareness campaign , it had an annual budget of 50 million marks -lrb- $ 31.4 million -rrb- .
today , the center 's public awareness campaign has just over a third of that to spend - € 9 million -lrb- $ 11 million -rrb- a year . although he said he knew how to protect himself , andreas still partially blames the lack of a strong public message and vigorous discussion about aids for his infection . " it did n't do much good for me to see some celebrity up there talking about wearing condoms or something , " he said .
" i needed something blatant that could shock me into making the right decisions .

still , the most contentious part of schreyer 's plan is not the total expenditure , nor the lack of vision , but the proposed reduction of the € 4 billion rebate given to britain annually . new states would have to pay for britain the 10 new poorer members of the eu feel britain 's 20-year old rebate , which as new members they also have to finance , is unfair .
unlike in the 1980s , britain today is the second-richest eu country in terms of per capita income .
back in 1984 , margaret thatcher , then uk prime minister , when fighting for the rebate , stated : " i want my money back . "
but schreyer explained the situation is much different now than it was two decades ago .
" the sums allocated to new , poorer member states is growing and the british rebate is also growing to the burden of others , " the german commissioner said .
britain now had a " magnificent " economy and no longer needed the rebate , she added .
the british government is fighting tooth and nail against any move to scrap the rebate .
the two british commissioners , neil kinnock and chris patten , should in theory represent the greater ' european ' interest .
but even they tried to persuade romano prodi , president of the commission , to water down schreyer 's rebate plans . patten fears eu backlash in britain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirs patten fears anti-eu sentiment will be fuelled by plans .
external relations commissioner patten wants more understanding of the british position , fearing that if schreyer 's plans are adopted in full , it will not help the knife-edge situation regarding the british public 's views on european union membership . " i am deeply disappointed and concerned that the proposals will set back our ability to argue a positive european case in the uk , " he said . patten also reportedly told schreyer that the plans were " manifestly unfair " and " not the basis for debate .

if they are to repeat their dominance of years past , it will be without their big-name stars . it used to be so automatic . the question at track and field events at recent summer olympic games was not whether the us team would win any medals , but how many , and what color .
in 1996 , the team won 23 medals , 13 of them gold .
in 2000 in sydney , the numbers were 19 and 10 . this year , doping allegations and disqualifications have cast a shadow over the star-studded track and field team .
at least eight of the stars from games past either face doping bans or have not qualified for the games in events they typically dominated . big names fall alvin harrison , silver medalist in the 400m in sydney , jerome young , world champ in the 400m in paris in 2003 and marion jones , who won every 100m race between 1997 and 2001 , all failed to qualify for the olympics at the us track and field trials in the past week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marion jones lands in the sand pit during the long jump competition at the us olympic track and field trials in sacramento in 2000 of the three , only jones , who has been haunted by doping allegations , can still qualify for the games , in the long jump or 200m .
her boyfriend and the father of her one-year-old son , the sprint star tim montgomery , faces a lifetime ban from the united states anti-doping agency -lrb- usada -rrb- for a doping offense . he finished a disappointing sixth in the trials , failing to qualify for the 100m sprint , an event in which he holds the world record . doping rumors everywhere the athletes blame the negative publicity and pressure on them since federal investigators uncovered a san francisco bay area laboratory that supplied athletes with steroids .
since the scandal surrounding the bay area laboratory co-operative -lrb- balco -rrb- broke last fall , four athletes have admitted to using designer drugs to boost their performance . champion shot-putter kevin toth as well as hammer-throwers melissa price and john mcewen accepted two-year bans .
in may , kelli white , the reigning world champion in the 100m and 200m , also accepted a two-year ban after admitting to using drugs provided by balco . since the scandal broke , us track and field stars have been battling a storm of negative publicity .
the strain appears to have taken a toll on athletes like jones , who has n't been able to shake off doping suspicions despite never testing positive . stress is too much " stress can burst a pipe , " said chryste gaines , a 100m sprinter who along with 200m indoor champion michelle collins is under the microscope of the usada .
both failed to qualify for the olympics . " so you can imagine what it can do to a person , " she said . time is ticking down for the us track and field association to pick a squad for the olympic games .
olympic committees have until july 25 to provide organizers with a list of competing athletes .
the early exits of some of the team 's brightest stars should relieve some of the pressure . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links olympic games 2004 dw-world 's special on the athen games .

some 600 workers at a mercedes plant in düsseldorf kicked off the action with an overnight demonstration by torchlight through the city streets . at daimlerchrysler 's main site in sindelfingen , near stuttgart in southern germany , around 20,00 employees answered the call to strike and stopped work for two hours earlier in the morning .
further stoppages have been staged at car and truck factories throughout the country during the course of the day , notably in berlin , bremen and hamburg , said ig metall and the employee 's council .

but the bad news has n't dampened us corporate investors shopping for bargains . given all the complaining in german business circles lately , it hardly seems likely foreign investors would want to dish out money in this country .
with unemployment steadily on the rise , the national budget deficit in stark violation of eu norms , economic growth squeezing by at less than two percent and employees on strike to keep 35-hour work weeks , there is n't much to encourage a positive future outlook for business .
but nobody seems to have shared the negative forecast with american private equity firms looking for a good money-making deal in germany .
us corporate investors have a decidedly different view of the german economy than many of the business leaders here do .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are all gloom and doom when they talk about the economy .
at a recent trans-atlantic business conference in stuttgart , us investors said they generally don ’ t find germany to be as bad off as many germans make it out to be .
instead , a healthy dose of american-flavored optimism was what they recommended to help get the patient back on its feet again .
instituting an emotional turn-around government officials and economic analysts across the country never tire talking about the need for germany to undergo structural economic change .
but the president of the american chamber of commerce in germany , fred irwin , said what the country really needs is an emotional turnaround .
" everyone in the media talks about needing to reform taxes and needing to reform business laws here , " he said .
" but actually nothing is going to dramatically change here if germans don ’ t decide that they ’ re willing to take a risk and that it ’ s necessary to change . "
irwin added that part of germany 's problems stem from a societal stubbornness to change , an affinity for keeping the status quo .
" it ’ s a conservative society , but all around it things are changing , " he said , pointing to germany 's neighbors in europe and markets oversees .
" we have a global market , and so where other countries are changing , germany is standing still , which is very unfortunate . "
american bargain hunters according to irwin , while germany is standing still , americans are busy looking for a good bargain .
many have been successful and have purchased good chunks of the market as corporate restructuring and streamlining within some large german conglomerates is throws up the occasional investment opportunity for big american firms .
the us private equity firm blackstone ’ s recent acquisition of the german chemicals company celanese , is one example .
and with attractive interest rates in germany , blackstone says it ’ s hungry for more takeovers .
the half-full glass why are american investors prepared to spend their money in germany , but germans apparently are not ?
walter raizner , the head of ibm deutschland , the german subsidiary of the american computer giant , pointed to differences in the business culture between the united states and germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : americans are still enthusiastic about the chance for economic recovery .
" first of all , the overall optimism in the united states , in the workforce , is much , much higher , " he said .
" i always describe it as how we look at the glass .
in germany , we always look at the glass as half-empty .
and our american friends always look at the glass as being half-full .
and i think this describes very nicely what the general mindset is , how you approach things in business but also in life . "
americans are also more pragmatic in implementing business decisions , raizner added .
" germans tend to discuss everything to the end , " he said .
" and even if you ’ ve made a decision you keep going on and discussing whether the decision was right or wrong or should we start all over again , " he added , describing the slow momentum in german business negotiations .
in contrast , the americans have a whole different attitude , according to raizner .
" they say , let ’ s move along this pass , " he said .
" if it proves to be wrong , well , we can adjust our course and come to the objective anyhow . "
adding the spice of america german corporate lawyer roderich thümmel , who works with companies on both sides of the atlantic , agrees that germany would be much better off economically if it had a dash of american business confidence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a stock trader toasts with champagne at the stock market in frankfurt , dec .
30 as the dax shows its highest level for the year at end of trading in 2003 . " we germans should be more confident in what we can do , " he stresses .
" we should become more active and we should take an active role in bringing things forward and that is what happens every day in many companies , but the perception in the general public , i think , is more negative than necessary . "
more spending needed the american chamber of commerce in germany says germans have to start spending money , rather than continuing to save it .
and the chamber ’ s president is following that advice and encouraging the company he works for , citigroup , to invest more in germany .
while most german banks are continuing to lay off staff in order to reduce costs , the us banking , insurance and investment corporation citigroup is hiring people in germany .
last year the company ’ s banking sector , citibank , created more than 350 extra positions in order to expand its network of branches .
recently , citibank announced that 200 more jobs will be created this year as part of a further expansion of services mainly in southern germany .
an american-led recovery ?
does this mean american businesses could be leading an economic recovery in germany ?
fred irwin does n't want to go that far , but he does think american businesses can show germans the path they need to take .
" we have in germany a consensus mentality society , " he said .
" and as long as you have an economic boom , a consensus society is very positive because everybody profits from it .
but when you ’ re having some difficulties , we need vision , we need leadership and we need execution . "
american businesses have the vision right now and they are the ones making things happen , irwin believes .
so while german chancellor gerhard schröder continues to blame the country 's economic woes on sluggish world economic conditions , and analysts bemoan investment conditions and economic confidence within germany , american corporations are busy investing in what is still europe ’ s biggest economy . geoff rodoreda send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany still attractive to u.s. industry germans are fond of moaning about their country 's business environment , but many us firms here have a more positive outlook .

but the bad news has n't dampened us corporate investors shopping for bargains . given all the complaining in german business circles lately , it hardly seems likely foreign investors would want to dish out money in this country .
with unemployment steadily on the rise , the national budget deficit in stark violation of eu norms , economic growth squeezing by at less than two percent and employees on strike to keep 35-hour work weeks , there is n't much to encourage a positive future outlook for business .
but nobody seems to have shared the negative forecast with american private equity firms looking for a good money-making deal in germany .
us corporate investors have a decidedly different view of the german economy than many of the business leaders here do .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are all gloom and doom when they talk about the economy .
at a recent trans-atlantic business conference in stuttgart , us investors said they generally don ’ t find germany to be as bad off as many germans make it out to be .
instead , a healthy dose of american-flavored optimism was what they recommended to help get the patient back on its feet again .
instituting an emotional turn-around government officials and economic analysts across the country never tire talking about the need for germany to undergo structural economic change .
but the president of the american chamber of commerce in germany , fred irwin , said what the country really needs is an emotional turnaround .
" everyone in the media talks about needing to reform taxes and needing to reform business laws here , " he said .
" but actually nothing is going to dramatically change here if germans don ’ t decide that they ’ re willing to take a risk and that it ’ s necessary to change . "
irwin added that part of germany 's problems stem from a societal stubbornness to change , an affinity for keeping the status quo .
" it ’ s a conservative society , but all around it things are changing , " he said , pointing to germany 's neighbors in europe and markets oversees .
" we have a global market , and so where other countries are changing , germany is standing still , which is very unfortunate . "
american bargain hunters according to irwin , while germany is standing still , americans are busy looking for a good bargain .
many have been successful and have purchased good chunks of the market as corporate restructuring and streamlining within some large german conglomerates is throws up the occasional investment opportunity for big american firms .
the us private equity firm blackstone ’ s recent acquisition of the german chemicals company celanese , is one example .
and with attractive interest rates in germany , blackstone says it ’ s hungry for more takeovers .
the half-full glass why are american investors prepared to spend their money in germany , but germans apparently are not ?
walter raizner , the head of ibm deutschland , the german subsidiary of the american computer giant , pointed to differences in the business culture between the united states and germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : americans are still enthusiastic about the chance for economic recovery .
" first of all , the overall optimism in the united states , in the workforce , is much , much higher , " he said .
" i always describe it as how we look at the glass .
in germany , we always look at the glass as half-empty .
and our american friends always look at the glass as being half-full .
and i think this describes very nicely what the general mindset is , how you approach things in business but also in life . "
americans are also more pragmatic in implementing business decisions , raizner added .
" germans tend to discuss everything to the end , " he said .
" and even if you ’ ve made a decision you keep going on and discussing whether the decision was right or wrong or should we start all over again , " he added , describing the slow momentum in german business negotiations .
in contrast , the americans have a whole different attitude , according to raizner .
" they say , let ’ s move along this pass , " he said .
" if it proves to be wrong , well , we can adjust our course and come to the objective anyhow . "
adding the spice of america german corporate lawyer roderich thümmel , who works with companies on both sides of the atlantic , agrees that germany would be much better off economically if it had a dash of american business confidence .

30 as the dax shows its highest level for the year at end of trading in 2003 . " we germans should be more confident in what we can do , " he stresses .
" we should become more active and we should take an active role in bringing things forward and that is what happens every day in many companies , but the perception in the general public , i think , is more negative than necessary . "
more spending needed the american chamber of commerce in germany says germans have to start spending money , rather than continuing to save it .
and the chamber ’ s president is following that advice and encouraging the company he works for , citigroup , to invest more in germany .
while most german banks are continuing to lay off staff in order to reduce costs , the us banking , insurance and investment corporation citigroup is hiring people in germany .
last year the company ’ s banking sector , citibank , created more than 350 extra positions in order to expand its network of branches .
recently , citibank announced that 200 more jobs will be created this year as part of a further expansion of services mainly in southern germany .
an american-led recovery ?
does this mean american businesses could be leading an economic recovery in germany ?
fred irwin does n't want to go that far , but he does think american businesses can show germans the path they need to take .
" we have in germany a consensus mentality society , " he said .
" and as long as you have an economic boom , a consensus society is very positive because everybody profits from it .
but when you ’ re having some difficulties , we need vision , we need leadership and we need execution . "
american businesses have the vision right now and they are the ones making things happen , irwin believes .

walter raizner , the head of ibm deutschland , the german subsidiary of the american computer giant , pointed to differences in the business culture between the united states and germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : americans are still enthusiastic about the chance for economic recovery .
" first of all , the overall optimism in the united states , in the workforce , is much , much higher , " he said .
" i always describe it as how we look at the glass .
in germany , we always look at the glass as half-empty .
and our american friends always look at the glass as being half-full .
and i think this describes very nicely what the general mindset is , how you approach things in business but also in life . "
americans are also more pragmatic in implementing business decisions , raizner added .
" germans tend to discuss everything to the end , " he said .
" and even if you ’ ve made a decision you keep going on and discussing whether the decision was right or wrong or should we start all over again , " he added , describing the slow momentum in german business negotiations .
in contrast , the americans have a whole different attitude , according to raizner .
" they say , let ’ s move along this pass , " he said .
" if it proves to be wrong , well , we can adjust our course and come to the objective anyhow . "
adding the spice of america german corporate lawyer roderich thümmel , who works with companies on both sides of the atlantic , agrees that germany would be much better off economically if it had a dash of american business confidence .

" we should become more active and we should take an active role in bringing things forward and that is what happens every day in many companies , but the perception in the general public , i think , is more negative than necessary . "
more spending needed the american chamber of commerce in germany says germans have to start spending money , rather than continuing to save it .
and the chamber ’ s president is following that advice and encouraging the company he works for , citigroup , to invest more in germany .
while most german banks are continuing to lay off staff in order to reduce costs , the us banking , insurance and investment corporation citigroup is hiring people in germany .
last year the company ’ s banking sector , citibank , created more than 350 extra positions in order to expand its network of branches .
recently , citibank announced that 200 more jobs will be created this year as part of a further expansion of services mainly in southern germany .
an american-led recovery ?
does this mean american businesses could be leading an economic recovery in germany ?
fred irwin does n't want to go that far , but he does think american businesses can show germans the path they need to take .
" we have in germany a consensus mentality society , " he said .
" and as long as you have an economic boom , a consensus society is very positive because everybody profits from it .
but when you ’ re having some difficulties , we need vision , we need leadership and we need execution . "
american businesses have the vision right now and they are the ones making things happen , irwin believes .

but the bad news has n't dampened us corporate investors shopping for bargains . given all the complaining in german business circles lately , it hardly seems likely foreign investors would want to dish out money in this country .
with unemployment steadily on the rise , the national budget deficit in stark violation of eu norms , economic growth squeezing by at less than two percent and employees on strike to keep 35-hour work weeks , there is n't much to encourage a positive future outlook for business .
but nobody seems to have shared the negative forecast with american private equity firms looking for a good money-making deal in germany .
us corporate investors have a decidedly different view of the german economy than many of the business leaders here do .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are all gloom and doom when they talk about the economy .
at a recent trans-atlantic business conference in stuttgart , us investors said they generally don ’ t find germany to be as bad off as many germans make it out to be .
instead , a healthy dose of american-flavored optimism was what they recommended to help get the patient back on its feet again .
instituting an emotional turn-around government officials and economic analysts across the country never tire talking about the need for germany to undergo structural economic change .
but the president of the american chamber of commerce in germany , fred irwin , said what the country really needs is an emotional turnaround .
" everyone in the media talks about needing to reform taxes and needing to reform business laws here , " he said .
" but actually nothing is going to dramatically change here if germans don ’ t decide that they ’ re willing to take a risk and that it ’ s necessary to change . "
irwin added that part of germany 's problems stem from a societal stubbornness to change , an affinity for keeping the status quo .
" it ’ s a conservative society , but all around it things are changing , " he said , pointing to germany 's neighbors in europe and markets oversees .
" we have a global market , and so where other countries are changing , germany is standing still , which is very unfortunate . "
american bargain hunters according to irwin , while germany is standing still , americans are busy looking for a good bargain .
many have been successful and have purchased good chunks of the market as corporate restructuring and streamlining within some large german conglomerates is throws up the occasional investment opportunity for big american firms .
the us private equity firm blackstone ’ s recent acquisition of the german chemicals company celanese , is one example .
and with attractive interest rates in germany , blackstone says it ’ s hungry for more takeovers .
the half-full glass why are american investors prepared to spend their money in germany , but germans apparently are not ?

some 600 workers at a mercedes plant in düsseldorf kicked off the action with an overnight demonstration by torchlight through the city streets . at daimlerchrysler 's main site in sindelfingen , near stuttgart in southern germany , around 20,00 employees answered the call to strike and stopped work for two hours earlier in the morning .
further stoppages have been staged at car and truck factories throughout the country during the course of the day , notably in berlin , bremen and hamburg , said ig metall and the employee 's council .
the carmaker employs around 160,000 people in germany and some reports suggest that as much as half the workforce could join in the protests .
" it 's war " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 600 night-shift workers at a mercedes plant in düsseldorf demonstrate in the early hours of thursday , july 15 , 2004 .
the strikes at all the german mercedes factories are a direct response to daimlerchrysler 's threats to shift production of its new mercedes c-class sedan away from sindelfingen to south africa if unions do not agree to € 500 million -lrb- $ 615 million -rrb- in personnel cost costs .
such a move could result in the loss of 6,000 jobs in sindelfingen .
ig metall slammed the threat as " blackmail " and vowed to fight the company 's plans .
protestors in sindelfingen , a factory which employs close to 30,000 people , rallied around the union and displayed signs crying out , " it 's war . "
the head of the employee 's council in sindelfingen , erich klemm , said the union was willing to offer pay reductions up to € 180 million , but not management 's " outrageous " demands for half a billion in reductions .
a climate of fear daimlerchrysler has also threatened to move some jobs from sindelfingen to bremen , where production costs are lower , and to change contracts to eliminate extra pay for late shifts and five-minute breaks on every hour , effectively leading to an increase of the work week without more pay .
" such proposals make me sick , " said klemm , who vowed that all the mercedes factories would stick together in a show of solidarity .
the president of germany 's parliament , wolfgang thierse , lashed out at daimlerchrysler management for " creating a climate of fear . "
" it 's repulsive to exert pressure on employees by making ultimatums , " he told the daily tagesspiegel on thursday . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de industry 's upper hand at the negotiating table siemens two weeks ago , daimlerchrysler this week .

what started as an operation for saving ski areas has turned out to be a successful environmental measure to protect glaciers from melting away .
germany 's zugspitze now spends most of the year undercover . while most people in germany are complaining about the unseasonable temperatures this summer , the cool , wet weather has been a boon to germany 's highest mountain , the zugspitze .
after a fresh dusting of snow on germany 's most famous glacier this past week , environmentalists let out a sigh of relief .
but things are n't always this cool in the icy heights of the german alps .
summers usually bring rising temperatures and glaring sunshine .
although the balmy weather may be just what the calendar calls for in the rest of the country , on the zugspitze warm days are frowned upon .
with every rise in the mercury , precious centimeters of one of germany 's few remaining glaciers melt away .
it 's estimated that global warming results in a loss of about 10 centimeters of the glacier every year .
at that rate , not much is expected to survive through the next century , says the society for environmental research in munich in its online glacier archive .
to preserve this unique environment , dedicated workers at the zugspitzbahn , the cable car operator up to the peak , have devised a giant sun shade to protect the ice on top of the 2,962 meter-high mountain .
every year for the past 10 years , they spread out about 6,000 square meters -lrb- 19,000 sq. feet -rrb- of mats and tarpaulins on the glacier 's surface .
the white material reflects sunlight and insulates against the heat , preventing further melting of the snow and ice .
keeping the glacier under wraps bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : covering up the zugspitze the canvas also helps protect the glacier from warm summer rain , " which virtually devours the snow , " says stephanie vogel of the zugspitzbahn .
vogel and her colleagues at the peak 's cable car are in favor of the giant sunshade .
although she admits it is work to cover the glacier , it is import for preserving the fragile condition on the mountain top for posterity .
originally the idea was developed to protect snow in popular ski areas , but vogel says it has moved beyond the economic aspects related to tourism and has turned out to be a successful environmental measure .
to critics she acknowledges the sun shield is an " intervention in nature . "
any attempt to save an at-risk environment implies intervention , she argues .
the tarps , she believes , are the least dramatic interference .
in other places , snow guns are used to keep mountain peaks and especially ski resorts covered in white powder .
germany , however , is against relying on artificial snow because of the environmental concerns and the cost of energy involved .
consequences of glacial melting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at 2,963 meters , the zugspitze in bavaria is germany 's highest mountain .
the zugspitze is not alone in its battle against global warming .
environmentalists say glaciers are some of the most threatened ecosystems on earth .
they function as " global thermometers " and are extremely sensitive to the world 's rising temperature .
global warming , the lack of snow in winter , hot summers as well as air pollution and acid rain are responsible for shrinking glaciers , says the society for environmental research in munich .
more than just the loss of a valuable landscape , the defrosting of the permanent glacial ice - the permafrost - causes landslides and avalanches as the rocky undersurface is revealed and erodes in the rough wind .
resources of potable water provided by glacial ice also become more scarce , the society warns on its web site .
given current rates of greenhouse gas emissions , the anti-glare shield on the zugspitze may in the end only represent a last-ditch effort to slow down the almost inevitable glacier diminution .

what started as an operation for saving ski areas has turned out to be a successful environmental measure to protect glaciers from melting away .
germany 's zugspitze now spends most of the year undercover . while most people in germany are complaining about the unseasonable temperatures this summer , the cool , wet weather has been a boon to germany 's highest mountain , the zugspitze .
after a fresh dusting of snow on germany 's most famous glacier this past week , environmentalists let out a sigh of relief .
but things are n't always this cool in the icy heights of the german alps .
summers usually bring rising temperatures and glaring sunshine .
although the balmy weather may be just what the calendar calls for in the rest of the country , on the zugspitze warm days are frowned upon .
with every rise in the mercury , precious centimeters of one of germany 's few remaining glaciers melt away .
it 's estimated that global warming results in a loss of about 10 centimeters of the glacier every year .
at that rate , not much is expected to survive through the next century , says the society for environmental research in munich in its online glacier archive .
to preserve this unique environment , dedicated workers at the zugspitzbahn , the cable car operator up to the peak , have devised a giant sun shade to protect the ice on top of the 2,962 meter-high mountain .
every year for the past 10 years , they spread out about 6,000 square meters -lrb- 19,000 sq. feet -rrb- of mats and tarpaulins on the glacier 's surface .
the white material reflects sunlight and insulates against the heat , preventing further melting of the snow and ice .
keeping the glacier under wraps bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : covering up the zugspitze the canvas also helps protect the glacier from warm summer rain , " which virtually devours the snow , " says stephanie vogel of the zugspitzbahn .
vogel and her colleagues at the peak 's cable car are in favor of the giant sunshade .
although she admits it is work to cover the glacier , it is import for preserving the fragile condition on the mountain top for posterity .
originally the idea was developed to protect snow in popular ski areas , but vogel says it has moved beyond the economic aspects related to tourism and has turned out to be a successful environmental measure .
to critics she acknowledges the sun shield is an " intervention in nature . "
any attempt to save an at-risk environment implies intervention , she argues .
the tarps , she believes , are the least dramatic interference .
in other places , snow guns are used to keep mountain peaks and especially ski resorts covered in white powder .
germany , however , is against relying on artificial snow because of the environmental concerns and the cost of energy involved .

the zugspitze is not alone in its battle against global warming .
environmentalists say glaciers are some of the most threatened ecosystems on earth .
they function as " global thermometers " and are extremely sensitive to the world 's rising temperature .
global warming , the lack of snow in winter , hot summers as well as air pollution and acid rain are responsible for shrinking glaciers , says the society for environmental research in munich .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.07.2004 young germans face rising hiv rates großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the early 90s , aggresive hiv campaigns were the norm after falling for several years , rates of hiv infection , particularly among young gay men , are rising again .
risky behavior is increasing as a new generation appears willing to close its eyes to the dangers of hiv / aids . at 20 years old , many young adults are busy getting their college degrees or beginning their work lives , often excited at the broad expanse of possibilities in front of them .
however , for 20-year-old andreas , a gay berlin resident , a dark cloud has formed on his horizon ; he found out recently he has been infected with hiv , the virus that causes aids . andreas , who asked that his real name not be used , is having difficulty coming to terms with a diagnosis that has changed his future irrevocably .
while hiv is no longer the death sentence it once was , andreas will have to begin a demanding drug regime to keep aids at bay - and there are no guarantees .
the disease still kills 600 people in germany every year . " there is too little information out there , " he told dw-world .
" i never thought it could happen to me . " " new dynamic " to epidemic for some time in the mid to late 1990s , researchers and health care professionals working in the areas of hiv / aids could take comfort in the statistics : the number of hiv infections was falling annually ; the message of safer sex seemed to have gotten out . but a report out by the robert koch institute , a federal organization that researches disease control and prevention , warns that the epidemic of hiv in germany could acquire a " new dynamic " since the number of infections since 2001 has been rising steadily . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researching hiv in the lab - there 's medicine , but no cure three years ago , the institute reported 1,470 hiv infections in germany ; in 2002 , that number rose to 1,716 ; last year , 1,958 people contracted the virus .
that is a 33 percent rise in three years .
the trend toward rising infection rates also affects heterosexuals , half of those infected were men who had sex with men . experts say the reason behind the rise in infections is an increase in unsafe sex and a swing in attitudes toward the dangers of aids . since 1987 , the koch institute has carried out an annual survey about aids awareness in the general public .
in 2003 , the survey found that condom usage in general was falling .
among those surveyed who had multiple sexual partners in 2003 , 78 percent used condoms , down five percent over two years .
manufacturers are even selling fewer condoms in germany .
young people seem especially susceptible to letting their guard down in the heat of the moment . " the general tendency among young people today is to not see fully the risks involved in risky sexual behavior , " rolf gindorf , founder and past president of dgss , a sexuality research center in düsseldorf , told dw-world . " older gay men , say around 40 and up , are aware of the danger because they came of age at a time when death rates were high and aids information was very visible and always on people 's minds , " he said . "
but younger people today , they do n't have that experience .
knowing that the disease can be treated tends to make them carefree when it comes to sex . " the result is a generation gap that has developed between older and younger gay men .
protected sex has become second nature to older gay men , but among today 's youth , while they generally known the rules of safer sex , they often do n't follow them in sexual situations , according to birgit krenz of berlin aids hilfe , an organization that provides counseling and care for people with the disease . the results are becoming clear .
in 2001 , less than 1 percent of the hiv-infected people counseled at berlin aids hilfe were under the age of 20 .
by 2003 , that number had risen to 5 percent . less information after the deluge of aids information up until the late 1990s , according to dr. marita völker-albert of the federal center for health education -lrb- bzga -rrb- , there has been a strong decline over the past five years in public discussion of the disease . " priorities change , and issues like bse or sept .
11 have largely driven aids out of the media and the public mind , " she told dw-world .
" it 's harder to reach people now . " public money made available for education has also fallen off .
in 1987 , when the bzga began its aids awareness campaign , it had an annual budget of 50 million marks -lrb- $ 31.4 million -rrb- .
today , the center 's public awareness campaign has just over a third of that to spend - € 9 million -lrb- $ 11 million -rrb- a year . although he said he knew how to protect himself , andreas still partially blames the lack of a strong public message and vigorous discussion about aids for his infection . " it did n't do much good for me to see some celebrity up there talking about wearing condoms or something , " he said .
" i needed something blatant that could shock me into making the right decisions . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de researchers warn about aids in eastern europe of the 280,000 new aids infections in europe during the past year , more than 200,000 were reported in areas formerly belonging to the soviet bloc .
the figures are triggering alarm bells among researchers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.07.2004 young germans face rising hiv rates großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the early 90s , aggresive hiv campaigns were the norm after falling for several years , rates of hiv infection , particularly among young gay men , are rising again .
risky behavior is increasing as a new generation appears willing to close its eyes to the dangers of hiv / aids . at 20 years old , many young adults are busy getting their college degrees or beginning their work lives , often excited at the broad expanse of possibilities in front of them .
however , for 20-year-old andreas , a gay berlin resident , a dark cloud has formed on his horizon ; he found out recently he has been infected with hiv , the virus that causes aids . andreas , who asked that his real name not be used , is having difficulty coming to terms with a diagnosis that has changed his future irrevocably .
while hiv is no longer the death sentence it once was , andreas will have to begin a demanding drug regime to keep aids at bay - and there are no guarantees .
the disease still kills 600 people in germany every year . " there is too little information out there , " he told dw-world .
" i never thought it could happen to me . " " new dynamic " to epidemic for some time in the mid to late 1990s , researchers and health care professionals working in the areas of hiv / aids could take comfort in the statistics : the number of hiv infections was falling annually ; the message of safer sex seemed to have gotten out . but a report out by the robert koch institute , a federal organization that researches disease control and prevention , warns that the epidemic of hiv in germany could acquire a " new dynamic " since the number of infections since 2001 has been rising steadily . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researching hiv in the lab - there 's medicine , but no cure three years ago , the institute reported 1,470 hiv infections in germany ; in 2002 , that number rose to 1,716 ; last year , 1,958 people contracted the virus .
that is a 33 percent rise in three years .
the trend toward rising infection rates also affects heterosexuals , half of those infected were men who had sex with men . experts say the reason behind the rise in infections is an increase in unsafe sex and a swing in attitudes toward the dangers of aids . since 1987 , the koch institute has carried out an annual survey about aids awareness in the general public .
in 2003 , the survey found that condom usage in general was falling .
among those surveyed who had multiple sexual partners in 2003 , 78 percent used condoms , down five percent over two years .
manufacturers are even selling fewer condoms in germany .
young people seem especially susceptible to letting their guard down in the heat of the moment . " the general tendency among young people today is to not see fully the risks involved in risky sexual behavior , " rolf gindorf , founder and past president of dgss , a sexuality research center in düsseldorf , told dw-world . " older gay men , say around 40 and up , are aware of the danger because they came of age at a time when death rates were high and aids information was very visible and always on people 's minds , " he said . "
but younger people today , they do n't have that experience .
knowing that the disease can be treated tends to make them carefree when it comes to sex . " the result is a generation gap that has developed between older and younger gay men .
protected sex has become second nature to older gay men , but among today 's youth , while they generally known the rules of safer sex , they often do n't follow them in sexual situations , according to birgit krenz of berlin aids hilfe , an organization that provides counseling and care for people with the disease . the results are becoming clear .
in 2001 , less than 1 percent of the hiv-infected people counseled at berlin aids hilfe were under the age of 20 .
by 2003 , that number had risen to 5 percent . less information after the deluge of aids information up until the late 1990s , according to dr. marita völker-albert of the federal center for health education -lrb- bzga -rrb- , there has been a strong decline over the past five years in public discussion of the disease . " priorities change , and issues like bse or sept .
11 have largely driven aids out of the media and the public mind , " she told dw-world .
" it 's harder to reach people now . " public money made available for education has also fallen off .
in 1987 , when the bzga began its aids awareness campaign , it had an annual budget of 50 million marks -lrb- $ 31.4 million -rrb- .
today , the center 's public awareness campaign has just over a third of that to spend - € 9 million -lrb- $ 11 million -rrb- a year . although he said he knew how to protect himself , andreas still partially blames the lack of a strong public message and vigorous discussion about aids for his infection . " it did n't do much good for me to see some celebrity up there talking about wearing condoms or something , " he said .
" i needed something blatant that could shock me into making the right decisions . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de researchers warn about aids in eastern europe of the 280,000 new aids infections in europe during the past year , more than 200,000 were reported in areas formerly belonging to the soviet bloc .

" he said he hoped " that it will continue to be allowed to be worth the effort to fight for an increase in the value of a company . " but the case revealed to the public the amount of compensation which a very few top managers were receiving , and created considerable public outrage . german civil law requires managerial compensation to be " fair and appropriate to the social situation .

some 600 workers at a mercedes plant in düsseldorf kicked off the action with an overnight demonstration by torchlight through the city streets . at daimlerchrysler 's main site in sindelfingen , near stuttgart in southern germany , around 20,00 employees answered the call to strike and stopped work for two hours earlier in the morning .
further stoppages have been staged at car and truck factories throughout the country during the course of the day , notably in berlin , bremen and hamburg , said ig metall and the employee 's council .
the carmaker employs around 160,000 people in germany and some reports suggest that as much as half the workforce could join in the protests .
" it 's war " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 600 night-shift workers at a mercedes plant in düsseldorf demonstrate in the early hours of thursday , july 15 , 2004 .
the strikes at all the german mercedes factories are a direct response to daimlerchrysler 's threats to shift production of its new mercedes c-class sedan away from sindelfingen to south africa if unions do not agree to € 500 million -lrb- $ 615 million -rrb- in personnel cost costs .
such a move could result in the loss of 6,000 jobs in sindelfingen .
ig metall slammed the threat as " blackmail " and vowed to fight the company 's plans .
protestors in sindelfingen , a factory which employs close to 30,000 people , rallied around the union and displayed signs crying out , " it 's war . "
the head of the employee 's council in sindelfingen , erich klemm , said the union was willing to offer pay reductions up to € 180 million , but not management 's " outrageous " demands for half a billion in reductions .
a climate of fear daimlerchrysler has also threatened to move some jobs from sindelfingen to bremen , where production costs are lower , and to change contracts to eliminate extra pay for late shifts and five-minute breaks on every hour , effectively leading to an increase of the work week without more pay .
" such proposals make me sick , " said klemm , who vowed that all the mercedes factories would stick together in a show of solidarity .
the president of germany 's parliament , wolfgang thierse , lashed out at daimlerchrysler management for " creating a climate of fear . "
" it 's repulsive to exert pressure on employees by making ultimatums , " he told the daily tagesspiegel on thursday . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de industry 's upper hand at the negotiating table siemens two weeks ago , daimlerchrysler this week .

although fischer acknowledged the country had made progress since the 1989 tiananmen square massacre , he also expressed misgivings over beijing 's use of he death penalty , administrative imprisonment for dissidents and " re-education programs . "
" we note the progress made but also have major concerns about human rights in china , " fischer said after meeting with his chinese counterpart , li zhaoxing .
the chinese foreign minister dismissed the criticism at a press conference , saying his country did not need " lessons from the west . "
china has a huge population of more than 1.3 billion people , li told reporters , " but china has great respect for each individual 's human rights . "
more freedom for tibet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer with chinese foreign minister li zhaoxing li -lrb- photo -rrb- thanked fischer for german support of the " one china " policy against granting independence to taiwan , which chancellor gerhard schröder endorsed on his trip to beijing late last year .
at the same time , however , he rejected fischer 's calls for granting more religious and political freedom to tibet .
the west 's concerns about tibet should not undermine chinese authority in the region , li replied after fischer appealed to him to engage in peaceful dialogue with the dalai lama , the buddhist leader of the tibetan government-in-exile .
the chinese foreign minister accused the dalai lama of " subversive " activity that threatened to undermine chinese sovereignty in tibet .
" that is unacceptable for us , " he said .
common ground after exchanging sharp barbs on human rights , the two ministers moved on to more friendly ground and stressed common goals for their countries .
germany is china 's biggest trading partner in the european union , and the two countries work closely together on the u.n. security council , li stressed at the press conference .
fischer echoed this view saying the two countries had worked together in promoting greater " multilateralism " as opposed to " unilateralism " on global issues such as the recent iraq war .
china , which is one of five permanent members on the security council , said it backed a larger role for germany at the united nations including berlin 's bid for a permanent seat on the influential council .
currently , germany holds one of 10 rotating seats , but fischer 's five-country tour through asia is intended to drum up support for a reform of the council 's make-up later this year . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de different worlds , same goal german efforts to gain support for a permanent seat at a reformed un security council found resonance on wednesday when foreign minister fischer visited india , south asia 's giant aspirant to a similar place .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.07.2004 young germans face rising hiv rates großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the early 90s , aggresive hiv campaigns were the norm after falling for several years , rates of hiv infection , particularly among young gay men , are rising again .
risky behavior is increasing as a new generation appears willing to close its eyes to the dangers of hiv / aids . at 20 years old , many young adults are busy getting their college degrees or beginning their work lives , often excited at the broad expanse of possibilities in front of them .
however , for 20-year-old andreas , a gay berlin resident , a dark cloud has formed on his horizon ; he found out recently he has been infected with hiv , the virus that causes aids . andreas , who asked that his real name not be used , is having difficulty coming to terms with a diagnosis that has changed his future irrevocably .
while hiv is no longer the death sentence it once was , andreas will have to begin a demanding drug regime to keep aids at bay - and there are no guarantees .
the disease still kills 600 people in germany every year . " there is too little information out there , " he told dw-world .
" i never thought it could happen to me . " " new dynamic " to epidemic for some time in the mid to late 1990s , researchers and health care professionals working in the areas of hiv / aids could take comfort in the statistics : the number of hiv infections was falling annually ; the message of safer sex seemed to have gotten out . but a report out by the robert koch institute , a federal organization that researches disease control and prevention , warns that the epidemic of hiv in germany could acquire a " new dynamic " since the number of infections since 2001 has been rising steadily . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researching hiv in the lab - there 's medicine , but no cure three years ago , the institute reported 1,470 hiv infections in germany ; in 2002 , that number rose to 1,716 ; last year , 1,958 people contracted the virus .
that is a 33 percent rise in three years .
the trend toward rising infection rates also affects heterosexuals , half of those infected were men who had sex with men . experts say the reason behind the rise in infections is an increase in unsafe sex and a swing in attitudes toward the dangers of aids . since 1987 , the koch institute has carried out an annual survey about aids awareness in the general public .
in 2003 , the survey found that condom usage in general was falling .
among those surveyed who had multiple sexual partners in 2003 , 78 percent used condoms , down five percent over two years .
manufacturers are even selling fewer condoms in germany .
young people seem especially susceptible to letting their guard down in the heat of the moment . " the general tendency among young people today is to not see fully the risks involved in risky sexual behavior , " rolf gindorf , founder and past president of dgss , a sexuality research center in düsseldorf , told dw-world . " older gay men , say around 40 and up , are aware of the danger because they came of age at a time when death rates were high and aids information was very visible and always on people 's minds , " he said . "
but younger people today , they do n't have that experience .
knowing that the disease can be treated tends to make them carefree when it comes to sex . " the result is a generation gap that has developed between older and younger gay men .
protected sex has become second nature to older gay men , but among today 's youth , while they generally known the rules of safer sex , they often do n't follow them in sexual situations , according to birgit krenz of berlin aids hilfe , an organization that provides counseling and care for people with the disease . the results are becoming clear .
in 2001 , less than 1 percent of the hiv-infected people counseled at berlin aids hilfe were under the age of 20 .
by 2003 , that number had risen to 5 percent . less information after the deluge of aids information up until the late 1990s , according to dr. marita völker-albert of the federal center for health education -lrb- bzga -rrb- , there has been a strong decline over the past five years in public discussion of the disease . " priorities change , and issues like bse or sept .
11 have largely driven aids out of the media and the public mind , " she told dw-world .
" it 's harder to reach people now . " public money made available for education has also fallen off .
in 1987 , when the bzga began its aids awareness campaign , it had an annual budget of 50 million marks -lrb- $ 31.4 million -rrb- .
today , the center 's public awareness campaign has just over a third of that to spend - € 9 million -lrb- $ 11 million -rrb- a year . although he said he knew how to protect himself , andreas still partially blames the lack of a strong public message and vigorous discussion about aids for his infection . " it did n't do much good for me to see some celebrity up there talking about wearing condoms or something , " he said .
" i needed something blatant that could shock me into making the right decisions .

the trend toward rising infection rates also affects heterosexuals , half of those infected were men who had sex with men . experts say the reason behind the rise in infections is an increase in unsafe sex and a swing in attitudes toward the dangers of aids . since 1987 , the koch institute has carried out an annual survey about aids awareness in the general public .
in 2003 , the survey found that condom usage in general was falling .
among those surveyed who had multiple sexual partners in 2003 , 78 percent used condoms , down five percent over two years .
manufacturers are even selling fewer condoms in germany .
young people seem especially susceptible to letting their guard down in the heat of the moment . " the general tendency among young people today is to not see fully the risks involved in risky sexual behavior , " rolf gindorf , founder and past president of dgss , a sexuality research center in düsseldorf , told dw-world . " older gay men , say around 40 and up , are aware of the danger because they came of age at a time when death rates were high and aids information was very visible and always on people 's minds , " he said . "
but younger people today , they do n't have that experience .
knowing that the disease can be treated tends to make them carefree when it comes to sex . " the result is a generation gap that has developed between older and younger gay men .
protected sex has become second nature to older gay men , but among today 's youth , while they generally known the rules of safer sex , they often do n't follow them in sexual situations , according to birgit krenz of berlin aids hilfe , an organization that provides counseling and care for people with the disease . the results are becoming clear .
in 2001 , less than 1 percent of the hiv-infected people counseled at berlin aids hilfe were under the age of 20 .
by 2003 , that number had risen to 5 percent . less information after the deluge of aids information up until the late 1990s , according to dr. marita völker-albert of the federal center for health education -lrb- bzga -rrb- , there has been a strong decline over the past five years in public discussion of the disease . " priorities change , and issues like bse or sept .
11 have largely driven aids out of the media and the public mind , " she told dw-world .
" it 's harder to reach people now . " public money made available for education has also fallen off .
in 1987 , when the bzga began its aids awareness campaign , it had an annual budget of 50 million marks -lrb- $ 31.4 million -rrb- .
today , the center 's public awareness campaign has just over a third of that to spend - € 9 million -lrb- $ 11 million -rrb- a year . although he said he knew how to protect himself , andreas still partially blames the lack of a strong public message and vigorous discussion about aids for his infection . " it did n't do much good for me to see some celebrity up there talking about wearing condoms or something , " he said .
" i needed something blatant that could shock me into making the right decisions . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de researchers warn about aids in eastern europe of the 280,000 new aids infections in europe during the past year , more than 200,000 were reported in areas formerly belonging to the soviet bloc .
the figures are triggering alarm bells among researchers .

still , the most contentious part of schreyer 's plan is not the total expenditure , nor the lack of vision , but the proposed reduction of the € 4 billion rebate given to britain annually . new states would have to pay for britain the 10 new poorer members of the eu feel britain 's 20-year old rebate , which as new members they also have to finance , is unfair .
unlike in the 1980s , britain today is the second-richest eu country in terms of per capita income .
back in 1984 , margaret thatcher , then uk prime minister , when fighting for the rebate , stated : " i want my money back . "
but schreyer explained the situation is much different now than it was two decades ago .
" the sums allocated to new , poorer member states is growing and the british rebate is also growing to the burden of others , " the german commissioner said .
britain now had a " magnificent " economy and no longer needed the rebate , she added .
the british government is fighting tooth and nail against any move to scrap the rebate .
the two british commissioners , neil kinnock and chris patten , should in theory represent the greater ' european ' interest .
but even they tried to persuade romano prodi , president of the commission , to water down schreyer 's rebate plans . patten fears eu backlash in britain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirs patten fears anti-eu sentiment will be fuelled by plans .
external relations commissioner patten wants more understanding of the british position , fearing that if schreyer 's plans are adopted in full , it will not help the knife-edge situation regarding the british public 's views on european union membership . " i am deeply disappointed and concerned that the proposals will set back our ability to argue a positive european case in the uk , " he said . patten also reportedly told schreyer that the plans were " manifestly unfair " and " not the basis for debate .

but the bad news has n't dampened us corporate investors shopping for bargains . given all the complaining in german business circles lately , it hardly seems likely foreign investors would want to dish out money in this country .
with unemployment steadily on the rise , the national budget deficit in stark violation of eu norms , economic growth squeezing by at less than two percent and employees on strike to keep 35-hour work weeks , there is n't much to encourage a positive future outlook for business .
but nobody seems to have shared the negative forecast with american private equity firms looking for a good money-making deal in germany .
us corporate investors have a decidedly different view of the german economy than many of the business leaders here do .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are all gloom and doom when they talk about the economy .
at a recent trans-atlantic business conference in stuttgart , us investors said they generally don ’ t find germany to be as bad off as many germans make it out to be .
instead , a healthy dose of american-flavored optimism was what they recommended to help get the patient back on its feet again .
instituting an emotional turn-around government officials and economic analysts across the country never tire talking about the need for germany to undergo structural economic change .
but the president of the american chamber of commerce in germany , fred irwin , said what the country really needs is an emotional turnaround .
" everyone in the media talks about needing to reform taxes and needing to reform business laws here , " he said .
" but actually nothing is going to dramatically change here if germans don ’ t decide that they ’ re willing to take a risk and that it ’ s necessary to change . "
irwin added that part of germany 's problems stem from a societal stubbornness to change , an affinity for keeping the status quo .
" it ’ s a conservative society , but all around it things are changing , " he said , pointing to germany 's neighbors in europe and markets oversees .
" we have a global market , and so where other countries are changing , germany is standing still , which is very unfortunate . "
american bargain hunters according to irwin , while germany is standing still , americans are busy looking for a good bargain .
many have been successful and have purchased good chunks of the market as corporate restructuring and streamlining within some large german conglomerates is throws up the occasional investment opportunity for big american firms .
the us private equity firm blackstone ’ s recent acquisition of the german chemicals company celanese , is one example .
and with attractive interest rates in germany , blackstone says it ’ s hungry for more takeovers .
the half-full glass why are american investors prepared to spend their money in germany , but germans apparently are not ?
walter raizner , the head of ibm deutschland , the german subsidiary of the american computer giant , pointed to differences in the business culture between the united states and germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : americans are still enthusiastic about the chance for economic recovery .
" first of all , the overall optimism in the united states , in the workforce , is much , much higher , " he said .
" i always describe it as how we look at the glass .
in germany , we always look at the glass as half-empty .
and our american friends always look at the glass as being half-full .
and i think this describes very nicely what the general mindset is , how you approach things in business but also in life . "
americans are also more pragmatic in implementing business decisions , raizner added .
" germans tend to discuss everything to the end , " he said .
" and even if you ’ ve made a decision you keep going on and discussing whether the decision was right or wrong or should we start all over again , " he added , describing the slow momentum in german business negotiations .
in contrast , the americans have a whole different attitude , according to raizner .
" they say , let ’ s move along this pass , " he said .
" if it proves to be wrong , well , we can adjust our course and come to the objective anyhow . "
adding the spice of america german corporate lawyer roderich thümmel , who works with companies on both sides of the atlantic , agrees that germany would be much better off economically if it had a dash of american business confidence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a stock trader toasts with champagne at the stock market in frankfurt , dec .
30 as the dax shows its highest level for the year at end of trading in 2003 . " we germans should be more confident in what we can do , " he stresses .
" we should become more active and we should take an active role in bringing things forward and that is what happens every day in many companies , but the perception in the general public , i think , is more negative than necessary . "
more spending needed the american chamber of commerce in germany says germans have to start spending money , rather than continuing to save it .
and the chamber ’ s president is following that advice and encouraging the company he works for , citigroup , to invest more in germany .
while most german banks are continuing to lay off staff in order to reduce costs , the us banking , insurance and investment corporation citigroup is hiring people in germany .
last year the company ’ s banking sector , citibank , created more than 350 extra positions in order to expand its network of branches .
recently , citibank announced that 200 more jobs will be created this year as part of a further expansion of services mainly in southern germany .
an american-led recovery ?
does this mean american businesses could be leading an economic recovery in germany ?
fred irwin does n't want to go that far , but he does think american businesses can show germans the path they need to take .
" we have in germany a consensus mentality society , " he said .
" and as long as you have an economic boom , a consensus society is very positive because everybody profits from it .
but when you ’ re having some difficulties , we need vision , we need leadership and we need execution . "
american businesses have the vision right now and they are the ones making things happen , irwin believes .

but the bad news has n't dampened us corporate investors shopping for bargains . given all the complaining in german business circles lately , it hardly seems likely foreign investors would want to dish out money in this country .
with unemployment steadily on the rise , the national budget deficit in stark violation of eu norms , economic growth squeezing by at less than two percent and employees on strike to keep 35-hour work weeks , there is n't much to encourage a positive future outlook for business .
but nobody seems to have shared the negative forecast with american private equity firms looking for a good money-making deal in germany .
us corporate investors have a decidedly different view of the german economy than many of the business leaders here do .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are all gloom and doom when they talk about the economy .
at a recent trans-atlantic business conference in stuttgart , us investors said they generally don ’ t find germany to be as bad off as many germans make it out to be .
instead , a healthy dose of american-flavored optimism was what they recommended to help get the patient back on its feet again .
instituting an emotional turn-around government officials and economic analysts across the country never tire talking about the need for germany to undergo structural economic change .
but the president of the american chamber of commerce in germany , fred irwin , said what the country really needs is an emotional turnaround .
" everyone in the media talks about needing to reform taxes and needing to reform business laws here , " he said .
" but actually nothing is going to dramatically change here if germans don ’ t decide that they ’ re willing to take a risk and that it ’ s necessary to change . "
irwin added that part of germany 's problems stem from a societal stubbornness to change , an affinity for keeping the status quo .
" it ’ s a conservative society , but all around it things are changing , " he said , pointing to germany 's neighbors in europe and markets oversees .
" we have a global market , and so where other countries are changing , germany is standing still , which is very unfortunate . "
american bargain hunters according to irwin , while germany is standing still , americans are busy looking for a good bargain .
many have been successful and have purchased good chunks of the market as corporate restructuring and streamlining within some large german conglomerates is throws up the occasional investment opportunity for big american firms .
the us private equity firm blackstone ’ s recent acquisition of the german chemicals company celanese , is one example .
and with attractive interest rates in germany , blackstone says it ’ s hungry for more takeovers .
the half-full glass why are american investors prepared to spend their money in germany , but germans apparently are not ?
walter raizner , the head of ibm deutschland , the german subsidiary of the american computer giant , pointed to differences in the business culture between the united states and germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : americans are still enthusiastic about the chance for economic recovery .
" first of all , the overall optimism in the united states , in the workforce , is much , much higher , " he said .
" i always describe it as how we look at the glass .
in germany , we always look at the glass as half-empty .
and our american friends always look at the glass as being half-full .
and i think this describes very nicely what the general mindset is , how you approach things in business but also in life . "
americans are also more pragmatic in implementing business decisions , raizner added .
" germans tend to discuss everything to the end , " he said .
" and even if you ’ ve made a decision you keep going on and discussing whether the decision was right or wrong or should we start all over again , " he added , describing the slow momentum in german business negotiations .
in contrast , the americans have a whole different attitude , according to raizner .
" they say , let ’ s move along this pass , " he said .
" if it proves to be wrong , well , we can adjust our course and come to the objective anyhow . "
adding the spice of america german corporate lawyer roderich thümmel , who works with companies on both sides of the atlantic , agrees that germany would be much better off economically if it had a dash of american business confidence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a stock trader toasts with champagne at the stock market in frankfurt , dec .
30 as the dax shows its highest level for the year at end of trading in 2003 . " we germans should be more confident in what we can do , " he stresses .
" we should become more active and we should take an active role in bringing things forward and that is what happens every day in many companies , but the perception in the general public , i think , is more negative than necessary . "
more spending needed the american chamber of commerce in germany says germans have to start spending money , rather than continuing to save it .
and the chamber ’ s president is following that advice and encouraging the company he works for , citigroup , to invest more in germany .
while most german banks are continuing to lay off staff in order to reduce costs , the us banking , insurance and investment corporation citigroup is hiring people in germany .
last year the company ’ s banking sector , citibank , created more than 350 extra positions in order to expand its network of branches .
recently , citibank announced that 200 more jobs will be created this year as part of a further expansion of services mainly in southern germany .

still , the most contentious part of schreyer 's plan is not the total expenditure , nor the lack of vision , but the proposed reduction of the € 4 billion rebate given to britain annually . new states would have to pay for britain the 10 new poorer members of the eu feel britain 's 20-year old rebate , which as new members they also have to finance , is unfair .
unlike in the 1980s , britain today is the second-richest eu country in terms of per capita income .
back in 1984 , margaret thatcher , then uk prime minister , when fighting for the rebate , stated : " i want my money back . "
but schreyer explained the situation is much different now than it was two decades ago .
" the sums allocated to new , poorer member states is growing and the british rebate is also growing to the burden of others , " the german commissioner said .
britain now had a " magnificent " economy and no longer needed the rebate , she added .
the british government is fighting tooth and nail against any move to scrap the rebate .
the two british commissioners , neil kinnock and chris patten , should in theory represent the greater ' european ' interest .
but even they tried to persuade romano prodi , president of the commission , to water down schreyer 's rebate plans . patten fears eu backlash in britain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirs patten fears anti-eu sentiment will be fuelled by plans .
external relations commissioner patten wants more understanding of the british position , fearing that if schreyer 's plans are adopted in full , it will not help the knife-edge situation regarding the british public 's views on european union membership . " i am deeply disappointed and concerned that the proposals will set back our ability to argue a positive european case in the uk , " he said . patten also reportedly told schreyer that the plans were " manifestly unfair " and " not the basis for debate .

what started as an operation for saving ski areas has turned out to be a successful environmental measure to protect glaciers from melting away .
germany 's zugspitze now spends most of the year undercover . while most people in germany are complaining about the unseasonable temperatures this summer , the cool , wet weather has been a boon to germany 's highest mountain , the zugspitze .
after a fresh dusting of snow on germany 's most famous glacier this past week , environmentalists let out a sigh of relief .
but things are n't always this cool in the icy heights of the german alps .
summers usually bring rising temperatures and glaring sunshine .
although the balmy weather may be just what the calendar calls for in the rest of the country , on the zugspitze warm days are frowned upon .
with every rise in the mercury , precious centimeters of one of germany 's few remaining glaciers melt away .
it 's estimated that global warming results in a loss of about 10 centimeters of the glacier every year .
at that rate , not much is expected to survive through the next century , says the society for environmental research in munich in its online glacier archive .
to preserve this unique environment , dedicated workers at the zugspitzbahn , the cable car operator up to the peak , have devised a giant sun shade to protect the ice on top of the 2,962 meter-high mountain .
every year for the past 10 years , they spread out about 6,000 square meters -lrb- 19,000 sq. feet -rrb- of mats and tarpaulins on the glacier 's surface .
the white material reflects sunlight and insulates against the heat , preventing further melting of the snow and ice .
keeping the glacier under wraps bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : covering up the zugspitze the canvas also helps protect the glacier from warm summer rain , " which virtually devours the snow , " says stephanie vogel of the zugspitzbahn .
vogel and her colleagues at the peak 's cable car are in favor of the giant sunshade .
although she admits it is work to cover the glacier , it is import for preserving the fragile condition on the mountain top for posterity .
originally the idea was developed to protect snow in popular ski areas , but vogel says it has moved beyond the economic aspects related to tourism and has turned out to be a successful environmental measure .
to critics she acknowledges the sun shield is an " intervention in nature . "
any attempt to save an at-risk environment implies intervention , she argues .
the tarps , she believes , are the least dramatic interference .
in other places , snow guns are used to keep mountain peaks and especially ski resorts covered in white powder .
germany , however , is against relying on artificial snow because of the environmental concerns and the cost of energy involved .
consequences of glacial melting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at 2,963 meters , the zugspitze in bavaria is germany 's highest mountain .
the zugspitze is not alone in its battle against global warming .
environmentalists say glaciers are some of the most threatened ecosystems on earth .
they function as " global thermometers " and are extremely sensitive to the world 's rising temperature .
global warming , the lack of snow in winter , hot summers as well as air pollution and acid rain are responsible for shrinking glaciers , says the society for environmental research in munich .
more than just the loss of a valuable landscape , the defrosting of the permanent glacial ice - the permafrost - causes landslides and avalanches as the rocky undersurface is revealed and erodes in the rough wind .
resources of potable water provided by glacial ice also become more scarce , the society warns on its web site .
given current rates of greenhouse gas emissions , the anti-glare shield on the zugspitze may in the end only represent a last-ditch effort to slow down the almost inevitable glacier diminution .
" as contemporary witnesses of this rapid melting we are at least able to experience real glaciers .

what started as an operation for saving ski areas has turned out to be a successful environmental measure to protect glaciers from melting away .
germany 's zugspitze now spends most of the year undercover . while most people in germany are complaining about the unseasonable temperatures this summer , the cool , wet weather has been a boon to germany 's highest mountain , the zugspitze .
after a fresh dusting of snow on germany 's most famous glacier this past week , environmentalists let out a sigh of relief .
but things are n't always this cool in the icy heights of the german alps .
summers usually bring rising temperatures and glaring sunshine .
although the balmy weather may be just what the calendar calls for in the rest of the country , on the zugspitze warm days are frowned upon .
with every rise in the mercury , precious centimeters of one of germany 's few remaining glaciers melt away .
it 's estimated that global warming results in a loss of about 10 centimeters of the glacier every year .
at that rate , not much is expected to survive through the next century , says the society for environmental research in munich in its online glacier archive .
to preserve this unique environment , dedicated workers at the zugspitzbahn , the cable car operator up to the peak , have devised a giant sun shade to protect the ice on top of the 2,962 meter-high mountain .
every year for the past 10 years , they spread out about 6,000 square meters -lrb- 19,000 sq. feet -rrb- of mats and tarpaulins on the glacier 's surface .
the white material reflects sunlight and insulates against the heat , preventing further melting of the snow and ice .
keeping the glacier under wraps bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : covering up the zugspitze the canvas also helps protect the glacier from warm summer rain , " which virtually devours the snow , " says stephanie vogel of the zugspitzbahn .
vogel and her colleagues at the peak 's cable car are in favor of the giant sunshade .
although she admits it is work to cover the glacier , it is import for preserving the fragile condition on the mountain top for posterity .
originally the idea was developed to protect snow in popular ski areas , but vogel says it has moved beyond the economic aspects related to tourism and has turned out to be a successful environmental measure .
to critics she acknowledges the sun shield is an " intervention in nature . "
any attempt to save an at-risk environment implies intervention , she argues .
the tarps , she believes , are the least dramatic interference .
in other places , snow guns are used to keep mountain peaks and especially ski resorts covered in white powder .
germany , however , is against relying on artificial snow because of the environmental concerns and the cost of energy involved .

sounds sad ?
it is , but if psychologists are to be believed , it 's just a temporary phenomenon .
reading simply has too many advantages , they say .
if only you can find the time for it . the book industry in germany is lamenting the " general reluctance of consumers to loosen their purse strings . "
the united states is threatening to become a nation of non-readers .
according to one study , not even every second adult there reads novels , letalone poetry . it 's a dire situation in need of remedy . ups and downs but before succumbing to despair , it might be worthwhile listening to thomas anz , professor of psychology at the university of marburg who 's researched the psychology of reading and authored a book called " literature and enjoyment - the ups and downs of reading .

risky behavior is increasing as a new generation appears willing to close its eyes to the dangers of hiv / aids . at 20 years old , many young adults are busy getting their college degrees or beginning their work lives , often excited at the broad expanse of possibilities in front of them .
however , for 20-year-old andreas , a gay berlin resident , a dark cloud has formed on his horizon ; he found out recently he has been infected with hiv , the virus that causes aids . andreas , who asked that his real name not be used , is having difficulty coming to terms with a diagnosis that has changed his future irrevocably .
while hiv is no longer the death sentence it once was , andreas will have to begin a demanding drug regime to keep aids at bay - and there are no guarantees .
the disease still kills 600 people in germany every year . " there is too little information out there , " he told dw-world .
" i never thought it could happen to me . " " new dynamic " to epidemic for some time in the mid to late 1990s , researchers and health care professionals working in the areas of hiv / aids could take comfort in the statistics : the number of hiv infections was falling annually ; the message of safer sex seemed to have gotten out . but a report out by the robert koch institute , a federal organization that researches disease control and prevention , warns that the epidemic of hiv in germany could acquire a " new dynamic " since the number of infections since 2001 has been rising steadily . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researching hiv in the lab - there 's medicine , but no cure three years ago , the institute reported 1,470 hiv infections in germany ; in 2002 , that number rose to 1,716 ; last year , 1,958 people contracted the virus .
that is a 33 percent rise in three years .
the trend toward rising infection rates also affects heterosexuals , half of those infected were men who had sex with men . experts say the reason behind the rise in infections is an increase in unsafe sex and a swing in attitudes toward the dangers of aids . since 1987 , the koch institute has carried out an annual survey about aids awareness in the general public .
in 2003 , the survey found that condom usage in general was falling .
among those surveyed who had multiple sexual partners in 2003 , 78 percent used condoms , down five percent over two years .
manufacturers are even selling fewer condoms in germany .
young people seem especially susceptible to letting their guard down in the heat of the moment . " the general tendency among young people today is to not see fully the risks involved in risky sexual behavior , " rolf gindorf , founder and past president of dgss , a sexuality research center in düsseldorf , told dw-world . " older gay men , say around 40 and up , are aware of the danger because they came of age at a time when death rates were high and aids information was very visible and always on people 's minds , " he said . "
but younger people today , they do n't have that experience .
knowing that the disease can be treated tends to make them carefree when it comes to sex . " the result is a generation gap that has developed between older and younger gay men .
protected sex has become second nature to older gay men , but among today 's youth , while they generally known the rules of safer sex , they often do n't follow them in sexual situations , according to birgit krenz of berlin aids hilfe , an organization that provides counseling and care for people with the disease . the results are becoming clear .
in 2001 , less than 1 percent of the hiv-infected people counseled at berlin aids hilfe were under the age of 20 .
by 2003 , that number had risen to 5 percent . less information after the deluge of aids information up until the late 1990s , according to dr. marita völker-albert of the federal center for health education -lrb- bzga -rrb- , there has been a strong decline over the past five years in public discussion of the disease . " priorities change , and issues like bse or sept .
11 have largely driven aids out of the media and the public mind , " she told dw-world .
" it 's harder to reach people now . " public money made available for education has also fallen off .
in 1987 , when the bzga began its aids awareness campaign , it had an annual budget of 50 million marks -lrb- $ 31.4 million -rrb- .
today , the center 's public awareness campaign has just over a third of that to spend - € 9 million -lrb- $ 11 million -rrb- a year . although he said he knew how to protect himself , andreas still partially blames the lack of a strong public message and vigorous discussion about aids for his infection . " it did n't do much good for me to see some celebrity up there talking about wearing condoms or something , " he said .

risky behavior is increasing as a new generation appears willing to close its eyes to the dangers of hiv / aids . at 20 years old , many young adults are busy getting their college degrees or beginning their work lives , often excited at the broad expanse of possibilities in front of them .
however , for 20-year-old andreas , a gay berlin resident , a dark cloud has formed on his horizon ; he found out recently he has been infected with hiv , the virus that causes aids . andreas , who asked that his real name not be used , is having difficulty coming to terms with a diagnosis that has changed his future irrevocably .
while hiv is no longer the death sentence it once was , andreas will have to begin a demanding drug regime to keep aids at bay - and there are no guarantees .
the disease still kills 600 people in germany every year . " there is too little information out there , " he told dw-world .
" i never thought it could happen to me . " " new dynamic " to epidemic for some time in the mid to late 1990s , researchers and health care professionals working in the areas of hiv / aids could take comfort in the statistics : the number of hiv infections was falling annually ; the message of safer sex seemed to have gotten out . but a report out by the robert koch institute , a federal organization that researches disease control and prevention , warns that the epidemic of hiv in germany could acquire a " new dynamic " since the number of infections since 2001 has been rising steadily . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researching hiv in the lab - there 's medicine , but no cure three years ago , the institute reported 1,470 hiv infections in germany ; in 2002 , that number rose to 1,716 ; last year , 1,958 people contracted the virus .

" in germany , the constitution forbids the referendum and we will respect the constitution , " the chancellor said . just a day earlier , french president jacques chirac announced he would let france vote on the eu charter , a move that is considered risky despite opinion polls showing a majority of french citizens backing the constitution . spain , portugal , denmark , ireland and luxembourg have also said they will hold referendums on the constitution .
" what the others do is the decision of the respective national governments , " schröder said when pressed on the issue . after nearly two years of wrangling , european union leaders agreed to the first-ever constitution for the bloc at a historic summit in brussels last month . the document , which is designed to streamline the complex web of institutions in an expanded eu and prevent decision-making deadlock among the bloc 's 25 members , must be ratified by all eu member states in the next two years before it comes into full force . german-british ties in good form schröder , one of the staunchest opponents of the us-led war to oust saddam hussein in march 2003 , met blair a day after an official inquiry lambasted the british government 's intelligence on iraq 's weapons of mass destruction as " seriously flawed " and " unreliable " , but absolved blair of responsibility for the failings . the results , which provided some relief to a beleaguered blair , came in the middle of what has been labeled one of blair 's toughest weeks in office since coming to power in 1997 . on thursday , schröder sought to present a united front with blair and stressed that german-british relations had not been strained by their disagreement last month on nominating a successor to romano prodi , the eu commission president . schröder said discussions with blair were as friendly as ever and pointed out that eu leaders had finally agreed on portuguese leader jose manuel barroso for the post .
" we are now going to collectively see that he is a success , " schröder said . " germany a brilliant investment location " after meeting with blair , schröder went on to speak with british business representatives and investors informing them on the economic reforms underway in germany . the german government launched a drive last year to pass the " agenda 2010 " reform package , intended to overhaul germany 's creaking social welfare systems and drive down unemployment , balance the budget and jumpstart the spluttering economy . " germany is a brilliant investment location that should not shy away from any global comparison and does not , " schröder said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report clears blair , assails british intelligence an official british inquiry wednesday lambasted the state of pre-war intelligence on iraq 's weapons of mass destruction but cleared prime minister tony blair of responsibility for the failings .

some 600 workers at a mercedes plant in düsseldorf kicked off the action with an overnight demonstration by torchlight through the city streets . at daimlerchrysler 's main site in sindelfingen , near stuttgart in southern germany , around 20,00 employees answered the call to strike and stopped work for two hours earlier in the morning .
further stoppages have been staged at car and truck factories throughout the country during the course of the day , notably in berlin , bremen and hamburg , said ig metall and the employee 's council .

the strikes at all the german mercedes factories are a direct response to daimlerchrysler 's threats to shift production of its new mercedes c-class sedan away from sindelfingen to south africa if unions do not agree to € 500 million -lrb- $ 615 million -rrb- in personnel cost costs .
such a move could result in the loss of 6,000 jobs in sindelfingen .
ig metall slammed the threat as " blackmail " and vowed to fight the company 's plans .
protestors in sindelfingen , a factory which employs close to 30,000 people , rallied around the union and displayed signs crying out , " it 's war . "
the head of the employee 's council in sindelfingen , erich klemm , said the union was willing to offer pay reductions up to € 180 million , but not management 's " outrageous " demands for half a billion in reductions .
a climate of fear daimlerchrysler has also threatened to move some jobs from sindelfingen to bremen , where production costs are lower , and to change contracts to eliminate extra pay for late shifts and five-minute breaks on every hour , effectively leading to an increase of the work week without more pay .
" such proposals make me sick , " said klemm , who vowed that all the mercedes factories would stick together in a show of solidarity .
the president of germany 's parliament , wolfgang thierse , lashed out at daimlerchrysler management for " creating a climate of fear . "

some 600 workers at a mercedes plant in düsseldorf kicked off the action with an overnight demonstration by torchlight through the city streets . at daimlerchrysler 's main site in sindelfingen , near stuttgart in southern germany , around 20,00 employees answered the call to strike and stopped work for two hours earlier in the morning .
further stoppages have been staged at car and truck factories throughout the country during the course of the day , notably in berlin , bremen and hamburg , said ig metall and the employee 's council .
the carmaker employs around 160,000 people in germany and some reports suggest that as much as half the workforce could join in the protests .
" it 's war " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 600 night-shift workers at a mercedes plant in düsseldorf demonstrate in the early hours of thursday , july 15 , 2004 .
the strikes at all the german mercedes factories are a direct response to daimlerchrysler 's threats to shift production of its new mercedes c-class sedan away from sindelfingen to south africa if unions do not agree to € 500 million -lrb- $ 615 million -rrb- in personnel cost costs .
such a move could result in the loss of 6,000 jobs in sindelfingen .
ig metall slammed the threat as " blackmail " and vowed to fight the company 's plans .
protestors in sindelfingen , a factory which employs close to 30,000 people , rallied around the union and displayed signs crying out , " it 's war . "
the head of the employee 's council in sindelfingen , erich klemm , said the union was willing to offer pay reductions up to € 180 million , but not management 's " outrageous " demands for half a billion in reductions .
a climate of fear daimlerchrysler has also threatened to move some jobs from sindelfingen to bremen , where production costs are lower , and to change contracts to eliminate extra pay for late shifts and five-minute breaks on every hour , effectively leading to an increase of the work week without more pay .
" such proposals make me sick , " said klemm , who vowed that all the mercedes factories would stick together in a show of solidarity .
the president of germany 's parliament , wolfgang thierse , lashed out at daimlerchrysler management for " creating a climate of fear . "
" it 's repulsive to exert pressure on employees by making ultimatums , " he told the daily tagesspiegel on thursday . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de industry 's upper hand at the negotiating table siemens two weeks ago , daimlerchrysler this week .

but the bad news has n't dampened us corporate investors shopping for bargains . given all the complaining in german business circles lately , it hardly seems likely foreign investors would want to dish out money in this country .
with unemployment steadily on the rise , the national budget deficit in stark violation of eu norms , economic growth squeezing by at less than two percent and employees on strike to keep 35-hour work weeks , there is n't much to encourage a positive future outlook for business .
but nobody seems to have shared the negative forecast with american private equity firms looking for a good money-making deal in germany .
us corporate investors have a decidedly different view of the german economy than many of the business leaders here do .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are all gloom and doom when they talk about the economy .
at a recent trans-atlantic business conference in stuttgart , us investors said they generally don ’ t find germany to be as bad off as many germans make it out to be .
instead , a healthy dose of american-flavored optimism was what they recommended to help get the patient back on its feet again .
instituting an emotional turn-around government officials and economic analysts across the country never tire talking about the need for germany to undergo structural economic change .
but the president of the american chamber of commerce in germany , fred irwin , said what the country really needs is an emotional turnaround .
" everyone in the media talks about needing to reform taxes and needing to reform business laws here , " he said .
" but actually nothing is going to dramatically change here if germans don ’ t decide that they ’ re willing to take a risk and that it ’ s necessary to change . "
irwin added that part of germany 's problems stem from a societal stubbornness to change , an affinity for keeping the status quo .
" it ’ s a conservative society , but all around it things are changing , " he said , pointing to germany 's neighbors in europe and markets oversees .
" we have a global market , and so where other countries are changing , germany is standing still , which is very unfortunate . "
american bargain hunters according to irwin , while germany is standing still , americans are busy looking for a good bargain .
many have been successful and have purchased good chunks of the market as corporate restructuring and streamlining within some large german conglomerates is throws up the occasional investment opportunity for big american firms .
the us private equity firm blackstone ’ s recent acquisition of the german chemicals company celanese , is one example .
and with attractive interest rates in germany , blackstone says it ’ s hungry for more takeovers .
the half-full glass why are american investors prepared to spend their money in germany , but germans apparently are not ?
walter raizner , the head of ibm deutschland , the german subsidiary of the american computer giant , pointed to differences in the business culture between the united states and germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : americans are still enthusiastic about the chance for economic recovery .
" first of all , the overall optimism in the united states , in the workforce , is much , much higher , " he said .
" i always describe it as how we look at the glass .
in germany , we always look at the glass as half-empty .
and our american friends always look at the glass as being half-full .
and i think this describes very nicely what the general mindset is , how you approach things in business but also in life . "
americans are also more pragmatic in implementing business decisions , raizner added .
" germans tend to discuss everything to the end , " he said .
" and even if you ’ ve made a decision you keep going on and discussing whether the decision was right or wrong or should we start all over again , " he added , describing the slow momentum in german business negotiations .
in contrast , the americans have a whole different attitude , according to raizner .
" they say , let ’ s move along this pass , " he said .
" if it proves to be wrong , well , we can adjust our course and come to the objective anyhow . "
adding the spice of america german corporate lawyer roderich thümmel , who works with companies on both sides of the atlantic , agrees that germany would be much better off economically if it had a dash of american business confidence .

" we should become more active and we should take an active role in bringing things forward and that is what happens every day in many companies , but the perception in the general public , i think , is more negative than necessary . "
more spending needed the american chamber of commerce in germany says germans have to start spending money , rather than continuing to save it .
and the chamber ’ s president is following that advice and encouraging the company he works for , citigroup , to invest more in germany .
while most german banks are continuing to lay off staff in order to reduce costs , the us banking , insurance and investment corporation citigroup is hiring people in germany .
last year the company ’ s banking sector , citibank , created more than 350 extra positions in order to expand its network of branches .
recently , citibank announced that 200 more jobs will be created this year as part of a further expansion of services mainly in southern germany .
an american-led recovery ?
does this mean american businesses could be leading an economic recovery in germany ?
fred irwin does n't want to go that far , but he does think american businesses can show germans the path they need to take .
" we have in germany a consensus mentality society , " he said .
" and as long as you have an economic boom , a consensus society is very positive because everybody profits from it .
but when you ’ re having some difficulties , we need vision , we need leadership and we need execution . "
american businesses have the vision right now and they are the ones making things happen , irwin believes .

but the bad news has n't dampened us corporate investors shopping for bargains . given all the complaining in german business circles lately , it hardly seems likely foreign investors would want to dish out money in this country .
with unemployment steadily on the rise , the national budget deficit in stark violation of eu norms , economic growth squeezing by at less than two percent and employees on strike to keep 35-hour work weeks , there is n't much to encourage a positive future outlook for business .
but nobody seems to have shared the negative forecast with american private equity firms looking for a good money-making deal in germany .
us corporate investors have a decidedly different view of the german economy than many of the business leaders here do .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are all gloom and doom when they talk about the economy .
at a recent trans-atlantic business conference in stuttgart , us investors said they generally don ’ t find germany to be as bad off as many germans make it out to be .
instead , a healthy dose of american-flavored optimism was what they recommended to help get the patient back on its feet again .
instituting an emotional turn-around government officials and economic analysts across the country never tire talking about the need for germany to undergo structural economic change .
but the president of the american chamber of commerce in germany , fred irwin , said what the country really needs is an emotional turnaround .
" everyone in the media talks about needing to reform taxes and needing to reform business laws here , " he said .
" but actually nothing is going to dramatically change here if germans don ’ t decide that they ’ re willing to take a risk and that it ’ s necessary to change . "
irwin added that part of germany 's problems stem from a societal stubbornness to change , an affinity for keeping the status quo .
" it ’ s a conservative society , but all around it things are changing , " he said , pointing to germany 's neighbors in europe and markets oversees .
" we have a global market , and so where other countries are changing , germany is standing still , which is very unfortunate . "
american bargain hunters according to irwin , while germany is standing still , americans are busy looking for a good bargain .
many have been successful and have purchased good chunks of the market as corporate restructuring and streamlining within some large german conglomerates is throws up the occasional investment opportunity for big american firms .
the us private equity firm blackstone ’ s recent acquisition of the german chemicals company celanese , is one example .
and with attractive interest rates in germany , blackstone says it ’ s hungry for more takeovers .
the half-full glass why are american investors prepared to spend their money in germany , but germans apparently are not ?
walter raizner , the head of ibm deutschland , the german subsidiary of the american computer giant , pointed to differences in the business culture between the united states and germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : americans are still enthusiastic about the chance for economic recovery .
" first of all , the overall optimism in the united states , in the workforce , is much , much higher , " he said .
" i always describe it as how we look at the glass .
in germany , we always look at the glass as half-empty .
and our american friends always look at the glass as being half-full .
and i think this describes very nicely what the general mindset is , how you approach things in business but also in life . "
americans are also more pragmatic in implementing business decisions , raizner added .
" germans tend to discuss everything to the end , " he said .
" and even if you ’ ve made a decision you keep going on and discussing whether the decision was right or wrong or should we start all over again , " he added , describing the slow momentum in german business negotiations .
in contrast , the americans have a whole different attitude , according to raizner .
" they say , let ’ s move along this pass , " he said .
" if it proves to be wrong , well , we can adjust our course and come to the objective anyhow . "
adding the spice of america german corporate lawyer roderich thümmel , who works with companies on both sides of the atlantic , agrees that germany would be much better off economically if it had a dash of american business confidence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a stock trader toasts with champagne at the stock market in frankfurt , dec .
30 as the dax shows its highest level for the year at end of trading in 2003 . " we germans should be more confident in what we can do , " he stresses .
" we should become more active and we should take an active role in bringing things forward and that is what happens every day in many companies , but the perception in the general public , i think , is more negative than necessary . "
more spending needed the american chamber of commerce in germany says germans have to start spending money , rather than continuing to save it .
and the chamber ’ s president is following that advice and encouraging the company he works for , citigroup , to invest more in germany .
while most german banks are continuing to lay off staff in order to reduce costs , the us banking , insurance and investment corporation citigroup is hiring people in germany .
last year the company ’ s banking sector , citibank , created more than 350 extra positions in order to expand its network of branches .
recently , citibank announced that 200 more jobs will be created this year as part of a further expansion of services mainly in southern germany .
an american-led recovery ?
does this mean american businesses could be leading an economic recovery in germany ?
fred irwin does n't want to go that far , but he does think american businesses can show germans the path they need to take .
" we have in germany a consensus mentality society , " he said .
" and as long as you have an economic boom , a consensus society is very positive because everybody profits from it .

but the bad news has n't dampened us corporate investors shopping for bargains . given all the complaining in german business circles lately , it hardly seems likely foreign investors would want to dish out money in this country .
with unemployment steadily on the rise , the national budget deficit in stark violation of eu norms , economic growth squeezing by at less than two percent and employees on strike to keep 35-hour work weeks , there is n't much to encourage a positive future outlook for business .
but nobody seems to have shared the negative forecast with american private equity firms looking for a good money-making deal in germany .
us corporate investors have a decidedly different view of the german economy than many of the business leaders here do .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are all gloom and doom when they talk about the economy .
at a recent trans-atlantic business conference in stuttgart , us investors said they generally don ’ t find germany to be as bad off as many germans make it out to be .
instead , a healthy dose of american-flavored optimism was what they recommended to help get the patient back on its feet again .
instituting an emotional turn-around government officials and economic analysts across the country never tire talking about the need for germany to undergo structural economic change .
but the president of the american chamber of commerce in germany , fred irwin , said what the country really needs is an emotional turnaround .
" everyone in the media talks about needing to reform taxes and needing to reform business laws here , " he said .
" but actually nothing is going to dramatically change here if germans don ’ t decide that they ’ re willing to take a risk and that it ’ s necessary to change . "
irwin added that part of germany 's problems stem from a societal stubbornness to change , an affinity for keeping the status quo .
" it ’ s a conservative society , but all around it things are changing , " he said , pointing to germany 's neighbors in europe and markets oversees .
" we have a global market , and so where other countries are changing , germany is standing still , which is very unfortunate . "
american bargain hunters according to irwin , while germany is standing still , americans are busy looking for a good bargain .
many have been successful and have purchased good chunks of the market as corporate restructuring and streamlining within some large german conglomerates is throws up the occasional investment opportunity for big american firms .
the us private equity firm blackstone ’ s recent acquisition of the german chemicals company celanese , is one example .
and with attractive interest rates in germany , blackstone says it ’ s hungry for more takeovers .
the half-full glass why are american investors prepared to spend their money in germany , but germans apparently are not ?
walter raizner , the head of ibm deutschland , the german subsidiary of the american computer giant , pointed to differences in the business culture between the united states and germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : americans are still enthusiastic about the chance for economic recovery .
" first of all , the overall optimism in the united states , in the workforce , is much , much higher , " he said .
" i always describe it as how we look at the glass .
in germany , we always look at the glass as half-empty .
and our american friends always look at the glass as being half-full .
and i think this describes very nicely what the general mindset is , how you approach things in business but also in life . "
americans are also more pragmatic in implementing business decisions , raizner added .
" germans tend to discuss everything to the end , " he said .
" and even if you ’ ve made a decision you keep going on and discussing whether the decision was right or wrong or should we start all over again , " he added , describing the slow momentum in german business negotiations .
in contrast , the americans have a whole different attitude , according to raizner .
" they say , let ’ s move along this pass , " he said .
" if it proves to be wrong , well , we can adjust our course and come to the objective anyhow . "
adding the spice of america german corporate lawyer roderich thümmel , who works with companies on both sides of the atlantic , agrees that germany would be much better off economically if it had a dash of american business confidence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a stock trader toasts with champagne at the stock market in frankfurt , dec .
30 as the dax shows its highest level for the year at end of trading in 2003 . " we germans should be more confident in what we can do , " he stresses .
" we should become more active and we should take an active role in bringing things forward and that is what happens every day in many companies , but the perception in the general public , i think , is more negative than necessary . "
more spending needed the american chamber of commerce in germany says germans have to start spending money , rather than continuing to save it .
and the chamber ’ s president is following that advice and encouraging the company he works for , citigroup , to invest more in germany .
while most german banks are continuing to lay off staff in order to reduce costs , the us banking , insurance and investment corporation citigroup is hiring people in germany .
last year the company ’ s banking sector , citibank , created more than 350 extra positions in order to expand its network of branches .
recently , citibank announced that 200 more jobs will be created this year as part of a further expansion of services mainly in southern germany .
an american-led recovery ?
does this mean american businesses could be leading an economic recovery in germany ?
fred irwin does n't want to go that far , but he does think american businesses can show germans the path they need to take .
" we have in germany a consensus mentality society , " he said .
" and as long as you have an economic boom , a consensus society is very positive because everybody profits from it .
but when you ’ re having some difficulties , we need vision , we need leadership and we need execution . "
american businesses have the vision right now and they are the ones making things happen , irwin believes .

sounds sad ?
it is , but if psychologists are to be believed , it 's just a temporary phenomenon .
reading simply has too many advantages , they say .
if only you can find the time for it . the book industry in germany is lamenting the " general reluctance of consumers to loosen their purse strings . "
the united states is threatening to become a nation of non-readers .
according to one study , not even every second adult there reads novels , letalone poetry . it 's a dire situation in need of remedy . ups and downs but before succumbing to despair , it might be worthwhile listening to thomas anz , professor of psychology at the university of marburg who 's researched the psychology of reading and authored a book called " literature and enjoyment - the ups and downs of reading . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman reads a book anz has concluded that reading is the " joy of being blown away " , a kind of trance situation , from which a person can switch back to reality anytime . reading , says anz , is the hunger for tension , for laughter , the horrible and the shocking .
in other words , it 's the joy of emotions . but reading is also the joy of discovering intellectual links and references .
" reading is like a game that the reader shares with the author , " says anz .
even the writing of a book is closely related to the pleasure of playing a game , he adds . " much like other games , one has to train the " reading " game , " says the psychologist and adds that the better one trains , the smoother the reading experience is .
" many give up in the training phase and do n't reach the real pleasure level of reading .

in 2000 in sydney , the numbers were 19 and 10 . this year , doping allegations and disqualifications have cast a shadow over the star-studded track and field team .
at least eight of the stars from games past either face doping bans or have not qualified for the games in events they typically dominated . big names fall alvin harrison , silver medalist in the 400m in sydney , jerome young , world champ in the 400m in paris in 2003 and marion jones , who won every 100m race between 1997 and 2001 , all failed to qualify for the olympics at the us track and field trials in the past week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marion jones lands in the sand pit during the long jump competition at the us olympic track and field trials in sacramento in 2000 of the three , only jones , who has been haunted by doping allegations , can still qualify for the games , in the long jump or 200m .

" in germany , the constitution forbids the referendum and we will respect the constitution , " the chancellor said . just a day earlier , french president jacques chirac announced he would let france vote on the eu charter , a move that is considered risky despite opinion polls showing a majority of french citizens backing the constitution . spain , portugal , denmark , ireland and luxembourg have also said they will hold referendums on the constitution .
" what the others do is the decision of the respective national governments , " schröder said when pressed on the issue . after nearly two years of wrangling , european union leaders agreed to the first-ever constitution for the bloc at a historic summit in brussels last month . the document , which is designed to streamline the complex web of institutions in an expanded eu and prevent decision-making deadlock among the bloc 's 25 members , must be ratified by all eu member states in the next two years before it comes into full force . german-british ties in good form schröder , one of the staunchest opponents of the us-led war to oust saddam hussein in march 2003 , met blair a day after an official inquiry lambasted the british government 's intelligence on iraq 's weapons of mass destruction as " seriously flawed " and " unreliable " , but absolved blair of responsibility for the failings . the results , which provided some relief to a beleaguered blair , came in the middle of what has been labeled one of blair 's toughest weeks in office since coming to power in 1997 . on thursday , schröder sought to present a united front with blair and stressed that german-british relations had not been strained by their disagreement last month on nominating a successor to romano prodi , the eu commission president . schröder said discussions with blair were as friendly as ever and pointed out that eu leaders had finally agreed on portuguese leader jose manuel barroso for the post .
" we are now going to collectively see that he is a success , " schröder said . " germany a brilliant investment location " after meeting with blair , schröder went on to speak with british business representatives and investors informing them on the economic reforms underway in germany . the german government launched a drive last year to pass the " agenda 2010 " reform package , intended to overhaul germany 's creaking social welfare systems and drive down unemployment , balance the budget and jumpstart the spluttering economy . " germany is a brilliant investment location that should not shy away from any global comparison and does not , " schröder said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report clears blair , assails british intelligence an official british inquiry wednesday lambasted the state of pre-war intelligence on iraq 's weapons of mass destruction but cleared prime minister tony blair of responsibility for the failings .

" germany a brilliant investment location " after meeting with blair , schröder went on to speak with british business representatives and investors informing them on the economic reforms underway in germany . the german government launched a drive last year to pass the " agenda 2010 " reform package , intended to overhaul germany 's creaking social welfare systems and drive down unemployment , balance the budget and jumpstart the spluttering economy .

sounds sad ?
it is , but if psychologists are to be believed , it 's just a temporary phenomenon .
reading simply has too many advantages , they say .
if only you can find the time for it . the book industry in germany is lamenting the " general reluctance of consumers to loosen their purse strings . "
the united states is threatening to become a nation of non-readers .
according to one study , not even every second adult there reads novels , letalone poetry . it 's a dire situation in need of remedy . ups and downs but before succumbing to despair , it might be worthwhile listening to thomas anz , professor of psychology at the university of marburg who 's researched the psychology of reading and authored a book called " literature and enjoyment - the ups and downs of reading . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman reads a book anz has concluded that reading is the " joy of being blown away " , a kind of trance situation , from which a person can switch back to reality anytime . reading , says anz , is the hunger for tension , for laughter , the horrible and the shocking .
in other words , it 's the joy of emotions . but reading is also the joy of discovering intellectual links and references .
" reading is like a game that the reader shares with the author , " says anz .
even the writing of a book is closely related to the pleasure of playing a game , he adds . " much like other games , one has to train the " reading " game , " says the psychologist and adds that the better one trains , the smoother the reading experience is .
" many give up in the training phase and do n't reach the real pleasure level of reading . " linked to social approval just because fewer people are taking time to read does n't automatically mean there 's a crisis brewing . the significance of reading to a society has historically been linked to social approval .
in the 18th century europe , reading was considered a highly immoral addiction .
at the time , only about 10 percent of all europeans could read .
knowledge and culture was largely transmitted through the theatre . now , anz expects reading to come into vogue again as a sort of backlash against the excessive presence of television , videos , and films in western society . " today reading is considered necessary in western society , and people consider too much video-watching as alarming , " said anz . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young harry potter fans read in front of a 1942-built locomotive at the kiel railway station on nov .
8 , 2003 the psychologist is certain that the joy of reading will make a comeback , even if it 's kids hungry for the next harry potter adventure who at the fore of the turnaround . after all , it was harry 's creator , j.k. rowling who received an honorary doctorate from the university of edinburgh because her novels proved to have the magic touch that could lure youngsters away from the small screen , and back to books . monika hülsken-stobbe -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de building bridges with books building a bridge between the middle east and the west is no small task , but its something the organizers of this year 's book fair in frankfurt hope to accomplish .

" what the others do is the decision of the respective national governments , " schröder said when pressed on the issue . after nearly two years of wrangling , european union leaders agreed to the first-ever constitution for the bloc at a historic summit in brussels last month . the document , which is designed to streamline the complex web of institutions in an expanded eu and prevent decision-making deadlock among the bloc 's 25 members , must be ratified by all eu member states in the next two years before it comes into full force . german-british ties in good form schröder , one of the staunchest opponents of the us-led war to oust saddam hussein in march 2003 , met blair a day after an official inquiry lambasted the british government 's intelligence on iraq 's weapons of mass destruction as " seriously flawed " and " unreliable " , but absolved blair of responsibility for the failings . the results , which provided some relief to a beleaguered blair , came in the middle of what has been labeled one of blair 's toughest weeks in office since coming to power in 1997 . on thursday , schröder sought to present a united front with blair and stressed that german-british relations had not been strained by their disagreement last month on nominating a successor to romano prodi , the eu commission president . schröder said discussions with blair were as friendly as ever and pointed out that eu leaders had finally agreed on portuguese leader jose manuel barroso for the post .
" we are now going to collectively see that he is a success , " schröder said . " germany a brilliant investment location " after meeting with blair , schröder went on to speak with british business representatives and investors informing them on the economic reforms underway in germany . the german government launched a drive last year to pass the " agenda 2010 " reform package , intended to overhaul germany 's creaking social welfare systems and drive down unemployment , balance the budget and jumpstart the spluttering economy . " germany is a brilliant investment location that should not shy away from any global comparison and does not , " schröder said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report clears blair , assails british intelligence an official british inquiry wednesday lambasted the state of pre-war intelligence on iraq 's weapons of mass destruction but cleared prime minister tony blair of responsibility for the failings .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.07.2004 young germans face rising hiv rates großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the early 90s , aggresive hiv campaigns were the norm after falling for several years , rates of hiv infection , particularly among young gay men , are rising again .
risky behavior is increasing as a new generation appears willing to close its eyes to the dangers of hiv / aids . at 20 years old , many young adults are busy getting their college degrees or beginning their work lives , often excited at the broad expanse of possibilities in front of them .
however , for 20-year-old andreas , a gay berlin resident , a dark cloud has formed on his horizon ; he found out recently he has been infected with hiv , the virus that causes aids . andreas , who asked that his real name not be used , is having difficulty coming to terms with a diagnosis that has changed his future irrevocably .
while hiv is no longer the death sentence it once was , andreas will have to begin a demanding drug regime to keep aids at bay - and there are no guarantees .
the disease still kills 600 people in germany every year . " there is too little information out there , " he told dw-world .
" i never thought it could happen to me . " " new dynamic " to epidemic for some time in the mid to late 1990s , researchers and health care professionals working in the areas of hiv / aids could take comfort in the statistics : the number of hiv infections was falling annually ; the message of safer sex seemed to have gotten out . but a report out by the robert koch institute , a federal organization that researches disease control and prevention , warns that the epidemic of hiv in germany could acquire a " new dynamic " since the number of infections since 2001 has been rising steadily . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researching hiv in the lab - there 's medicine , but no cure three years ago , the institute reported 1,470 hiv infections in germany ; in 2002 , that number rose to 1,716 ; last year , 1,958 people contracted the virus .
that is a 33 percent rise in three years .
the trend toward rising infection rates also affects heterosexuals , half of those infected were men who had sex with men . experts say the reason behind the rise in infections is an increase in unsafe sex and a swing in attitudes toward the dangers of aids . since 1987 , the koch institute has carried out an annual survey about aids awareness in the general public .
in 2003 , the survey found that condom usage in general was falling .
among those surveyed who had multiple sexual partners in 2003 , 78 percent used condoms , down five percent over two years .
manufacturers are even selling fewer condoms in germany .
young people seem especially susceptible to letting their guard down in the heat of the moment . " the general tendency among young people today is to not see fully the risks involved in risky sexual behavior , " rolf gindorf , founder and past president of dgss , a sexuality research center in düsseldorf , told dw-world . " older gay men , say around 40 and up , are aware of the danger because they came of age at a time when death rates were high and aids information was very visible and always on people 's minds , " he said . "
but younger people today , they do n't have that experience .
knowing that the disease can be treated tends to make them carefree when it comes to sex . " the result is a generation gap that has developed between older and younger gay men .
protected sex has become second nature to older gay men , but among today 's youth , while they generally known the rules of safer sex , they often do n't follow them in sexual situations , according to birgit krenz of berlin aids hilfe , an organization that provides counseling and care for people with the disease . the results are becoming clear .
in 2001 , less than 1 percent of the hiv-infected people counseled at berlin aids hilfe were under the age of 20 .
by 2003 , that number had risen to 5 percent . less information after the deluge of aids information up until the late 1990s , according to dr. marita völker-albert of the federal center for health education -lrb- bzga -rrb- , there has been a strong decline over the past five years in public discussion of the disease . " priorities change , and issues like bse or sept .
11 have largely driven aids out of the media and the public mind , " she told dw-world .
" it 's harder to reach people now . " public money made available for education has also fallen off .
in 1987 , when the bzga began its aids awareness campaign , it had an annual budget of 50 million marks -lrb- $ 31.4 million -rrb- .
today , the center 's public awareness campaign has just over a third of that to spend - € 9 million -lrb- $ 11 million -rrb- a year . although he said he knew how to protect himself , andreas still partially blames the lack of a strong public message and vigorous discussion about aids for his infection . " it did n't do much good for me to see some celebrity up there talking about wearing condoms or something , " he said .
" i needed something blatant that could shock me into making the right decisions . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de researchers warn about aids in eastern europe of the 280,000 new aids infections in europe during the past year , more than 200,000 were reported in areas formerly belonging to the soviet bloc .
the figures are triggering alarm bells among researchers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.07.2004 young germans face rising hiv rates großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the early 90s , aggresive hiv campaigns were the norm after falling for several years , rates of hiv infection , particularly among young gay men , are rising again .
risky behavior is increasing as a new generation appears willing to close its eyes to the dangers of hiv / aids . at 20 years old , many young adults are busy getting their college degrees or beginning their work lives , often excited at the broad expanse of possibilities in front of them .
however , for 20-year-old andreas , a gay berlin resident , a dark cloud has formed on his horizon ; he found out recently he has been infected with hiv , the virus that causes aids . andreas , who asked that his real name not be used , is having difficulty coming to terms with a diagnosis that has changed his future irrevocably .
while hiv is no longer the death sentence it once was , andreas will have to begin a demanding drug regime to keep aids at bay - and there are no guarantees .
the disease still kills 600 people in germany every year . " there is too little information out there , " he told dw-world .
" i never thought it could happen to me . " " new dynamic " to epidemic for some time in the mid to late 1990s , researchers and health care professionals working in the areas of hiv / aids could take comfort in the statistics : the number of hiv infections was falling annually ; the message of safer sex seemed to have gotten out . but a report out by the robert koch institute , a federal organization that researches disease control and prevention , warns that the epidemic of hiv in germany could acquire a " new dynamic " since the number of infections since 2001 has been rising steadily . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researching hiv in the lab - there 's medicine , but no cure three years ago , the institute reported 1,470 hiv infections in germany ; in 2002 , that number rose to 1,716 ; last year , 1,958 people contracted the virus .
that is a 33 percent rise in three years .
the trend toward rising infection rates also affects heterosexuals , half of those infected were men who had sex with men . experts say the reason behind the rise in infections is an increase in unsafe sex and a swing in attitudes toward the dangers of aids . since 1987 , the koch institute has carried out an annual survey about aids awareness in the general public .
in 2003 , the survey found that condom usage in general was falling .
among those surveyed who had multiple sexual partners in 2003 , 78 percent used condoms , down five percent over two years .
manufacturers are even selling fewer condoms in germany .
young people seem especially susceptible to letting their guard down in the heat of the moment . " the general tendency among young people today is to not see fully the risks involved in risky sexual behavior , " rolf gindorf , founder and past president of dgss , a sexuality research center in düsseldorf , told dw-world . " older gay men , say around 40 and up , are aware of the danger because they came of age at a time when death rates were high and aids information was very visible and always on people 's minds , " he said . "
but younger people today , they do n't have that experience .
knowing that the disease can be treated tends to make them carefree when it comes to sex . " the result is a generation gap that has developed between older and younger gay men .
protected sex has become second nature to older gay men , but among today 's youth , while they generally known the rules of safer sex , they often do n't follow them in sexual situations , according to birgit krenz of berlin aids hilfe , an organization that provides counseling and care for people with the disease . the results are becoming clear .
in 2001 , less than 1 percent of the hiv-infected people counseled at berlin aids hilfe were under the age of 20 .
by 2003 , that number had risen to 5 percent . less information after the deluge of aids information up until the late 1990s , according to dr. marita völker-albert of the federal center for health education -lrb- bzga -rrb- , there has been a strong decline over the past five years in public discussion of the disease . " priorities change , and issues like bse or sept .
11 have largely driven aids out of the media and the public mind , " she told dw-world .
" it 's harder to reach people now . " public money made available for education has also fallen off .
in 1987 , when the bzga began its aids awareness campaign , it had an annual budget of 50 million marks -lrb- $ 31.4 million -rrb- .
today , the center 's public awareness campaign has just over a third of that to spend - € 9 million -lrb- $ 11 million -rrb- a year . although he said he knew how to protect himself , andreas still partially blames the lack of a strong public message and vigorous discussion about aids for his infection . " it did n't do much good for me to see some celebrity up there talking about wearing condoms or something , " he said .

if they are to repeat their dominance of years past , it will be without their big-name stars . it used to be so automatic . the question at track and field events at recent summer olympic games was not whether the us team would win any medals , but how many , and what color .

since the scandal surrounding the bay area laboratory co-operative -lrb- balco -rrb- broke last fall , four athletes have admitted to using designer drugs to boost their performance . champion shot-putter kevin toth as well as hammer-throwers melissa price and john mcewen accepted two-year bans .
in may , kelli white , the reigning world champion in the 100m and 200m , also accepted a two-year ban after admitting to using drugs provided by balco . since the scandal broke , us track and field stars have been battling a storm of negative publicity .
the strain appears to have taken a toll on athletes like jones , who has n't been able to shake off doping suspicions despite never testing positive . stress is too much " stress can burst a pipe , " said chryste gaines , a 100m sprinter who along with 200m indoor champion michelle collins is under the microscope of the usada .
both failed to qualify for the olympics . " so you can imagine what it can do to a person , " she said . time is ticking down for the us track and field association to pick a squad for the olympic games .
olympic committees have until july 25 to provide organizers with a list of competing athletes .
the early exits of some of the team 's brightest stars should relieve some of the pressure . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links olympic games 2004 dw-world 's special on the athen games .

risky behavior is increasing as a new generation appears willing to close its eyes to the dangers of hiv / aids . at 20 years old , many young adults are busy getting their college degrees or beginning their work lives , often excited at the broad expanse of possibilities in front of them .
however , for 20-year-old andreas , a gay berlin resident , a dark cloud has formed on his horizon ; he found out recently he has been infected with hiv , the virus that causes aids . andreas , who asked that his real name not be used , is having difficulty coming to terms with a diagnosis that has changed his future irrevocably .
while hiv is no longer the death sentence it once was , andreas will have to begin a demanding drug regime to keep aids at bay - and there are no guarantees .
the disease still kills 600 people in germany every year . " there is too little information out there , " he told dw-world .
" i never thought it could happen to me . " " new dynamic " to epidemic for some time in the mid to late 1990s , researchers and health care professionals working in the areas of hiv / aids could take comfort in the statistics : the number of hiv infections was falling annually ; the message of safer sex seemed to have gotten out . but a report out by the robert koch institute , a federal organization that researches disease control and prevention , warns that the epidemic of hiv in germany could acquire a " new dynamic " since the number of infections since 2001 has been rising steadily . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researching hiv in the lab - there 's medicine , but no cure three years ago , the institute reported 1,470 hiv infections in germany ; in 2002 , that number rose to 1,716 ; last year , 1,958 people contracted the virus .
that is a 33 percent rise in three years .
the trend toward rising infection rates also affects heterosexuals , half of those infected were men who had sex with men . experts say the reason behind the rise in infections is an increase in unsafe sex and a swing in attitudes toward the dangers of aids . since 1987 , the koch institute has carried out an annual survey about aids awareness in the general public .
in 2003 , the survey found that condom usage in general was falling .
among those surveyed who had multiple sexual partners in 2003 , 78 percent used condoms , down five percent over two years .
manufacturers are even selling fewer condoms in germany .
young people seem especially susceptible to letting their guard down in the heat of the moment . " the general tendency among young people today is to not see fully the risks involved in risky sexual behavior , " rolf gindorf , founder and past president of dgss , a sexuality research center in düsseldorf , told dw-world . " older gay men , say around 40 and up , are aware of the danger because they came of age at a time when death rates were high and aids information was very visible and always on people 's minds , " he said . "
but younger people today , they do n't have that experience .
knowing that the disease can be treated tends to make them carefree when it comes to sex . " the result is a generation gap that has developed between older and younger gay men .
protected sex has become second nature to older gay men , but among today 's youth , while they generally known the rules of safer sex , they often do n't follow them in sexual situations , according to birgit krenz of berlin aids hilfe , an organization that provides counseling and care for people with the disease . the results are becoming clear .
in 2001 , less than 1 percent of the hiv-infected people counseled at berlin aids hilfe were under the age of 20 .
by 2003 , that number had risen to 5 percent . less information after the deluge of aids information up until the late 1990s , according to dr. marita völker-albert of the federal center for health education -lrb- bzga -rrb- , there has been a strong decline over the past five years in public discussion of the disease . " priorities change , and issues like bse or sept .
11 have largely driven aids out of the media and the public mind , " she told dw-world .
" it 's harder to reach people now . " public money made available for education has also fallen off .
in 1987 , when the bzga began its aids awareness campaign , it had an annual budget of 50 million marks -lrb- $ 31.4 million -rrb- .
today , the center 's public awareness campaign has just over a third of that to spend - € 9 million -lrb- $ 11 million -rrb- a year . although he said he knew how to protect himself , andreas still partially blames the lack of a strong public message and vigorous discussion about aids for his infection . " it did n't do much good for me to see some celebrity up there talking about wearing condoms or something , " he said .

what started as an operation for saving ski areas has turned out to be a successful environmental measure to protect glaciers from melting away .
germany 's zugspitze now spends most of the year undercover . while most people in germany are complaining about the unseasonable temperatures this summer , the cool , wet weather has been a boon to germany 's highest mountain , the zugspitze .
after a fresh dusting of snow on germany 's most famous glacier this past week , environmentalists let out a sigh of relief .
but things are n't always this cool in the icy heights of the german alps .
summers usually bring rising temperatures and glaring sunshine .
although the balmy weather may be just what the calendar calls for in the rest of the country , on the zugspitze warm days are frowned upon .
with every rise in the mercury , precious centimeters of one of germany 's few remaining glaciers melt away .
it 's estimated that global warming results in a loss of about 10 centimeters of the glacier every year .
at that rate , not much is expected to survive through the next century , says the society for environmental research in munich in its online glacier archive .
to preserve this unique environment , dedicated workers at the zugspitzbahn , the cable car operator up to the peak , have devised a giant sun shade to protect the ice on top of the 2,962 meter-high mountain .
every year for the past 10 years , they spread out about 6,000 square meters -lrb- 19,000 sq. feet -rrb- of mats and tarpaulins on the glacier 's surface .
the white material reflects sunlight and insulates against the heat , preventing further melting of the snow and ice .
keeping the glacier under wraps bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : covering up the zugspitze the canvas also helps protect the glacier from warm summer rain , " which virtually devours the snow , " says stephanie vogel of the zugspitzbahn .
vogel and her colleagues at the peak 's cable car are in favor of the giant sunshade .
although she admits it is work to cover the glacier , it is import for preserving the fragile condition on the mountain top for posterity .
originally the idea was developed to protect snow in popular ski areas , but vogel says it has moved beyond the economic aspects related to tourism and has turned out to be a successful environmental measure .
to critics she acknowledges the sun shield is an " intervention in nature . "
any attempt to save an at-risk environment implies intervention , she argues .
the tarps , she believes , are the least dramatic interference .
in other places , snow guns are used to keep mountain peaks and especially ski resorts covered in white powder .
germany , however , is against relying on artificial snow because of the environmental concerns and the cost of energy involved .
consequences of glacial melting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at 2,963 meters , the zugspitze in bavaria is germany 's highest mountain .
the zugspitze is not alone in its battle against global warming .
environmentalists say glaciers are some of the most threatened ecosystems on earth .
they function as " global thermometers " and are extremely sensitive to the world 's rising temperature .
global warming , the lack of snow in winter , hot summers as well as air pollution and acid rain are responsible for shrinking glaciers , says the society for environmental research in munich .
more than just the loss of a valuable landscape , the defrosting of the permanent glacial ice - the permafrost - causes landslides and avalanches as the rocky undersurface is revealed and erodes in the rough wind .
resources of potable water provided by glacial ice also become more scarce , the society warns on its web site .
given current rates of greenhouse gas emissions , the anti-glare shield on the zugspitze may in the end only represent a last-ditch effort to slow down the almost inevitable glacier diminution .

what started as an operation for saving ski areas has turned out to be a successful environmental measure to protect glaciers from melting away .
germany 's zugspitze now spends most of the year undercover . while most people in germany are complaining about the unseasonable temperatures this summer , the cool , wet weather has been a boon to germany 's highest mountain , the zugspitze .
after a fresh dusting of snow on germany 's most famous glacier this past week , environmentalists let out a sigh of relief .
but things are n't always this cool in the icy heights of the german alps .
summers usually bring rising temperatures and glaring sunshine .
although the balmy weather may be just what the calendar calls for in the rest of the country , on the zugspitze warm days are frowned upon .
with every rise in the mercury , precious centimeters of one of germany 's few remaining glaciers melt away .
it 's estimated that global warming results in a loss of about 10 centimeters of the glacier every year .
at that rate , not much is expected to survive through the next century , says the society for environmental research in munich in its online glacier archive .
to preserve this unique environment , dedicated workers at the zugspitzbahn , the cable car operator up to the peak , have devised a giant sun shade to protect the ice on top of the 2,962 meter-high mountain .
every year for the past 10 years , they spread out about 6,000 square meters -lrb- 19,000 sq. feet -rrb- of mats and tarpaulins on the glacier 's surface .
the white material reflects sunlight and insulates against the heat , preventing further melting of the snow and ice .
keeping the glacier under wraps bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : covering up the zugspitze the canvas also helps protect the glacier from warm summer rain , " which virtually devours the snow , " says stephanie vogel of the zugspitzbahn .
vogel and her colleagues at the peak 's cable car are in favor of the giant sunshade .
although she admits it is work to cover the glacier , it is import for preserving the fragile condition on the mountain top for posterity .
originally the idea was developed to protect snow in popular ski areas , but vogel says it has moved beyond the economic aspects related to tourism and has turned out to be a successful environmental measure .
to critics she acknowledges the sun shield is an " intervention in nature . "
any attempt to save an at-risk environment implies intervention , she argues .
the tarps , she believes , are the least dramatic interference .
in other places , snow guns are used to keep mountain peaks and especially ski resorts covered in white powder .
germany , however , is against relying on artificial snow because of the environmental concerns and the cost of energy involved .
consequences of glacial melting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at 2,963 meters , the zugspitze in bavaria is germany 's highest mountain .
the zugspitze is not alone in its battle against global warming .
environmentalists say glaciers are some of the most threatened ecosystems on earth .
they function as " global thermometers " and are extremely sensitive to the world 's rising temperature .
global warming , the lack of snow in winter , hot summers as well as air pollution and acid rain are responsible for shrinking glaciers , says the society for environmental research in munich .
more than just the loss of a valuable landscape , the defrosting of the permanent glacial ice - the permafrost - causes landslides and avalanches as the rocky undersurface is revealed and erodes in the rough wind .
resources of potable water provided by glacial ice also become more scarce , the society warns on its web site .
given current rates of greenhouse gas emissions , the anti-glare shield on the zugspitze may in the end only represent a last-ditch effort to slow down the almost inevitable glacier diminution .

" go right back to hamburg or lübeck , because you 're always in a better situation there . regardless of the way that german interior minister otto schily has described the legal situation , " neudeck said . " just aid workers , not criminals " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily schily has said that if cap anamur was smuggling humans , it was a serious offence . " if the suspicion is confirmed that members of cap anamur 's crew were participating in smuggling immigrants , this would be a serious matter that may have to be taken up by germany 's criminal prosecution authorities , " schily said in a statement . neudeck however does n't agree . " the three sailors are n't criminals . they are aid workers and the german government should put pressure on italy to release them from jail . only then , could we talk about whether there were possible mistakes in the operation , " he said . restrictive immigration policy not everyone in germany agrees with schily 's stance . german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul has called for the release of cap anamur 's crew workers . bierdel should not be punished " because he wanted to help people in dire need , " zeul said in a statement .
" humanitarian actions must not be criminalized , " she added . pro asyl , a refugee aid organization has said that schily is responsible for helping conceive a highly restrictive european immigration policy that reinforced the notion of europe being a fortress to outsiders . a german foreign ministry spokeswoman said a diplomatic official had been sent to sicily " to provide consular support for those involved .

but the bad news has n't dampened us corporate investors shopping for bargains . given all the complaining in german business circles lately , it hardly seems likely foreign investors would want to dish out money in this country .
with unemployment steadily on the rise , the national budget deficit in stark violation of eu norms , economic growth squeezing by at less than two percent and employees on strike to keep 35-hour work weeks , there is n't much to encourage a positive future outlook for business .
but nobody seems to have shared the negative forecast with american private equity firms looking for a good money-making deal in germany .
us corporate investors have a decidedly different view of the german economy than many of the business leaders here do .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are all gloom and doom when they talk about the economy .
at a recent trans-atlantic business conference in stuttgart , us investors said they generally don ’ t find germany to be as bad off as many germans make it out to be .
instead , a healthy dose of american-flavored optimism was what they recommended to help get the patient back on its feet again .
instituting an emotional turn-around government officials and economic analysts across the country never tire talking about the need for germany to undergo structural economic change .
but the president of the american chamber of commerce in germany , fred irwin , said what the country really needs is an emotional turnaround .
" everyone in the media talks about needing to reform taxes and needing to reform business laws here , " he said .
" but actually nothing is going to dramatically change here if germans don ’ t decide that they ’ re willing to take a risk and that it ’ s necessary to change . "
irwin added that part of germany 's problems stem from a societal stubbornness to change , an affinity for keeping the status quo .
" it ’ s a conservative society , but all around it things are changing , " he said , pointing to germany 's neighbors in europe and markets oversees .
" we have a global market , and so where other countries are changing , germany is standing still , which is very unfortunate . "
american bargain hunters according to irwin , while germany is standing still , americans are busy looking for a good bargain .
many have been successful and have purchased good chunks of the market as corporate restructuring and streamlining within some large german conglomerates is throws up the occasional investment opportunity for big american firms .
the us private equity firm blackstone ’ s recent acquisition of the german chemicals company celanese , is one example .
and with attractive interest rates in germany , blackstone says it ’ s hungry for more takeovers .
the half-full glass why are american investors prepared to spend their money in germany , but germans apparently are not ?
walter raizner , the head of ibm deutschland , the german subsidiary of the american computer giant , pointed to differences in the business culture between the united states and germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : americans are still enthusiastic about the chance for economic recovery .
" first of all , the overall optimism in the united states , in the workforce , is much , much higher , " he said .
" i always describe it as how we look at the glass .
in germany , we always look at the glass as half-empty .
and our american friends always look at the glass as being half-full .
and i think this describes very nicely what the general mindset is , how you approach things in business but also in life . "
americans are also more pragmatic in implementing business decisions , raizner added .
" germans tend to discuss everything to the end , " he said .
" and even if you ’ ve made a decision you keep going on and discussing whether the decision was right or wrong or should we start all over again , " he added , describing the slow momentum in german business negotiations .
in contrast , the americans have a whole different attitude , according to raizner .
" they say , let ’ s move along this pass , " he said .
" if it proves to be wrong , well , we can adjust our course and come to the objective anyhow . "
adding the spice of america german corporate lawyer roderich thümmel , who works with companies on both sides of the atlantic , agrees that germany would be much better off economically if it had a dash of american business confidence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a stock trader toasts with champagne at the stock market in frankfurt , dec .
30 as the dax shows its highest level for the year at end of trading in 2003 . " we germans should be more confident in what we can do , " he stresses .
" we should become more active and we should take an active role in bringing things forward and that is what happens every day in many companies , but the perception in the general public , i think , is more negative than necessary . "
more spending needed the american chamber of commerce in germany says germans have to start spending money , rather than continuing to save it .
and the chamber ’ s president is following that advice and encouraging the company he works for , citigroup , to invest more in germany .
while most german banks are continuing to lay off staff in order to reduce costs , the us banking , insurance and investment corporation citigroup is hiring people in germany .
last year the company ’ s banking sector , citibank , created more than 350 extra positions in order to expand its network of branches .
recently , citibank announced that 200 more jobs will be created this year as part of a further expansion of services mainly in southern germany .
an american-led recovery ?
does this mean american businesses could be leading an economic recovery in germany ?
fred irwin does n't want to go that far , but he does think american businesses can show germans the path they need to take .
" we have in germany a consensus mentality society , " he said .
" and as long as you have an economic boom , a consensus society is very positive because everybody profits from it .
but when you ’ re having some difficulties , we need vision , we need leadership and we need execution . "
american businesses have the vision right now and they are the ones making things happen , irwin believes .

us corporate investors have a decidedly different view of the german economy than many of the business leaders here do .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are all gloom and doom when they talk about the economy .
at a recent trans-atlantic business conference in stuttgart , us investors said they generally don ’ t find germany to be as bad off as many germans make it out to be .
instead , a healthy dose of american-flavored optimism was what they recommended to help get the patient back on its feet again .
instituting an emotional turn-around government officials and economic analysts across the country never tire talking about the need for germany to undergo structural economic change .
but the president of the american chamber of commerce in germany , fred irwin , said what the country really needs is an emotional turnaround .
" everyone in the media talks about needing to reform taxes and needing to reform business laws here , " he said .
" but actually nothing is going to dramatically change here if germans don ’ t decide that they ’ re willing to take a risk and that it ’ s necessary to change . "
irwin added that part of germany 's problems stem from a societal stubbornness to change , an affinity for keeping the status quo .
" it ’ s a conservative society , but all around it things are changing , " he said , pointing to germany 's neighbors in europe and markets oversees .
" we have a global market , and so where other countries are changing , germany is standing still , which is very unfortunate . "
american bargain hunters according to irwin , while germany is standing still , americans are busy looking for a good bargain .
many have been successful and have purchased good chunks of the market as corporate restructuring and streamlining within some large german conglomerates is throws up the occasional investment opportunity for big american firms .
the us private equity firm blackstone ’ s recent acquisition of the german chemicals company celanese , is one example .
and with attractive interest rates in germany , blackstone says it ’ s hungry for more takeovers .
the half-full glass why are american investors prepared to spend their money in germany , but germans apparently are not ?
walter raizner , the head of ibm deutschland , the german subsidiary of the american computer giant , pointed to differences in the business culture between the united states and germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : americans are still enthusiastic about the chance for economic recovery .
" first of all , the overall optimism in the united states , in the workforce , is much , much higher , " he said .
" i always describe it as how we look at the glass .
in germany , we always look at the glass as half-empty .
and our american friends always look at the glass as being half-full .
and i think this describes very nicely what the general mindset is , how you approach things in business but also in life . "
americans are also more pragmatic in implementing business decisions , raizner added .
" germans tend to discuss everything to the end , " he said .
" and even if you ’ ve made a decision you keep going on and discussing whether the decision was right or wrong or should we start all over again , " he added , describing the slow momentum in german business negotiations .
in contrast , the americans have a whole different attitude , according to raizner .
" they say , let ’ s move along this pass , " he said .
" if it proves to be wrong , well , we can adjust our course and come to the objective anyhow . "
adding the spice of america german corporate lawyer roderich thümmel , who works with companies on both sides of the atlantic , agrees that germany would be much better off economically if it had a dash of american business confidence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a stock trader toasts with champagne at the stock market in frankfurt , dec .
30 as the dax shows its highest level for the year at end of trading in 2003 . " we germans should be more confident in what we can do , " he stresses .
" we should become more active and we should take an active role in bringing things forward and that is what happens every day in many companies , but the perception in the general public , i think , is more negative than necessary . "
more spending needed the american chamber of commerce in germany says germans have to start spending money , rather than continuing to save it .
and the chamber ’ s president is following that advice and encouraging the company he works for , citigroup , to invest more in germany .
while most german banks are continuing to lay off staff in order to reduce costs , the us banking , insurance and investment corporation citigroup is hiring people in germany .
last year the company ’ s banking sector , citibank , created more than 350 extra positions in order to expand its network of branches .
recently , citibank announced that 200 more jobs will be created this year as part of a further expansion of services mainly in southern germany .
an american-led recovery ?
does this mean american businesses could be leading an economic recovery in germany ?
fred irwin does n't want to go that far , but he does think american businesses can show germans the path they need to take .
" we have in germany a consensus mentality society , " he said .
" and as long as you have an economic boom , a consensus society is very positive because everybody profits from it .
but when you ’ re having some difficulties , we need vision , we need leadership and we need execution . "
american businesses have the vision right now and they are the ones making things happen , irwin believes .

many of the arrests were made in the capital , lima , where police used tear-gas to disperse protesters who tried to block roads with tyres and logs .
the strike was declared a success by peru 's largest union , the cgtp .
but the government said the protest had failed because people were working and public transport was functioning .
peruvian interior minister javier reategui claimed only half of all transport services in lima had been affected by the strike .
he said police had confiscated a large number of rubber tyres to stop protesters from setting fire to them .
in central lima , one union leader told a cheering crowd that reports from around peru suggested 90 % of workers supported the strike .
more than 85 % of the population is demanding toledo to go ... the voice of the people is the word of god mario huaman cgtp workers ' union peru 's former president , alan garcia , the country 's main opposition party leader , suggested that prime minister carlos ferrero and his cabinet should consider resigning .
the bbc 's hannah hennessy in lima reports that for many the protest has become less about economics and more about trying to undermine the authority of mr toledo - the region 's least popular president , with the support of less than 7 % of peruvians , according to recent polls .
although peru has one of the fastest growing economies in latin america , half the population lives on $ 1.25 a day .
people are angry at the president 's failure to fulfil his election promises to create more jobs and stamp out poverty , our correspondent adds .
many said could not afford to strike - if they took to the streets , they would have no money to feed their families .
' inflitration fears ' more than 150 unions - from teachers to construction workers - had signed up for the protest .
the communist-led general workers ' union of peru estimated that some 300,000 people would take part in protests .
but that the numbers seems to have been overestimated , our correspondent says .
the strike comes as peru tries to cope with hundreds of visitors to an international football event - the copa america - stranded by the grounding of a local airline .
the aero continente airline was banned from flying on monday after the government alleged its planes were not insured and the us announced it was investigating the firm for ties to the drug trafficking trade .
some 93,000 police were deployed across peru to deal with any unrest .
peru 's government said army and riot police units had been enlisted because of fears that the demonstrations might be infiltrated by guerrillas from the outlawed marxist rebel army , the shining path .

the rcn 's lucy hamilton told bbc news online the figures were no surprise .
she said : " there is a high turnover of nurses in london , we have an acute shortage of staff here and generally the nhs is being propped up by nurses from overseas . "
the study also says increasing competition for overseas recruits from other countries could mean more problems for london .
king 's fund chief executive niall dixon said the policy should also be reassessed to ensure it is not depriving patients in developing countries of health professionals .

mr green had hoped that investors would use m & s 's annual meeting on wednesday to voice support for his proposed £ 9.1bn -lrb- $ 16.9bn -rrb- offer .
instead they gave their backing to the current board and chief executive .
newly-appointed boss stuart rose will now have to prove that his team can deliver more value to shareholders .
sweeteners on monday , m & s unveiled a reform package aimed at fending off mr green .
the company has promised to boost profits , revamp its image and focus on winning back customers .
it also will return £ 2.3bn to shareholders . "
they are going to have us breathing down their neck in every street and every shopping centre in the uk " philip green vitally , the board of directors also refused to approve mr green 's approach and denied him access to company accounts .
mr green was not willing to table a formal bid within the 6 august deadline without first checking m & s 's books .
speaking on bbc2 's newsnight programme , mr green said he had been treated with " contempt " and that he was surprised that the board had refused to meet with him and his advisors .
mr green now plans to concentrate on his other businesses , adding he was going to give it his best shot .
" they are going to have us breathing down their neck in every street and every shopping centre in the uk . "
" and then we 'll see who the best retailer is . "
showdown monaco-based mr green reckoned he had the backing of about a third of m & s shareholders , including some of the world 's best-known investment firms .
earlier on wednesday , m & s 's largest shareholder , us firm brandes , urged the company to open its books to mr green .
but in the end , it would prove too little to swing the deal in his favour .
especially as other investors thought that his offer of 400 pence a share , the third he had tabled , was still not large enough .
standard life investments , which owns about 2 % of m & s , said on tuesday it was rejecting the proposed bid because it undervalued the company 's recovery prospects .
the bbc 's business editor jeff randall told news 24 that : " it 's the big shareholders , the big institutions , the big guns from wall street and the city that really dictate this . "
" they have closed the door on philip green and he has walked away . "
head to head the battle for control of m & s has involved two of the uk retail industry 's biggest names .
mr green is the swashbuckling tycoon who made his name with the break-up of the sears group in the late 1990s .
he has also seen success after turning around retail chain bhs and buying the arcadia retail group , which owns top shop .
mr rose , meanwhile , worked at debenhams and argos before moving to troubled cash-and-carry business booker , where he arranged a merger with frozen food retailer iceland .
but it was as head of arcadia that mr rose secured his reputation , turning around a company lumbered with more than £ 250m of debt .
he also presided over the sale of arcadia to mr green for £ 855m - making £ 25m out of the deal himself .

ual corp , the airline 's parent , said the move would enable it to organise its funds to exit bankruptcy .
in late june the company failed in its attempt to get a $ 1.1bn us government handout .
and earlier this month it increased some of its fares by 5 % after a surge in crude oil prices raised fuel costs .
united , which filed for chapter 11 protection in december 2002 , has until september 2005 to make the pension payment .
' financial sense ' the deferment does not have any impact on payments to current retirees , but has caused concern among staff .
the decision was greeted with a warning from one union representing 27,000 workers .
the international association of machinists said it would " fight any attempt by united airlines to impose a permanent solution to what may be a temporary , even self-correcting problem " .
but the air line pilots association said the decision made " financial sense " .
however , bill warlick , senior credit analyst for fitch ratings , said the payment was small enough not to affect liquidity at united .
he warned that united 's move could be a signal that further pension actions might be needed " including potentially the termination of the plans " .
