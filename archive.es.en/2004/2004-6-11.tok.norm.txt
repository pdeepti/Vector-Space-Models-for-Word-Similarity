the problem has always been that they emit toxic particles that have been linked to cancer and respiratory illnesses .
however , the recent creation of so-called particle filters has made diesel engines safer for consumer use .
proponents say particle filters are the only technology currently available that can cut particle emissions by 99 percent .
but german car makers have n't been quick enough to jump on the bandwagon , and that 's beginning to create a political problem in the environmentally progressive country .
in contrast to french car makers like peugeot and renault , which have embraced particle-filter diesel engines , german companies have instead opted for internal improvements to diesel motors , with moderate successes in reducing particle emissions .
a shot in the arm german environment minister jürgen trittin of the green party has drafted legislation that would seek to give a shot in the arm to the particle filter business by providing a tax break of € 600 -lrb- $ 740 -rrb- on diesel cars with new particle filters that reduce particle emissions to a stringent limit of 2.5 milligrams per kilometer .
but major car makers like volkswagen have called for a looser limit of 12.5 milligrams .
environmental groups , the green party and factions of the social democrats are backing trittin 's calls , which they say is supported by environment ministry data claiming that 14,000 people die each year as a result of diesel particle emissions .
but the industry , led by volkswagen , has fought tooth and nail to avoid being forced to adopt the filters .
in an attempt to break the bottleneck , german chancellor gerhard schröder met earlier this week in berlin with vw ceo bernd pischetsrieder and other top european automobile industry executives to discuss future use of particle filters .
" every seventh job in germany is still dependent on the automobile industry , " said schröder 's spokesman , bela anda .
" this should not be seen as a call for measures not to be implemented .
but it should also make it clear that there are also endeavors in the industry to reach this goal through changes in the internal motors - and people should n't disregard that fact . "
after his meeting with pischetsrieder , schröder said no decision had been reached as to when particle filters would be included in cars or how they might be filtered .
instead , the chancellor and the executives of europe 's largest car maker decided to leave responsibility for the decision with brussels .
by the end of the year , the eu is expected to produce regulations for emissions norms that would serve as the blueprint for filtering technologies .
for the automobile industry , punting the responsibility to brussels represents a partial victory , as the standards proposed by germany 's trittin would likely have been much stricter .
gerd lottsiepen , of the german automobile club , said the car manufacturers were acting irresponsibly in their fight against technological limits .
" the manufacturers who are now issuing polemical attacks against these limits ... are knowingly acting against the interests of consumers .
the customers who buy cars today with yesterday 's technology will get stuck paying the piper for the manufacturer 's deep sleep .
the loss of value for cars without particle filters will be higher than average in the coming years , " lottsiepen said .
to some environmental groups , including greenpeace , the financial incentive trittin has proposed does not go far enough .
" the price difference between the systems runs between € 300 and € 1,300 , " said günter hubmann of greenpeace .
" we 're demanding that , for the best system , which is 99 percent effective , a tax break of € 999 should be given by the government .
how , exactly , that can happen still needs to be negotiated . "
discord in berlin the current debate over particle filters also threatens to spark a new row between environment minister trittin and economics minister wolfgang clement , who just recently locked horns over emissions trading standards for heavy industry .
responding to the particle filter debate , clement has said he does not want to add further pressure to car makers while the economy struggles for growth .
companies like vw say that if particle filters become obligatory , it should not happen before 2007 and that the particle emission limits should be set higher than trittin 's proposed standard .
meanwhile , the opposition parties , including the christian democratic union , have said that promoting specific or special technologies should not be the government 's responsibility .

there , car-maker peugeot introduced its first diesel car with a particle filter in 2000 , offering the additional safety at the same price as its other diesel offerings .
peugeot 's parent company , autogruppe psa , is the world 's largest self-combusting engine manufacturer , and it has widely introduced particle filters in its diesel cars .
but differences remain between germany 's leading politicians on the best way to move forward with particle filters .
and any car tax breaks proposed by the federal government must also be approved by the states that are entitled to the proceeds from the motor vehicle tax .
so far , most states are taking a reserved approach to the proposal , with ministers in some states , like bavaria , saying it has not yet been proven that the current generation of particle filters are the most effective means of reducing particle emissions from diesel motors . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de still no decision on filters for diesel cars the german government has still not made a decision on whether it will subsidize diesel-powered cars outfitted with particulate filters .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.06.2004 government split on ' clean diesel ' initiatives großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diesel cars are sparking an unfiltered debate berlin says it wants to give tax breaks for cars with clean diesel , but a divided cabinet and automobile industry have stalled the effort - at least for now . for years , diesel cars have been considered more environmentally friendly than traditional gasoline motors because they create fewer climate-damaging emissions .
the problem has always been that they emit toxic particles that have been linked to cancer and respiratory illnesses .
however , the recent creation of so-called particle filters has made diesel engines safer for consumer use .
proponents say particle filters are the only technology currently available that can cut particle emissions by 99 percent .
but german car makers have n't been quick enough to jump on the bandwagon , and that 's beginning to create a political problem in the environmentally progressive country .
in contrast to french car makers like peugeot and renault , which have embraced particle-filter diesel engines , german companies have instead opted for internal improvements to diesel motors , with moderate successes in reducing particle emissions .
a shot in the arm german environment minister jürgen trittin of the green party has drafted legislation that would seek to give a shot in the arm to the particle filter business by providing a tax break of € 600 -lrb- $ 740 -rrb- on diesel cars with new particle filters that reduce particle emissions to a stringent limit of 2.5 milligrams per kilometer .
but major car makers like volkswagen have called for a looser limit of 12.5 milligrams .
environmental groups , the green party and factions of the social democrats are backing trittin 's calls , which they say is supported by environment ministry data claiming that 14,000 people die each year as a result of diesel particle emissions .
but the industry , led by volkswagen , has fought tooth and nail to avoid being forced to adopt the filters .
in an attempt to break the bottleneck , german chancellor gerhard schröder met earlier this week in berlin with vw ceo bernd pischetsrieder and other top european automobile industry executives to discuss future use of particle filters .
" every seventh job in germany is still dependent on the automobile industry , " said schröder 's spokesman , bela anda .
" this should not be seen as a call for measures not to be implemented .
but it should also make it clear that there are also endeavors in the industry to reach this goal through changes in the internal motors - and people should n't disregard that fact . "
after his meeting with pischetsrieder , schröder said no decision had been reached as to when particle filters would be included in cars or how they might be filtered .
instead , the chancellor and the executives of europe 's largest car maker decided to leave responsibility for the decision with brussels .
by the end of the year , the eu is expected to produce regulations for emissions norms that would serve as the blueprint for filtering technologies .
for the automobile industry , punting the responsibility to brussels represents a partial victory , as the standards proposed by germany 's trittin would likely have been much stricter .
gerd lottsiepen , of the german automobile club , said the car manufacturers were acting irresponsibly in their fight against technological limits .
" the manufacturers who are now issuing polemical attacks against these limits ... are knowingly acting against the interests of consumers .
the customers who buy cars today with yesterday 's technology will get stuck paying the piper for the manufacturer 's deep sleep .
the loss of value for cars without particle filters will be higher than average in the coming years , " lottsiepen said .
to some environmental groups , including greenpeace , the financial incentive trittin has proposed does not go far enough .
" the price difference between the systems runs between € 300 and € 1,300 , " said günter hubmann of greenpeace .
" we 're demanding that , for the best system , which is 99 percent effective , a tax break of € 999 should be given by the government .
how , exactly , that can happen still needs to be negotiated . "
discord in berlin the current debate over particle filters also threatens to spark a new row between environment minister trittin and economics minister wolfgang clement , who just recently locked horns over emissions trading standards for heavy industry .
responding to the particle filter debate , clement has said he does not want to add further pressure to car makers while the economy struggles for growth .
companies like vw say that if particle filters become obligatory , it should not happen before 2007 and that the particle emission limits should be set higher than trittin 's proposed standard .
meanwhile , the opposition parties , including the christian democratic union , have said that promoting specific or special technologies should not be the government 's responsibility .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dacia , logan , 2004 though germany leads europe in auto exports , the particle filter issue has been driven by the french .
there , car-maker peugeot introduced its first diesel car with a particle filter in 2000 , offering the additional safety at the same price as its other diesel offerings .
peugeot 's parent company , autogruppe psa , is the world 's largest self-combusting engine manufacturer , and it has widely introduced particle filters in its diesel cars .
but differences remain between germany 's leading politicians on the best way to move forward with particle filters .
and any car tax breaks proposed by the federal government must also be approved by the states that are entitled to the proceeds from the motor vehicle tax .
so far , most states are taking a reserved approach to the proposal , with ministers in some states , like bavaria , saying it has not yet been proven that the current generation of particle filters are the most effective means of reducing particle emissions from diesel motors . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de still no decision on filters for diesel cars the german government has still not made a decision on whether it will subsidize diesel-powered cars outfitted with particulate filters .
on monday , a summit between top players from europe 's car industry and german chancellor gerhard schröder dealt with the topic as well as the general competitiveness of the auto industry .

government ministers acknowledged that war in iraq played a role . british prime minister tony blair 's party lost more than 200 seats on local councils , according to bbc .
while final results have not been announced , labor is expected to come in third , behind opposition conservatives and the third party liberal democrats . speaking at the g-8 summit in the u.s. state of georgia , blair said the british role in iraq had cast a shadow over the elections .
" but in the end you have to take decisions that are right and you have to see them through , " he told reporters . the conservatives were unable to make huge gains as they also supported the war in iraq .
only the liberal democrats , who opposed a british involvement , made strides at the ballots . results unlikely to threaten blair 's re-election while experts said that the elections were unlikely to threaten blair 's re-election in the upcoming general election , which is expected to take place next year , government officials also tried to play down the significance of the results . " we always knew this was going to be a very difficult election for us , " nick raynford , the cabinet minister in charge of local government issues , told sky television .
" governments in mid-term tend to lose . " results in elections for london 's mayor were expected to be announced later on friday .
incumbent ken livingstone was expected to win re-election . british voters also cast their ballots in the european parliament elections on thursday , but those results are not expected to be announced until sunday after all other 25 eu countries have voted as well . the anti-eu uk independence party , which has called for britain 's withdrawal from the eu , is expected to fare well in those elections and could quadruple its seats to 12 . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu-skeptics gain momentum in britain elections for the european parliament started thursday as dutch and british voters headed to the polls .

" i wo n't hide it from you that i do n't think it is nato 's purpose to intervene in iraq , " chirac said wednesday according to the associated press .
" what 's more , i do n't feel that it would be opportune nor necessarily well understood .
i am totally reserved about this issue , " he said . however , on thursday , the last day of the summit , both bush and chirac attempted to appear more cordial at a private meeting .
bush acknowledged past differences with the french president and told reporters : " friends are able to discuss the future . " a french official also said that despite chirac 's reservations about an expanded nato role in iraq , he is open to discussion ahead of a nato summit in turkey at the end of the month . canada , france and germany also made it clear that even after passage of the resolution , they would n't send troops to the country . the leaders of britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan and russia were also unable to agree on bush 's appeal for oil-rich iraq 's debts be forgiven .
they left the issue open , only deciding that there would be " substantial " debt forgiveness . positive report card from schröder german chancellor gerhard schröder had an upbeat assessment of the meetings on sea island , saying lot of hard work was done there , despite many leaders ' dispensing with their ties and three-pieces suits during meetings .
schröder said the unanimous vote in the u.n. security council for the resolution on iraq had not only made the summit work easier , it had proved that one can " come together . " while standing by his pledge not to send german soldiers to iraq , he said germany would not stand in the way of nato doing so . schröder said one of the signals from the summit was a desire to stabilize the " very , very good " situation that the global economy finds itself in . one of the main risks , however , to economic stability is the insecurity in the middle east .
another is the price of oil , if it remains at its current record-high prices . middle east democratization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from top center , going clockwise : u.s. president george w. bush , russian president vladimir putin , german chancellor gerhard schröder , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , european council president bertie ahern , european commission president romano prodi , canadian prime minister paul martin , japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi , british prime minister tony blair and french president jacques chirac during the morning plenary meeting at the g-8 summit in sea island on wednesday .
g-8 leaders at the summit did agree to president bush 's initiative to promote democratic reform in the arab world , and they offered middle eastern and northern african states a political and economic partnership , which would include regular talks at ministerial level , aid in organizing free and transparent elections , increased efforts to fight illiteracy and loans for small businesses . but along with the french president , german chancellor gerhard schröder was still cautious about the plans .
" the west must not make the mistake of imposing its ideas of inner-social development . "
democratization must come from the countries themselves , he said . arab states were critical of the initiative , accusing the g-8 of meddling in internal affairs .
the heads of six moslem countries , including iraqi interim president ghazi al-yawer , took part in the talks .
other arab statesmen , including the egyptian and saudi arabian leaders , rejected the invitation to the summit . on thursday the group turned its attention to developmental policies during a session with african leaders .
the g-8 was to endorse an initiative to battle famine and also commit itself to training and , where necessary , equipping 75,000 peacekeepers to deal with crises in africa . they plan to discuss debt forgiveness for the world 's poorest countries and meet with african statesmen to talk about the new partnership for african development -lrb- nepad -rrb- project to introduce reforms on the african continent . the group also agreed on a proposal to speed up development of a vaccine for hiv , the virus that causes aids .
bush proposed spending € 15 million to launch it . g-9 or g-10 ? british premier tony blair , who will take over the g-8 presidency in july , said member states were in agreement that the group should be expanded to include other countries , such as china or india . the german chancellor also said he believed china would be a candidate to participate in future meetings as the country had dramatically changed over the past years . chirac expressed his regrets that unlike french officials at the last meeting in evian , the u.s. had not invited china , india or brazil to the meeting . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany-u.s. exhibit chummy ties at g-8 summit after almost 18 months of fluctuating tensions between berlin and washington , german chancellor schröder and u.s. president bush held a cordial meeting on the fringes of the g8 summit proving they were chummy once again .

" while standing by his pledge not to send german soldiers to iraq , he said germany would not stand in the way of nato doing so . schröder said one of the signals from the summit was a desire to stabilize the " very , very good " situation that the global economy finds itself in . one of the main risks , however , to economic stability is the insecurity in the middle east .

government ministers acknowledged that war in iraq played a role . british prime minister tony blair 's party lost more than 200 seats on local councils , according to bbc .
while final results have not been announced , labor is expected to come in third , behind opposition conservatives and the third party liberal democrats . speaking at the g-8 summit in the u.s. state of georgia , blair said the british role in iraq had cast a shadow over the elections .
" but in the end you have to take decisions that are right and you have to see them through , " he told reporters . the conservatives were unable to make huge gains as they also supported the war in iraq .
only the liberal democrats , who opposed a british involvement , made strides at the ballots . results unlikely to threaten blair 's re-election while experts said that the elections were unlikely to threaten blair 's re-election in the upcoming general election , which is expected to take place next year , government officials also tried to play down the significance of the results . " we always knew this was going to be a very difficult election for us , " nick raynford , the cabinet minister in charge of local government issues , told sky television .
" governments in mid-term tend to lose . " results in elections for london 's mayor were expected to be announced later on friday .
incumbent ken livingstone was expected to win re-election . british voters also cast their ballots in the european parliament elections on thursday , but those results are not expected to be announced until sunday after all other 25 eu countries have voted as well . the anti-eu uk independence party , which has called for britain 's withdrawal from the eu , is expected to fare well in those elections and could quadruple its seats to 12 . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu-skeptics gain momentum in britain elections for the european parliament started thursday as dutch and british voters headed to the polls .

a bill has been introduced which would add legal weight to patients ' wishes . the federal government is not aiming to legalize active medically assisted suicide , according to justice minister brigitte zypries , rather it is seeking through the bill it introduced on thursday to put patients ' own decisions on medical treatment , especially regarding artificial life support , on more secure legal ground . the law proposed by the social democratic minister would add heft to so-called advance health care declarations , or living wills , made by patients who ask that their lives not be extended by artificial means .
it would also give doctors and patients ' relatives a more secure legal footing when carrying out patients ' wishes . the bill , which if passed would become law in 2006 , is based on suggestions made by a working group the minister convened called " patient autonomy at the end of life . "
headed by a former federal judge , the group included doctors , legal experts , social welfare groups and churches . the group came together after a federal court ruling in march 2003 in which judges acknowledged the relevance of living wills , but ruled that in the event of a disagreement between an attending physician and the custodian of a comatose patient , the matter had to be referred to a guardianship court , which would decide whether , for example , removing a feeding tube would be in the best interests of the patient . according to zypries , under the new law the guardianship would no longer be consulted if a living will has designated a person to represent a patient 's wishes should he or she no longer be able to .
that representative would then be able to make decisions based on the contents of the living will .
additionally , the living will should in the future have legal weight in any stage of illness , not only when the patient 's condition has become terminal . the head of the working group which drafted the bill , federal judge klaus kutzer , said the proposed law is not active assisted suicide or the so-called death on demand , in which a lethal drug is administered to a patient .
he said the working group did not want to create any legal room for such actions with the proposed law , but did want to create a legal framework in which passive doctor-assisted suicide was possible for patients who wanted it . slippery slope criticism but the minister 's proposal drew criticism from churches , the german hospice association , the federal doctors ' chamber and the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , who said it was a first step in legalizing active medically assisted suicide .
hubert hüppe , deputy head of the german parliament 's ethics commission and cdu member , warned against " unusually dangerous tendencies " toward weakening laws that protect the lives of patients .
both the protestant and catholic churches of germany said patients " should not in any instance be put under pressure " to end their lives . justice minister zypries encouraged germans to put some thought into what they would want should they be incapacitated by a serious illness or accident and to consider drawing up a living will . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german hospice movement seeks to make " dying a part of life " death remains a taboo topic , causing many to die alone - in hospitals or nursing homes .

a bill has been introduced which would add legal weight to patients ' wishes . the federal government is not aiming to legalize active medically assisted suicide , according to justice minister brigitte zypries , rather it is seeking through the bill it introduced on thursday to put patients ' own decisions on medical treatment , especially regarding artificial life support , on more secure legal ground . the law proposed by the social democratic minister would add heft to so-called advance health care declarations , or living wills , made by patients who ask that their lives not be extended by artificial means .
it would also give doctors and patients ' relatives a more secure legal footing when carrying out patients ' wishes . the bill , which if passed would become law in 2006 , is based on suggestions made by a working group the minister convened called " patient autonomy at the end of life . "
headed by a former federal judge , the group included doctors , legal experts , social welfare groups and churches . the group came together after a federal court ruling in march 2003 in which judges acknowledged the relevance of living wills , but ruled that in the event of a disagreement between an attending physician and the custodian of a comatose patient , the matter had to be referred to a guardianship court , which would decide whether , for example , removing a feeding tube would be in the best interests of the patient . according to zypries , under the new law the guardianship would no longer be consulted if a living will has designated a person to represent a patient 's wishes should he or she no longer be able to .
that representative would then be able to make decisions based on the contents of the living will .
additionally , the living will should in the future have legal weight in any stage of illness , not only when the patient 's condition has become terminal . the head of the working group which drafted the bill , federal judge klaus kutzer , said the proposed law is not active assisted suicide or the so-called death on demand , in which a lethal drug is administered to a patient .
he said the working group did not want to create any legal room for such actions with the proposed law , but did want to create a legal framework in which passive doctor-assisted suicide was possible for patients who wanted it . slippery slope criticism but the minister 's proposal drew criticism from churches , the german hospice association , the federal doctors ' chamber and the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , who said it was a first step in legalizing active medically assisted suicide .
hubert hüppe , deputy head of the german parliament 's ethics commission and cdu member , warned against " unusually dangerous tendencies " toward weakening laws that protect the lives of patients .
both the protestant and catholic churches of germany said patients " should not in any instance be put under pressure " to end their lives . justice minister zypries encouraged germans to put some thought into what they would want should they be incapacitated by a serious illness or accident and to consider drawing up a living will . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german hospice movement seeks to make " dying a part of life " death remains a taboo topic , causing many to die alone - in hospitals or nursing homes .

during the nazi occupation , papon oversaw the bordeaux area police and signed orders that led to the deportation of 1,690 jews from 1942 to 1944 .
most of those deported perished in the auschwitz concentration camp .
papon rose through the ranks of french politics following world war ii , becoming chief of the paris police in 1958 , and later national budget minister under valerie giscard d 'estaing .
but in 1981 his wartime record was revealed when documents were unearthed showing that he had authorized the deportations .
too sick to serve papon has argued that he did n't know the fate of the jews he deported , and that he had to deport them to keep his job at the time .
despite his claims of innocence , he was convicted of crimes against humanity six years ago .
but he walked out of prison in 2002 after a court ruled him too old and sick to finish his 10-year sentence .
the decision outraged the victims of france 's wartime regime and their families .
yet the court of cassation , france 's highest court , will now study an appeal request to clear papon 's name .
this time , the judges wo n't look at the question of papon 's guilt or innocence , but rather focus on obscure legal problems that occurred during his trial .
the procedure is not an appeal as such , but a review by the court to decide whether or not a new appeal can take place .
judges are expected to rule on the matter june 16 .
papon has launched many appeals because he believes justice was fundamentally not carried out during the drawn-out legal battles which began over twenty years ago .
touching a nerve he claims not to regret his actions during the war , and says he ca n't be held partially responsible for holocaust crimes , because he was removed by several " links in the chain " from the murders that took place in concentration camps .
the question of indirect collaboration with war crimes touched a sensitive nerve in france , where the media has periodically pounced on the case , and reopened public dialogue about the extent of nazi sympathy in france during world war ii .
papon says his goal now is to clear his name for history .
but jewish groups say he should still be in prison , citing his lack of remorse .
when papon walked free in 2002 , the u.s.-based simon wiesenthal center called the release " a bad case of misplaced sympathy . "
a frequent problem france has not been the only nation faced with the problem of high officials with nazi pasts .
as recently as last month , a decision by germany 's christian democrats to include a former state premier with a history of nazi activity as a delegate to the presidential election was harshly criticized by jewish groups and left-wing politicians .
hans filbinger , 90 , was forced to resign as premier of the southern state of baden-württemberg in 1978 after it emerged that as a naval judge he shared responsibility for handing down death sentences in the waning months of nazi germany .
probably the best-known case is that of austria 's kurt waldheim .
a widely esteemed former secretary general of the united nations , he was running for president of austria in march 1986 when it came to light that he had participated in nazi atrocities during world war ii .
despite this , he served as his country 's head of state until 1992 . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de delegate 's nazi past clouds german presidential election a decision by germany 's christian democrats to include a former state premier with a nazi past as a delegate for a presidential election has been harshly criticized by jewish groups and left-wing politicians .

during the nazi occupation , papon oversaw the bordeaux area police and signed orders that led to the deportation of 1,690 jews from 1942 to 1944 .
most of those deported perished in the auschwitz concentration camp .
papon rose through the ranks of french politics following world war ii , becoming chief of the paris police in 1958 , and later national budget minister under valerie giscard d 'estaing .
but in 1981 his wartime record was revealed when documents were unearthed showing that he had authorized the deportations .
too sick to serve papon has argued that he did n't know the fate of the jews he deported , and that he had to deport them to keep his job at the time .
despite his claims of innocence , he was convicted of crimes against humanity six years ago .
but he walked out of prison in 2002 after a court ruled him too old and sick to finish his 10-year sentence .
the decision outraged the victims of france 's wartime regime and their families .
yet the court of cassation , france 's highest court , will now study an appeal request to clear papon 's name .
this time , the judges wo n't look at the question of papon 's guilt or innocence , but rather focus on obscure legal problems that occurred during his trial .
the procedure is not an appeal as such , but a review by the court to decide whether or not a new appeal can take place .
judges are expected to rule on the matter june 16 .
papon has launched many appeals because he believes justice was fundamentally not carried out during the drawn-out legal battles which began over twenty years ago .
touching a nerve he claims not to regret his actions during the war , and says he ca n't be held partially responsible for holocaust crimes , because he was removed by several " links in the chain " from the murders that took place in concentration camps .
the question of indirect collaboration with war crimes touched a sensitive nerve in france , where the media has periodically pounced on the case , and reopened public dialogue about the extent of nazi sympathy in france during world war ii .
papon says his goal now is to clear his name for history .
but jewish groups say he should still be in prison , citing his lack of remorse .
when papon walked free in 2002 , the u.s.-based simon wiesenthal center called the release " a bad case of misplaced sympathy . "
a frequent problem france has not been the only nation faced with the problem of high officials with nazi pasts .
as recently as last month , a decision by germany 's christian democrats to include a former state premier with a history of nazi activity as a delegate to the presidential election was harshly criticized by jewish groups and left-wing politicians .
hans filbinger , 90 , was forced to resign as premier of the southern state of baden-württemberg in 1978 after it emerged that as a naval judge he shared responsibility for handing down death sentences in the waning months of nazi germany .
probably the best-known case is that of austria 's kurt waldheim .
a widely esteemed former secretary general of the united nations , he was running for president of austria in march 1986 when it came to light that he had participated in nazi atrocities during world war ii .
despite this , he served as his country 's head of state until 1992 . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de delegate 's nazi past clouds german presidential election a decision by germany 's christian democrats to include a former state premier with a nazi past as a delegate for a presidential election has been harshly criticized by jewish groups and left-wing politicians .

a bill has been introduced which would add legal weight to patients ' wishes . the federal government is not aiming to legalize active medically assisted suicide , according to justice minister brigitte zypries , rather it is seeking through the bill it introduced on thursday to put patients ' own decisions on medical treatment , especially regarding artificial life support , on more secure legal ground . the law proposed by the social democratic minister would add heft to so-called advance health care declarations , or living wills , made by patients who ask that their lives not be extended by artificial means .
it would also give doctors and patients ' relatives a more secure legal footing when carrying out patients ' wishes . the bill , which if passed would become law in 2006 , is based on suggestions made by a working group the minister convened called " patient autonomy at the end of life . "
headed by a former federal judge , the group included doctors , legal experts , social welfare groups and churches . the group came together after a federal court ruling in march 2003 in which judges acknowledged the relevance of living wills , but ruled that in the event of a disagreement between an attending physician and the custodian of a comatose patient , the matter had to be referred to a guardianship court , which would decide whether , for example , removing a feeding tube would be in the best interests of the patient . according to zypries , under the new law the guardianship would no longer be consulted if a living will has designated a person to represent a patient 's wishes should he or she no longer be able to .
that representative would then be able to make decisions based on the contents of the living will .
additionally , the living will should in the future have legal weight in any stage of illness , not only when the patient 's condition has become terminal . the head of the working group which drafted the bill , federal judge klaus kutzer , said the proposed law is not active assisted suicide or the so-called death on demand , in which a lethal drug is administered to a patient .
he said the working group did not want to create any legal room for such actions with the proposed law , but did want to create a legal framework in which passive doctor-assisted suicide was possible for patients who wanted it . slippery slope criticism but the minister 's proposal drew criticism from churches , the german hospice association , the federal doctors ' chamber and the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , who said it was a first step in legalizing active medically assisted suicide .
hubert hüppe , deputy head of the german parliament 's ethics commission and cdu member , warned against " unusually dangerous tendencies " toward weakening laws that protect the lives of patients .
both the protestant and catholic churches of germany said patients " should not in any instance be put under pressure " to end their lives . justice minister zypries encouraged germans to put some thought into what they would want should they be incapacitated by a serious illness or accident and to consider drawing up a living will . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german hospice movement seeks to make " dying a part of life " death remains a taboo topic , causing many to die alone - in hospitals or nursing homes .

government ministers acknowledged that war in iraq played a role . british prime minister tony blair 's party lost more than 200 seats on local councils , according to bbc .
while final results have not been announced , labor is expected to come in third , behind opposition conservatives and the third party liberal democrats . speaking at the g-8 summit in the u.s. state of georgia , blair said the british role in iraq had cast a shadow over the elections .
" but in the end you have to take decisions that are right and you have to see them through , " he told reporters . the conservatives were unable to make huge gains as they also supported the war in iraq .
only the liberal democrats , who opposed a british involvement , made strides at the ballots . results unlikely to threaten blair 's re-election while experts said that the elections were unlikely to threaten blair 's re-election in the upcoming general election , which is expected to take place next year , government officials also tried to play down the significance of the results . " we always knew this was going to be a very difficult election for us , " nick raynford , the cabinet minister in charge of local government issues , told sky television .
" governments in mid-term tend to lose . " results in elections for london 's mayor were expected to be announced later on friday .
incumbent ken livingstone was expected to win re-election . british voters also cast their ballots in the european parliament elections on thursday , but those results are not expected to be announced until sunday after all other 25 eu countries have voted as well . the anti-eu uk independence party , which has called for britain 's withdrawal from the eu , is expected to fare well in those elections and could quadruple its seats to 12 . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu-skeptics gain momentum in britain elections for the european parliament started thursday as dutch and british voters headed to the polls .

from bit player to global heavyweight current affairs -pipe- 11.06.2004 g-8 summit ends with emphasis on mid east reform großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there was time for a stroll under palm trees g-8 leaders wrapped up their three-day summit at the luxury sea island resort in georgia thursday by vowing to promote democracy in the middle east , but failed to strongly back a u.s. appeal for help on iraq . the harmony and public bonhomie on display during the summit failed to mask differences between leaders of the world 's eight richest nations , in particular between french president jacques chirac and u.s. president bush . on thursday bush appealed to his heavyweight allies to do more to guide iraq 's transformation to a stable democracy , saying the " iraqi people need help " to defend themselves , rebuild their country and hold elections . although bush scored a victory at the start of the summit with the u.n. security council approving a new resolution on iraq , french president jacques chirac - one of the strongest opponents of the iraq war - rebuffed bush 's suggestion that with several nato states already engaged in iraq , the alliance 's role could be expanded there . " i wo n't hide it from you that i do n't think it is nato 's purpose to intervene in iraq , " chirac said wednesday according to the associated press .
" what 's more , i do n't feel that it would be opportune nor necessarily well understood .
i am totally reserved about this issue , " he said . however , on thursday , the last day of the summit , both bush and chirac attempted to appear more cordial at a private meeting .
bush acknowledged past differences with the french president and told reporters : " friends are able to discuss the future . " a french official also said that despite chirac 's reservations about an expanded nato role in iraq , he is open to discussion ahead of a nato summit in turkey at the end of the month . canada , france and germany also made it clear that even after passage of the resolution , they would n't send troops to the country . the leaders of britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan and russia were also unable to agree on bush 's appeal for oil-rich iraq 's debts be forgiven .
they left the issue open , only deciding that there would be " substantial " debt forgiveness . positive report card from schröder german chancellor gerhard schröder had an upbeat assessment of the meetings on sea island , saying lot of hard work was done there , despite many leaders ' dispensing with their ties and three-pieces suits during meetings .

from bit player to global heavyweight current affairs -pipe- 11.06.2004 g-8 summit ends with emphasis on mid east reform großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there was time for a stroll under palm trees g-8 leaders wrapped up their three-day summit at the luxury sea island resort in georgia thursday by vowing to promote democracy in the middle east , but failed to strongly back a u.s. appeal for help on iraq . the harmony and public bonhomie on display during the summit failed to mask differences between leaders of the world 's eight richest nations , in particular between french president jacques chirac and u.s. president bush . on thursday bush appealed to his heavyweight allies to do more to guide iraq 's transformation to a stable democracy , saying the " iraqi people need help " to defend themselves , rebuild their country and hold elections . although bush scored a victory at the start of the summit with the u.n. security council approving a new resolution on iraq , french president jacques chirac - one of the strongest opponents of the iraq war - rebuffed bush 's suggestion that with several nato states already engaged in iraq , the alliance 's role could be expanded there . " i wo n't hide it from you that i do n't think it is nato 's purpose to intervene in iraq , " chirac said wednesday according to the associated press .
" what 's more , i do n't feel that it would be opportune nor necessarily well understood .
i am totally reserved about this issue , " he said . however , on thursday , the last day of the summit , both bush and chirac attempted to appear more cordial at a private meeting .
bush acknowledged past differences with the french president and told reporters : " friends are able to discuss the future . " a french official also said that despite chirac 's reservations about an expanded nato role in iraq , he is open to discussion ahead of a nato summit in turkey at the end of the month . canada , france and germany also made it clear that even after passage of the resolution , they would n't send troops to the country . the leaders of britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan and russia were also unable to agree on bush 's appeal for oil-rich iraq 's debts be forgiven .
they left the issue open , only deciding that there would be " substantial " debt forgiveness . positive report card from schröder german chancellor gerhard schröder had an upbeat assessment of the meetings on sea island , saying lot of hard work was done there , despite many leaders ' dispensing with their ties and three-pieces suits during meetings .
schröder said the unanimous vote in the u.n. security council for the resolution on iraq had not only made the summit work easier , it had proved that one can " come together .

government ministers acknowledged that war in iraq played a role . british prime minister tony blair 's party lost more than 200 seats on local councils , according to bbc .
while final results have not been announced , labor is expected to come in third , behind opposition conservatives and the third party liberal democrats . speaking at the g-8 summit in the u.s. state of georgia , blair said the british role in iraq had cast a shadow over the elections .
" but in the end you have to take decisions that are right and you have to see them through , " he told reporters . the conservatives were unable to make huge gains as they also supported the war in iraq .
only the liberal democrats , who opposed a british involvement , made strides at the ballots . results unlikely to threaten blair 's re-election while experts said that the elections were unlikely to threaten blair 's re-election in the upcoming general election , which is expected to take place next year , government officials also tried to play down the significance of the results . " we always knew this was going to be a very difficult election for us , " nick raynford , the cabinet minister in charge of local government issues , told sky television .
" governments in mid-term tend to lose . " results in elections for london 's mayor were expected to be announced later on friday .
incumbent ken livingstone was expected to win re-election . british voters also cast their ballots in the european parliament elections on thursday , but those results are not expected to be announced until sunday after all other 25 eu countries have voted as well . the anti-eu uk independence party , which has called for britain 's withdrawal from the eu , is expected to fare well in those elections and could quadruple its seats to 12 . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu-skeptics gain momentum in britain elections for the european parliament started thursday as dutch and british voters headed to the polls .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.06.2004 government split on ' clean diesel ' initiatives großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diesel cars are sparking an unfiltered debate berlin says it wants to give tax breaks for cars with clean diesel , but a divided cabinet and automobile industry have stalled the effort - at least for now . for years , diesel cars have been considered more environmentally friendly than traditional gasoline motors because they create fewer climate-damaging emissions .
the problem has always been that they emit toxic particles that have been linked to cancer and respiratory illnesses .
however , the recent creation of so-called particle filters has made diesel engines safer for consumer use .
proponents say particle filters are the only technology currently available that can cut particle emissions by 99 percent .
but german car makers have n't been quick enough to jump on the bandwagon , and that 's beginning to create a political problem in the environmentally progressive country .
in contrast to french car makers like peugeot and renault , which have embraced particle-filter diesel engines , german companies have instead opted for internal improvements to diesel motors , with moderate successes in reducing particle emissions .
a shot in the arm german environment minister jürgen trittin of the green party has drafted legislation that would seek to give a shot in the arm to the particle filter business by providing a tax break of € 600 -lrb- $ 740 -rrb- on diesel cars with new particle filters that reduce particle emissions to a stringent limit of 2.5 milligrams per kilometer .
but major car makers like volkswagen have called for a looser limit of 12.5 milligrams .
environmental groups , the green party and factions of the social democrats are backing trittin 's calls , which they say is supported by environment ministry data claiming that 14,000 people die each year as a result of diesel particle emissions .
but the industry , led by volkswagen , has fought tooth and nail to avoid being forced to adopt the filters .
in an attempt to break the bottleneck , german chancellor gerhard schröder met earlier this week in berlin with vw ceo bernd pischetsrieder and other top european automobile industry executives to discuss future use of particle filters .
" every seventh job in germany is still dependent on the automobile industry , " said schröder 's spokesman , bela anda .
" this should not be seen as a call for measures not to be implemented .
but it should also make it clear that there are also endeavors in the industry to reach this goal through changes in the internal motors - and people should n't disregard that fact . "
after his meeting with pischetsrieder , schröder said no decision had been reached as to when particle filters would be included in cars or how they might be filtered .
instead , the chancellor and the executives of europe 's largest car maker decided to leave responsibility for the decision with brussels .
by the end of the year , the eu is expected to produce regulations for emissions norms that would serve as the blueprint for filtering technologies .
for the automobile industry , punting the responsibility to brussels represents a partial victory , as the standards proposed by germany 's trittin would likely have been much stricter .
gerd lottsiepen , of the german automobile club , said the car manufacturers were acting irresponsibly in their fight against technological limits .
" the manufacturers who are now issuing polemical attacks against these limits ... are knowingly acting against the interests of consumers .
the customers who buy cars today with yesterday 's technology will get stuck paying the piper for the manufacturer 's deep sleep .
the loss of value for cars without particle filters will be higher than average in the coming years , " lottsiepen said .
to some environmental groups , including greenpeace , the financial incentive trittin has proposed does not go far enough .
" the price difference between the systems runs between € 300 and € 1,300 , " said günter hubmann of greenpeace .
" we 're demanding that , for the best system , which is 99 percent effective , a tax break of € 999 should be given by the government .
how , exactly , that can happen still needs to be negotiated . "
discord in berlin the current debate over particle filters also threatens to spark a new row between environment minister trittin and economics minister wolfgang clement , who just recently locked horns over emissions trading standards for heavy industry .
responding to the particle filter debate , clement has said he does not want to add further pressure to car makers while the economy struggles for growth .
companies like vw say that if particle filters become obligatory , it should not happen before 2007 and that the particle emission limits should be set higher than trittin 's proposed standard .
meanwhile , the opposition parties , including the christian democratic union , have said that promoting specific or special technologies should not be the government 's responsibility .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dacia , logan , 2004 though germany leads europe in auto exports , the particle filter issue has been driven by the french .
there , car-maker peugeot introduced its first diesel car with a particle filter in 2000 , offering the additional safety at the same price as its other diesel offerings .
peugeot 's parent company , autogruppe psa , is the world 's largest self-combusting engine manufacturer , and it has widely introduced particle filters in its diesel cars .
but differences remain between germany 's leading politicians on the best way to move forward with particle filters .
and any car tax breaks proposed by the federal government must also be approved by the states that are entitled to the proceeds from the motor vehicle tax .
so far , most states are taking a reserved approach to the proposal , with ministers in some states , like bavaria , saying it has not yet been proven that the current generation of particle filters are the most effective means of reducing particle emissions from diesel motors . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de still no decision on filters for diesel cars the german government has still not made a decision on whether it will subsidize diesel-powered cars outfitted with particulate filters .
on monday , a summit between top players from europe 's car industry and german chancellor gerhard schröder dealt with the topic as well as the general competitiveness of the auto industry .

during the nazi occupation , papon oversaw the bordeaux area police and signed orders that led to the deportation of 1,690 jews from 1942 to 1944 .
most of those deported perished in the auschwitz concentration camp .
papon rose through the ranks of french politics following world war ii , becoming chief of the paris police in 1958 , and later national budget minister under valerie giscard d 'estaing .
but in 1981 his wartime record was revealed when documents were unearthed showing that he had authorized the deportations .
too sick to serve papon has argued that he did n't know the fate of the jews he deported , and that he had to deport them to keep his job at the time .
despite his claims of innocence , he was convicted of crimes against humanity six years ago .
but he walked out of prison in 2002 after a court ruled him too old and sick to finish his 10-year sentence .
the decision outraged the victims of france 's wartime regime and their families .
yet the court of cassation , france 's highest court , will now study an appeal request to clear papon 's name .
this time , the judges wo n't look at the question of papon 's guilt or innocence , but rather focus on obscure legal problems that occurred during his trial .
the procedure is not an appeal as such , but a review by the court to decide whether or not a new appeal can take place .
judges are expected to rule on the matter june 16 .
papon has launched many appeals because he believes justice was fundamentally not carried out during the drawn-out legal battles which began over twenty years ago .
touching a nerve he claims not to regret his actions during the war , and says he ca n't be held partially responsible for holocaust crimes , because he was removed by several " links in the chain " from the murders that took place in concentration camps .
the question of indirect collaboration with war crimes touched a sensitive nerve in france , where the media has periodically pounced on the case , and reopened public dialogue about the extent of nazi sympathy in france during world war ii .
papon says his goal now is to clear his name for history .
but jewish groups say he should still be in prison , citing his lack of remorse .
when papon walked free in 2002 , the u.s.-based simon wiesenthal center called the release " a bad case of misplaced sympathy . "
a frequent problem france has not been the only nation faced with the problem of high officials with nazi pasts .
as recently as last month , a decision by germany 's christian democrats to include a former state premier with a history of nazi activity as a delegate to the presidential election was harshly criticized by jewish groups and left-wing politicians .
hans filbinger , 90 , was forced to resign as premier of the southern state of baden-württemberg in 1978 after it emerged that as a naval judge he shared responsibility for handing down death sentences in the waning months of nazi germany .
probably the best-known case is that of austria 's kurt waldheim .
a widely esteemed former secretary general of the united nations , he was running for president of austria in march 1986 when it came to light that he had participated in nazi atrocities during world war ii .
despite this , he served as his country 's head of state until 1992 . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de delegate 's nazi past clouds german presidential election a decision by germany 's christian democrats to include a former state premier with a nazi past as a delegate for a presidential election has been harshly criticized by jewish groups and left-wing politicians .

the question of indirect collaboration with war crimes touched a sensitive nerve in france , where the media has periodically pounced on the case , and reopened public dialogue about the extent of nazi sympathy in france during world war ii .
papon says his goal now is to clear his name for history .
but jewish groups say he should still be in prison , citing his lack of remorse .
when papon walked free in 2002 , the u.s.-based simon wiesenthal center called the release " a bad case of misplaced sympathy . "
a frequent problem france has not been the only nation faced with the problem of high officials with nazi pasts .
as recently as last month , a decision by germany 's christian democrats to include a former state premier with a history of nazi activity as a delegate to the presidential election was harshly criticized by jewish groups and left-wing politicians .
hans filbinger , 90 , was forced to resign as premier of the southern state of baden-württemberg in 1978 after it emerged that as a naval judge he shared responsibility for handing down death sentences in the waning months of nazi germany .

during the nazi occupation , papon oversaw the bordeaux area police and signed orders that led to the deportation of 1,690 jews from 1942 to 1944 .
most of those deported perished in the auschwitz concentration camp .
papon rose through the ranks of french politics following world war ii , becoming chief of the paris police in 1958 , and later national budget minister under valerie giscard d 'estaing .
but in 1981 his wartime record was revealed when documents were unearthed showing that he had authorized the deportations .
too sick to serve papon has argued that he did n't know the fate of the jews he deported , and that he had to deport them to keep his job at the time .
despite his claims of innocence , he was convicted of crimes against humanity six years ago .
but he walked out of prison in 2002 after a court ruled him too old and sick to finish his 10-year sentence .
the decision outraged the victims of france 's wartime regime and their families .
yet the court of cassation , france 's highest court , will now study an appeal request to clear papon 's name .
this time , the judges wo n't look at the question of papon 's guilt or innocence , but rather focus on obscure legal problems that occurred during his trial .
the procedure is not an appeal as such , but a review by the court to decide whether or not a new appeal can take place .
judges are expected to rule on the matter june 16 .

government ministers acknowledged that war in iraq played a role . british prime minister tony blair 's party lost more than 200 seats on local councils , according to bbc .

" but in the end you have to take decisions that are right and you have to see them through , " he told reporters . the conservatives were unable to make huge gains as they also supported the war in iraq .
only the liberal democrats , who opposed a british involvement , made strides at the ballots . results unlikely to threaten blair 's re-election while experts said that the elections were unlikely to threaten blair 's re-election in the upcoming general election , which is expected to take place next year , government officials also tried to play down the significance of the results .

" governments in mid-term tend to lose . " results in elections for london 's mayor were expected to be announced later on friday .
incumbent ken livingstone was expected to win re-election . british voters also cast their ballots in the european parliament elections on thursday , but those results are not expected to be announced until sunday after all other 25 eu countries have voted as well . the anti-eu uk independence party , which has called for britain 's withdrawal from the eu , is expected to fare well in those elections and could quadruple its seats to 12 . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu-skeptics gain momentum in britain elections for the european parliament started thursday as dutch and british voters headed to the polls .

a bill has been introduced which would add legal weight to patients ' wishes . the federal government is not aiming to legalize active medically assisted suicide , according to justice minister brigitte zypries , rather it is seeking through the bill it introduced on thursday to put patients ' own decisions on medical treatment , especially regarding artificial life support , on more secure legal ground . the law proposed by the social democratic minister would add heft to so-called advance health care declarations , or living wills , made by patients who ask that their lives not be extended by artificial means .
it would also give doctors and patients ' relatives a more secure legal footing when carrying out patients ' wishes . the bill , which if passed would become law in 2006 , is based on suggestions made by a working group the minister convened called " patient autonomy at the end of life . "
headed by a former federal judge , the group included doctors , legal experts , social welfare groups and churches . the group came together after a federal court ruling in march 2003 in which judges acknowledged the relevance of living wills , but ruled that in the event of a disagreement between an attending physician and the custodian of a comatose patient , the matter had to be referred to a guardianship court , which would decide whether , for example , removing a feeding tube would be in the best interests of the patient . according to zypries , under the new law the guardianship would no longer be consulted if a living will has designated a person to represent a patient 's wishes should he or she no longer be able to .
that representative would then be able to make decisions based on the contents of the living will .
additionally , the living will should in the future have legal weight in any stage of illness , not only when the patient 's condition has become terminal . the head of the working group which drafted the bill , federal judge klaus kutzer , said the proposed law is not active assisted suicide or the so-called death on demand , in which a lethal drug is administered to a patient .
he said the working group did not want to create any legal room for such actions with the proposed law , but did want to create a legal framework in which passive doctor-assisted suicide was possible for patients who wanted it . slippery slope criticism but the minister 's proposal drew criticism from churches , the german hospice association , the federal doctors ' chamber and the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , who said it was a first step in legalizing active medically assisted suicide .
hubert hüppe , deputy head of the german parliament 's ethics commission and cdu member , warned against " unusually dangerous tendencies " toward weakening laws that protect the lives of patients .
both the protestant and catholic churches of germany said patients " should not in any instance be put under pressure " to end their lives . justice minister zypries encouraged germans to put some thought into what they would want should they be incapacitated by a serious illness or accident and to consider drawing up a living will . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german hospice movement seeks to make " dying a part of life " death remains a taboo topic , causing many to die alone - in hospitals or nursing homes .

a bill has been introduced which would add legal weight to patients ' wishes . the federal government is not aiming to legalize active medically assisted suicide , according to justice minister brigitte zypries , rather it is seeking through the bill it introduced on thursday to put patients ' own decisions on medical treatment , especially regarding artificial life support , on more secure legal ground . the law proposed by the social democratic minister would add heft to so-called advance health care declarations , or living wills , made by patients who ask that their lives not be extended by artificial means .
it would also give doctors and patients ' relatives a more secure legal footing when carrying out patients ' wishes . the bill , which if passed would become law in 2006 , is based on suggestions made by a working group the minister convened called " patient autonomy at the end of life . "
headed by a former federal judge , the group included doctors , legal experts , social welfare groups and churches . the group came together after a federal court ruling in march 2003 in which judges acknowledged the relevance of living wills , but ruled that in the event of a disagreement between an attending physician and the custodian of a comatose patient , the matter had to be referred to a guardianship court , which would decide whether , for example , removing a feeding tube would be in the best interests of the patient . according to zypries , under the new law the guardianship would no longer be consulted if a living will has designated a person to represent a patient 's wishes should he or she no longer be able to .
that representative would then be able to make decisions based on the contents of the living will .
additionally , the living will should in the future have legal weight in any stage of illness , not only when the patient 's condition has become terminal . the head of the working group which drafted the bill , federal judge klaus kutzer , said the proposed law is not active assisted suicide or the so-called death on demand , in which a lethal drug is administered to a patient .
he said the working group did not want to create any legal room for such actions with the proposed law , but did want to create a legal framework in which passive doctor-assisted suicide was possible for patients who wanted it . slippery slope criticism but the minister 's proposal drew criticism from churches , the german hospice association , the federal doctors ' chamber and the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , who said it was a first step in legalizing active medically assisted suicide .
hubert hüppe , deputy head of the german parliament 's ethics commission and cdu member , warned against " unusually dangerous tendencies " toward weakening laws that protect the lives of patients .
both the protestant and catholic churches of germany said patients " should not in any instance be put under pressure " to end their lives . justice minister zypries encouraged germans to put some thought into what they would want should they be incapacitated by a serious illness or accident and to consider drawing up a living will . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german hospice movement seeks to make " dying a part of life " death remains a taboo topic , causing many to die alone - in hospitals or nursing homes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.06.2004 government split on ' clean diesel ' initiatives großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diesel cars are sparking an unfiltered debate berlin says it wants to give tax breaks for cars with clean diesel , but a divided cabinet and automobile industry have stalled the effort - at least for now . for years , diesel cars have been considered more environmentally friendly than traditional gasoline motors because they create fewer climate-damaging emissions .
the problem has always been that they emit toxic particles that have been linked to cancer and respiratory illnesses .
however , the recent creation of so-called particle filters has made diesel engines safer for consumer use .
proponents say particle filters are the only technology currently available that can cut particle emissions by 99 percent .
but german car makers have n't been quick enough to jump on the bandwagon , and that 's beginning to create a political problem in the environmentally progressive country .
in contrast to french car makers like peugeot and renault , which have embraced particle-filter diesel engines , german companies have instead opted for internal improvements to diesel motors , with moderate successes in reducing particle emissions .
a shot in the arm german environment minister jürgen trittin of the green party has drafted legislation that would seek to give a shot in the arm to the particle filter business by providing a tax break of € 600 -lrb- $ 740 -rrb- on diesel cars with new particle filters that reduce particle emissions to a stringent limit of 2.5 milligrams per kilometer .
but major car makers like volkswagen have called for a looser limit of 12.5 milligrams .
environmental groups , the green party and factions of the social democrats are backing trittin 's calls , which they say is supported by environment ministry data claiming that 14,000 people die each year as a result of diesel particle emissions .
but the industry , led by volkswagen , has fought tooth and nail to avoid being forced to adopt the filters .
in an attempt to break the bottleneck , german chancellor gerhard schröder met earlier this week in berlin with vw ceo bernd pischetsrieder and other top european automobile industry executives to discuss future use of particle filters .
" every seventh job in germany is still dependent on the automobile industry , " said schröder 's spokesman , bela anda .
" this should not be seen as a call for measures not to be implemented .
but it should also make it clear that there are also endeavors in the industry to reach this goal through changes in the internal motors - and people should n't disregard that fact . "
after his meeting with pischetsrieder , schröder said no decision had been reached as to when particle filters would be included in cars or how they might be filtered .
instead , the chancellor and the executives of europe 's largest car maker decided to leave responsibility for the decision with brussels .
by the end of the year , the eu is expected to produce regulations for emissions norms that would serve as the blueprint for filtering technologies .
for the automobile industry , punting the responsibility to brussels represents a partial victory , as the standards proposed by germany 's trittin would likely have been much stricter .
gerd lottsiepen , of the german automobile club , said the car manufacturers were acting irresponsibly in their fight against technological limits .
" the manufacturers who are now issuing polemical attacks against these limits ... are knowingly acting against the interests of consumers .
the customers who buy cars today with yesterday 's technology will get stuck paying the piper for the manufacturer 's deep sleep .
the loss of value for cars without particle filters will be higher than average in the coming years , " lottsiepen said .
to some environmental groups , including greenpeace , the financial incentive trittin has proposed does not go far enough .
" the price difference between the systems runs between € 300 and € 1,300 , " said günter hubmann of greenpeace .
" we 're demanding that , for the best system , which is 99 percent effective , a tax break of € 999 should be given by the government .
how , exactly , that can happen still needs to be negotiated . "
discord in berlin the current debate over particle filters also threatens to spark a new row between environment minister trittin and economics minister wolfgang clement , who just recently locked horns over emissions trading standards for heavy industry .
responding to the particle filter debate , clement has said he does not want to add further pressure to car makers while the economy struggles for growth .
companies like vw say that if particle filters become obligatory , it should not happen before 2007 and that the particle emission limits should be set higher than trittin 's proposed standard .
meanwhile , the opposition parties , including the christian democratic union , have said that promoting specific or special technologies should not be the government 's responsibility .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dacia , logan , 2004 though germany leads europe in auto exports , the particle filter issue has been driven by the french .
there , car-maker peugeot introduced its first diesel car with a particle filter in 2000 , offering the additional safety at the same price as its other diesel offerings .
peugeot 's parent company , autogruppe psa , is the world 's largest self-combusting engine manufacturer , and it has widely introduced particle filters in its diesel cars .
but differences remain between germany 's leading politicians on the best way to move forward with particle filters .
and any car tax breaks proposed by the federal government must also be approved by the states that are entitled to the proceeds from the motor vehicle tax .
so far , most states are taking a reserved approach to the proposal , with ministers in some states , like bavaria , saying it has not yet been proven that the current generation of particle filters are the most effective means of reducing particle emissions from diesel motors . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de still no decision on filters for diesel cars the german government has still not made a decision on whether it will subsidize diesel-powered cars outfitted with particulate filters .

after his meeting with pischetsrieder , schröder said no decision had been reached as to when particle filters would be included in cars or how they might be filtered .
instead , the chancellor and the executives of europe 's largest car maker decided to leave responsibility for the decision with brussels .
by the end of the year , the eu is expected to produce regulations for emissions norms that would serve as the blueprint for filtering technologies .
for the automobile industry , punting the responsibility to brussels represents a partial victory , as the standards proposed by germany 's trittin would likely have been much stricter .
gerd lottsiepen , of the german automobile club , said the car manufacturers were acting irresponsibly in their fight against technological limits .
" the manufacturers who are now issuing polemical attacks against these limits ... are knowingly acting against the interests of consumers .
the customers who buy cars today with yesterday 's technology will get stuck paying the piper for the manufacturer 's deep sleep .
the loss of value for cars without particle filters will be higher than average in the coming years , " lottsiepen said .
to some environmental groups , including greenpeace , the financial incentive trittin has proposed does not go far enough .
" the price difference between the systems runs between € 300 and € 1,300 , " said günter hubmann of greenpeace .
" we 're demanding that , for the best system , which is 99 percent effective , a tax break of € 999 should be given by the government .
how , exactly , that can happen still needs to be negotiated . "
discord in berlin the current debate over particle filters also threatens to spark a new row between environment minister trittin and economics minister wolfgang clement , who just recently locked horns over emissions trading standards for heavy industry .
responding to the particle filter debate , clement has said he does not want to add further pressure to car makers while the economy struggles for growth .
companies like vw say that if particle filters become obligatory , it should not happen before 2007 and that the particle emission limits should be set higher than trittin 's proposed standard .
meanwhile , the opposition parties , including the christian democratic union , have said that promoting specific or special technologies should not be the government 's responsibility .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dacia , logan , 2004 though germany leads europe in auto exports , the particle filter issue has been driven by the french .
there , car-maker peugeot introduced its first diesel car with a particle filter in 2000 , offering the additional safety at the same price as its other diesel offerings .
peugeot 's parent company , autogruppe psa , is the world 's largest self-combusting engine manufacturer , and it has widely introduced particle filters in its diesel cars .
but differences remain between germany 's leading politicians on the best way to move forward with particle filters .
and any car tax breaks proposed by the federal government must also be approved by the states that are entitled to the proceeds from the motor vehicle tax .
so far , most states are taking a reserved approach to the proposal , with ministers in some states , like bavaria , saying it has not yet been proven that the current generation of particle filters are the most effective means of reducing particle emissions from diesel motors . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de still no decision on filters for diesel cars the german government has still not made a decision on whether it will subsidize diesel-powered cars outfitted with particulate filters .
on monday , a summit between top players from europe 's car industry and german chancellor gerhard schröder dealt with the topic as well as the general competitiveness of the auto industry .

the problem has always been that they emit toxic particles that have been linked to cancer and respiratory illnesses .
however , the recent creation of so-called particle filters has made diesel engines safer for consumer use .
proponents say particle filters are the only technology currently available that can cut particle emissions by 99 percent .
but german car makers have n't been quick enough to jump on the bandwagon , and that 's beginning to create a political problem in the environmentally progressive country .
in contrast to french car makers like peugeot and renault , which have embraced particle-filter diesel engines , german companies have instead opted for internal improvements to diesel motors , with moderate successes in reducing particle emissions .
a shot in the arm german environment minister jürgen trittin of the green party has drafted legislation that would seek to give a shot in the arm to the particle filter business by providing a tax break of € 600 -lrb- $ 740 -rrb- on diesel cars with new particle filters that reduce particle emissions to a stringent limit of 2.5 milligrams per kilometer .
but major car makers like volkswagen have called for a looser limit of 12.5 milligrams .
environmental groups , the green party and factions of the social democrats are backing trittin 's calls , which they say is supported by environment ministry data claiming that 14,000 people die each year as a result of diesel particle emissions .
but the industry , led by volkswagen , has fought tooth and nail to avoid being forced to adopt the filters .
in an attempt to break the bottleneck , german chancellor gerhard schröder met earlier this week in berlin with vw ceo bernd pischetsrieder and other top european automobile industry executives to discuss future use of particle filters .
" every seventh job in germany is still dependent on the automobile industry , " said schröder 's spokesman , bela anda .
" this should not be seen as a call for measures not to be implemented .
but it should also make it clear that there are also endeavors in the industry to reach this goal through changes in the internal motors - and people should n't disregard that fact . "
after his meeting with pischetsrieder , schröder said no decision had been reached as to when particle filters would be included in cars or how they might be filtered .
instead , the chancellor and the executives of europe 's largest car maker decided to leave responsibility for the decision with brussels .
by the end of the year , the eu is expected to produce regulations for emissions norms that would serve as the blueprint for filtering technologies .
for the automobile industry , punting the responsibility to brussels represents a partial victory , as the standards proposed by germany 's trittin would likely have been much stricter .
gerd lottsiepen , of the german automobile club , said the car manufacturers were acting irresponsibly in their fight against technological limits .
" the manufacturers who are now issuing polemical attacks against these limits ... are knowingly acting against the interests of consumers .
the customers who buy cars today with yesterday 's technology will get stuck paying the piper for the manufacturer 's deep sleep .
the loss of value for cars without particle filters will be higher than average in the coming years , " lottsiepen said .
to some environmental groups , including greenpeace , the financial incentive trittin has proposed does not go far enough .
" the price difference between the systems runs between € 300 and € 1,300 , " said günter hubmann of greenpeace .
" we 're demanding that , for the best system , which is 99 percent effective , a tax break of € 999 should be given by the government .
how , exactly , that can happen still needs to be negotiated . "
discord in berlin the current debate over particle filters also threatens to spark a new row between environment minister trittin and economics minister wolfgang clement , who just recently locked horns over emissions trading standards for heavy industry .
responding to the particle filter debate , clement has said he does not want to add further pressure to car makers while the economy struggles for growth .
companies like vw say that if particle filters become obligatory , it should not happen before 2007 and that the particle emission limits should be set higher than trittin 's proposed standard .
meanwhile , the opposition parties , including the christian democratic union , have said that promoting specific or special technologies should not be the government 's responsibility .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dacia , logan , 2004 though germany leads europe in auto exports , the particle filter issue has been driven by the french .
there , car-maker peugeot introduced its first diesel car with a particle filter in 2000 , offering the additional safety at the same price as its other diesel offerings .
peugeot 's parent company , autogruppe psa , is the world 's largest self-combusting engine manufacturer , and it has widely introduced particle filters in its diesel cars .
but differences remain between germany 's leading politicians on the best way to move forward with particle filters .
and any car tax breaks proposed by the federal government must also be approved by the states that are entitled to the proceeds from the motor vehicle tax .
so far , most states are taking a reserved approach to the proposal , with ministers in some states , like bavaria , saying it has not yet been proven that the current generation of particle filters are the most effective means of reducing particle emissions from diesel motors . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de still no decision on filters for diesel cars the german government has still not made a decision on whether it will subsidize diesel-powered cars outfitted with particulate filters .

from bit player to global heavyweight current affairs -pipe- 11.06.2004 g-8 summit ends with emphasis on mid east reform großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there was time for a stroll under palm trees g-8 leaders wrapped up their three-day summit at the luxury sea island resort in georgia thursday by vowing to promote democracy in the middle east , but failed to strongly back a u.s. appeal for help on iraq . the harmony and public bonhomie on display during the summit failed to mask differences between leaders of the world 's eight richest nations , in particular between french president jacques chirac and u.s. president bush . on thursday bush appealed to his heavyweight allies to do more to guide iraq 's transformation to a stable democracy , saying the " iraqi people need help " to defend themselves , rebuild their country and hold elections . although bush scored a victory at the start of the summit with the u.n. security council approving a new resolution on iraq , french president jacques chirac - one of the strongest opponents of the iraq war - rebuffed bush 's suggestion that with several nato states already engaged in iraq , the alliance 's role could be expanded there . " i wo n't hide it from you that i do n't think it is nato 's purpose to intervene in iraq , " chirac said wednesday according to the associated press .
" what 's more , i do n't feel that it would be opportune nor necessarily well understood .
i am totally reserved about this issue , " he said . however , on thursday , the last day of the summit , both bush and chirac attempted to appear more cordial at a private meeting .
bush acknowledged past differences with the french president and told reporters : " friends are able to discuss the future . " a french official also said that despite chirac 's reservations about an expanded nato role in iraq , he is open to discussion ahead of a nato summit in turkey at the end of the month . canada , france and germany also made it clear that even after passage of the resolution , they would n't send troops to the country . the leaders of britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan and russia were also unable to agree on bush 's appeal for oil-rich iraq 's debts be forgiven .
they left the issue open , only deciding that there would be " substantial " debt forgiveness . positive report card from schröder german chancellor gerhard schröder had an upbeat assessment of the meetings on sea island , saying lot of hard work was done there , despite many leaders ' dispensing with their ties and three-pieces suits during meetings .
schröder said the unanimous vote in the u.n. security council for the resolution on iraq had not only made the summit work easier , it had proved that one can " come together . " while standing by his pledge not to send german soldiers to iraq , he said germany would not stand in the way of nato doing so . schröder said one of the signals from the summit was a desire to stabilize the " very , very good " situation that the global economy finds itself in . one of the main risks , however , to economic stability is the insecurity in the middle east .
another is the price of oil , if it remains at its current record-high prices . middle east democratization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from top center , going clockwise : u.s. president george w. bush , russian president vladimir putin , german chancellor gerhard schröder , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , european council president bertie ahern , european commission president romano prodi , canadian prime minister paul martin , japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi , british prime minister tony blair and french president jacques chirac during the morning plenary meeting at the g-8 summit in sea island on wednesday .
g-8 leaders at the summit did agree to president bush 's initiative to promote democratic reform in the arab world , and they offered middle eastern and northern african states a political and economic partnership , which would include regular talks at ministerial level , aid in organizing free and transparent elections , increased efforts to fight illiteracy and loans for small businesses . but along with the french president , german chancellor gerhard schröder was still cautious about the plans .

a professor of public law at the postgraduate school of administrative sciences in the german town of speyer , von arnim has conducted a study into the system of party lists , which he claims goes some way to predetermining the results of the elections .
his calculations are based on the german election rules , figures from the latest election as well as current projections , he told the euobserver .
if unpopular politicians are at the top of the party list , voters can not get rid of them unless they vote for another party .
equally they have no major chance of backing a popular candidate at the bottom of the list .
german rules stick strictly to party lists , thus preventing voters from voting on individuals rather than parties , he says .
one example is gabriele stauner , conservative mep from the german state of bavaria , who is known for her work on fighting fraud and corruption .
however , in the forthcoming election she is number 10 on the list of her party and thus not sure to be back in brussels after the election .
armin argued recently that this system could be in conflict with german constitutional law , which requires " free and direct " elections .
according to his method von arnim produced a list of 77 secure seats including members of the christian democrats , the social democrats and the green party .

a professor of public law at the postgraduate school of administrative sciences in the german town of speyer , von arnim has conducted a study into the system of party lists , which he claims goes some way to predetermining the results of the elections .
his calculations are based on the german election rules , figures from the latest election as well as current projections , he told the euobserver .
if unpopular politicians are at the top of the party list , voters can not get rid of them unless they vote for another party .
equally they have no major chance of backing a popular candidate at the bottom of the list .
german rules stick strictly to party lists , thus preventing voters from voting on individuals rather than parties , he says .
one example is gabriele stauner , conservative mep from the german state of bavaria , who is known for her work on fighting fraud and corruption .
however , in the forthcoming election she is number 10 on the list of her party and thus not sure to be back in brussels after the election .
armin argued recently that this system could be in conflict with german constitutional law , which requires " free and direct " elections .
according to his method von arnim produced a list of 77 secure seats including members of the christian democrats , the social democrats and the green party .

a bill has been introduced which would add legal weight to patients ' wishes . the federal government is not aiming to legalize active medically assisted suicide , according to justice minister brigitte zypries , rather it is seeking through the bill it introduced on thursday to put patients ' own decisions on medical treatment , especially regarding artificial life support , on more secure legal ground . the law proposed by the social democratic minister would add heft to so-called advance health care declarations , or living wills , made by patients who ask that their lives not be extended by artificial means .
it would also give doctors and patients ' relatives a more secure legal footing when carrying out patients ' wishes . the bill , which if passed would become law in 2006 , is based on suggestions made by a working group the minister convened called " patient autonomy at the end of life . "
headed by a former federal judge , the group included doctors , legal experts , social welfare groups and churches . the group came together after a federal court ruling in march 2003 in which judges acknowledged the relevance of living wills , but ruled that in the event of a disagreement between an attending physician and the custodian of a comatose patient , the matter had to be referred to a guardianship court , which would decide whether , for example , removing a feeding tube would be in the best interests of the patient . according to zypries , under the new law the guardianship would no longer be consulted if a living will has designated a person to represent a patient 's wishes should he or she no longer be able to .
that representative would then be able to make decisions based on the contents of the living will .
additionally , the living will should in the future have legal weight in any stage of illness , not only when the patient 's condition has become terminal . the head of the working group which drafted the bill , federal judge klaus kutzer , said the proposed law is not active assisted suicide or the so-called death on demand , in which a lethal drug is administered to a patient .
he said the working group did not want to create any legal room for such actions with the proposed law , but did want to create a legal framework in which passive doctor-assisted suicide was possible for patients who wanted it . slippery slope criticism but the minister 's proposal drew criticism from churches , the german hospice association , the federal doctors ' chamber and the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , who said it was a first step in legalizing active medically assisted suicide .
hubert hüppe , deputy head of the german parliament 's ethics commission and cdu member , warned against " unusually dangerous tendencies " toward weakening laws that protect the lives of patients .
both the protestant and catholic churches of germany said patients " should not in any instance be put under pressure " to end their lives . justice minister zypries encouraged germans to put some thought into what they would want should they be incapacitated by a serious illness or accident and to consider drawing up a living will . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german hospice movement seeks to make " dying a part of life " death remains a taboo topic , causing many to die alone - in hospitals or nursing homes .

a bill has been introduced which would add legal weight to patients ' wishes . the federal government is not aiming to legalize active medically assisted suicide , according to justice minister brigitte zypries , rather it is seeking through the bill it introduced on thursday to put patients ' own decisions on medical treatment , especially regarding artificial life support , on more secure legal ground . the law proposed by the social democratic minister would add heft to so-called advance health care declarations , or living wills , made by patients who ask that their lives not be extended by artificial means .
it would also give doctors and patients ' relatives a more secure legal footing when carrying out patients ' wishes . the bill , which if passed would become law in 2006 , is based on suggestions made by a working group the minister convened called " patient autonomy at the end of life . "
headed by a former federal judge , the group included doctors , legal experts , social welfare groups and churches . the group came together after a federal court ruling in march 2003 in which judges acknowledged the relevance of living wills , but ruled that in the event of a disagreement between an attending physician and the custodian of a comatose patient , the matter had to be referred to a guardianship court , which would decide whether , for example , removing a feeding tube would be in the best interests of the patient . according to zypries , under the new law the guardianship would no longer be consulted if a living will has designated a person to represent a patient 's wishes should he or she no longer be able to .
that representative would then be able to make decisions based on the contents of the living will .
additionally , the living will should in the future have legal weight in any stage of illness , not only when the patient 's condition has become terminal . the head of the working group which drafted the bill , federal judge klaus kutzer , said the proposed law is not active assisted suicide or the so-called death on demand , in which a lethal drug is administered to a patient .
he said the working group did not want to create any legal room for such actions with the proposed law , but did want to create a legal framework in which passive doctor-assisted suicide was possible for patients who wanted it . slippery slope criticism but the minister 's proposal drew criticism from churches , the german hospice association , the federal doctors ' chamber and the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , who said it was a first step in legalizing active medically assisted suicide .
hubert hüppe , deputy head of the german parliament 's ethics commission and cdu member , warned against " unusually dangerous tendencies " toward weakening laws that protect the lives of patients .
both the protestant and catholic churches of germany said patients " should not in any instance be put under pressure " to end their lives . justice minister zypries encouraged germans to put some thought into what they would want should they be incapacitated by a serious illness or accident and to consider drawing up a living will . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german hospice movement seeks to make " dying a part of life " death remains a taboo topic , causing many to die alone - in hospitals or nursing homes .

dw-world has compiled a selection of forecasts to give a sense of what will happen in eu member states when the results are announced sunday . czech republic czechs will be the first new eu citizens to vote in ep elections when the polls open friday .
polls suggest that prime minister vladimir spidla 's ruling social democratic party -lrb- cssd -rrb- will take a beating since carrying out painful cost-cutting measures to bring the budget in line with criteria to join the eu 's monetary union .
appealing to czechs fears of the eu , the euroskeptics stand to gain , particularly president vaclav klaus 's conservative ods , which is pegged to win most of the 24 czech seats in the strasbourg parliament .
the communist party is expected to also benefit from the euroskeptic vote and could send four or five representatives to the ep . france the opposition socialist party is expected to claim a clear victory with around 29 percent of the vote in the french ep elections on sunday , another slap in the face for prime minister jean-pierre raffarin .
president jacques chirac 's conservative ump party may be in for a repeat of its sharp defeat in may regional elections .
pollsters forecast only 17 percent for the ump .
the center-right , eu-friendly udf party could bring in 10 percent , ahead of the environmentalist green party , which is expected to garner around 8 percent .
polls put the communists at 4 percent .
the right-wing nationalist mpf , which has focused its ep campaign on opposing turkey joining the eu , is expected to receive 6 to 9 percent .
jean-marie le pen 's right-wing extremist could end up with 10 percent of the vote .
france will send 78 meps to strasbourg . germany germany is looking forward to a " super sunday " this weekend , as the ep election coincides with local polls in seven of the country 's 16 states .
campaigns for the 99 german seats in european parliament have been dominated by national issues .
thus , the vote is being touted as an indication of what could happen in the next german general elections in 2006 .
if that 's the case , the governing coalition does n't have a rosy future .
chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats are expected to bring in less than 30 percent , far behind their rivals in the conservative csu / cdu parties , who polls say could curry 48.7 percent .
the green party , the social democrats ' junior partner in the government , are pegged to tally around a sturdy 10 percent .
the business-friendly fdp is forecast to just make the 5 percent hurdle to allow them to send representatives to strasbourg , something they failed to do in the last ep elections five years ago . hungary face-offs between the ruling socialists -lrb- msvp -rrb- and the opposition party of young democrats -lrb- fidesz -rrb- dominate hungary 's political scene , and that 's no different for ep elections , which take place sunday in the country .
but msvp has been falling out of voters ' favor since introducing cost-cutting measures in 2002 to quell a huge public deficit caused in part by arch enemy fidesz , their predecessor in the government .
fidesz has been promising to protect jobs and hungary 's sovereignty , which pollsters say could bring them more 50 percent of the ballots and at least half of the country 's 24 parliamentary seats . spain spanish prime minister josé luis zapatero has a good chance of seeing his recent electoral victory confirmed in the ep elections .
the socialists have only been in power since april after sweeping the conservative popular party out of office and nearly achieving an absolute majority .
the socialists are still benefiting from the post-election honeymoon atmosphere , which , in addition to zapatero 's enthusiastically pro-eu focus , will likely add up to another large victory for the party and a sizeable portion of the country 's 54 seats in strasbourg .
fighting basque separatist and islamic terror in the wake of the march 11 bombings in madrid and spain 's recent withdrawal of troops from iraq have also played a role in the ep campaign .
voters are especially concerned that due to the eu enlargement that brought many countries poorer than spain into the eu fold , madrid will receive fewer subsidies from brussels than in the past . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : eu campaigns are just window-dressing candidates are in top gear throughout the eu , stumping for election to the european parliament -lrb- ep -rrb- .

dw-world has compiled a selection of forecasts to give a sense of what will happen in eu member states when the results are announced sunday . czech republic czechs will be the first new eu citizens to vote in ep elections when the polls open friday .
polls suggest that prime minister vladimir spidla 's ruling social democratic party -lrb- cssd -rrb- will take a beating since carrying out painful cost-cutting measures to bring the budget in line with criteria to join the eu 's monetary union .
appealing to czechs fears of the eu , the euroskeptics stand to gain , particularly president vaclav klaus 's conservative ods , which is pegged to win most of the 24 czech seats in the strasbourg parliament .
the communist party is expected to also benefit from the euroskeptic vote and could send four or five representatives to the ep . france the opposition socialist party is expected to claim a clear victory with around 29 percent of the vote in the french ep elections on sunday , another slap in the face for prime minister jean-pierre raffarin .
president jacques chirac 's conservative ump party may be in for a repeat of its sharp defeat in may regional elections .
pollsters forecast only 17 percent for the ump .
the center-right , eu-friendly udf party could bring in 10 percent , ahead of the environmentalist green party , which is expected to garner around 8 percent .
polls put the communists at 4 percent .
the right-wing nationalist mpf , which has focused its ep campaign on opposing turkey joining the eu , is expected to receive 6 to 9 percent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 11.06.2004 -pipe- 11:00 utc professor claims 77 german meps already elected when german voters go to the ballot box on sunday , 77 of 99 german meps will already be sure of their place in the european parliament , according to hans herbert von arnim .
a professor of public law at the postgraduate school of administrative sciences in the german town of speyer , von arnim has conducted a study into the system of party lists , which he claims goes some way to predetermining the results of the elections .
his calculations are based on the german election rules , figures from the latest election as well as current projections , he told the euobserver .
if unpopular politicians are at the top of the party list , voters can not get rid of them unless they vote for another party .
equally they have no major chance of backing a popular candidate at the bottom of the list .
german rules stick strictly to party lists , thus preventing voters from voting on individuals rather than parties , he says .
one example is gabriele stauner , conservative mep from the german state of bavaria , who is known for her work on fighting fraud and corruption .
however , in the forthcoming election she is number 10 on the list of her party and thus not sure to be back in brussels after the election .
armin argued recently that this system could be in conflict with german constitutional law , which requires " free and direct " elections .
according to his method von arnim produced a list of 77 secure seats including members of the christian democrats , the social democrats and the green party .

if the constitution is finalized by eu leaders on june 17 and 18 , it will not come into force until at least 2006 - but it is set to be signed in the early autumn .
directly after this , the machinery surrounding the foreign minister post , which will essentially be an eu diplomatic service made up of civil servants from both the member states and the european commission delegations , will be put into place .
dutch eu ambassador tom de bruijn said earlier this week that his country 's eu presidency , which starts on july 1 , will immediately begin the " practical work " to prepare the entry into force of the treaty .

as european commission assistant auditor , van buitenen became famous in 1998 for exposing fraud and mismanagement within eu institutions , which ultimately led to the fall of the santer commission in the spring of 1999 .
" i return to brussels with a smile " , van buitenen said reacting to the results .
he interpreted the voters ' message as a mandate to confront mismanagement in brussels , rather than a vote against the eu itself .
" i will start to clean up things over there , because the people do not deserve the administration that is in place " .
meanwhile , the governing centre-right coalition suffered a major blow , with all three coalition parties losing seats .
the christian democrats , the party of prime minister jan peter balkenende , led the field but its percentage of votes dropped by 2.4 points to 24.5 percent and were almost taken over by the opposition labor party , which polled 23.6 percent .

a professor of public law at the postgraduate school of administrative sciences in the german town of speyer , von arnim has conducted a study into the system of party lists , which he claims goes some way to predetermining the results of the elections .
his calculations are based on the german election rules , figures from the latest election as well as current projections , he told the euobserver .
if unpopular politicians are at the top of the party list , voters can not get rid of them unless they vote for another party .
equally they have no major chance of backing a popular candidate at the bottom of the list .
german rules stick strictly to party lists , thus preventing voters from voting on individuals rather than parties , he says .
one example is gabriele stauner , conservative mep from the german state of bavaria , who is known for her work on fighting fraud and corruption .
however , in the forthcoming election she is number 10 on the list of her party and thus not sure to be back in brussels after the election .
armin argued recently that this system could be in conflict with german constitutional law , which requires " free and direct " elections .
according to his method von arnim produced a list of 77 secure seats including members of the christian democrats , the social democrats and the green party .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.06.2004 government split on ' clean diesel ' initiatives großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diesel cars are sparking an unfiltered debate berlin says it wants to give tax breaks for cars with clean diesel , but a divided cabinet and automobile industry have stalled the effort - at least for now . for years , diesel cars have been considered more environmentally friendly than traditional gasoline motors because they create fewer climate-damaging emissions .
the problem has always been that they emit toxic particles that have been linked to cancer and respiratory illnesses .
however , the recent creation of so-called particle filters has made diesel engines safer for consumer use .
proponents say particle filters are the only technology currently available that can cut particle emissions by 99 percent .
but german car makers have n't been quick enough to jump on the bandwagon , and that 's beginning to create a political problem in the environmentally progressive country .
in contrast to french car makers like peugeot and renault , which have embraced particle-filter diesel engines , german companies have instead opted for internal improvements to diesel motors , with moderate successes in reducing particle emissions .
a shot in the arm german environment minister jürgen trittin of the green party has drafted legislation that would seek to give a shot in the arm to the particle filter business by providing a tax break of € 600 -lrb- $ 740 -rrb- on diesel cars with new particle filters that reduce particle emissions to a stringent limit of 2.5 milligrams per kilometer .
but major car makers like volkswagen have called for a looser limit of 12.5 milligrams .
environmental groups , the green party and factions of the social democrats are backing trittin 's calls , which they say is supported by environment ministry data claiming that 14,000 people die each year as a result of diesel particle emissions .
but the industry , led by volkswagen , has fought tooth and nail to avoid being forced to adopt the filters .
in an attempt to break the bottleneck , german chancellor gerhard schröder met earlier this week in berlin with vw ceo bernd pischetsrieder and other top european automobile industry executives to discuss future use of particle filters .
" every seventh job in germany is still dependent on the automobile industry , " said schröder 's spokesman , bela anda .
" this should not be seen as a call for measures not to be implemented .
but it should also make it clear that there are also endeavors in the industry to reach this goal through changes in the internal motors - and people should n't disregard that fact . "
after his meeting with pischetsrieder , schröder said no decision had been reached as to when particle filters would be included in cars or how they might be filtered .
instead , the chancellor and the executives of europe 's largest car maker decided to leave responsibility for the decision with brussels .
by the end of the year , the eu is expected to produce regulations for emissions norms that would serve as the blueprint for filtering technologies .
for the automobile industry , punting the responsibility to brussels represents a partial victory , as the standards proposed by germany 's trittin would likely have been much stricter .
gerd lottsiepen , of the german automobile club , said the car manufacturers were acting irresponsibly in their fight against technological limits .
" the manufacturers who are now issuing polemical attacks against these limits ... are knowingly acting against the interests of consumers .
the customers who buy cars today with yesterday 's technology will get stuck paying the piper for the manufacturer 's deep sleep .
the loss of value for cars without particle filters will be higher than average in the coming years , " lottsiepen said .
to some environmental groups , including greenpeace , the financial incentive trittin has proposed does not go far enough .
" the price difference between the systems runs between € 300 and € 1,300 , " said günter hubmann of greenpeace .
" we 're demanding that , for the best system , which is 99 percent effective , a tax break of € 999 should be given by the government .
how , exactly , that can happen still needs to be negotiated . "
discord in berlin the current debate over particle filters also threatens to spark a new row between environment minister trittin and economics minister wolfgang clement , who just recently locked horns over emissions trading standards for heavy industry .
responding to the particle filter debate , clement has said he does not want to add further pressure to car makers while the economy struggles for growth .
companies like vw say that if particle filters become obligatory , it should not happen before 2007 and that the particle emission limits should be set higher than trittin 's proposed standard .
meanwhile , the opposition parties , including the christian democratic union , have said that promoting specific or special technologies should not be the government 's responsibility .

there , car-maker peugeot introduced its first diesel car with a particle filter in 2000 , offering the additional safety at the same price as its other diesel offerings .
peugeot 's parent company , autogruppe psa , is the world 's largest self-combusting engine manufacturer , and it has widely introduced particle filters in its diesel cars .
but differences remain between germany 's leading politicians on the best way to move forward with particle filters .
and any car tax breaks proposed by the federal government must also be approved by the states that are entitled to the proceeds from the motor vehicle tax .

the problem has always been that they emit toxic particles that have been linked to cancer and respiratory illnesses .
however , the recent creation of so-called particle filters has made diesel engines safer for consumer use .
proponents say particle filters are the only technology currently available that can cut particle emissions by 99 percent .
but german car makers have n't been quick enough to jump on the bandwagon , and that 's beginning to create a political problem in the environmentally progressive country .
in contrast to french car makers like peugeot and renault , which have embraced particle-filter diesel engines , german companies have instead opted for internal improvements to diesel motors , with moderate successes in reducing particle emissions .
a shot in the arm german environment minister jürgen trittin of the green party has drafted legislation that would seek to give a shot in the arm to the particle filter business by providing a tax break of € 600 -lrb- $ 740 -rrb- on diesel cars with new particle filters that reduce particle emissions to a stringent limit of 2.5 milligrams per kilometer .
but major car makers like volkswagen have called for a looser limit of 12.5 milligrams .
environmental groups , the green party and factions of the social democrats are backing trittin 's calls , which they say is supported by environment ministry data claiming that 14,000 people die each year as a result of diesel particle emissions .
but the industry , led by volkswagen , has fought tooth and nail to avoid being forced to adopt the filters .
in an attempt to break the bottleneck , german chancellor gerhard schröder met earlier this week in berlin with vw ceo bernd pischetsrieder and other top european automobile industry executives to discuss future use of particle filters .
" every seventh job in germany is still dependent on the automobile industry , " said schröder 's spokesman , bela anda .
" this should not be seen as a call for measures not to be implemented .
but it should also make it clear that there are also endeavors in the industry to reach this goal through changes in the internal motors - and people should n't disregard that fact . "
after his meeting with pischetsrieder , schröder said no decision had been reached as to when particle filters would be included in cars or how they might be filtered .
instead , the chancellor and the executives of europe 's largest car maker decided to leave responsibility for the decision with brussels .
by the end of the year , the eu is expected to produce regulations for emissions norms that would serve as the blueprint for filtering technologies .
for the automobile industry , punting the responsibility to brussels represents a partial victory , as the standards proposed by germany 's trittin would likely have been much stricter .
gerd lottsiepen , of the german automobile club , said the car manufacturers were acting irresponsibly in their fight against technological limits .
" the manufacturers who are now issuing polemical attacks against these limits ... are knowingly acting against the interests of consumers .
the customers who buy cars today with yesterday 's technology will get stuck paying the piper for the manufacturer 's deep sleep .
the loss of value for cars without particle filters will be higher than average in the coming years , " lottsiepen said .
to some environmental groups , including greenpeace , the financial incentive trittin has proposed does not go far enough .
" the price difference between the systems runs between € 300 and € 1,300 , " said günter hubmann of greenpeace .
" we 're demanding that , for the best system , which is 99 percent effective , a tax break of € 999 should be given by the government .
how , exactly , that can happen still needs to be negotiated . "
discord in berlin the current debate over particle filters also threatens to spark a new row between environment minister trittin and economics minister wolfgang clement , who just recently locked horns over emissions trading standards for heavy industry .
responding to the particle filter debate , clement has said he does not want to add further pressure to car makers while the economy struggles for growth .
companies like vw say that if particle filters become obligatory , it should not happen before 2007 and that the particle emission limits should be set higher than trittin 's proposed standard .
meanwhile , the opposition parties , including the christian democratic union , have said that promoting specific or special technologies should not be the government 's responsibility .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dacia , logan , 2004 though germany leads europe in auto exports , the particle filter issue has been driven by the french .
there , car-maker peugeot introduced its first diesel car with a particle filter in 2000 , offering the additional safety at the same price as its other diesel offerings .
peugeot 's parent company , autogruppe psa , is the world 's largest self-combusting engine manufacturer , and it has widely introduced particle filters in its diesel cars .
but differences remain between germany 's leading politicians on the best way to move forward with particle filters .
and any car tax breaks proposed by the federal government must also be approved by the states that are entitled to the proceeds from the motor vehicle tax .
so far , most states are taking a reserved approach to the proposal , with ministers in some states , like bavaria , saying it has not yet been proven that the current generation of particle filters are the most effective means of reducing particle emissions from diesel motors . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de still no decision on filters for diesel cars the german government has still not made a decision on whether it will subsidize diesel-powered cars outfitted with particulate filters .

however , the recent creation of so-called particle filters has made diesel engines safer for consumer use .
proponents say particle filters are the only technology currently available that can cut particle emissions by 99 percent .
but german car makers have n't been quick enough to jump on the bandwagon , and that 's beginning to create a political problem in the environmentally progressive country .
in contrast to french car makers like peugeot and renault , which have embraced particle-filter diesel engines , german companies have instead opted for internal improvements to diesel motors , with moderate successes in reducing particle emissions .
a shot in the arm german environment minister jürgen trittin of the green party has drafted legislation that would seek to give a shot in the arm to the particle filter business by providing a tax break of € 600 -lrb- $ 740 -rrb- on diesel cars with new particle filters that reduce particle emissions to a stringent limit of 2.5 milligrams per kilometer .
but major car makers like volkswagen have called for a looser limit of 12.5 milligrams .
environmental groups , the green party and factions of the social democrats are backing trittin 's calls , which they say is supported by environment ministry data claiming that 14,000 people die each year as a result of diesel particle emissions .
but the industry , led by volkswagen , has fought tooth and nail to avoid being forced to adopt the filters .
in an attempt to break the bottleneck , german chancellor gerhard schröder met earlier this week in berlin with vw ceo bernd pischetsrieder and other top european automobile industry executives to discuss future use of particle filters .
" every seventh job in germany is still dependent on the automobile industry , " said schröder 's spokesman , bela anda .
" this should not be seen as a call for measures not to be implemented .
but it should also make it clear that there are also endeavors in the industry to reach this goal through changes in the internal motors - and people should n't disregard that fact . "
after his meeting with pischetsrieder , schröder said no decision had been reached as to when particle filters would be included in cars or how they might be filtered .
instead , the chancellor and the executives of europe 's largest car maker decided to leave responsibility for the decision with brussels .
by the end of the year , the eu is expected to produce regulations for emissions norms that would serve as the blueprint for filtering technologies .
for the automobile industry , punting the responsibility to brussels represents a partial victory , as the standards proposed by germany 's trittin would likely have been much stricter .
gerd lottsiepen , of the german automobile club , said the car manufacturers were acting irresponsibly in their fight against technological limits .
" the manufacturers who are now issuing polemical attacks against these limits ... are knowingly acting against the interests of consumers .
the customers who buy cars today with yesterday 's technology will get stuck paying the piper for the manufacturer 's deep sleep .
the loss of value for cars without particle filters will be higher than average in the coming years , " lottsiepen said .
to some environmental groups , including greenpeace , the financial incentive trittin has proposed does not go far enough .
" the price difference between the systems runs between € 300 and € 1,300 , " said günter hubmann of greenpeace .
" we 're demanding that , for the best system , which is 99 percent effective , a tax break of € 999 should be given by the government .
how , exactly , that can happen still needs to be negotiated . "
discord in berlin the current debate over particle filters also threatens to spark a new row between environment minister trittin and economics minister wolfgang clement , who just recently locked horns over emissions trading standards for heavy industry .
responding to the particle filter debate , clement has said he does not want to add further pressure to car makers while the economy struggles for growth .
companies like vw say that if particle filters become obligatory , it should not happen before 2007 and that the particle emission limits should be set higher than trittin 's proposed standard .
meanwhile , the opposition parties , including the christian democratic union , have said that promoting specific or special technologies should not be the government 's responsibility .

there , car-maker peugeot introduced its first diesel car with a particle filter in 2000 , offering the additional safety at the same price as its other diesel offerings .
peugeot 's parent company , autogruppe psa , is the world 's largest self-combusting engine manufacturer , and it has widely introduced particle filters in its diesel cars .
but differences remain between germany 's leading politicians on the best way to move forward with particle filters .
and any car tax breaks proposed by the federal government must also be approved by the states that are entitled to the proceeds from the motor vehicle tax .
so far , most states are taking a reserved approach to the proposal , with ministers in some states , like bavaria , saying it has not yet been proven that the current generation of particle filters are the most effective means of reducing particle emissions from diesel motors . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de still no decision on filters for diesel cars the german government has still not made a decision on whether it will subsidize diesel-powered cars outfitted with particulate filters .

the representative poll was conducted in major cities in both countries in the fall of 2003 . germany 's opposition to the war in iraq , for example , had clear effects on how russians and americans viewed bilateral relations .
in russia , 72 percent of those interviewed described relations as " good " and 62 percent said the german position on iraq had improved their perception of the country . only 35 percent of americans on the other hand said relations were good and 51 percent felt the iraq crisis had harmed germany 's reputation abroad . hitler remains best-known german bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adolf hitler pollsters said that relations between east germany and the soviet union were partially responsible for the positive assessment in russia despite the german invasion under adolf hitler , who incidentally remains the best known german in both countries . while chancellor gerhard schröder was the second-best known german in the u.s. , writer johann wolfgang von goethe took that position among russians .
few people named philosopher karl marx or composer johann sebastian bach . the findings wo n't have any direct effects on deutsche welle 's programming , according to erik bettermann , the broadcaster 's director-general .
he said dw officials would combine them with feedback from viewers , listeners and readers as well as partner organizations such as the goethe institute .
germany 's parliament is expected to redefine the broadcaster 's mission with a new law later this year .

during the nazi occupation , papon oversaw the bordeaux area police and signed orders that led to the deportation of 1,690 jews from 1942 to 1944 .
most of those deported perished in the auschwitz concentration camp .
papon rose through the ranks of french politics following world war ii , becoming chief of the paris police in 1958 , and later national budget minister under valerie giscard d 'estaing .
but in 1981 his wartime record was revealed when documents were unearthed showing that he had authorized the deportations .
too sick to serve papon has argued that he did n't know the fate of the jews he deported , and that he had to deport them to keep his job at the time .
despite his claims of innocence , he was convicted of crimes against humanity six years ago .
but he walked out of prison in 2002 after a court ruled him too old and sick to finish his 10-year sentence .
the decision outraged the victims of france 's wartime regime and their families .
yet the court of cassation , france 's highest court , will now study an appeal request to clear papon 's name .
this time , the judges wo n't look at the question of papon 's guilt or innocence , but rather focus on obscure legal problems that occurred during his trial .
the procedure is not an appeal as such , but a review by the court to decide whether or not a new appeal can take place .
judges are expected to rule on the matter june 16 .
papon has launched many appeals because he believes justice was fundamentally not carried out during the drawn-out legal battles which began over twenty years ago .
touching a nerve he claims not to regret his actions during the war , and says he ca n't be held partially responsible for holocaust crimes , because he was removed by several " links in the chain " from the murders that took place in concentration camps .
the question of indirect collaboration with war crimes touched a sensitive nerve in france , where the media has periodically pounced on the case , and reopened public dialogue about the extent of nazi sympathy in france during world war ii .
papon says his goal now is to clear his name for history .
but jewish groups say he should still be in prison , citing his lack of remorse .
when papon walked free in 2002 , the u.s.-based simon wiesenthal center called the release " a bad case of misplaced sympathy . "
a frequent problem france has not been the only nation faced with the problem of high officials with nazi pasts .
as recently as last month , a decision by germany 's christian democrats to include a former state premier with a history of nazi activity as a delegate to the presidential election was harshly criticized by jewish groups and left-wing politicians .
hans filbinger , 90 , was forced to resign as premier of the southern state of baden-württemberg in 1978 after it emerged that as a naval judge he shared responsibility for handing down death sentences in the waning months of nazi germany .
probably the best-known case is that of austria 's kurt waldheim .
a widely esteemed former secretary general of the united nations , he was running for president of austria in march 1986 when it came to light that he had participated in nazi atrocities during world war ii .
despite this , he served as his country 's head of state until 1992 . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de delegate 's nazi past clouds german presidential election a decision by germany 's christian democrats to include a former state premier with a nazi past as a delegate for a presidential election has been harshly criticized by jewish groups and left-wing politicians .

government ministers acknowledged that war in iraq played a role . british prime minister tony blair 's party lost more than 200 seats on local councils , according to bbc .
while final results have not been announced , labor is expected to come in third , behind opposition conservatives and the third party liberal democrats . speaking at the g-8 summit in the u.s. state of georgia , blair said the british role in iraq had cast a shadow over the elections .
" but in the end you have to take decisions that are right and you have to see them through , " he told reporters . the conservatives were unable to make huge gains as they also supported the war in iraq .
only the liberal democrats , who opposed a british involvement , made strides at the ballots . results unlikely to threaten blair 's re-election while experts said that the elections were unlikely to threaten blair 's re-election in the upcoming general election , which is expected to take place next year , government officials also tried to play down the significance of the results . " we always knew this was going to be a very difficult election for us , " nick raynford , the cabinet minister in charge of local government issues , told sky television .
" governments in mid-term tend to lose . " results in elections for london 's mayor were expected to be announced later on friday .
incumbent ken livingstone was expected to win re-election . british voters also cast their ballots in the european parliament elections on thursday , but those results are not expected to be announced until sunday after all other 25 eu countries have voted as well . the anti-eu uk independence party , which has called for britain 's withdrawal from the eu , is expected to fare well in those elections and could quadruple its seats to 12 . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu-skeptics gain momentum in britain elections for the european parliament started thursday as dutch and british voters headed to the polls .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 11.06.2004 court revisits case of french nazi collaborator großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maurice papon during an earlier court appearance the case of a high french official convicted of nazi war crimes is active once again : a french court is reviewing the request for an appeal by maurice papon , unleashing anger in the jewish community . france 's highest court on friday will once again take up the case of 93-year-old convicted nazi collaborator maurice papon - the most senior official from the pro-nazi vichy regime tried for crimes against humanity and for helping send jews to nazi death camps .
during the nazi occupation , papon oversaw the bordeaux area police and signed orders that led to the deportation of 1,690 jews from 1942 to 1944 .
most of those deported perished in the auschwitz concentration camp .
papon rose through the ranks of french politics following world war ii , becoming chief of the paris police in 1958 , and later national budget minister under valerie giscard d 'estaing .
but in 1981 his wartime record was revealed when documents were unearthed showing that he had authorized the deportations .
too sick to serve papon has argued that he did n't know the fate of the jews he deported , and that he had to deport them to keep his job at the time .
despite his claims of innocence , he was convicted of crimes against humanity six years ago .
but he walked out of prison in 2002 after a court ruled him too old and sick to finish his 10-year sentence .
the decision outraged the victims of france 's wartime regime and their families .
yet the court of cassation , france 's highest court , will now study an appeal request to clear papon 's name .
this time , the judges wo n't look at the question of papon 's guilt or innocence , but rather focus on obscure legal problems that occurred during his trial .
the procedure is not an appeal as such , but a review by the court to decide whether or not a new appeal can take place .
judges are expected to rule on the matter june 16 .
papon has launched many appeals because he believes justice was fundamentally not carried out during the drawn-out legal battles which began over twenty years ago .
touching a nerve he claims not to regret his actions during the war , and says he ca n't be held partially responsible for holocaust crimes , because he was removed by several " links in the chain " from the murders that took place in concentration camps .
the question of indirect collaboration with war crimes touched a sensitive nerve in france , where the media has periodically pounced on the case , and reopened public dialogue about the extent of nazi sympathy in france during world war ii .
papon says his goal now is to clear his name for history .
but jewish groups say he should still be in prison , citing his lack of remorse .
when papon walked free in 2002 , the u.s.-based simon wiesenthal center called the release " a bad case of misplaced sympathy . "
a frequent problem france has not been the only nation faced with the problem of high officials with nazi pasts .
as recently as last month , a decision by germany 's christian democrats to include a former state premier with a history of nazi activity as a delegate to the presidential election was harshly criticized by jewish groups and left-wing politicians .
hans filbinger , 90 , was forced to resign as premier of the southern state of baden-württemberg in 1978 after it emerged that as a naval judge he shared responsibility for handing down death sentences in the waning months of nazi germany .
probably the best-known case is that of austria 's kurt waldheim .
a widely esteemed former secretary general of the united nations , he was running for president of austria in march 1986 when it came to light that he had participated in nazi atrocities during world war ii .
despite this , he served as his country 's head of state until 1992 . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de delegate 's nazi past clouds german presidential election a decision by germany 's christian democrats to include a former state premier with a nazi past as a delegate for a presidential election has been harshly criticized by jewish groups and left-wing politicians .

during the nazi occupation , papon oversaw the bordeaux area police and signed orders that led to the deportation of 1,690 jews from 1942 to 1944 .
most of those deported perished in the auschwitz concentration camp .
papon rose through the ranks of french politics following world war ii , becoming chief of the paris police in 1958 , and later national budget minister under valerie giscard d 'estaing .
but in 1981 his wartime record was revealed when documents were unearthed showing that he had authorized the deportations .
too sick to serve papon has argued that he did n't know the fate of the jews he deported , and that he had to deport them to keep his job at the time .
despite his claims of innocence , he was convicted of crimes against humanity six years ago .
but he walked out of prison in 2002 after a court ruled him too old and sick to finish his 10-year sentence .
the decision outraged the victims of france 's wartime regime and their families .
yet the court of cassation , france 's highest court , will now study an appeal request to clear papon 's name .
this time , the judges wo n't look at the question of papon 's guilt or innocence , but rather focus on obscure legal problems that occurred during his trial .
the procedure is not an appeal as such , but a review by the court to decide whether or not a new appeal can take place .
judges are expected to rule on the matter june 16 .
papon has launched many appeals because he believes justice was fundamentally not carried out during the drawn-out legal battles which began over twenty years ago .
touching a nerve he claims not to regret his actions during the war , and says he ca n't be held partially responsible for holocaust crimes , because he was removed by several " links in the chain " from the murders that took place in concentration camps .
the question of indirect collaboration with war crimes touched a sensitive nerve in france , where the media has periodically pounced on the case , and reopened public dialogue about the extent of nazi sympathy in france during world war ii .
papon says his goal now is to clear his name for history .
but jewish groups say he should still be in prison , citing his lack of remorse .
when papon walked free in 2002 , the u.s.-based simon wiesenthal center called the release " a bad case of misplaced sympathy . "
a frequent problem france has not been the only nation faced with the problem of high officials with nazi pasts .
as recently as last month , a decision by germany 's christian democrats to include a former state premier with a history of nazi activity as a delegate to the presidential election was harshly criticized by jewish groups and left-wing politicians .
hans filbinger , 90 , was forced to resign as premier of the southern state of baden-württemberg in 1978 after it emerged that as a naval judge he shared responsibility for handing down death sentences in the waning months of nazi germany .
probably the best-known case is that of austria 's kurt waldheim .
a widely esteemed former secretary general of the united nations , he was running for president of austria in march 1986 when it came to light that he had participated in nazi atrocities during world war ii .
despite this , he served as his country 's head of state until 1992 . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de delegate 's nazi past clouds german presidential election a decision by germany 's christian democrats to include a former state premier with a nazi past as a delegate for a presidential election has been harshly criticized by jewish groups and left-wing politicians .

during the nazi occupation , papon oversaw the bordeaux area police and signed orders that led to the deportation of 1,690 jews from 1942 to 1944 .
most of those deported perished in the auschwitz concentration camp .
papon rose through the ranks of french politics following world war ii , becoming chief of the paris police in 1958 , and later national budget minister under valerie giscard d 'estaing .
but in 1981 his wartime record was revealed when documents were unearthed showing that he had authorized the deportations .
too sick to serve papon has argued that he did n't know the fate of the jews he deported , and that he had to deport them to keep his job at the time .
despite his claims of innocence , he was convicted of crimes against humanity six years ago .
but he walked out of prison in 2002 after a court ruled him too old and sick to finish his 10-year sentence .
the decision outraged the victims of france 's wartime regime and their families .
yet the court of cassation , france 's highest court , will now study an appeal request to clear papon 's name .
this time , the judges wo n't look at the question of papon 's guilt or innocence , but rather focus on obscure legal problems that occurred during his trial .
the procedure is not an appeal as such , but a review by the court to decide whether or not a new appeal can take place .
judges are expected to rule on the matter june 16 .
papon has launched many appeals because he believes justice was fundamentally not carried out during the drawn-out legal battles which began over twenty years ago .
touching a nerve he claims not to regret his actions during the war , and says he ca n't be held partially responsible for holocaust crimes , because he was removed by several " links in the chain " from the murders that took place in concentration camps .
the question of indirect collaboration with war crimes touched a sensitive nerve in france , where the media has periodically pounced on the case , and reopened public dialogue about the extent of nazi sympathy in france during world war ii .
papon says his goal now is to clear his name for history .
but jewish groups say he should still be in prison , citing his lack of remorse .
when papon walked free in 2002 , the u.s.-based simon wiesenthal center called the release " a bad case of misplaced sympathy . "
a frequent problem france has not been the only nation faced with the problem of high officials with nazi pasts .
as recently as last month , a decision by germany 's christian democrats to include a former state premier with a history of nazi activity as a delegate to the presidential election was harshly criticized by jewish groups and left-wing politicians .
hans filbinger , 90 , was forced to resign as premier of the southern state of baden-württemberg in 1978 after it emerged that as a naval judge he shared responsibility for handing down death sentences in the waning months of nazi germany .
probably the best-known case is that of austria 's kurt waldheim .

from bit player to global heavyweight current affairs -pipe- 11.06.2004 g-8 summit ends with emphasis on mid east reform großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there was time for a stroll under palm trees g-8 leaders wrapped up their three-day summit at the luxury sea island resort in georgia thursday by vowing to promote democracy in the middle east , but failed to strongly back a u.s. appeal for help on iraq . the harmony and public bonhomie on display during the summit failed to mask differences between leaders of the world 's eight richest nations , in particular between french president jacques chirac and u.s. president bush . on thursday bush appealed to his heavyweight allies to do more to guide iraq 's transformation to a stable democracy , saying the " iraqi people need help " to defend themselves , rebuild their country and hold elections . although bush scored a victory at the start of the summit with the u.n. security council approving a new resolution on iraq , french president jacques chirac - one of the strongest opponents of the iraq war - rebuffed bush 's suggestion that with several nato states already engaged in iraq , the alliance 's role could be expanded there . " i wo n't hide it from you that i do n't think it is nato 's purpose to intervene in iraq , " chirac said wednesday according to the associated press .
" what 's more , i do n't feel that it would be opportune nor necessarily well understood .
i am totally reserved about this issue , " he said . however , on thursday , the last day of the summit , both bush and chirac attempted to appear more cordial at a private meeting .
bush acknowledged past differences with the french president and told reporters : " friends are able to discuss the future . " a french official also said that despite chirac 's reservations about an expanded nato role in iraq , he is open to discussion ahead of a nato summit in turkey at the end of the month . canada , france and germany also made it clear that even after passage of the resolution , they would n't send troops to the country . the leaders of britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan and russia were also unable to agree on bush 's appeal for oil-rich iraq 's debts be forgiven .
they left the issue open , only deciding that there would be " substantial " debt forgiveness . positive report card from schröder german chancellor gerhard schröder had an upbeat assessment of the meetings on sea island , saying lot of hard work was done there , despite many leaders ' dispensing with their ties and three-pieces suits during meetings .
schröder said the unanimous vote in the u.n. security council for the resolution on iraq had not only made the summit work easier , it had proved that one can " come together . " while standing by his pledge not to send german soldiers to iraq , he said germany would not stand in the way of nato doing so . schröder said one of the signals from the summit was a desire to stabilize the " very , very good " situation that the global economy finds itself in . one of the main risks , however , to economic stability is the insecurity in the middle east .
another is the price of oil , if it remains at its current record-high prices . middle east democratization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from top center , going clockwise : u.s. president george w. bush , russian president vladimir putin , german chancellor gerhard schröder , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , european council president bertie ahern , european commission president romano prodi , canadian prime minister paul martin , japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi , british prime minister tony blair and french president jacques chirac during the morning plenary meeting at the g-8 summit in sea island on wednesday .
g-8 leaders at the summit did agree to president bush 's initiative to promote democratic reform in the arab world , and they offered middle eastern and northern african states a political and economic partnership , which would include regular talks at ministerial level , aid in organizing free and transparent elections , increased efforts to fight illiteracy and loans for small businesses . but along with the french president , german chancellor gerhard schröder was still cautious about the plans .
" the west must not make the mistake of imposing its ideas of inner-social development . "
democratization must come from the countries themselves , he said . arab states were critical of the initiative , accusing the g-8 of meddling in internal affairs .
the heads of six moslem countries , including iraqi interim president ghazi al-yawer , took part in the talks .
other arab statesmen , including the egyptian and saudi arabian leaders , rejected the invitation to the summit . on thursday the group turned its attention to developmental policies during a session with african leaders .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.06.2004 government split on ' clean diesel ' initiatives großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diesel cars are sparking an unfiltered debate berlin says it wants to give tax breaks for cars with clean diesel , but a divided cabinet and automobile industry have stalled the effort - at least for now . for years , diesel cars have been considered more environmentally friendly than traditional gasoline motors because they create fewer climate-damaging emissions .
the problem has always been that they emit toxic particles that have been linked to cancer and respiratory illnesses .
however , the recent creation of so-called particle filters has made diesel engines safer for consumer use .
proponents say particle filters are the only technology currently available that can cut particle emissions by 99 percent .
but german car makers have n't been quick enough to jump on the bandwagon , and that 's beginning to create a political problem in the environmentally progressive country .
in contrast to french car makers like peugeot and renault , which have embraced particle-filter diesel engines , german companies have instead opted for internal improvements to diesel motors , with moderate successes in reducing particle emissions .
a shot in the arm german environment minister jürgen trittin of the green party has drafted legislation that would seek to give a shot in the arm to the particle filter business by providing a tax break of € 600 -lrb- $ 740 -rrb- on diesel cars with new particle filters that reduce particle emissions to a stringent limit of 2.5 milligrams per kilometer .
but major car makers like volkswagen have called for a looser limit of 12.5 milligrams .
environmental groups , the green party and factions of the social democrats are backing trittin 's calls , which they say is supported by environment ministry data claiming that 14,000 people die each year as a result of diesel particle emissions .
but the industry , led by volkswagen , has fought tooth and nail to avoid being forced to adopt the filters .
in an attempt to break the bottleneck , german chancellor gerhard schröder met earlier this week in berlin with vw ceo bernd pischetsrieder and other top european automobile industry executives to discuss future use of particle filters .
" every seventh job in germany is still dependent on the automobile industry , " said schröder 's spokesman , bela anda .
" this should not be seen as a call for measures not to be implemented .
but it should also make it clear that there are also endeavors in the industry to reach this goal through changes in the internal motors - and people should n't disregard that fact . "
after his meeting with pischetsrieder , schröder said no decision had been reached as to when particle filters would be included in cars or how they might be filtered .
instead , the chancellor and the executives of europe 's largest car maker decided to leave responsibility for the decision with brussels .
by the end of the year , the eu is expected to produce regulations for emissions norms that would serve as the blueprint for filtering technologies .
for the automobile industry , punting the responsibility to brussels represents a partial victory , as the standards proposed by germany 's trittin would likely have been much stricter .
gerd lottsiepen , of the german automobile club , said the car manufacturers were acting irresponsibly in their fight against technological limits .
" the manufacturers who are now issuing polemical attacks against these limits ... are knowingly acting against the interests of consumers .
the customers who buy cars today with yesterday 's technology will get stuck paying the piper for the manufacturer 's deep sleep .
the loss of value for cars without particle filters will be higher than average in the coming years , " lottsiepen said .
to some environmental groups , including greenpeace , the financial incentive trittin has proposed does not go far enough .
" the price difference between the systems runs between € 300 and € 1,300 , " said günter hubmann of greenpeace .
" we 're demanding that , for the best system , which is 99 percent effective , a tax break of € 999 should be given by the government .
how , exactly , that can happen still needs to be negotiated . "
discord in berlin the current debate over particle filters also threatens to spark a new row between environment minister trittin and economics minister wolfgang clement , who just recently locked horns over emissions trading standards for heavy industry .
responding to the particle filter debate , clement has said he does not want to add further pressure to car makers while the economy struggles for growth .
companies like vw say that if particle filters become obligatory , it should not happen before 2007 and that the particle emission limits should be set higher than trittin 's proposed standard .
meanwhile , the opposition parties , including the christian democratic union , have said that promoting specific or special technologies should not be the government 's responsibility .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dacia , logan , 2004 though germany leads europe in auto exports , the particle filter issue has been driven by the french .
there , car-maker peugeot introduced its first diesel car with a particle filter in 2000 , offering the additional safety at the same price as its other diesel offerings .
peugeot 's parent company , autogruppe psa , is the world 's largest self-combusting engine manufacturer , and it has widely introduced particle filters in its diesel cars .
but differences remain between germany 's leading politicians on the best way to move forward with particle filters .
and any car tax breaks proposed by the federal government must also be approved by the states that are entitled to the proceeds from the motor vehicle tax .
so far , most states are taking a reserved approach to the proposal , with ministers in some states , like bavaria , saying it has not yet been proven that the current generation of particle filters are the most effective means of reducing particle emissions from diesel motors . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de still no decision on filters for diesel cars the german government has still not made a decision on whether it will subsidize diesel-powered cars outfitted with particulate filters .
on monday , a summit between top players from europe 's car industry and german chancellor gerhard schröder dealt with the topic as well as the general competitiveness of the auto industry .

the problem has always been that they emit toxic particles that have been linked to cancer and respiratory illnesses .
however , the recent creation of so-called particle filters has made diesel engines safer for consumer use .
proponents say particle filters are the only technology currently available that can cut particle emissions by 99 percent .
but german car makers have n't been quick enough to jump on the bandwagon , and that 's beginning to create a political problem in the environmentally progressive country .
in contrast to french car makers like peugeot and renault , which have embraced particle-filter diesel engines , german companies have instead opted for internal improvements to diesel motors , with moderate successes in reducing particle emissions .
a shot in the arm german environment minister jürgen trittin of the green party has drafted legislation that would seek to give a shot in the arm to the particle filter business by providing a tax break of € 600 -lrb- $ 740 -rrb- on diesel cars with new particle filters that reduce particle emissions to a stringent limit of 2.5 milligrams per kilometer .
but major car makers like volkswagen have called for a looser limit of 12.5 milligrams .
environmental groups , the green party and factions of the social democrats are backing trittin 's calls , which they say is supported by environment ministry data claiming that 14,000 people die each year as a result of diesel particle emissions .
but the industry , led by volkswagen , has fought tooth and nail to avoid being forced to adopt the filters .
in an attempt to break the bottleneck , german chancellor gerhard schröder met earlier this week in berlin with vw ceo bernd pischetsrieder and other top european automobile industry executives to discuss future use of particle filters .
" every seventh job in germany is still dependent on the automobile industry , " said schröder 's spokesman , bela anda .
" this should not be seen as a call for measures not to be implemented .
but it should also make it clear that there are also endeavors in the industry to reach this goal through changes in the internal motors - and people should n't disregard that fact . "
after his meeting with pischetsrieder , schröder said no decision had been reached as to when particle filters would be included in cars or how they might be filtered .
instead , the chancellor and the executives of europe 's largest car maker decided to leave responsibility for the decision with brussels .
by the end of the year , the eu is expected to produce regulations for emissions norms that would serve as the blueprint for filtering technologies .
for the automobile industry , punting the responsibility to brussels represents a partial victory , as the standards proposed by germany 's trittin would likely have been much stricter .
gerd lottsiepen , of the german automobile club , said the car manufacturers were acting irresponsibly in their fight against technological limits .
" the manufacturers who are now issuing polemical attacks against these limits ... are knowingly acting against the interests of consumers .
the customers who buy cars today with yesterday 's technology will get stuck paying the piper for the manufacturer 's deep sleep .
the loss of value for cars without particle filters will be higher than average in the coming years , " lottsiepen said .
to some environmental groups , including greenpeace , the financial incentive trittin has proposed does not go far enough .
" the price difference between the systems runs between € 300 and € 1,300 , " said günter hubmann of greenpeace .
" we 're demanding that , for the best system , which is 99 percent effective , a tax break of € 999 should be given by the government .
how , exactly , that can happen still needs to be negotiated . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.06.2004 government split on ' clean diesel ' initiatives großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diesel cars are sparking an unfiltered debate berlin says it wants to give tax breaks for cars with clean diesel , but a divided cabinet and automobile industry have stalled the effort - at least for now . for years , diesel cars have been considered more environmentally friendly than traditional gasoline motors because they create fewer climate-damaging emissions .
the problem has always been that they emit toxic particles that have been linked to cancer and respiratory illnesses .
however , the recent creation of so-called particle filters has made diesel engines safer for consumer use .
proponents say particle filters are the only technology currently available that can cut particle emissions by 99 percent .
but german car makers have n't been quick enough to jump on the bandwagon , and that 's beginning to create a political problem in the environmentally progressive country .
in contrast to french car makers like peugeot and renault , which have embraced particle-filter diesel engines , german companies have instead opted for internal improvements to diesel motors , with moderate successes in reducing particle emissions .
a shot in the arm german environment minister jürgen trittin of the green party has drafted legislation that would seek to give a shot in the arm to the particle filter business by providing a tax break of € 600 -lrb- $ 740 -rrb- on diesel cars with new particle filters that reduce particle emissions to a stringent limit of 2.5 milligrams per kilometer .
but major car makers like volkswagen have called for a looser limit of 12.5 milligrams .
environmental groups , the green party and factions of the social democrats are backing trittin 's calls , which they say is supported by environment ministry data claiming that 14,000 people die each year as a result of diesel particle emissions .
but the industry , led by volkswagen , has fought tooth and nail to avoid being forced to adopt the filters .
in an attempt to break the bottleneck , german chancellor gerhard schröder met earlier this week in berlin with vw ceo bernd pischetsrieder and other top european automobile industry executives to discuss future use of particle filters .
" every seventh job in germany is still dependent on the automobile industry , " said schröder 's spokesman , bela anda .
" this should not be seen as a call for measures not to be implemented .
but it should also make it clear that there are also endeavors in the industry to reach this goal through changes in the internal motors - and people should n't disregard that fact . "
after his meeting with pischetsrieder , schröder said no decision had been reached as to when particle filters would be included in cars or how they might be filtered .
instead , the chancellor and the executives of europe 's largest car maker decided to leave responsibility for the decision with brussels .
by the end of the year , the eu is expected to produce regulations for emissions norms that would serve as the blueprint for filtering technologies .
for the automobile industry , punting the responsibility to brussels represents a partial victory , as the standards proposed by germany 's trittin would likely have been much stricter .
gerd lottsiepen , of the german automobile club , said the car manufacturers were acting irresponsibly in their fight against technological limits .
" the manufacturers who are now issuing polemical attacks against these limits ... are knowingly acting against the interests of consumers .
the customers who buy cars today with yesterday 's technology will get stuck paying the piper for the manufacturer 's deep sleep .
the loss of value for cars without particle filters will be higher than average in the coming years , " lottsiepen said .
to some environmental groups , including greenpeace , the financial incentive trittin has proposed does not go far enough .
" the price difference between the systems runs between € 300 and € 1,300 , " said günter hubmann of greenpeace .
" we 're demanding that , for the best system , which is 99 percent effective , a tax break of € 999 should be given by the government .
how , exactly , that can happen still needs to be negotiated . "
discord in berlin the current debate over particle filters also threatens to spark a new row between environment minister trittin and economics minister wolfgang clement , who just recently locked horns over emissions trading standards for heavy industry .
responding to the particle filter debate , clement has said he does not want to add further pressure to car makers while the economy struggles for growth .
companies like vw say that if particle filters become obligatory , it should not happen before 2007 and that the particle emission limits should be set higher than trittin 's proposed standard .
meanwhile , the opposition parties , including the christian democratic union , have said that promoting specific or special technologies should not be the government 's responsibility .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dacia , logan , 2004 though germany leads europe in auto exports , the particle filter issue has been driven by the french .
there , car-maker peugeot introduced its first diesel car with a particle filter in 2000 , offering the additional safety at the same price as its other diesel offerings .
peugeot 's parent company , autogruppe psa , is the world 's largest self-combusting engine manufacturer , and it has widely introduced particle filters in its diesel cars .
but differences remain between germany 's leading politicians on the best way to move forward with particle filters .
and any car tax breaks proposed by the federal government must also be approved by the states that are entitled to the proceeds from the motor vehicle tax .

a bill has been introduced which would add legal weight to patients ' wishes . the federal government is not aiming to legalize active medically assisted suicide , according to justice minister brigitte zypries , rather it is seeking through the bill it introduced on thursday to put patients ' own decisions on medical treatment , especially regarding artificial life support , on more secure legal ground . the law proposed by the social democratic minister would add heft to so-called advance health care declarations , or living wills , made by patients who ask that their lives not be extended by artificial means .
it would also give doctors and patients ' relatives a more secure legal footing when carrying out patients ' wishes . the bill , which if passed would become law in 2006 , is based on suggestions made by a working group the minister convened called " patient autonomy at the end of life . "
headed by a former federal judge , the group included doctors , legal experts , social welfare groups and churches . the group came together after a federal court ruling in march 2003 in which judges acknowledged the relevance of living wills , but ruled that in the event of a disagreement between an attending physician and the custodian of a comatose patient , the matter had to be referred to a guardianship court , which would decide whether , for example , removing a feeding tube would be in the best interests of the patient . according to zypries , under the new law the guardianship would no longer be consulted if a living will has designated a person to represent a patient 's wishes should he or she no longer be able to .
that representative would then be able to make decisions based on the contents of the living will .
additionally , the living will should in the future have legal weight in any stage of illness , not only when the patient 's condition has become terminal . the head of the working group which drafted the bill , federal judge klaus kutzer , said the proposed law is not active assisted suicide or the so-called death on demand , in which a lethal drug is administered to a patient .
he said the working group did not want to create any legal room for such actions with the proposed law , but did want to create a legal framework in which passive doctor-assisted suicide was possible for patients who wanted it . slippery slope criticism but the minister 's proposal drew criticism from churches , the german hospice association , the federal doctors ' chamber and the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , who said it was a first step in legalizing active medically assisted suicide .
hubert hüppe , deputy head of the german parliament 's ethics commission and cdu member , warned against " unusually dangerous tendencies " toward weakening laws that protect the lives of patients .
both the protestant and catholic churches of germany said patients " should not in any instance be put under pressure " to end their lives . justice minister zypries encouraged germans to put some thought into what they would want should they be incapacitated by a serious illness or accident and to consider drawing up a living will . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german hospice movement seeks to make " dying a part of life " death remains a taboo topic , causing many to die alone - in hospitals or nursing homes .

a bill has been introduced which would add legal weight to patients ' wishes . the federal government is not aiming to legalize active medically assisted suicide , according to justice minister brigitte zypries , rather it is seeking through the bill it introduced on thursday to put patients ' own decisions on medical treatment , especially regarding artificial life support , on more secure legal ground . the law proposed by the social democratic minister would add heft to so-called advance health care declarations , or living wills , made by patients who ask that their lives not be extended by artificial means .
it would also give doctors and patients ' relatives a more secure legal footing when carrying out patients ' wishes . the bill , which if passed would become law in 2006 , is based on suggestions made by a working group the minister convened called " patient autonomy at the end of life . "
headed by a former federal judge , the group included doctors , legal experts , social welfare groups and churches . the group came together after a federal court ruling in march 2003 in which judges acknowledged the relevance of living wills , but ruled that in the event of a disagreement between an attending physician and the custodian of a comatose patient , the matter had to be referred to a guardianship court , which would decide whether , for example , removing a feeding tube would be in the best interests of the patient . according to zypries , under the new law the guardianship would no longer be consulted if a living will has designated a person to represent a patient 's wishes should he or she no longer be able to .
that representative would then be able to make decisions based on the contents of the living will .
additionally , the living will should in the future have legal weight in any stage of illness , not only when the patient 's condition has become terminal . the head of the working group which drafted the bill , federal judge klaus kutzer , said the proposed law is not active assisted suicide or the so-called death on demand , in which a lethal drug is administered to a patient .
he said the working group did not want to create any legal room for such actions with the proposed law , but did want to create a legal framework in which passive doctor-assisted suicide was possible for patients who wanted it . slippery slope criticism but the minister 's proposal drew criticism from churches , the german hospice association , the federal doctors ' chamber and the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , who said it was a first step in legalizing active medically assisted suicide .
hubert hüppe , deputy head of the german parliament 's ethics commission and cdu member , warned against " unusually dangerous tendencies " toward weakening laws that protect the lives of patients .
both the protestant and catholic churches of germany said patients " should not in any instance be put under pressure " to end their lives . justice minister zypries encouraged germans to put some thought into what they would want should they be incapacitated by a serious illness or accident and to consider drawing up a living will . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german hospice movement seeks to make " dying a part of life " death remains a taboo topic , causing many to die alone - in hospitals or nursing homes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 11.06.2004 court revisits case of french nazi collaborator großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maurice papon during an earlier court appearance the case of a high french official convicted of nazi war crimes is active once again : a french court is reviewing the request for an appeal by maurice papon , unleashing anger in the jewish community . france 's highest court on friday will once again take up the case of 93-year-old convicted nazi collaborator maurice papon - the most senior official from the pro-nazi vichy regime tried for crimes against humanity and for helping send jews to nazi death camps .
during the nazi occupation , papon oversaw the bordeaux area police and signed orders that led to the deportation of 1,690 jews from 1942 to 1944 .
most of those deported perished in the auschwitz concentration camp .
papon rose through the ranks of french politics following world war ii , becoming chief of the paris police in 1958 , and later national budget minister under valerie giscard d 'estaing .
but in 1981 his wartime record was revealed when documents were unearthed showing that he had authorized the deportations .
too sick to serve papon has argued that he did n't know the fate of the jews he deported , and that he had to deport them to keep his job at the time .
despite his claims of innocence , he was convicted of crimes against humanity six years ago .
but he walked out of prison in 2002 after a court ruled him too old and sick to finish his 10-year sentence .
the decision outraged the victims of france 's wartime regime and their families .
yet the court of cassation , france 's highest court , will now study an appeal request to clear papon 's name .
this time , the judges wo n't look at the question of papon 's guilt or innocence , but rather focus on obscure legal problems that occurred during his trial .
the procedure is not an appeal as such , but a review by the court to decide whether or not a new appeal can take place .
judges are expected to rule on the matter june 16 .
papon has launched many appeals because he believes justice was fundamentally not carried out during the drawn-out legal battles which began over twenty years ago .
touching a nerve he claims not to regret his actions during the war , and says he ca n't be held partially responsible for holocaust crimes , because he was removed by several " links in the chain " from the murders that took place in concentration camps .
the question of indirect collaboration with war crimes touched a sensitive nerve in france , where the media has periodically pounced on the case , and reopened public dialogue about the extent of nazi sympathy in france during world war ii .
papon says his goal now is to clear his name for history .
but jewish groups say he should still be in prison , citing his lack of remorse .
when papon walked free in 2002 , the u.s.-based simon wiesenthal center called the release " a bad case of misplaced sympathy . "
a frequent problem france has not been the only nation faced with the problem of high officials with nazi pasts .
as recently as last month , a decision by germany 's christian democrats to include a former state premier with a history of nazi activity as a delegate to the presidential election was harshly criticized by jewish groups and left-wing politicians .
hans filbinger , 90 , was forced to resign as premier of the southern state of baden-württemberg in 1978 after it emerged that as a naval judge he shared responsibility for handing down death sentences in the waning months of nazi germany .
probably the best-known case is that of austria 's kurt waldheim .
a widely esteemed former secretary general of the united nations , he was running for president of austria in march 1986 when it came to light that he had participated in nazi atrocities during world war ii .
despite this , he served as his country 's head of state until 1992 . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de delegate 's nazi past clouds german presidential election a decision by germany 's christian democrats to include a former state premier with a nazi past as a delegate for a presidential election has been harshly criticized by jewish groups and left-wing politicians .

during the nazi occupation , papon oversaw the bordeaux area police and signed orders that led to the deportation of 1,690 jews from 1942 to 1944 .
most of those deported perished in the auschwitz concentration camp .
papon rose through the ranks of french politics following world war ii , becoming chief of the paris police in 1958 , and later national budget minister under valerie giscard d 'estaing .
but in 1981 his wartime record was revealed when documents were unearthed showing that he had authorized the deportations .
too sick to serve papon has argued that he did n't know the fate of the jews he deported , and that he had to deport them to keep his job at the time .
despite his claims of innocence , he was convicted of crimes against humanity six years ago .
but he walked out of prison in 2002 after a court ruled him too old and sick to finish his 10-year sentence .
the decision outraged the victims of france 's wartime regime and their families .
yet the court of cassation , france 's highest court , will now study an appeal request to clear papon 's name .
this time , the judges wo n't look at the question of papon 's guilt or innocence , but rather focus on obscure legal problems that occurred during his trial .
the procedure is not an appeal as such , but a review by the court to decide whether or not a new appeal can take place .
judges are expected to rule on the matter june 16 .
papon has launched many appeals because he believes justice was fundamentally not carried out during the drawn-out legal battles which began over twenty years ago .
touching a nerve he claims not to regret his actions during the war , and says he ca n't be held partially responsible for holocaust crimes , because he was removed by several " links in the chain " from the murders that took place in concentration camps .
the question of indirect collaboration with war crimes touched a sensitive nerve in france , where the media has periodically pounced on the case , and reopened public dialogue about the extent of nazi sympathy in france during world war ii .
papon says his goal now is to clear his name for history .
but jewish groups say he should still be in prison , citing his lack of remorse .
when papon walked free in 2002 , the u.s.-based simon wiesenthal center called the release " a bad case of misplaced sympathy . "
a frequent problem france has not been the only nation faced with the problem of high officials with nazi pasts .
as recently as last month , a decision by germany 's christian democrats to include a former state premier with a history of nazi activity as a delegate to the presidential election was harshly criticized by jewish groups and left-wing politicians .
hans filbinger , 90 , was forced to resign as premier of the southern state of baden-württemberg in 1978 after it emerged that as a naval judge he shared responsibility for handing down death sentences in the waning months of nazi germany .
probably the best-known case is that of austria 's kurt waldheim .
a widely esteemed former secretary general of the united nations , he was running for president of austria in march 1986 when it came to light that he had participated in nazi atrocities during world war ii .
despite this , he served as his country 's head of state until 1992 . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de delegate 's nazi past clouds german presidential election a decision by germany 's christian democrats to include a former state premier with a nazi past as a delegate for a presidential election has been harshly criticized by jewish groups and left-wing politicians .

from bit player to global heavyweight current affairs -pipe- 11.06.2004 g-8 summit ends with emphasis on mid east reform großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there was time for a stroll under palm trees g-8 leaders wrapped up their three-day summit at the luxury sea island resort in georgia thursday by vowing to promote democracy in the middle east , but failed to strongly back a u.s. appeal for help on iraq . the harmony and public bonhomie on display during the summit failed to mask differences between leaders of the world 's eight richest nations , in particular between french president jacques chirac and u.s. president bush . on thursday bush appealed to his heavyweight allies to do more to guide iraq 's transformation to a stable democracy , saying the " iraqi people need help " to defend themselves , rebuild their country and hold elections . although bush scored a victory at the start of the summit with the u.n. security council approving a new resolution on iraq , french president jacques chirac - one of the strongest opponents of the iraq war - rebuffed bush 's suggestion that with several nato states already engaged in iraq , the alliance 's role could be expanded there . " i wo n't hide it from you that i do n't think it is nato 's purpose to intervene in iraq , " chirac said wednesday according to the associated press .
" what 's more , i do n't feel that it would be opportune nor necessarily well understood .
i am totally reserved about this issue , " he said . however , on thursday , the last day of the summit , both bush and chirac attempted to appear more cordial at a private meeting .
bush acknowledged past differences with the french president and told reporters : " friends are able to discuss the future . " a french official also said that despite chirac 's reservations about an expanded nato role in iraq , he is open to discussion ahead of a nato summit in turkey at the end of the month . canada , france and germany also made it clear that even after passage of the resolution , they would n't send troops to the country . the leaders of britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan and russia were also unable to agree on bush 's appeal for oil-rich iraq 's debts be forgiven .
they left the issue open , only deciding that there would be " substantial " debt forgiveness . positive report card from schröder german chancellor gerhard schröder had an upbeat assessment of the meetings on sea island , saying lot of hard work was done there , despite many leaders ' dispensing with their ties and three-pieces suits during meetings .
schröder said the unanimous vote in the u.n. security council for the resolution on iraq had not only made the summit work easier , it had proved that one can " come together . " while standing by his pledge not to send german soldiers to iraq , he said germany would not stand in the way of nato doing so . schröder said one of the signals from the summit was a desire to stabilize the " very , very good " situation that the global economy finds itself in . one of the main risks , however , to economic stability is the insecurity in the middle east .
another is the price of oil , if it remains at its current record-high prices . middle east democratization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from top center , going clockwise : u.s. president george w. bush , russian president vladimir putin , german chancellor gerhard schröder , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , european council president bertie ahern , european commission president romano prodi , canadian prime minister paul martin , japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi , british prime minister tony blair and french president jacques chirac during the morning plenary meeting at the g-8 summit in sea island on wednesday .
g-8 leaders at the summit did agree to president bush 's initiative to promote democratic reform in the arab world , and they offered middle eastern and northern african states a political and economic partnership , which would include regular talks at ministerial level , aid in organizing free and transparent elections , increased efforts to fight illiteracy and loans for small businesses . but along with the french president , german chancellor gerhard schröder was still cautious about the plans .
" the west must not make the mistake of imposing its ideas of inner-social development . "
democratization must come from the countries themselves , he said . arab states were critical of the initiative , accusing the g-8 of meddling in internal affairs .
the heads of six moslem countries , including iraqi interim president ghazi al-yawer , took part in the talks .
other arab statesmen , including the egyptian and saudi arabian leaders , rejected the invitation to the summit . on thursday the group turned its attention to developmental policies during a session with african leaders .
the g-8 was to endorse an initiative to battle famine and also commit itself to training and , where necessary , equipping 75,000 peacekeepers to deal with crises in africa . they plan to discuss debt forgiveness for the world 's poorest countries and meet with african statesmen to talk about the new partnership for african development -lrb- nepad -rrb- project to introduce reforms on the african continent . the group also agreed on a proposal to speed up development of a vaccine for hiv , the virus that causes aids .

from bit player to global heavyweight current affairs -pipe- 11.06.2004 g-8 summit ends with emphasis on mid east reform großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there was time for a stroll under palm trees g-8 leaders wrapped up their three-day summit at the luxury sea island resort in georgia thursday by vowing to promote democracy in the middle east , but failed to strongly back a u.s. appeal for help on iraq . the harmony and public bonhomie on display during the summit failed to mask differences between leaders of the world 's eight richest nations , in particular between french president jacques chirac and u.s. president bush . on thursday bush appealed to his heavyweight allies to do more to guide iraq 's transformation to a stable democracy , saying the " iraqi people need help " to defend themselves , rebuild their country and hold elections . although bush scored a victory at the start of the summit with the u.n. security council approving a new resolution on iraq , french president jacques chirac - one of the strongest opponents of the iraq war - rebuffed bush 's suggestion that with several nato states already engaged in iraq , the alliance 's role could be expanded there . " i wo n't hide it from you that i do n't think it is nato 's purpose to intervene in iraq , " chirac said wednesday according to the associated press .
" what 's more , i do n't feel that it would be opportune nor necessarily well understood .
i am totally reserved about this issue , " he said . however , on thursday , the last day of the summit , both bush and chirac attempted to appear more cordial at a private meeting .
bush acknowledged past differences with the french president and told reporters : " friends are able to discuss the future . " a french official also said that despite chirac 's reservations about an expanded nato role in iraq , he is open to discussion ahead of a nato summit in turkey at the end of the month . canada , france and germany also made it clear that even after passage of the resolution , they would n't send troops to the country . the leaders of britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan and russia were also unable to agree on bush 's appeal for oil-rich iraq 's debts be forgiven .
they left the issue open , only deciding that there would be " substantial " debt forgiveness . positive report card from schröder german chancellor gerhard schröder had an upbeat assessment of the meetings on sea island , saying lot of hard work was done there , despite many leaders ' dispensing with their ties and three-pieces suits during meetings .
schröder said the unanimous vote in the u.n. security council for the resolution on iraq had not only made the summit work easier , it had proved that one can " come together . " while standing by his pledge not to send german soldiers to iraq , he said germany would not stand in the way of nato doing so . schröder said one of the signals from the summit was a desire to stabilize the " very , very good " situation that the global economy finds itself in . one of the main risks , however , to economic stability is the insecurity in the middle east .
another is the price of oil , if it remains at its current record-high prices . middle east democratization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from top center , going clockwise : u.s. president george w. bush , russian president vladimir putin , german chancellor gerhard schröder , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , european council president bertie ahern , european commission president romano prodi , canadian prime minister paul martin , japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi , british prime minister tony blair and french president jacques chirac during the morning plenary meeting at the g-8 summit in sea island on wednesday .
g-8 leaders at the summit did agree to president bush 's initiative to promote democratic reform in the arab world , and they offered middle eastern and northern african states a political and economic partnership , which would include regular talks at ministerial level , aid in organizing free and transparent elections , increased efforts to fight illiteracy and loans for small businesses . but along with the french president , german chancellor gerhard schröder was still cautious about the plans .
" the west must not make the mistake of imposing its ideas of inner-social development . "
democratization must come from the countries themselves , he said . arab states were critical of the initiative , accusing the g-8 of meddling in internal affairs .
the heads of six moslem countries , including iraqi interim president ghazi al-yawer , took part in the talks .
other arab statesmen , including the egyptian and saudi arabian leaders , rejected the invitation to the summit . on thursday the group turned its attention to developmental policies during a session with african leaders .

during the nazi occupation , papon oversaw the bordeaux area police and signed orders that led to the deportation of 1,690 jews from 1942 to 1944 .
most of those deported perished in the auschwitz concentration camp .
papon rose through the ranks of french politics following world war ii , becoming chief of the paris police in 1958 , and later national budget minister under valerie giscard d 'estaing .
but in 1981 his wartime record was revealed when documents were unearthed showing that he had authorized the deportations .
too sick to serve papon has argued that he did n't know the fate of the jews he deported , and that he had to deport them to keep his job at the time .
despite his claims of innocence , he was convicted of crimes against humanity six years ago .
but he walked out of prison in 2002 after a court ruled him too old and sick to finish his 10-year sentence .
the decision outraged the victims of france 's wartime regime and their families .
yet the court of cassation , france 's highest court , will now study an appeal request to clear papon 's name .
this time , the judges wo n't look at the question of papon 's guilt or innocence , but rather focus on obscure legal problems that occurred during his trial .
the procedure is not an appeal as such , but a review by the court to decide whether or not a new appeal can take place .
judges are expected to rule on the matter june 16 .
papon has launched many appeals because he believes justice was fundamentally not carried out during the drawn-out legal battles which began over twenty years ago .
touching a nerve he claims not to regret his actions during the war , and says he ca n't be held partially responsible for holocaust crimes , because he was removed by several " links in the chain " from the murders that took place in concentration camps .
the question of indirect collaboration with war crimes touched a sensitive nerve in france , where the media has periodically pounced on the case , and reopened public dialogue about the extent of nazi sympathy in france during world war ii .
papon says his goal now is to clear his name for history .
but jewish groups say he should still be in prison , citing his lack of remorse .
when papon walked free in 2002 , the u.s.-based simon wiesenthal center called the release " a bad case of misplaced sympathy . "
a frequent problem france has not been the only nation faced with the problem of high officials with nazi pasts .
as recently as last month , a decision by germany 's christian democrats to include a former state premier with a history of nazi activity as a delegate to the presidential election was harshly criticized by jewish groups and left-wing politicians .
hans filbinger , 90 , was forced to resign as premier of the southern state of baden-württemberg in 1978 after it emerged that as a naval judge he shared responsibility for handing down death sentences in the waning months of nazi germany .
probably the best-known case is that of austria 's kurt waldheim .
a widely esteemed former secretary general of the united nations , he was running for president of austria in march 1986 when it came to light that he had participated in nazi atrocities during world war ii .
despite this , he served as his country 's head of state until 1992 . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de delegate 's nazi past clouds german presidential election a decision by germany 's christian democrats to include a former state premier with a nazi past as a delegate for a presidential election has been harshly criticized by jewish groups and left-wing politicians .

in russia , 72 percent of those interviewed described relations as " good " and 62 percent said the german position on iraq had improved their perception of the country . only 35 percent of americans on the other hand said relations were good and 51 percent felt the iraq crisis had harmed germany 's reputation abroad . hitler remains best-known german bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adolf hitler pollsters said that relations between east germany and the soviet union were partially responsible for the positive assessment in russia despite the german invasion under adolf hitler , who incidentally remains the best known german in both countries . while chancellor gerhard schröder was the second-best known german in the u.s. , writer johann wolfgang von goethe took that position among russians .
few people named philosopher karl marx or composer johann sebastian bach . the findings wo n't have any direct effects on deutsche welle 's programming , according to erik bettermann , the broadcaster 's director-general .
he said dw officials would combine them with feedback from viewers , listeners and readers as well as partner organizations such as the goethe institute .
germany 's parliament is expected to redefine the broadcaster 's mission with a new law later this year .

a bill has been introduced which would add legal weight to patients ' wishes . the federal government is not aiming to legalize active medically assisted suicide , according to justice minister brigitte zypries , rather it is seeking through the bill it introduced on thursday to put patients ' own decisions on medical treatment , especially regarding artificial life support , on more secure legal ground . the law proposed by the social democratic minister would add heft to so-called advance health care declarations , or living wills , made by patients who ask that their lives not be extended by artificial means .
it would also give doctors and patients ' relatives a more secure legal footing when carrying out patients ' wishes . the bill , which if passed would become law in 2006 , is based on suggestions made by a working group the minister convened called " patient autonomy at the end of life . "
headed by a former federal judge , the group included doctors , legal experts , social welfare groups and churches . the group came together after a federal court ruling in march 2003 in which judges acknowledged the relevance of living wills , but ruled that in the event of a disagreement between an attending physician and the custodian of a comatose patient , the matter had to be referred to a guardianship court , which would decide whether , for example , removing a feeding tube would be in the best interests of the patient . according to zypries , under the new law the guardianship would no longer be consulted if a living will has designated a person to represent a patient 's wishes should he or she no longer be able to .
that representative would then be able to make decisions based on the contents of the living will .
additionally , the living will should in the future have legal weight in any stage of illness , not only when the patient 's condition has become terminal . the head of the working group which drafted the bill , federal judge klaus kutzer , said the proposed law is not active assisted suicide or the so-called death on demand , in which a lethal drug is administered to a patient .
he said the working group did not want to create any legal room for such actions with the proposed law , but did want to create a legal framework in which passive doctor-assisted suicide was possible for patients who wanted it . slippery slope criticism but the minister 's proposal drew criticism from churches , the german hospice association , the federal doctors ' chamber and the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , who said it was a first step in legalizing active medically assisted suicide .
hubert hüppe , deputy head of the german parliament 's ethics commission and cdu member , warned against " unusually dangerous tendencies " toward weakening laws that protect the lives of patients .
both the protestant and catholic churches of germany said patients " should not in any instance be put under pressure " to end their lives . justice minister zypries encouraged germans to put some thought into what they would want should they be incapacitated by a serious illness or accident and to consider drawing up a living will . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german hospice movement seeks to make " dying a part of life " death remains a taboo topic , causing many to die alone - in hospitals or nursing homes .

a bill has been introduced which would add legal weight to patients ' wishes . the federal government is not aiming to legalize active medically assisted suicide , according to justice minister brigitte zypries , rather it is seeking through the bill it introduced on thursday to put patients ' own decisions on medical treatment , especially regarding artificial life support , on more secure legal ground . the law proposed by the social democratic minister would add heft to so-called advance health care declarations , or living wills , made by patients who ask that their lives not be extended by artificial means .
it would also give doctors and patients ' relatives a more secure legal footing when carrying out patients ' wishes . the bill , which if passed would become law in 2006 , is based on suggestions made by a working group the minister convened called " patient autonomy at the end of life . "
headed by a former federal judge , the group included doctors , legal experts , social welfare groups and churches . the group came together after a federal court ruling in march 2003 in which judges acknowledged the relevance of living wills , but ruled that in the event of a disagreement between an attending physician and the custodian of a comatose patient , the matter had to be referred to a guardianship court , which would decide whether , for example , removing a feeding tube would be in the best interests of the patient . according to zypries , under the new law the guardianship would no longer be consulted if a living will has designated a person to represent a patient 's wishes should he or she no longer be able to .
that representative would then be able to make decisions based on the contents of the living will .
additionally , the living will should in the future have legal weight in any stage of illness , not only when the patient 's condition has become terminal . the head of the working group which drafted the bill , federal judge klaus kutzer , said the proposed law is not active assisted suicide or the so-called death on demand , in which a lethal drug is administered to a patient .
he said the working group did not want to create any legal room for such actions with the proposed law , but did want to create a legal framework in which passive doctor-assisted suicide was possible for patients who wanted it . slippery slope criticism but the minister 's proposal drew criticism from churches , the german hospice association , the federal doctors ' chamber and the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , who said it was a first step in legalizing active medically assisted suicide .
hubert hüppe , deputy head of the german parliament 's ethics commission and cdu member , warned against " unusually dangerous tendencies " toward weakening laws that protect the lives of patients .
both the protestant and catholic churches of germany said patients " should not in any instance be put under pressure " to end their lives . justice minister zypries encouraged germans to put some thought into what they would want should they be incapacitated by a serious illness or accident and to consider drawing up a living will . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german hospice movement seeks to make " dying a part of life " death remains a taboo topic , causing many to die alone - in hospitals or nursing homes .
since the late sixties , the german hospice movement has been trying to change this , showing people that " dying is a part of life . "

the problem has always been that they emit toxic particles that have been linked to cancer and respiratory illnesses .
however , the recent creation of so-called particle filters has made diesel engines safer for consumer use .
proponents say particle filters are the only technology currently available that can cut particle emissions by 99 percent .
but german car makers have n't been quick enough to jump on the bandwagon , and that 's beginning to create a political problem in the environmentally progressive country .
in contrast to french car makers like peugeot and renault , which have embraced particle-filter diesel engines , german companies have instead opted for internal improvements to diesel motors , with moderate successes in reducing particle emissions .
a shot in the arm german environment minister jürgen trittin of the green party has drafted legislation that would seek to give a shot in the arm to the particle filter business by providing a tax break of € 600 -lrb- $ 740 -rrb- on diesel cars with new particle filters that reduce particle emissions to a stringent limit of 2.5 milligrams per kilometer .
but major car makers like volkswagen have called for a looser limit of 12.5 milligrams .
environmental groups , the green party and factions of the social democrats are backing trittin 's calls , which they say is supported by environment ministry data claiming that 14,000 people die each year as a result of diesel particle emissions .
but the industry , led by volkswagen , has fought tooth and nail to avoid being forced to adopt the filters .
in an attempt to break the bottleneck , german chancellor gerhard schröder met earlier this week in berlin with vw ceo bernd pischetsrieder and other top european automobile industry executives to discuss future use of particle filters .
" every seventh job in germany is still dependent on the automobile industry , " said schröder 's spokesman , bela anda .
" this should not be seen as a call for measures not to be implemented .
but it should also make it clear that there are also endeavors in the industry to reach this goal through changes in the internal motors - and people should n't disregard that fact . "
after his meeting with pischetsrieder , schröder said no decision had been reached as to when particle filters would be included in cars or how they might be filtered .
instead , the chancellor and the executives of europe 's largest car maker decided to leave responsibility for the decision with brussels .
by the end of the year , the eu is expected to produce regulations for emissions norms that would serve as the blueprint for filtering technologies .
for the automobile industry , punting the responsibility to brussels represents a partial victory , as the standards proposed by germany 's trittin would likely have been much stricter .
gerd lottsiepen , of the german automobile club , said the car manufacturers were acting irresponsibly in their fight against technological limits .
" the manufacturers who are now issuing polemical attacks against these limits ... are knowingly acting against the interests of consumers .
the customers who buy cars today with yesterday 's technology will get stuck paying the piper for the manufacturer 's deep sleep .
the loss of value for cars without particle filters will be higher than average in the coming years , " lottsiepen said .
to some environmental groups , including greenpeace , the financial incentive trittin has proposed does not go far enough .
" the price difference between the systems runs between € 300 and € 1,300 , " said günter hubmann of greenpeace .
" we 're demanding that , for the best system , which is 99 percent effective , a tax break of € 999 should be given by the government .
how , exactly , that can happen still needs to be negotiated . "
discord in berlin the current debate over particle filters also threatens to spark a new row between environment minister trittin and economics minister wolfgang clement , who just recently locked horns over emissions trading standards for heavy industry .
responding to the particle filter debate , clement has said he does not want to add further pressure to car makers while the economy struggles for growth .
companies like vw say that if particle filters become obligatory , it should not happen before 2007 and that the particle emission limits should be set higher than trittin 's proposed standard .
meanwhile , the opposition parties , including the christian democratic union , have said that promoting specific or special technologies should not be the government 's responsibility .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dacia , logan , 2004 though germany leads europe in auto exports , the particle filter issue has been driven by the french .
there , car-maker peugeot introduced its first diesel car with a particle filter in 2000 , offering the additional safety at the same price as its other diesel offerings .
peugeot 's parent company , autogruppe psa , is the world 's largest self-combusting engine manufacturer , and it has widely introduced particle filters in its diesel cars .
but differences remain between germany 's leading politicians on the best way to move forward with particle filters .
and any car tax breaks proposed by the federal government must also be approved by the states that are entitled to the proceeds from the motor vehicle tax .
so far , most states are taking a reserved approach to the proposal , with ministers in some states , like bavaria , saying it has not yet been proven that the current generation of particle filters are the most effective means of reducing particle emissions from diesel motors . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de still no decision on filters for diesel cars the german government has still not made a decision on whether it will subsidize diesel-powered cars outfitted with particulate filters .

proponents say particle filters are the only technology currently available that can cut particle emissions by 99 percent .
but german car makers have n't been quick enough to jump on the bandwagon , and that 's beginning to create a political problem in the environmentally progressive country .
in contrast to french car makers like peugeot and renault , which have embraced particle-filter diesel engines , german companies have instead opted for internal improvements to diesel motors , with moderate successes in reducing particle emissions .
a shot in the arm german environment minister jürgen trittin of the green party has drafted legislation that would seek to give a shot in the arm to the particle filter business by providing a tax break of € 600 -lrb- $ 740 -rrb- on diesel cars with new particle filters that reduce particle emissions to a stringent limit of 2.5 milligrams per kilometer .
but major car makers like volkswagen have called for a looser limit of 12.5 milligrams .
environmental groups , the green party and factions of the social democrats are backing trittin 's calls , which they say is supported by environment ministry data claiming that 14,000 people die each year as a result of diesel particle emissions .
but the industry , led by volkswagen , has fought tooth and nail to avoid being forced to adopt the filters .
in an attempt to break the bottleneck , german chancellor gerhard schröder met earlier this week in berlin with vw ceo bernd pischetsrieder and other top european automobile industry executives to discuss future use of particle filters .
" every seventh job in germany is still dependent on the automobile industry , " said schröder 's spokesman , bela anda .
" this should not be seen as a call for measures not to be implemented .
but it should also make it clear that there are also endeavors in the industry to reach this goal through changes in the internal motors - and people should n't disregard that fact . "
after his meeting with pischetsrieder , schröder said no decision had been reached as to when particle filters would be included in cars or how they might be filtered .
instead , the chancellor and the executives of europe 's largest car maker decided to leave responsibility for the decision with brussels .
by the end of the year , the eu is expected to produce regulations for emissions norms that would serve as the blueprint for filtering technologies .
for the automobile industry , punting the responsibility to brussels represents a partial victory , as the standards proposed by germany 's trittin would likely have been much stricter .
gerd lottsiepen , of the german automobile club , said the car manufacturers were acting irresponsibly in their fight against technological limits .
" the manufacturers who are now issuing polemical attacks against these limits ... are knowingly acting against the interests of consumers .
the customers who buy cars today with yesterday 's technology will get stuck paying the piper for the manufacturer 's deep sleep .
the loss of value for cars without particle filters will be higher than average in the coming years , " lottsiepen said .
to some environmental groups , including greenpeace , the financial incentive trittin has proposed does not go far enough .
" the price difference between the systems runs between € 300 and € 1,300 , " said günter hubmann of greenpeace .
" we 're demanding that , for the best system , which is 99 percent effective , a tax break of € 999 should be given by the government .
how , exactly , that can happen still needs to be negotiated . "
discord in berlin the current debate over particle filters also threatens to spark a new row between environment minister trittin and economics minister wolfgang clement , who just recently locked horns over emissions trading standards for heavy industry .
responding to the particle filter debate , clement has said he does not want to add further pressure to car makers while the economy struggles for growth .
companies like vw say that if particle filters become obligatory , it should not happen before 2007 and that the particle emission limits should be set higher than trittin 's proposed standard .
meanwhile , the opposition parties , including the christian democratic union , have said that promoting specific or special technologies should not be the government 's responsibility .

there , car-maker peugeot introduced its first diesel car with a particle filter in 2000 , offering the additional safety at the same price as its other diesel offerings .

from bit player to global heavyweight current affairs -pipe- 11.06.2004 g-8 summit ends with emphasis on mid east reform großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there was time for a stroll under palm trees g-8 leaders wrapped up their three-day summit at the luxury sea island resort in georgia thursday by vowing to promote democracy in the middle east , but failed to strongly back a u.s. appeal for help on iraq . the harmony and public bonhomie on display during the summit failed to mask differences between leaders of the world 's eight richest nations , in particular between french president jacques chirac and u.s. president bush . on thursday bush appealed to his heavyweight allies to do more to guide iraq 's transformation to a stable democracy , saying the " iraqi people need help " to defend themselves , rebuild their country and hold elections . although bush scored a victory at the start of the summit with the u.n. security council approving a new resolution on iraq , french president jacques chirac - one of the strongest opponents of the iraq war - rebuffed bush 's suggestion that with several nato states already engaged in iraq , the alliance 's role could be expanded there . " i wo n't hide it from you that i do n't think it is nato 's purpose to intervene in iraq , " chirac said wednesday according to the associated press .
" what 's more , i do n't feel that it would be opportune nor necessarily well understood .
i am totally reserved about this issue , " he said . however , on thursday , the last day of the summit , both bush and chirac attempted to appear more cordial at a private meeting .
bush acknowledged past differences with the french president and told reporters : " friends are able to discuss the future . " a french official also said that despite chirac 's reservations about an expanded nato role in iraq , he is open to discussion ahead of a nato summit in turkey at the end of the month . canada , france and germany also made it clear that even after passage of the resolution , they would n't send troops to the country . the leaders of britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan and russia were also unable to agree on bush 's appeal for oil-rich iraq 's debts be forgiven .
they left the issue open , only deciding that there would be " substantial " debt forgiveness . positive report card from schröder german chancellor gerhard schröder had an upbeat assessment of the meetings on sea island , saying lot of hard work was done there , despite many leaders ' dispensing with their ties and three-pieces suits during meetings .
schröder said the unanimous vote in the u.n. security council for the resolution on iraq had not only made the summit work easier , it had proved that one can " come together . " while standing by his pledge not to send german soldiers to iraq , he said germany would not stand in the way of nato doing so . schröder said one of the signals from the summit was a desire to stabilize the " very , very good " situation that the global economy finds itself in . one of the main risks , however , to economic stability is the insecurity in the middle east .
another is the price of oil , if it remains at its current record-high prices . middle east democratization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from top center , going clockwise : u.s. president george w. bush , russian president vladimir putin , german chancellor gerhard schröder , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , european council president bertie ahern , european commission president romano prodi , canadian prime minister paul martin , japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi , british prime minister tony blair and french president jacques chirac during the morning plenary meeting at the g-8 summit in sea island on wednesday .
g-8 leaders at the summit did agree to president bush 's initiative to promote democratic reform in the arab world , and they offered middle eastern and northern african states a political and economic partnership , which would include regular talks at ministerial level , aid in organizing free and transparent elections , increased efforts to fight illiteracy and loans for small businesses . but along with the french president , german chancellor gerhard schröder was still cautious about the plans .
" the west must not make the mistake of imposing its ideas of inner-social development . "
democratization must come from the countries themselves , he said . arab states were critical of the initiative , accusing the g-8 of meddling in internal affairs .
the heads of six moslem countries , including iraqi interim president ghazi al-yawer , took part in the talks .
other arab statesmen , including the egyptian and saudi arabian leaders , rejected the invitation to the summit . on thursday the group turned its attention to developmental policies during a session with african leaders .
the g-8 was to endorse an initiative to battle famine and also commit itself to training and , where necessary , equipping 75,000 peacekeepers to deal with crises in africa . they plan to discuss debt forgiveness for the world 's poorest countries and meet with african statesmen to talk about the new partnership for african development -lrb- nepad -rrb- project to introduce reforms on the african continent . the group also agreed on a proposal to speed up development of a vaccine for hiv , the virus that causes aids .
bush proposed spending € 15 million to launch it . g-9 or g-10 ? british premier tony blair , who will take over the g-8 presidency in july , said member states were in agreement that the group should be expanded to include other countries , such as china or india . the german chancellor also said he believed china would be a candidate to participate in future meetings as the country had dramatically changed over the past years . chirac expressed his regrets that unlike french officials at the last meeting in evian , the u.s. had not invited china , india or brazil to the meeting . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany-u.s. exhibit chummy ties at g-8 summit after almost 18 months of fluctuating tensions between berlin and washington , german chancellor schröder and u.s. president bush held a cordial meeting on the fringes of the g8 summit proving they were chummy once again .

during the nazi occupation , papon oversaw the bordeaux area police and signed orders that led to the deportation of 1,690 jews from 1942 to 1944 .
most of those deported perished in the auschwitz concentration camp .
papon rose through the ranks of french politics following world war ii , becoming chief of the paris police in 1958 , and later national budget minister under valerie giscard d 'estaing .
but in 1981 his wartime record was revealed when documents were unearthed showing that he had authorized the deportations .
too sick to serve papon has argued that he did n't know the fate of the jews he deported , and that he had to deport them to keep his job at the time .
despite his claims of innocence , he was convicted of crimes against humanity six years ago .
but he walked out of prison in 2002 after a court ruled him too old and sick to finish his 10-year sentence .
the decision outraged the victims of france 's wartime regime and their families .
yet the court of cassation , france 's highest court , will now study an appeal request to clear papon 's name .
this time , the judges wo n't look at the question of papon 's guilt or innocence , but rather focus on obscure legal problems that occurred during his trial .
the procedure is not an appeal as such , but a review by the court to decide whether or not a new appeal can take place .
judges are expected to rule on the matter june 16 .
papon has launched many appeals because he believes justice was fundamentally not carried out during the drawn-out legal battles which began over twenty years ago .
touching a nerve he claims not to regret his actions during the war , and says he ca n't be held partially responsible for holocaust crimes , because he was removed by several " links in the chain " from the murders that took place in concentration camps .
the question of indirect collaboration with war crimes touched a sensitive nerve in france , where the media has periodically pounced on the case , and reopened public dialogue about the extent of nazi sympathy in france during world war ii .
papon says his goal now is to clear his name for history .
but jewish groups say he should still be in prison , citing his lack of remorse .
when papon walked free in 2002 , the u.s.-based simon wiesenthal center called the release " a bad case of misplaced sympathy . "
a frequent problem france has not been the only nation faced with the problem of high officials with nazi pasts .
as recently as last month , a decision by germany 's christian democrats to include a former state premier with a history of nazi activity as a delegate to the presidential election was harshly criticized by jewish groups and left-wing politicians .
hans filbinger , 90 , was forced to resign as premier of the southern state of baden-württemberg in 1978 after it emerged that as a naval judge he shared responsibility for handing down death sentences in the waning months of nazi germany .
probably the best-known case is that of austria 's kurt waldheim .
a widely esteemed former secretary general of the united nations , he was running for president of austria in march 1986 when it came to light that he had participated in nazi atrocities during world war ii .
despite this , he served as his country 's head of state until 1992 . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de delegate 's nazi past clouds german presidential election a decision by germany 's christian democrats to include a former state premier with a nazi past as a delegate for a presidential election has been harshly criticized by jewish groups and left-wing politicians .

government ministers acknowledged that war in iraq played a role . british prime minister tony blair 's party lost more than 200 seats on local councils , according to bbc .
while final results have not been announced , labor is expected to come in third , behind opposition conservatives and the third party liberal democrats . speaking at the g-8 summit in the u.s. state of georgia , blair said the british role in iraq had cast a shadow over the elections .
" but in the end you have to take decisions that are right and you have to see them through , " he told reporters . the conservatives were unable to make huge gains as they also supported the war in iraq .
only the liberal democrats , who opposed a british involvement , made strides at the ballots . results unlikely to threaten blair 's re-election while experts said that the elections were unlikely to threaten blair 's re-election in the upcoming general election , which is expected to take place next year , government officials also tried to play down the significance of the results . " we always knew this was going to be a very difficult election for us , " nick raynford , the cabinet minister in charge of local government issues , told sky television .
" governments in mid-term tend to lose . " results in elections for london 's mayor were expected to be announced later on friday .
incumbent ken livingstone was expected to win re-election . british voters also cast their ballots in the european parliament elections on thursday , but those results are not expected to be announced until sunday after all other 25 eu countries have voted as well . the anti-eu uk independence party , which has called for britain 's withdrawal from the eu , is expected to fare well in those elections and could quadruple its seats to 12 . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu-skeptics gain momentum in britain elections for the european parliament started thursday as dutch and british voters headed to the polls .

during the nazi occupation , papon oversaw the bordeaux area police and signed orders that led to the deportation of 1,690 jews from 1942 to 1944 .
most of those deported perished in the auschwitz concentration camp .
papon rose through the ranks of french politics following world war ii , becoming chief of the paris police in 1958 , and later national budget minister under valerie giscard d 'estaing .
but in 1981 his wartime record was revealed when documents were unearthed showing that he had authorized the deportations .
too sick to serve papon has argued that he did n't know the fate of the jews he deported , and that he had to deport them to keep his job at the time .
despite his claims of innocence , he was convicted of crimes against humanity six years ago .
but he walked out of prison in 2002 after a court ruled him too old and sick to finish his 10-year sentence .
the decision outraged the victims of france 's wartime regime and their families .
yet the court of cassation , france 's highest court , will now study an appeal request to clear papon 's name .
this time , the judges wo n't look at the question of papon 's guilt or innocence , but rather focus on obscure legal problems that occurred during his trial .
the procedure is not an appeal as such , but a review by the court to decide whether or not a new appeal can take place .
judges are expected to rule on the matter june 16 .
papon has launched many appeals because he believes justice was fundamentally not carried out during the drawn-out legal battles which began over twenty years ago .
touching a nerve he claims not to regret his actions during the war , and says he ca n't be held partially responsible for holocaust crimes , because he was removed by several " links in the chain " from the murders that took place in concentration camps .
the question of indirect collaboration with war crimes touched a sensitive nerve in france , where the media has periodically pounced on the case , and reopened public dialogue about the extent of nazi sympathy in france during world war ii .
papon says his goal now is to clear his name for history .
but jewish groups say he should still be in prison , citing his lack of remorse .
when papon walked free in 2002 , the u.s.-based simon wiesenthal center called the release " a bad case of misplaced sympathy . "
a frequent problem france has not been the only nation faced with the problem of high officials with nazi pasts .
as recently as last month , a decision by germany 's christian democrats to include a former state premier with a history of nazi activity as a delegate to the presidential election was harshly criticized by jewish groups and left-wing politicians .
hans filbinger , 90 , was forced to resign as premier of the southern state of baden-württemberg in 1978 after it emerged that as a naval judge he shared responsibility for handing down death sentences in the waning months of nazi germany .
probably the best-known case is that of austria 's kurt waldheim .
a widely esteemed former secretary general of the united nations , he was running for president of austria in march 1986 when it came to light that he had participated in nazi atrocities during world war ii .
despite this , he served as his country 's head of state until 1992 . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de delegate 's nazi past clouds german presidential election a decision by germany 's christian democrats to include a former state premier with a nazi past as a delegate for a presidential election has been harshly criticized by jewish groups and left-wing politicians .

from bit player to global heavyweight current affairs -pipe- 11.06.2004 g-8 summit ends with emphasis on mid east reform großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there was time for a stroll under palm trees g-8 leaders wrapped up their three-day summit at the luxury sea island resort in georgia thursday by vowing to promote democracy in the middle east , but failed to strongly back a u.s. appeal for help on iraq . the harmony and public bonhomie on display during the summit failed to mask differences between leaders of the world 's eight richest nations , in particular between french president jacques chirac and u.s. president bush . on thursday bush appealed to his heavyweight allies to do more to guide iraq 's transformation to a stable democracy , saying the " iraqi people need help " to defend themselves , rebuild their country and hold elections . although bush scored a victory at the start of the summit with the u.n. security council approving a new resolution on iraq , french president jacques chirac - one of the strongest opponents of the iraq war - rebuffed bush 's suggestion that with several nato states already engaged in iraq , the alliance 's role could be expanded there . " i wo n't hide it from you that i do n't think it is nato 's purpose to intervene in iraq , " chirac said wednesday according to the associated press .
" what 's more , i do n't feel that it would be opportune nor necessarily well understood .
i am totally reserved about this issue , " he said . however , on thursday , the last day of the summit , both bush and chirac attempted to appear more cordial at a private meeting .
bush acknowledged past differences with the french president and told reporters : " friends are able to discuss the future . " a french official also said that despite chirac 's reservations about an expanded nato role in iraq , he is open to discussion ahead of a nato summit in turkey at the end of the month . canada , france and germany also made it clear that even after passage of the resolution , they would n't send troops to the country . the leaders of britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan and russia were also unable to agree on bush 's appeal for oil-rich iraq 's debts be forgiven .
they left the issue open , only deciding that there would be " substantial " debt forgiveness . positive report card from schröder german chancellor gerhard schröder had an upbeat assessment of the meetings on sea island , saying lot of hard work was done there , despite many leaders ' dispensing with their ties and three-pieces suits during meetings .
schröder said the unanimous vote in the u.n. security council for the resolution on iraq had not only made the summit work easier , it had proved that one can " come together . " while standing by his pledge not to send german soldiers to iraq , he said germany would not stand in the way of nato doing so . schröder said one of the signals from the summit was a desire to stabilize the " very , very good " situation that the global economy finds itself in . one of the main risks , however , to economic stability is the insecurity in the middle east .
another is the price of oil , if it remains at its current record-high prices . middle east democratization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from top center , going clockwise : u.s. president george w. bush , russian president vladimir putin , german chancellor gerhard schröder , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , european council president bertie ahern , european commission president romano prodi , canadian prime minister paul martin , japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi , british prime minister tony blair and french president jacques chirac during the morning plenary meeting at the g-8 summit in sea island on wednesday .
g-8 leaders at the summit did agree to president bush 's initiative to promote democratic reform in the arab world , and they offered middle eastern and northern african states a political and economic partnership , which would include regular talks at ministerial level , aid in organizing free and transparent elections , increased efforts to fight illiteracy and loans for small businesses . but along with the french president , german chancellor gerhard schröder was still cautious about the plans .
" the west must not make the mistake of imposing its ideas of inner-social development . "
democratization must come from the countries themselves , he said . arab states were critical of the initiative , accusing the g-8 of meddling in internal affairs .
the heads of six moslem countries , including iraqi interim president ghazi al-yawer , took part in the talks .
other arab statesmen , including the egyptian and saudi arabian leaders , rejected the invitation to the summit . on thursday the group turned its attention to developmental policies during a session with african leaders .
the g-8 was to endorse an initiative to battle famine and also commit itself to training and , where necessary , equipping 75,000 peacekeepers to deal with crises in africa . they plan to discuss debt forgiveness for the world 's poorest countries and meet with african statesmen to talk about the new partnership for african development -lrb- nepad -rrb- project to introduce reforms on the african continent . the group also agreed on a proposal to speed up development of a vaccine for hiv , the virus that causes aids .
bush proposed spending € 15 million to launch it . g-9 or g-10 ? british premier tony blair , who will take over the g-8 presidency in july , said member states were in agreement that the group should be expanded to include other countries , such as china or india . the german chancellor also said he believed china would be a candidate to participate in future meetings as the country had dramatically changed over the past years . chirac expressed his regrets that unlike french officials at the last meeting in evian , the u.s. had not invited china , india or brazil to the meeting . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany-u.s. exhibit chummy ties at g-8 summit after almost 18 months of fluctuating tensions between berlin and washington , german chancellor schröder and u.s. president bush held a cordial meeting on the fringes of the g8 summit proving they were chummy once again .

a bill has been introduced which would add legal weight to patients ' wishes . the federal government is not aiming to legalize active medically assisted suicide , according to justice minister brigitte zypries , rather it is seeking through the bill it introduced on thursday to put patients ' own decisions on medical treatment , especially regarding artificial life support , on more secure legal ground . the law proposed by the social democratic minister would add heft to so-called advance health care declarations , or living wills , made by patients who ask that their lives not be extended by artificial means .
it would also give doctors and patients ' relatives a more secure legal footing when carrying out patients ' wishes . the bill , which if passed would become law in 2006 , is based on suggestions made by a working group the minister convened called " patient autonomy at the end of life . "
headed by a former federal judge , the group included doctors , legal experts , social welfare groups and churches . the group came together after a federal court ruling in march 2003 in which judges acknowledged the relevance of living wills , but ruled that in the event of a disagreement between an attending physician and the custodian of a comatose patient , the matter had to be referred to a guardianship court , which would decide whether , for example , removing a feeding tube would be in the best interests of the patient . according to zypries , under the new law the guardianship would no longer be consulted if a living will has designated a person to represent a patient 's wishes should he or she no longer be able to .
that representative would then be able to make decisions based on the contents of the living will .
additionally , the living will should in the future have legal weight in any stage of illness , not only when the patient 's condition has become terminal . the head of the working group which drafted the bill , federal judge klaus kutzer , said the proposed law is not active assisted suicide or the so-called death on demand , in which a lethal drug is administered to a patient .
he said the working group did not want to create any legal room for such actions with the proposed law , but did want to create a legal framework in which passive doctor-assisted suicide was possible for patients who wanted it . slippery slope criticism but the minister 's proposal drew criticism from churches , the german hospice association , the federal doctors ' chamber and the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , who said it was a first step in legalizing active medically assisted suicide .
hubert hüppe , deputy head of the german parliament 's ethics commission and cdu member , warned against " unusually dangerous tendencies " toward weakening laws that protect the lives of patients .
both the protestant and catholic churches of germany said patients " should not in any instance be put under pressure " to end their lives . justice minister zypries encouraged germans to put some thought into what they would want should they be incapacitated by a serious illness or accident and to consider drawing up a living will . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german hospice movement seeks to make " dying a part of life " death remains a taboo topic , causing many to die alone - in hospitals or nursing homes .

government ministers acknowledged that war in iraq played a role . british prime minister tony blair 's party lost more than 200 seats on local councils , according to bbc .
while final results have not been announced , labor is expected to come in third , behind opposition conservatives and the third party liberal democrats . speaking at the g-8 summit in the u.s. state of georgia , blair said the british role in iraq had cast a shadow over the elections .
" but in the end you have to take decisions that are right and you have to see them through , " he told reporters . the conservatives were unable to make huge gains as they also supported the war in iraq .
only the liberal democrats , who opposed a british involvement , made strides at the ballots . results unlikely to threaten blair 's re-election while experts said that the elections were unlikely to threaten blair 's re-election in the upcoming general election , which is expected to take place next year , government officials also tried to play down the significance of the results . " we always knew this was going to be a very difficult election for us , " nick raynford , the cabinet minister in charge of local government issues , told sky television .
" governments in mid-term tend to lose . " results in elections for london 's mayor were expected to be announced later on friday .
incumbent ken livingstone was expected to win re-election . british voters also cast their ballots in the european parliament elections on thursday , but those results are not expected to be announced until sunday after all other 25 eu countries have voted as well . the anti-eu uk independence party , which has called for britain 's withdrawal from the eu , is expected to fare well in those elections and could quadruple its seats to 12 . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu-skeptics gain momentum in britain elections for the european parliament started thursday as dutch and british voters headed to the polls .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.06.2004 german government to strengthen patients ' right to die großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new bill would make living wills the final word in medical treatment germany 's justice minister wants to make it easier for terminally ill patients to refuse life-extending treatments in the hospital .
a bill has been introduced which would add legal weight to patients ' wishes . the federal government is not aiming to legalize active medically assisted suicide , according to justice minister brigitte zypries , rather it is seeking through the bill it introduced on thursday to put patients ' own decisions on medical treatment , especially regarding artificial life support , on more secure legal ground . the law proposed by the social democratic minister would add heft to so-called advance health care declarations , or living wills , made by patients who ask that their lives not be extended by artificial means .
it would also give doctors and patients ' relatives a more secure legal footing when carrying out patients ' wishes . the bill , which if passed would become law in 2006 , is based on suggestions made by a working group the minister convened called " patient autonomy at the end of life . "
headed by a former federal judge , the group included doctors , legal experts , social welfare groups and churches . the group came together after a federal court ruling in march 2003 in which judges acknowledged the relevance of living wills , but ruled that in the event of a disagreement between an attending physician and the custodian of a comatose patient , the matter had to be referred to a guardianship court , which would decide whether , for example , removing a feeding tube would be in the best interests of the patient . according to zypries , under the new law the guardianship would no longer be consulted if a living will has designated a person to represent a patient 's wishes should he or she no longer be able to .
that representative would then be able to make decisions based on the contents of the living will .
additionally , the living will should in the future have legal weight in any stage of illness , not only when the patient 's condition has become terminal . the head of the working group which drafted the bill , federal judge klaus kutzer , said the proposed law is not active assisted suicide or the so-called death on demand , in which a lethal drug is administered to a patient .
he said the working group did not want to create any legal room for such actions with the proposed law , but did want to create a legal framework in which passive doctor-assisted suicide was possible for patients who wanted it . slippery slope criticism but the minister 's proposal drew criticism from churches , the german hospice association , the federal doctors ' chamber and the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , who said it was a first step in legalizing active medically assisted suicide .
hubert hüppe , deputy head of the german parliament 's ethics commission and cdu member , warned against " unusually dangerous tendencies " toward weakening laws that protect the lives of patients .
both the protestant and catholic churches of germany said patients " should not in any instance be put under pressure " to end their lives . justice minister zypries encouraged germans to put some thought into what they would want should they be incapacitated by a serious illness or accident and to consider drawing up a living will . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german hospice movement seeks to make " dying a part of life " death remains a taboo topic , causing many to die alone - in hospitals or nursing homes .

from bit player to global heavyweight current affairs -pipe- 11.06.2004 g-8 summit ends with emphasis on mid east reform großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there was time for a stroll under palm trees g-8 leaders wrapped up their three-day summit at the luxury sea island resort in georgia thursday by vowing to promote democracy in the middle east , but failed to strongly back a u.s. appeal for help on iraq . the harmony and public bonhomie on display during the summit failed to mask differences between leaders of the world 's eight richest nations , in particular between french president jacques chirac and u.s. president bush . on thursday bush appealed to his heavyweight allies to do more to guide iraq 's transformation to a stable democracy , saying the " iraqi people need help " to defend themselves , rebuild their country and hold elections . although bush scored a victory at the start of the summit with the u.n. security council approving a new resolution on iraq , french president jacques chirac - one of the strongest opponents of the iraq war - rebuffed bush 's suggestion that with several nato states already engaged in iraq , the alliance 's role could be expanded there . " i wo n't hide it from you that i do n't think it is nato 's purpose to intervene in iraq , " chirac said wednesday according to the associated press .
" what 's more , i do n't feel that it would be opportune nor necessarily well understood .
i am totally reserved about this issue , " he said . however , on thursday , the last day of the summit , both bush and chirac attempted to appear more cordial at a private meeting .
bush acknowledged past differences with the french president and told reporters : " friends are able to discuss the future . " a french official also said that despite chirac 's reservations about an expanded nato role in iraq , he is open to discussion ahead of a nato summit in turkey at the end of the month . canada , france and germany also made it clear that even after passage of the resolution , they would n't send troops to the country . the leaders of britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan and russia were also unable to agree on bush 's appeal for oil-rich iraq 's debts be forgiven .
they left the issue open , only deciding that there would be " substantial " debt forgiveness . positive report card from schröder german chancellor gerhard schröder had an upbeat assessment of the meetings on sea island , saying lot of hard work was done there , despite many leaders ' dispensing with their ties and three-pieces suits during meetings .
schröder said the unanimous vote in the u.n. security council for the resolution on iraq had not only made the summit work easier , it had proved that one can " come together . " while standing by his pledge not to send german soldiers to iraq , he said germany would not stand in the way of nato doing so . schröder said one of the signals from the summit was a desire to stabilize the " very , very good " situation that the global economy finds itself in . one of the main risks , however , to economic stability is the insecurity in the middle east .
another is the price of oil , if it remains at its current record-high prices . middle east democratization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from top center , going clockwise : u.s. president george w. bush , russian president vladimir putin , german chancellor gerhard schröder , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , european council president bertie ahern , european commission president romano prodi , canadian prime minister paul martin , japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi , british prime minister tony blair and french president jacques chirac during the morning plenary meeting at the g-8 summit in sea island on wednesday .
g-8 leaders at the summit did agree to president bush 's initiative to promote democratic reform in the arab world , and they offered middle eastern and northern african states a political and economic partnership , which would include regular talks at ministerial level , aid in organizing free and transparent elections , increased efforts to fight illiteracy and loans for small businesses . but along with the french president , german chancellor gerhard schröder was still cautious about the plans .
" the west must not make the mistake of imposing its ideas of inner-social development . "
democratization must come from the countries themselves , he said . arab states were critical of the initiative , accusing the g-8 of meddling in internal affairs .
the heads of six moslem countries , including iraqi interim president ghazi al-yawer , took part in the talks .
other arab statesmen , including the egyptian and saudi arabian leaders , rejected the invitation to the summit . on thursday the group turned its attention to developmental policies during a session with african leaders .
the g-8 was to endorse an initiative to battle famine and also commit itself to training and , where necessary , equipping 75,000 peacekeepers to deal with crises in africa . they plan to discuss debt forgiveness for the world 's poorest countries and meet with african statesmen to talk about the new partnership for african development -lrb- nepad -rrb- project to introduce reforms on the african continent . the group also agreed on a proposal to speed up development of a vaccine for hiv , the virus that causes aids .
bush proposed spending € 15 million to launch it . g-9 or g-10 ? british premier tony blair , who will take over the g-8 presidency in july , said member states were in agreement that the group should be expanded to include other countries , such as china or india . the german chancellor also said he believed china would be a candidate to participate in future meetings as the country had dramatically changed over the past years . chirac expressed his regrets that unlike french officials at the last meeting in evian , the u.s. had not invited china , india or brazil to the meeting . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany-u.s. exhibit chummy ties at g-8 summit after almost 18 months of fluctuating tensions between berlin and washington , german chancellor schröder and u.s. president bush held a cordial meeting on the fringes of the g8 summit proving they were chummy once again .

from bit player to global heavyweight current affairs -pipe- 11.06.2004 g-8 summit ends with emphasis on mid east reform großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there was time for a stroll under palm trees g-8 leaders wrapped up their three-day summit at the luxury sea island resort in georgia thursday by vowing to promote democracy in the middle east , but failed to strongly back a u.s. appeal for help on iraq . the harmony and public bonhomie on display during the summit failed to mask differences between leaders of the world 's eight richest nations , in particular between french president jacques chirac and u.s. president bush . on thursday bush appealed to his heavyweight allies to do more to guide iraq 's transformation to a stable democracy , saying the " iraqi people need help " to defend themselves , rebuild their country and hold elections . although bush scored a victory at the start of the summit with the u.n. security council approving a new resolution on iraq , french president jacques chirac - one of the strongest opponents of the iraq war - rebuffed bush 's suggestion that with several nato states already engaged in iraq , the alliance 's role could be expanded there . " i wo n't hide it from you that i do n't think it is nato 's purpose to intervene in iraq , " chirac said wednesday according to the associated press .
" what 's more , i do n't feel that it would be opportune nor necessarily well understood .
i am totally reserved about this issue , " he said . however , on thursday , the last day of the summit , both bush and chirac attempted to appear more cordial at a private meeting .
bush acknowledged past differences with the french president and told reporters : " friends are able to discuss the future . " a french official also said that despite chirac 's reservations about an expanded nato role in iraq , he is open to discussion ahead of a nato summit in turkey at the end of the month . canada , france and germany also made it clear that even after passage of the resolution , they would n't send troops to the country . the leaders of britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan and russia were also unable to agree on bush 's appeal for oil-rich iraq 's debts be forgiven .
they left the issue open , only deciding that there would be " substantial " debt forgiveness . positive report card from schröder german chancellor gerhard schröder had an upbeat assessment of the meetings on sea island , saying lot of hard work was done there , despite many leaders ' dispensing with their ties and three-pieces suits during meetings .
schröder said the unanimous vote in the u.n. security council for the resolution on iraq had not only made the summit work easier , it had proved that one can " come together . " while standing by his pledge not to send german soldiers to iraq , he said germany would not stand in the way of nato doing so . schröder said one of the signals from the summit was a desire to stabilize the " very , very good " situation that the global economy finds itself in . one of the main risks , however , to economic stability is the insecurity in the middle east .

the problem has always been that they emit toxic particles that have been linked to cancer and respiratory illnesses .
however , the recent creation of so-called particle filters has made diesel engines safer for consumer use .
proponents say particle filters are the only technology currently available that can cut particle emissions by 99 percent .
but german car makers have n't been quick enough to jump on the bandwagon , and that 's beginning to create a political problem in the environmentally progressive country .
in contrast to french car makers like peugeot and renault , which have embraced particle-filter diesel engines , german companies have instead opted for internal improvements to diesel motors , with moderate successes in reducing particle emissions .
a shot in the arm german environment minister jürgen trittin of the green party has drafted legislation that would seek to give a shot in the arm to the particle filter business by providing a tax break of € 600 -lrb- $ 740 -rrb- on diesel cars with new particle filters that reduce particle emissions to a stringent limit of 2.5 milligrams per kilometer .
but major car makers like volkswagen have called for a looser limit of 12.5 milligrams .
environmental groups , the green party and factions of the social democrats are backing trittin 's calls , which they say is supported by environment ministry data claiming that 14,000 people die each year as a result of diesel particle emissions .
but the industry , led by volkswagen , has fought tooth and nail to avoid being forced to adopt the filters .
in an attempt to break the bottleneck , german chancellor gerhard schröder met earlier this week in berlin with vw ceo bernd pischetsrieder and other top european automobile industry executives to discuss future use of particle filters .
" every seventh job in germany is still dependent on the automobile industry , " said schröder 's spokesman , bela anda .
" this should not be seen as a call for measures not to be implemented .
but it should also make it clear that there are also endeavors in the industry to reach this goal through changes in the internal motors - and people should n't disregard that fact . "
after his meeting with pischetsrieder , schröder said no decision had been reached as to when particle filters would be included in cars or how they might be filtered .
instead , the chancellor and the executives of europe 's largest car maker decided to leave responsibility for the decision with brussels .
by the end of the year , the eu is expected to produce regulations for emissions norms that would serve as the blueprint for filtering technologies .
for the automobile industry , punting the responsibility to brussels represents a partial victory , as the standards proposed by germany 's trittin would likely have been much stricter .
gerd lottsiepen , of the german automobile club , said the car manufacturers were acting irresponsibly in their fight against technological limits .
" the manufacturers who are now issuing polemical attacks against these limits ... are knowingly acting against the interests of consumers .
the customers who buy cars today with yesterday 's technology will get stuck paying the piper for the manufacturer 's deep sleep .
the loss of value for cars without particle filters will be higher than average in the coming years , " lottsiepen said .
to some environmental groups , including greenpeace , the financial incentive trittin has proposed does not go far enough .
" the price difference between the systems runs between € 300 and € 1,300 , " said günter hubmann of greenpeace .
" we 're demanding that , for the best system , which is 99 percent effective , a tax break of € 999 should be given by the government .
how , exactly , that can happen still needs to be negotiated . "
discord in berlin the current debate over particle filters also threatens to spark a new row between environment minister trittin and economics minister wolfgang clement , who just recently locked horns over emissions trading standards for heavy industry .
responding to the particle filter debate , clement has said he does not want to add further pressure to car makers while the economy struggles for growth .
companies like vw say that if particle filters become obligatory , it should not happen before 2007 and that the particle emission limits should be set higher than trittin 's proposed standard .
meanwhile , the opposition parties , including the christian democratic union , have said that promoting specific or special technologies should not be the government 's responsibility .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dacia , logan , 2004 though germany leads europe in auto exports , the particle filter issue has been driven by the french .
there , car-maker peugeot introduced its first diesel car with a particle filter in 2000 , offering the additional safety at the same price as its other diesel offerings .
peugeot 's parent company , autogruppe psa , is the world 's largest self-combusting engine manufacturer , and it has widely introduced particle filters in its diesel cars .
but differences remain between germany 's leading politicians on the best way to move forward with particle filters .
and any car tax breaks proposed by the federal government must also be approved by the states that are entitled to the proceeds from the motor vehicle tax .
so far , most states are taking a reserved approach to the proposal , with ministers in some states , like bavaria , saying it has not yet been proven that the current generation of particle filters are the most effective means of reducing particle emissions from diesel motors . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de still no decision on filters for diesel cars the german government has still not made a decision on whether it will subsidize diesel-powered cars outfitted with particulate filters .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.06.2004 government split on ' clean diesel ' initiatives großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diesel cars are sparking an unfiltered debate berlin says it wants to give tax breaks for cars with clean diesel , but a divided cabinet and automobile industry have stalled the effort - at least for now . for years , diesel cars have been considered more environmentally friendly than traditional gasoline motors because they create fewer climate-damaging emissions .
the problem has always been that they emit toxic particles that have been linked to cancer and respiratory illnesses .
however , the recent creation of so-called particle filters has made diesel engines safer for consumer use .
proponents say particle filters are the only technology currently available that can cut particle emissions by 99 percent .
but german car makers have n't been quick enough to jump on the bandwagon , and that 's beginning to create a political problem in the environmentally progressive country .
in contrast to french car makers like peugeot and renault , which have embraced particle-filter diesel engines , german companies have instead opted for internal improvements to diesel motors , with moderate successes in reducing particle emissions .
a shot in the arm german environment minister jürgen trittin of the green party has drafted legislation that would seek to give a shot in the arm to the particle filter business by providing a tax break of € 600 -lrb- $ 740 -rrb- on diesel cars with new particle filters that reduce particle emissions to a stringent limit of 2.5 milligrams per kilometer .
but major car makers like volkswagen have called for a looser limit of 12.5 milligrams .
environmental groups , the green party and factions of the social democrats are backing trittin 's calls , which they say is supported by environment ministry data claiming that 14,000 people die each year as a result of diesel particle emissions .
but the industry , led by volkswagen , has fought tooth and nail to avoid being forced to adopt the filters .
in an attempt to break the bottleneck , german chancellor gerhard schröder met earlier this week in berlin with vw ceo bernd pischetsrieder and other top european automobile industry executives to discuss future use of particle filters .
" every seventh job in germany is still dependent on the automobile industry , " said schröder 's spokesman , bela anda .
" this should not be seen as a call for measures not to be implemented .
but it should also make it clear that there are also endeavors in the industry to reach this goal through changes in the internal motors - and people should n't disregard that fact . "
after his meeting with pischetsrieder , schröder said no decision had been reached as to when particle filters would be included in cars or how they might be filtered .
instead , the chancellor and the executives of europe 's largest car maker decided to leave responsibility for the decision with brussels .
by the end of the year , the eu is expected to produce regulations for emissions norms that would serve as the blueprint for filtering technologies .
for the automobile industry , punting the responsibility to brussels represents a partial victory , as the standards proposed by germany 's trittin would likely have been much stricter .
gerd lottsiepen , of the german automobile club , said the car manufacturers were acting irresponsibly in their fight against technological limits .
" the manufacturers who are now issuing polemical attacks against these limits ... are knowingly acting against the interests of consumers .
the customers who buy cars today with yesterday 's technology will get stuck paying the piper for the manufacturer 's deep sleep .
the loss of value for cars without particle filters will be higher than average in the coming years , " lottsiepen said .
to some environmental groups , including greenpeace , the financial incentive trittin has proposed does not go far enough .
" the price difference between the systems runs between € 300 and € 1,300 , " said günter hubmann of greenpeace .
" we 're demanding that , for the best system , which is 99 percent effective , a tax break of € 999 should be given by the government .
how , exactly , that can happen still needs to be negotiated . "
discord in berlin the current debate over particle filters also threatens to spark a new row between environment minister trittin and economics minister wolfgang clement , who just recently locked horns over emissions trading standards for heavy industry .
responding to the particle filter debate , clement has said he does not want to add further pressure to car makers while the economy struggles for growth .
companies like vw say that if particle filters become obligatory , it should not happen before 2007 and that the particle emission limits should be set higher than trittin 's proposed standard .
meanwhile , the opposition parties , including the christian democratic union , have said that promoting specific or special technologies should not be the government 's responsibility .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dacia , logan , 2004 though germany leads europe in auto exports , the particle filter issue has been driven by the french .
there , car-maker peugeot introduced its first diesel car with a particle filter in 2000 , offering the additional safety at the same price as its other diesel offerings .
peugeot 's parent company , autogruppe psa , is the world 's largest self-combusting engine manufacturer , and it has widely introduced particle filters in its diesel cars .
but differences remain between germany 's leading politicians on the best way to move forward with particle filters .
and any car tax breaks proposed by the federal government must also be approved by the states that are entitled to the proceeds from the motor vehicle tax .
so far , most states are taking a reserved approach to the proposal , with ministers in some states , like bavaria , saying it has not yet been proven that the current generation of particle filters are the most effective means of reducing particle emissions from diesel motors . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de still no decision on filters for diesel cars the german government has still not made a decision on whether it will subsidize diesel-powered cars outfitted with particulate filters .

during the nazi occupation , papon oversaw the bordeaux area police and signed orders that led to the deportation of 1,690 jews from 1942 to 1944 .
most of those deported perished in the auschwitz concentration camp .
papon rose through the ranks of french politics following world war ii , becoming chief of the paris police in 1958 , and later national budget minister under valerie giscard d 'estaing .
but in 1981 his wartime record was revealed when documents were unearthed showing that he had authorized the deportations .
too sick to serve papon has argued that he did n't know the fate of the jews he deported , and that he had to deport them to keep his job at the time .
despite his claims of innocence , he was convicted of crimes against humanity six years ago .
but he walked out of prison in 2002 after a court ruled him too old and sick to finish his 10-year sentence .
the decision outraged the victims of france 's wartime regime and their families .
yet the court of cassation , france 's highest court , will now study an appeal request to clear papon 's name .
this time , the judges wo n't look at the question of papon 's guilt or innocence , but rather focus on obscure legal problems that occurred during his trial .
the procedure is not an appeal as such , but a review by the court to decide whether or not a new appeal can take place .
judges are expected to rule on the matter june 16 .
papon has launched many appeals because he believes justice was fundamentally not carried out during the drawn-out legal battles which began over twenty years ago .
touching a nerve he claims not to regret his actions during the war , and says he ca n't be held partially responsible for holocaust crimes , because he was removed by several " links in the chain " from the murders that took place in concentration camps .
the question of indirect collaboration with war crimes touched a sensitive nerve in france , where the media has periodically pounced on the case , and reopened public dialogue about the extent of nazi sympathy in france during world war ii .
papon says his goal now is to clear his name for history .
but jewish groups say he should still be in prison , citing his lack of remorse .
when papon walked free in 2002 , the u.s.-based simon wiesenthal center called the release " a bad case of misplaced sympathy . "
a frequent problem france has not been the only nation faced with the problem of high officials with nazi pasts .
as recently as last month , a decision by germany 's christian democrats to include a former state premier with a history of nazi activity as a delegate to the presidential election was harshly criticized by jewish groups and left-wing politicians .
hans filbinger , 90 , was forced to resign as premier of the southern state of baden-württemberg in 1978 after it emerged that as a naval judge he shared responsibility for handing down death sentences in the waning months of nazi germany .
probably the best-known case is that of austria 's kurt waldheim .
a widely esteemed former secretary general of the united nations , he was running for president of austria in march 1986 when it came to light that he had participated in nazi atrocities during world war ii .
despite this , he served as his country 's head of state until 1992 . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de delegate 's nazi past clouds german presidential election a decision by germany 's christian democrats to include a former state premier with a nazi past as a delegate for a presidential election has been harshly criticized by jewish groups and left-wing politicians .

from bit player to global heavyweight current affairs -pipe- 11.06.2004 g-8 summit ends with emphasis on mid east reform großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there was time for a stroll under palm trees g-8 leaders wrapped up their three-day summit at the luxury sea island resort in georgia thursday by vowing to promote democracy in the middle east , but failed to strongly back a u.s. appeal for help on iraq . the harmony and public bonhomie on display during the summit failed to mask differences between leaders of the world 's eight richest nations , in particular between french president jacques chirac and u.s. president bush . on thursday bush appealed to his heavyweight allies to do more to guide iraq 's transformation to a stable democracy , saying the " iraqi people need help " to defend themselves , rebuild their country and hold elections . although bush scored a victory at the start of the summit with the u.n. security council approving a new resolution on iraq , french president jacques chirac - one of the strongest opponents of the iraq war - rebuffed bush 's suggestion that with several nato states already engaged in iraq , the alliance 's role could be expanded there . " i wo n't hide it from you that i do n't think it is nato 's purpose to intervene in iraq , " chirac said wednesday according to the associated press .
" what 's more , i do n't feel that it would be opportune nor necessarily well understood .
i am totally reserved about this issue , " he said . however , on thursday , the last day of the summit , both bush and chirac attempted to appear more cordial at a private meeting .

from bit player to global heavyweight current affairs -pipe- 11.06.2004 g-8 summit ends with emphasis on mid east reform großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there was time for a stroll under palm trees g-8 leaders wrapped up their three-day summit at the luxury sea island resort in georgia thursday by vowing to promote democracy in the middle east , but failed to strongly back a u.s. appeal for help on iraq . the harmony and public bonhomie on display during the summit failed to mask differences between leaders of the world 's eight richest nations , in particular between french president jacques chirac and u.s. president bush . on thursday bush appealed to his heavyweight allies to do more to guide iraq 's transformation to a stable democracy , saying the " iraqi people need help " to defend themselves , rebuild their country and hold elections . although bush scored a victory at the start of the summit with the u.n. security council approving a new resolution on iraq , french president jacques chirac - one of the strongest opponents of the iraq war - rebuffed bush 's suggestion that with several nato states already engaged in iraq , the alliance 's role could be expanded there . " i wo n't hide it from you that i do n't think it is nato 's purpose to intervene in iraq , " chirac said wednesday according to the associated press .
" what 's more , i do n't feel that it would be opportune nor necessarily well understood .
i am totally reserved about this issue , " he said . however , on thursday , the last day of the summit , both bush and chirac attempted to appear more cordial at a private meeting .
bush acknowledged past differences with the french president and told reporters : " friends are able to discuss the future . " a french official also said that despite chirac 's reservations about an expanded nato role in iraq , he is open to discussion ahead of a nato summit in turkey at the end of the month . canada , france and germany also made it clear that even after passage of the resolution , they would n't send troops to the country . the leaders of britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan and russia were also unable to agree on bush 's appeal for oil-rich iraq 's debts be forgiven .

during the nazi occupation , papon oversaw the bordeaux area police and signed orders that led to the deportation of 1,690 jews from 1942 to 1944 .
most of those deported perished in the auschwitz concentration camp .
papon rose through the ranks of french politics following world war ii , becoming chief of the paris police in 1958 , and later national budget minister under valerie giscard d 'estaing .
but in 1981 his wartime record was revealed when documents were unearthed showing that he had authorized the deportations .
too sick to serve papon has argued that he did n't know the fate of the jews he deported , and that he had to deport them to keep his job at the time .
despite his claims of innocence , he was convicted of crimes against humanity six years ago .
but he walked out of prison in 2002 after a court ruled him too old and sick to finish his 10-year sentence .
the decision outraged the victims of france 's wartime regime and their families .
yet the court of cassation , france 's highest court , will now study an appeal request to clear papon 's name .
this time , the judges wo n't look at the question of papon 's guilt or innocence , but rather focus on obscure legal problems that occurred during his trial .
the procedure is not an appeal as such , but a review by the court to decide whether or not a new appeal can take place .
judges are expected to rule on the matter june 16 .
papon has launched many appeals because he believes justice was fundamentally not carried out during the drawn-out legal battles which began over twenty years ago .
touching a nerve he claims not to regret his actions during the war , and says he ca n't be held partially responsible for holocaust crimes , because he was removed by several " links in the chain " from the murders that took place in concentration camps .
the question of indirect collaboration with war crimes touched a sensitive nerve in france , where the media has periodically pounced on the case , and reopened public dialogue about the extent of nazi sympathy in france during world war ii .
papon says his goal now is to clear his name for history .
but jewish groups say he should still be in prison , citing his lack of remorse .
when papon walked free in 2002 , the u.s.-based simon wiesenthal center called the release " a bad case of misplaced sympathy . "
a frequent problem france has not been the only nation faced with the problem of high officials with nazi pasts .
as recently as last month , a decision by germany 's christian democrats to include a former state premier with a history of nazi activity as a delegate to the presidential election was harshly criticized by jewish groups and left-wing politicians .
hans filbinger , 90 , was forced to resign as premier of the southern state of baden-württemberg in 1978 after it emerged that as a naval judge he shared responsibility for handing down death sentences in the waning months of nazi germany .
probably the best-known case is that of austria 's kurt waldheim .
a widely esteemed former secretary general of the united nations , he was running for president of austria in march 1986 when it came to light that he had participated in nazi atrocities during world war ii .
despite this , he served as his country 's head of state until 1992 . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de delegate 's nazi past clouds german presidential election a decision by germany 's christian democrats to include a former state premier with a nazi past as a delegate for a presidential election has been harshly criticized by jewish groups and left-wing politicians .

news of the passing of a new un resolution set a positive tone as the summit began .
president bush in his closing press conference gave a robust defence of the g8 's agreement on middle east reform .
" there was some concern when the initiative was first proposed , " he said , " that this was america trying to make the world look like america .
it 's not going to happen .
" i fully understand that a free society in the middle east is going to reflect the culture and traditions of the people in that country , not america . "
' no excuse ' the dominance of iraq and the middle east pushed other issues to the sidelines .
obasanjo stressed the need for common prosperity jamie drummond of the non-government group , debt aids trade africa , expressed the frustrations of those who want the g8 to focus on the developing world .
" africa is the poorest region of the earth , " he said .
" it is the most marginalised , most economically needy and we all recognise we should be doing far more .
no doubt if there were n't a situation in iraq , it would be getting more attention , more resources and more political will .
" but having said all of that , that 's no excuse not to do all the things they should be doing . "
more than lunch on thursday , african leaders finally did get their say - meeting g8 leaders for a working lunch .
compliments to the chef : chirac liked the food nigeria 's president olusegun obasanjo did his best to stress the positive .
" did we come just for lunch , all the way from africa , and nothing else ? " he asked reporters .
" of course not ! "
in fact as well as lunch , african leaders got progress on peacekeeping , with a g8 commitment to train another 75,000 peacekeepers .
also a more concerted international approach to tackling hiv / aids , and an extension of the process on debt relief for the world 's poorest countries .
president obasanjo made it clear it was a necessary investment .
" the issue is not the issue of one group begging the other , the issue is not the issue of one condescending to the other .
the issue is of mutual interest , mutual security , common prosperity . "
hail to the chef but despite everyone 's efforts at harmony , there was continuing tension between the us and france .
as president george w bush happily looked ahead to a possible expanded role for nato in iraq , french president jacques chirac said he did n't think it was nato 's purpose to intervene .
president chirac also made it clear that france only supported the new un resolution after us concessions .
but when the two leaders emerged from their bilateral talks on thursday , they 'd finally found common ground .
" i 'd like to thank once again the president for his hospitality , " he said through a translator .
" he was kind enough to mention french cuisine .
i can tell you over the last few days , the cuisine here in america was certainly on a par with french cuisine and i ask the president to convey my thanks to the chef . "
president bush , never one to miss an opportunity , immediately chipped in : " he particularly liked the cheeseburger he had yesterday . "
so the future , it seems , may be in hamburger diplomacy .

news of the passing of a new un resolution set a positive tone as the summit began .
president bush in his closing press conference gave a robust defence of the g8 's agreement on middle east reform .
" there was some concern when the initiative was first proposed , " he said , " that this was america trying to make the world look like america .
it 's not going to happen .
" i fully understand that a free society in the middle east is going to reflect the culture and traditions of the people in that country , not america . "
' no excuse ' the dominance of iraq and the middle east pushed other issues to the sidelines .
obasanjo stressed the need for common prosperity jamie drummond of the non-government group , debt aids trade africa , expressed the frustrations of those who want the g8 to focus on the developing world .
" africa is the poorest region of the earth , " he said .
" it is the most marginalised , most economically needy and we all recognise we should be doing far more .
no doubt if there were n't a situation in iraq , it would be getting more attention , more resources and more political will .
" but having said all of that , that 's no excuse not to do all the things they should be doing . "
more than lunch on thursday , african leaders finally did get their say - meeting g8 leaders for a working lunch .
compliments to the chef : chirac liked the food nigeria 's president olusegun obasanjo did his best to stress the positive .
" did we come just for lunch , all the way from africa , and nothing else ? " he asked reporters .
" of course not ! "
in fact as well as lunch , african leaders got progress on peacekeeping , with a g8 commitment to train another 75,000 peacekeepers .
also a more concerted international approach to tackling hiv / aids , and an extension of the process on debt relief for the world 's poorest countries .
president obasanjo made it clear it was a necessary investment .
" the issue is not the issue of one group begging the other , the issue is not the issue of one condescending to the other .
the issue is of mutual interest , mutual security , common prosperity . "
hail to the chef but despite everyone 's efforts at harmony , there was continuing tension between the us and france .
as president george w bush happily looked ahead to a possible expanded role for nato in iraq , french president jacques chirac said he did n't think it was nato 's purpose to intervene .
president chirac also made it clear that france only supported the new un resolution after us concessions .
but when the two leaders emerged from their bilateral talks on thursday , they 'd finally found common ground .
" i 'd like to thank once again the president for his hospitality , " he said through a translator .
" he was kind enough to mention french cuisine .
i can tell you over the last few days , the cuisine here in america was certainly on a par with french cuisine and i ask the president to convey my thanks to the chef . "
president bush , never one to miss an opportunity , immediately chipped in : " he particularly liked the cheeseburger he had yesterday . "
so the future , it seems , may be in hamburger diplomacy .

the bletchley park story is part of the first of three development phases at the national codes centre 's new exhibition complex , called block b. the new display tells the story of wartime code-breaking at bletchley .
it includes the restored hut 8 , in which alan turing and his team cracked the germans ' vital enigma code .
enigma was the backbone of german military and intelligence communications , and turing 's cracking of it in 1939 is seen as one of the great intellectual achievements of the 20th century .
the development at block b also includes an exhibition telling the story of code breaking at the stately home , which historians say shortened the war by two years .
it 's a great day for bletchley park volunteers who so wanted to make this day happen christine large this includes an interactive display of a german u-boat enigma station and an enigma machine .
also on display for the first time at the official opening by the duke of kent was a piece of an original colossus code breaking machine , which provided information essential to the planning of the d-day landings .
the colossus cracked the lorenz code , which was used by hitler to communicate with his generals , admirals and air marshals about troop movements .
speaking after the opening , christine large , trust director , said : " it 's a great day for bletchley park volunteers who so wanted to make this day happen and for the world war ii veterans who saw the park really come to life .
" today 's success is in large measure due to the supporters who had the faith to make early financial contributions . "
