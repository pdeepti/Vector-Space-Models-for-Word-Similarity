a plan to reform germany 's state-backed pension system has passed a vote in parliament .
the reform aims to stabilize the system in the long term in the face of a rapidly ageing population . germany 's younger generation will have to start taking more responsibility for their retirement , since after today 's vote the country 's state-backed pensions will not be as generous in the future .
the german parliament , or bundestag , passed the reform plan as expected with a necessary majority of social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- and green party members , 302 in total .
the opposition cast 291 votes against the plan and one spd member abstained .
the reform plan does not need to go to the upper house , the bundesrat , for approval .
the plan , introduced last year as part of chancellor gerhard schröder 's agenda 2010 spate of labor market and welfare reforms , changes the formula that determines how pension benefit levels are set and tries to limit the growing rising contribution rates employees pay into the system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulla schmidt according to ulla schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- , the minister for health and social security , a state pension alone in the future will no longer be enough to maintain living standards employees had before they retired .
overview a central element of the reform takes into consideration germany 's graying population and seeks to slow down annual rises in pension benefits .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pensioners will have to get by with less .
low birth rates and increased longevity have led to critical pressures on the system , a pay-as-you-go plan based on tax-paying workers supporting retirees through compulsory contributions .
as the ratio of working-age germans to pensioners narrows , expected to fall from two taxpayers per retiree to one over the next decades , the system is becoming increasingly unsustainable .
in the future , pension benefit rates will rise more slowly than overall income levels .
pensioners will have to forego an increase in benefits this year .
next year , as the formula comes into effect , modest increases of .38 percent in western germany and .61 percent in the eastern part of the country are expected .
obligatory contributions to the state system , which are paid jointly by employees and employers , are now set at 19.5 percent of wages .
according to the government , these contributions will stay under 20 percent until 2020 and will remain under 22 percent until 2030 .
currently , pension benefits stand at about 53 percent of the average wage of the retiree during his or her working life , less social security contributions .
according to estimated government revenues , pension benefits will fall to 46 percent of the average wage by 2020 and down to around 43 percent by 2030 .
but in order to quell a possible rebellion by some left-leaning spd members , the government has introduced a clause that requires future governments to keep pension payments from falling below the 43 percent mark in the future .
the reform plan makes this possible by increasing federal contributions to the system from tax revenues or raising the retirement age from 65 to 67 .
the parliament will decide on the retirement age increase in 2008 at the earliest .
fuzzy math opposition politicians accused the government coalition of using numbers that do not add up .
according to horst seehofer , the social affairs point man for the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , setting a benefits floor at 46 percent while limiting the contributions ceiling to 22 percent by 2030 is not possible .
maintaining the 46 percent rate would require an increase of contribution levels to 24 percent , or a retirement age of 70 .
" otherwise , these aims make no sense , " he told reporters , accusing the government 's reform of being only a prelude to further cuts .
politicians from the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- also had sharp words for the benefits floor .
heinrich kolb , social affairs expert for the fdp , criticized the 46 percent number as being unrealistic .
" those who do n't want to go under the 46 percent mark ca n't be committed to maintaining the system 's sustainability , " he told the associated press . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parliament freezes pensions german pensioners will get less money next year after parliament voted to cap pensions and require the elderly to pay for nursing insurance .

the german government wants to lock away particularly violent criminals and sex offenders with a law that would allow them to be held indefinitely in preventive detention even after they have been sentenced to prison . when the partly-charred body of eight-year-old julia was found on a smoldering wood pile near giessen in the state of hesse in july 2001 , the brutality of the crime shook the nation . german chancellor gerhard schröder said at the time about the culprit : " lock him away - and forever . "
exactly three weeks ago , the 35-year-old culprit thorsten volk was sentenced for the murder and sexual abuse of julia . though julia 's tormentor and murderer might be a free man someday , the same may not be the case for future offenders considered too dangerous to be walking around freely , if chancellor schröder 's government has its way . protecting society from madmen on wednesday , the schröder 's cabinet agreed on a legal blueprint that will enable lawmakers to incarcerate accused individuals before trial on the assumption that their release would compromise the security of society . the practice , known as " preventive detention , " can in future also be used in the case of criminals who have served their sentence in jail but are still deemed too risky to be allowed to move freely outside prison walls .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte zypries , german justice minister german justice minister brigitte zypries -lrb- photo -rrb- said that the planned legislation would serve to protect society from dangerous criminals as far as possible .
preventive legislation , as opposed to a normal prison sentence , can be applied for an indefinite period of time . " ultimate means in penal law " zypries added that the planned law would also allow judges to recommend preventive detention even if the danger posed by the criminal is only confirmed after his sentencing , such as in the case of a sexual offender , whose earlier series of rape come to light after he 's already received a jail term .
" with it , it 's possible that one could remain in preventive detention till the end of his life , " zypries said . up to now , the provision of preventive detention in germany , had to be contained in the verdict or at least be mentioned as a caveat , though exceptions have been made in four cases . at the same time the justice minister stressed that the practice of preventive detention had to be subject to stringent checks and requirements since it dealt with " imprisonment without guilt " and " absolute measures . "
zypries added that it should only be applied as a last resort . also applicable to teenagers the proposed law governing preventive detention is a reaction by schröder 's government to a february ruling by germany 's constitutional court that overturned similar state laws , saying that only the federal government had the right to implement such laws .
in an additional ruling , the judges agreed that unlimited preventive detention was indeed in accordance with the constitution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inmates in prison the german government has also made clear that preventive detention could only be applied in the case of particularly dangerous criminals who have been sentenced to at least four years in prison and whose victims ' lives have been physically threatened . it would be applicable to culprits who were deemed " risky " even after undergoing psychiatric treatment and to delinquents between 18 and 21 years as well .

the german government wants to lock away particularly violent criminals and sex offenders with a law that would allow them to be held indefinitely in preventive detention even after they have been sentenced to prison . when the partly-charred body of eight-year-old julia was found on a smoldering wood pile near giessen in the state of hesse in july 2001 , the brutality of the crime shook the nation . german chancellor gerhard schröder said at the time about the culprit : " lock him away - and forever . "
exactly three weeks ago , the 35-year-old culprit thorsten volk was sentenced for the murder and sexual abuse of julia . though julia 's tormentor and murderer might be a free man someday , the same may not be the case for future offenders considered too dangerous to be walking around freely , if chancellor schröder 's government has its way . protecting society from madmen on wednesday , the schröder 's cabinet agreed on a legal blueprint that will enable lawmakers to incarcerate accused individuals before trial on the assumption that their release would compromise the security of society . the practice , known as " preventive detention , " can in future also be used in the case of criminals who have served their sentence in jail but are still deemed too risky to be allowed to move freely outside prison walls .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte zypries , german justice minister german justice minister brigitte zypries -lrb- photo -rrb- said that the planned legislation would serve to protect society from dangerous criminals as far as possible .
preventive legislation , as opposed to a normal prison sentence , can be applied for an indefinite period of time . " ultimate means in penal law " zypries added that the planned law would also allow judges to recommend preventive detention even if the danger posed by the criminal is only confirmed after his sentencing , such as in the case of a sexual offender , whose earlier series of rape come to light after he 's already received a jail term .
" with it , it 's possible that one could remain in preventive detention till the end of his life , " zypries said . up to now , the provision of preventive detention in germany , had to be contained in the verdict or at least be mentioned as a caveat , though exceptions have been made in four cases . at the same time the justice minister stressed that the practice of preventive detention had to be subject to stringent checks and requirements since it dealt with " imprisonment without guilt " and " absolute measures . "
zypries added that it should only be applied as a last resort . also applicable to teenagers the proposed law governing preventive detention is a reaction by schröder 's government to a february ruling by germany 's constitutional court that overturned similar state laws , saying that only the federal government had the right to implement such laws .
in an additional ruling , the judges agreed that unlimited preventive detention was indeed in accordance with the constitution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inmates in prison the german government has also made clear that preventive detention could only be applied in the case of particularly dangerous criminals who have been sentenced to at least four years in prison and whose victims ' lives have been physically threatened . it would be applicable to culprits who were deemed " risky " even after undergoing psychiatric treatment and to delinquents between 18 and 21 years as well .
the decision to implement preventive detention would also have to be reviewed every two years . critics slam proposed legislation the proposed legislation , which is expected to become law in summer , has its share of critics . one of them is christian ströbele , a parliamentarian of the green party , the junior partner in the ruling government coalition .
" the result is n't acceptable in this current form , " ströbele told the süddeutsche zeitung daily .
ströbele slammed the fact that the law could in future be applied to young adults aged 18 and above in particular , as well as for criminals who would be sentenced for the first time . even erwin huber , head of the bavarian state chancellery and member of the opposition conservative christian social union , rejected the draft legislation as " unsatisfactory " and added that it was n't clear why preventive detention could only be applied in the case of a minimum sentencing of four years .

thursday morning rush hour in spain 's capital came to a halt when several bombs went off in a commuter train station , killing 182 people just days ahead of national elections . powerful explosions rocked several madrid train stations during morning rush hour .
news reports said two bombs went off in a high-speed commuter train arriving at the busy downtown atocha station at 7:30 a.m. local time .
blasts also ripped through two other stops - santa eugenia and el pozo - on a southeastern commuter line leading to atocha , the news agency efe reported .
spanish national radio quoted witnesses saying they saw people lying on the ground and train cars ripped open .
people in tears and bloodied could be seen running away from the station in panic .
the spanish interior ministry has reported at least 182 people dead and more than 900 injured .
hospitals appealed for people to donate blood .
make-shift emergency rooms were set up in neighboring sports centers , and taxis and buses were turned into ambulances to transport the severely wounded to nearby emergency rooms .
the country 's rail authority renfe has halted all commuter traffic into the capital .
politicians for the major parties have called off all campaigning ahead of the weekend 's general election .
the work of eta ?
so far there has been no claim of responsibility , but police were quick to point their finger at the basque separatist group eta .
security offices throughout the country have been on high alert for separatist violence ahead of the country 's general elections on sunday .
spain 's conservative ruling party , which has built up its campaign on a hard-line stance against eta , is currently leading in the polls .
in the last several weeks , the government has made several high-profile arrests of eta members .
" this is a collective killing by the criminal band which is eta , " government spokesman eduardo zaplana told cadena ser radio station .
spain 's interior ministry also said tests showed the explosives used in the attacks were a kind of dynamite normally used by eta .
aznar 's office said the explosives were a material called titadine , a kind of compressed dynamite found in a van-bomb intercepted last month as it headed for madrid , according to an associated press report .
on feb .
29 , police intercepted a madrid-bound van packed with more than 500 kilos -lrb- 1,100 pounds -rrb- of explosives traced back to the basque separatists ; two men were arrested on charges of terrorism .
on christmas eve , police thwarted an attempted bombing at chamartin , another madrid rail station , and arrested two suspected eta members .
the leader of the banned basque separatist party batasuna , however , denied that its armed group eta was behind the coordinated bombings . speaking on radio popular arnold otegi blamed " arab resistance " for the attacks , the worst in spain 's history .
history of terror bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wreckage of a spanish intercity train destroyed by an explosion lies on the track at atocha railway station in madrid spain , thursday , march 11 , 2004 .
the european union and the united states have listed eta , which stands for basque homeland and freedom , as a terrorist organization .
the group has committed itself to an armed fight for an independent basque state , comprising the basque regions of north-western spain as well as parts of southern france .

spanish prime minister jose maria aznar has vowed to catch those responsible for the madrid train bombings thursday morning that killed 190 and injured more than 1,240 .
the government is blaming the separatist group eta . ten bombs in total exploded during thursday morning 's commute in the worst terrorist attack in spain 's history .
" march 11 , 2004 has taken its place in the history of infamy , " prime minster aznar said in a national address .
he said those who set off the bombs would be hunted down and punished .
he and other government ministries , as well as much of the country 's news media , have pointed the finger at the basque separatist group eta .
" we will defeat them -lrb- eta -rrb- , " aznar said .
" we will succeed in finishing off the terrorist band , with the strength of the rule of law and with the unity of all spaniards . "
" terrorist band " is a term the spanish government regularly uses to refer to eta .
spain 's interior ministry said tests showed the explosives used in the attacks were a kind of dynamite normally used by eta .
aznar 's office said the explosives were a material called titadine , a kind of compressed dynamite found in a van-bomb intercepted last month as it headed for madrid , according to an associated press report .
on feb .
29 , police intercepted a madrid-bound van packed with more than 500 kilos -lrb- 1,100 pounds -rrb- of explosives traced back to the basque separatists ; two men were arrested on charges of terrorism .
on christmas eve , police thwarted an attempted bombing at chamartin , another madrid rail station , and arrested two suspected eta members .
however , the government is also not ruling out that islamic extremists could be involved in the attacks .
in the town of alcala de henares east of madrid a stolen truck was found that contained detonators and an audio tape with verses from the koran in arabic , according to interior minister angel acebes . he said all possibilities were being investigated , although eta remains the chief suspect . eta denies involvement a political group close to eta , the banned basque separatist party batasuna , denied that it was responsible for the attacks .
in the past , eta attacks have been preceded by warnings from the group .
officials received no such warning before thursday 's explosions .
speaking on radio popular arnold otegi blamed " arab resistance " for the attacks , the worst in spain 's history .
" spain maintains occupation forces in iraq and we should not forget that it had a responsibility for the war in iraq , " he said .
eta , which stands for basque homeland and freedom , was thought by many to be weakened and on its way out after the string of arrests and seizures of weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the group , which police believe to number only several dozen hard-core militants , has been responsible for some 800 deaths since it began its armed fight for basque independence in 1968 .
most of eta 's attacks have been assassinations or small-scale attacks .

spanish prime minister jose maria aznar has vowed to catch those responsible for the madrid train bombings thursday morning that killed 190 and injured more than 1,240 .
the government is blaming the separatist group eta . ten bombs in total exploded during thursday morning 's commute in the worst terrorist attack in spain 's history .
" march 11 , 2004 has taken its place in the history of infamy , " prime minster aznar said in a national address .
he said those who set off the bombs would be hunted down and punished .
he and other government ministries , as well as much of the country 's news media , have pointed the finger at the basque separatist group eta .
" we will defeat them -lrb- eta -rrb- , " aznar said .
" we will succeed in finishing off the terrorist band , with the strength of the rule of law and with the unity of all spaniards . "
" terrorist band " is a term the spanish government regularly uses to refer to eta .
spain 's interior ministry said tests showed the explosives used in the attacks were a kind of dynamite normally used by eta .
aznar 's office said the explosives were a material called titadine , a kind of compressed dynamite found in a van-bomb intercepted last month as it headed for madrid , according to an associated press report .
on feb .
29 , police intercepted a madrid-bound van packed with more than 500 kilos -lrb- 1,100 pounds -rrb- of explosives traced back to the basque separatists ; two men were arrested on charges of terrorism .
on christmas eve , police thwarted an attempted bombing at chamartin , another madrid rail station , and arrested two suspected eta members .
however , the government is also not ruling out that islamic extremists could be involved in the attacks .
in the town of alcala de henares east of madrid a stolen truck was found that contained detonators and an audio tape with verses from the koran in arabic , according to interior minister angel acebes . he said all possibilities were being investigated , although eta remains the chief suspect . eta denies involvement a political group close to eta , the banned basque separatist party batasuna , denied that it was responsible for the attacks .
in the past , eta attacks have been preceded by warnings from the group .
officials received no such warning before thursday 's explosions .
speaking on radio popular arnold otegi blamed " arab resistance " for the attacks , the worst in spain 's history .
" spain maintains occupation forces in iraq and we should not forget that it had a responsibility for the war in iraq , " he said .
eta , which stands for basque homeland and freedom , was thought by many to be weakened and on its way out after the string of arrests and seizures of weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the group , which police believe to number only several dozen hard-core militants , has been responsible for some 800 deaths since it began its armed fight for basque independence in 1968 .

now that europe 's central banks have agreed on how much gold they can sell over the next five years , germany is considering using its profits to stop top researchers from leaving the country . he may have the support of german chancellor gerhard schröder , but ernst welteke , head of germany 's central bank , the bundesbank , is having a hard time selling his idea to parliament .
in january , welteke proposed setting up a research foundation to distribute profits made from the sale of 20 percent of the bundesbank 's gold reserves .
he reasoned this would go a long way in appeasing top german researchers , who complain that a lack of state funding is forcing them to look for jobs abroad .
but welteke 's idea met with disapproval from the parliamentary budget committee on wednesday .
" i did n't hear from anyone who was in favor of welteke 's suggestion , " said deputy finance minister karl diller .
back to the drawing board bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ernst welteke , president of the bundesbank .
following the parliamentary committee session , welteke admitted that much more work needed to be done to convince politicians of his proposal 's merit .
but that will be difficult .
his plan would necessitate changing german law , which stipulates that any profits from gold sales be used to reduce the national deficit . that is a top priority now , as germany is set to breach eu budget deficit rules for a third year in a row in 2004 .
welteke would also have to amend his proposal to fall in line with a new gold deal agreed by europe 's central banks on monday .
the deal commits the european central bank , and the banks of every eu nation except the uk and denmark , to cap gold sales at 500 metric tons a year for the next five years .
the overall limit for the accord is 2,500 tons , up from 2,000 tons under the previous 1999 agreement .
" gold will remain an important element of global monetary reserves , " said the joint statement of the 14 central banks and the ecb .
gold operates as a safe haven for investors in troubled times .
while the trend in recent years has seen central banks shedding gold in favor of hard currencies , gold is currently in demand because of the weak u.s. dollar .
national gold reserves are a holdover from the bretton woods accord of 1944 , in which the value of currencies was pegged to gold .
with a total value of around € 46 billion , germany is the world 's second largest holder of gold reserves behind the u.s. before the new deal was struck , the bundesbank had requested an option to sell 600 tons .
that will now have to be scaled down in line with the new limits .
finding resonance in france the german proposal to use gold profits to stem the flow of its best researchers abroad has found favor in neighboring france , which faces growing protest by top scientists .
on tuesday , 2,000 scientists stopped their administrative work at laboratories to demand more state support for research .
following the protest action , france 's research minister claudie haigneré suggested raising cash either through the sale of gold or more privatizations .

now that europe 's central banks have agreed on how much gold they can sell over the next five years , germany is considering using its profits to stop top researchers from leaving the country . he may have the support of german chancellor gerhard schröder , but ernst welteke , head of germany 's central bank , the bundesbank , is having a hard time selling his idea to parliament .
in january , welteke proposed setting up a research foundation to distribute profits made from the sale of 20 percent of the bundesbank 's gold reserves .
he reasoned this would go a long way in appeasing top german researchers , who complain that a lack of state funding is forcing them to look for jobs abroad .
but welteke 's idea met with disapproval from the parliamentary budget committee on wednesday .
" i did n't hear from anyone who was in favor of welteke 's suggestion , " said deputy finance minister karl diller .
back to the drawing board bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ernst welteke , president of the bundesbank .
following the parliamentary committee session , welteke admitted that much more work needed to be done to convince politicians of his proposal 's merit .
but that will be difficult .
his plan would necessitate changing german law , which stipulates that any profits from gold sales be used to reduce the national deficit . that is a top priority now , as germany is set to breach eu budget deficit rules for a third year in a row in 2004 .
welteke would also have to amend his proposal to fall in line with a new gold deal agreed by europe 's central banks on monday .
the deal commits the european central bank , and the banks of every eu nation except the uk and denmark , to cap gold sales at 500 metric tons a year for the next five years .
the overall limit for the accord is 2,500 tons , up from 2,000 tons under the previous 1999 agreement .
" gold will remain an important element of global monetary reserves , " said the joint statement of the 14 central banks and the ecb .
gold operates as a safe haven for investors in troubled times .
while the trend in recent years has seen central banks shedding gold in favor of hard currencies , gold is currently in demand because of the weak u.s. dollar .
national gold reserves are a holdover from the bretton woods accord of 1944 , in which the value of currencies was pegged to gold .
with a total value of around € 46 billion , germany is the world 's second largest holder of gold reserves behind the u.s. before the new deal was struck , the bundesbank had requested an option to sell 600 tons .

spanish prime minister jose maria aznar has vowed to catch those responsible for the madrid train bombings thursday morning that killed 190 and injured more than 1,240 .
the government is blaming the separatist group eta . ten bombs in total exploded during thursday morning 's commute in the worst terrorist attack in spain 's history .
" march 11 , 2004 has taken its place in the history of infamy , " prime minster aznar said in a national address .
he said those who set off the bombs would be hunted down and punished .
he and other government ministries , as well as much of the country 's news media , have pointed the finger at the basque separatist group eta .
" we will defeat them -lrb- eta -rrb- , " aznar said .
" we will succeed in finishing off the terrorist band , with the strength of the rule of law and with the unity of all spaniards . "
" terrorist band " is a term the spanish government regularly uses to refer to eta .
spain 's interior ministry said tests showed the explosives used in the attacks were a kind of dynamite normally used by eta .
aznar 's office said the explosives were a material called titadine , a kind of compressed dynamite found in a van-bomb intercepted last month as it headed for madrid , according to an associated press report .
on feb .
29 , police intercepted a madrid-bound van packed with more than 500 kilos -lrb- 1,100 pounds -rrb- of explosives traced back to the basque separatists ; two men were arrested on charges of terrorism .
on christmas eve , police thwarted an attempted bombing at chamartin , another madrid rail station , and arrested two suspected eta members .
however , the government is also not ruling out that islamic extremists could be involved in the attacks .
in the town of alcala de henares east of madrid a stolen truck was found that contained detonators and an audio tape with verses from the koran in arabic , according to interior minister angel acebes . he said all possibilities were being investigated , although eta remains the chief suspect . eta denies involvement a political group close to eta , the banned basque separatist party batasuna , denied that it was responsible for the attacks .
in the past , eta attacks have been preceded by warnings from the group .
officials received no such warning before thursday 's explosions .
speaking on radio popular arnold otegi blamed " arab resistance " for the attacks , the worst in spain 's history .
" spain maintains occupation forces in iraq and we should not forget that it had a responsibility for the war in iraq , " he said .
eta , which stands for basque homeland and freedom , was thought by many to be weakened and on its way out after the string of arrests and seizures of weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the group , which police believe to number only several dozen hard-core militants , has been responsible for some 800 deaths since it began its armed fight for basque independence in 1968 .
most of eta 's attacks have been assassinations or small-scale attacks .
if the thursday bombings are its work , it represents a remarkable increase in scale , ruthlessness and coordination .
" this is a step ahead of previous attacks by eta .
it could be a splinter group , it could be hardliners trying to extract as many casualties as they could , " paul wilkinson , a terrorism expert at the university of st. andrews , told reuters .
remote control the bombings are being described as the worst in europe since the 1988 bombing of pan-am flight 103 , which was blown out of the sky over the town of lockerbie , scotland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : debris lies next to a destroyed train car after the bombs exploded in the atocha railway station in madrid .
thursday 's powerful explosions , which authorities say appear to have been set off by remote control , rocked several madrid train stations during morning rush hour .
news reports said two bombs went off in a high-speed commuter train arriving at the busy downtown atocha station at 7:30 a.m. local time .
blasts also ripped through two other stops - santa eugenia and el pozo - the news agency efe reported .
" people started to scream and run , some bumping into each other , " juani fernandez , who was on the platform at atocha when the bombs went off , told the associated press .
spanish national radio quoted witnesses saying they saw people lying on the ground and train cars ripped open .
people in tears and bloodied could be seen running away from the station in panic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medics carry a woman injured by an explosion .
the latest count is at least 190 people dead and more than 1,240 injured .
hospitals appealed for people to donate blood .
make-shift emergency rooms were set up in neighboring sports centers , and taxis and buses were turned into ambulances to transport the severely wounded to nearby emergency rooms .
the country 's rail authority renfe has halted all commuter traffic into the capital .
politicians for the major parties have called off all campaigning ahead of the weekend 's general election .
three days of national mourning have been declared .

" head-on , " the much talked-about german film which won the berlin film festival 's highest award , opens in theaters in germany on thursday .
the movie gained notoriety when its female star 's porn past came to light . " head-on " by director fatih akin has seen some turbulent times in the weeks before its official release .
it was first hailed by the media for putting german film back on the map when it won the coveted golden bear at last month 's berlinale , being the first german film to take top honors there in 18 years .
barely a week later , the mass-circulation tabloid bild revealed that the film 's female star , 23-year-old sibel kekilli , had made pornographic films in the past .
critics might argue that either way the film has benefited from the wave of publicity , but now german viewers will get the chance to cut through the sensationalism and make up their own minds about " head-on " when it opens across germany on thursday .
sex , drugs and violence the story tells of the painful emancipation of a young german-turkish woman played by kekilli , who lands in a psychiatric clinic after a suicide attempt .

"
" head-on , " the much talked-about german film which won the berlin film festival 's highest award , opens in theaters in germany on thursday .
the movie gained notoriety when its female star 's porn past came to light . " head-on " by director fatih akin has seen some turbulent times in the weeks before its official release .
it was first hailed by the media for putting german film back on the map when it won the coveted golden bear at last month 's berlinale , being the first german film to take top honors there in 18 years .
barely a week later , the mass-circulation tabloid bild revealed that the film 's female star , 23-year-old sibel kekilli , had made pornographic films in the past .
critics might argue that either way the film has benefited from the wave of publicity , but now german viewers will get the chance to cut through the sensationalism and make up their own minds about " head-on " when it opens across germany on thursday .
sex , drugs and violence the story tells of the painful emancipation of a young german-turkish woman played by kekilli , who lands in a psychiatric clinic after a suicide attempt .
there she meets a turkish-german alcoholic punk cahit , played by birol ünel -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , who is twice her age .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish-born actors sibel kekilli , left , and birol ünel anxious to escape the clutches of her conservative family , sibel convinces cahit to enter into a marriage of convenience with her .
their wedding marks the beginning of a life of freedom for sibel , who 's eager to try out parties , drugs and lots of sex .
as sibel and cahit live it up and indulge in separate sexual affairs , the two eventually fall in love .
the love story ends , however , when cahit kills one of sibel 's lovers in a jealous rage .
controversy among the turks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fatih akin , german director of turkish origin hamburg-based director akin -lrb- photo -rrb- , 31 , is the son of turkish immigrants .
he is aware that the german-turkish love story is bound to spark controversy among the more conservative members of germany 's 2.5-million-strong turkish community . even before the film has been released to the wider public , the director has been accused of exploiting the problems facing turkish women in germany in his film .
" there 's already a discussion on the internet calling for a boycott of the film , " akin said in an interview with deutsche welle .
but the director , whose has in the past explored the issue of young turks in germany straddling two cultures , says the release of the film will straighten out things .
he has won critical acclaim for his previous films , " short sharp shock " , " solino " and " in july . "
" those who 've seen the film , whether it 's been poor people or rich , whether conservatives or left-leaning people , women or men - all were pretty convinced so far , " akin said .

a plan to reform germany 's state-backed pension system has passed a vote in parliament .
the reform aims to stabilize the system in the long term in the face of a rapidly ageing population . germany 's younger generation will have to start taking more responsibility for their retirement , since after today 's vote the country 's state-backed pensions will not be as generous in the future .
the german parliament , or bundestag , passed the reform plan as expected with a necessary majority of social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- and green party members , 302 in total .
the opposition cast 291 votes against the plan and one spd member abstained .
the reform plan does not need to go to the upper house , the bundesrat , for approval .
the plan , introduced last year as part of chancellor gerhard schröder 's agenda 2010 spate of labor market and welfare reforms , changes the formula that determines how pension benefit levels are set and tries to limit the growing rising contribution rates employees pay into the system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulla schmidt according to ulla schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- , the minister for health and social security , a state pension alone in the future will no longer be enough to maintain living standards employees had before they retired .
overview a central element of the reform takes into consideration germany 's graying population and seeks to slow down annual rises in pension benefits .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pensioners will have to get by with less .
low birth rates and increased longevity have led to critical pressures on the system , a pay-as-you-go plan based on tax-paying workers supporting retirees through compulsory contributions .
as the ratio of working-age germans to pensioners narrows , expected to fall from two taxpayers per retiree to one over the next decades , the system is becoming increasingly unsustainable .
in the future , pension benefit rates will rise more slowly than overall income levels .
pensioners will have to forego an increase in benefits this year .
next year , as the formula comes into effect , modest increases of .38 percent in western germany and .61 percent in the eastern part of the country are expected .
obligatory contributions to the state system , which are paid jointly by employees and employers , are now set at 19.5 percent of wages .
according to the government , these contributions will stay under 20 percent until 2020 and will remain under 22 percent until 2030 .
currently , pension benefits stand at about 53 percent of the average wage of the retiree during his or her working life , less social security contributions .
according to estimated government revenues , pension benefits will fall to 46 percent of the average wage by 2020 and down to around 43 percent by 2030 .
but in order to quell a possible rebellion by some left-leaning spd members , the government has introduced a clause that requires future governments to keep pension payments from falling below the 43 percent mark in the future .
the reform plan makes this possible by increasing federal contributions to the system from tax revenues or raising the retirement age from 65 to 67 .
the parliament will decide on the retirement age increase in 2008 at the earliest .
fuzzy math opposition politicians accused the government coalition of using numbers that do not add up .
according to horst seehofer , the social affairs point man for the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , setting a benefits floor at 46 percent while limiting the contributions ceiling to 22 percent by 2030 is not possible .
maintaining the 46 percent rate would require an increase of contribution levels to 24 percent , or a retirement age of 70 .
" otherwise , these aims make no sense , " he told reporters , accusing the government 's reform of being only a prelude to further cuts .
politicians from the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- also had sharp words for the benefits floor .
heinrich kolb , social affairs expert for the fdp , criticized the 46 percent number as being unrealistic .
" those who do n't want to go under the 46 percent mark ca n't be committed to maintaining the system 's sustainability , " he told the associated press . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parliament freezes pensions german pensioners will get less money next year after parliament voted to cap pensions and require the elderly to pay for nursing insurance .

"
" head-on , " the much talked-about german film which won the berlin film festival 's highest award , opens in theaters in germany on thursday .
the movie gained notoriety when its female star 's porn past came to light . " head-on " by director fatih akin has seen some turbulent times in the weeks before its official release .
it was first hailed by the media for putting german film back on the map when it won the coveted golden bear at last month 's berlinale , being the first german film to take top honors there in 18 years .
barely a week later , the mass-circulation tabloid bild revealed that the film 's female star , 23-year-old sibel kekilli , had made pornographic films in the past .
critics might argue that either way the film has benefited from the wave of publicity , but now german viewers will get the chance to cut through the sensationalism and make up their own minds about " head-on " when it opens across germany on thursday .
sex , drugs and violence the story tells of the painful emancipation of a young german-turkish woman played by kekilli , who lands in a psychiatric clinic after a suicide attempt .
there she meets a turkish-german alcoholic punk cahit , played by birol ünel -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , who is twice her age .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish-born actors sibel kekilli , left , and birol ünel anxious to escape the clutches of her conservative family , sibel convinces cahit to enter into a marriage of convenience with her .
their wedding marks the beginning of a life of freedom for sibel , who 's eager to try out parties , drugs and lots of sex .
as sibel and cahit live it up and indulge in separate sexual affairs , the two eventually fall in love .
the love story ends , however , when cahit kills one of sibel 's lovers in a jealous rage .
controversy among the turks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fatih akin , german director of turkish origin hamburg-based director akin -lrb- photo -rrb- , 31 , is the son of turkish immigrants .
he is aware that the german-turkish love story is bound to spark controversy among the more conservative members of germany 's 2.5-million-strong turkish community . even before the film has been released to the wider public , the director has been accused of exploiting the problems facing turkish women in germany in his film .
" there 's already a discussion on the internet calling for a boycott of the film , " akin said in an interview with deutsche welle .
but the director , whose has in the past explored the issue of young turks in germany straddling two cultures , says the release of the film will straighten out things .
he has won critical acclaim for his previous films , " short sharp shock " , " solino " and " in july . "
" those who 've seen the film , whether it 's been poor people or rich , whether conservatives or left-leaning people , women or men - all were pretty convinced so far , " akin said .

spain 's conservative ruling party , which has built up its campaign on a hard-line stance against eta , is currently leading in the polls .
in the last several weeks , the government has made several high-profile arrests of eta members .
" this is a collective killing by the criminal band which is eta , " government spokesman eduardo zaplana told cadena ser radio station .
spain 's interior ministry also said tests showed the explosives used in the attacks were a kind of dynamite normally used by eta .

the german government wants to lock away particularly violent criminals and sex offenders with a law that would allow them to be held indefinitely in preventive detention even after they have been sentenced to prison . when the partly-charred body of eight-year-old julia was found on a smoldering wood pile near giessen in the state of hesse in july 2001 , the brutality of the crime shook the nation . german chancellor gerhard schröder said at the time about the culprit : " lock him away - and forever . "
exactly three weeks ago , the 35-year-old culprit thorsten volk was sentenced for the murder and sexual abuse of julia . though julia 's tormentor and murderer might be a free man someday , the same may not be the case for future offenders considered too dangerous to be walking around freely , if chancellor schröder 's government has its way . protecting society from madmen on wednesday , the schröder 's cabinet agreed on a legal blueprint that will enable lawmakers to incarcerate accused individuals before trial on the assumption that their release would compromise the security of society . the practice , known as " preventive detention , " can in future also be used in the case of criminals who have served their sentence in jail but are still deemed too risky to be allowed to move freely outside prison walls .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte zypries , german justice minister german justice minister brigitte zypries -lrb- photo -rrb- said that the planned legislation would serve to protect society from dangerous criminals as far as possible .
preventive legislation , as opposed to a normal prison sentence , can be applied for an indefinite period of time . " ultimate means in penal law " zypries added that the planned law would also allow judges to recommend preventive detention even if the danger posed by the criminal is only confirmed after his sentencing , such as in the case of a sexual offender , whose earlier series of rape come to light after he 's already received a jail term .
" with it , it 's possible that one could remain in preventive detention till the end of his life , " zypries said . up to now , the provision of preventive detention in germany , had to be contained in the verdict or at least be mentioned as a caveat , though exceptions have been made in four cases . at the same time the justice minister stressed that the practice of preventive detention had to be subject to stringent checks and requirements since it dealt with " imprisonment without guilt " and " absolute measures . "
zypries added that it should only be applied as a last resort . also applicable to teenagers the proposed law governing preventive detention is a reaction by schröder 's government to a february ruling by germany 's constitutional court that overturned similar state laws , saying that only the federal government had the right to implement such laws .
in an additional ruling , the judges agreed that unlimited preventive detention was indeed in accordance with the constitution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inmates in prison the german government has also made clear that preventive detention could only be applied in the case of particularly dangerous criminals who have been sentenced to at least four years in prison and whose victims ' lives have been physically threatened . it would be applicable to culprits who were deemed " risky " even after undergoing psychiatric treatment and to delinquents between 18 and 21 years as well .
the decision to implement preventive detention would also have to be reviewed every two years . critics slam proposed legislation the proposed legislation , which is expected to become law in summer , has its share of critics . one of them is christian ströbele , a parliamentarian of the green party , the junior partner in the ruling government coalition .
" the result is n't acceptable in this current form , " ströbele told the süddeutsche zeitung daily .
ströbele slammed the fact that the law could in future be applied to young adults aged 18 and above in particular , as well as for criminals who would be sentenced for the first time . even erwin huber , head of the bavarian state chancellery and member of the opposition conservative christian social union , rejected the draft legislation as " unsatisfactory " and added that it was n't clear why preventive detention could only be applied in the case of a minimum sentencing of four years .

the german government wants to lock away particularly violent criminals and sex offenders with a law that would allow them to be held indefinitely in preventive detention even after they have been sentenced to prison . when the partly-charred body of eight-year-old julia was found on a smoldering wood pile near giessen in the state of hesse in july 2001 , the brutality of the crime shook the nation . german chancellor gerhard schröder said at the time about the culprit : " lock him away - and forever . "
exactly three weeks ago , the 35-year-old culprit thorsten volk was sentenced for the murder and sexual abuse of julia . though julia 's tormentor and murderer might be a free man someday , the same may not be the case for future offenders considered too dangerous to be walking around freely , if chancellor schröder 's government has its way . protecting society from madmen on wednesday , the schröder 's cabinet agreed on a legal blueprint that will enable lawmakers to incarcerate accused individuals before trial on the assumption that their release would compromise the security of society . the practice , known as " preventive detention , " can in future also be used in the case of criminals who have served their sentence in jail but are still deemed too risky to be allowed to move freely outside prison walls .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte zypries , german justice minister german justice minister brigitte zypries -lrb- photo -rrb- said that the planned legislation would serve to protect society from dangerous criminals as far as possible .
preventive legislation , as opposed to a normal prison sentence , can be applied for an indefinite period of time . " ultimate means in penal law " zypries added that the planned law would also allow judges to recommend preventive detention even if the danger posed by the criminal is only confirmed after his sentencing , such as in the case of a sexual offender , whose earlier series of rape come to light after he 's already received a jail term .
" with it , it 's possible that one could remain in preventive detention till the end of his life , " zypries said . up to now , the provision of preventive detention in germany , had to be contained in the verdict or at least be mentioned as a caveat , though exceptions have been made in four cases . at the same time the justice minister stressed that the practice of preventive detention had to be subject to stringent checks and requirements since it dealt with " imprisonment without guilt " and " absolute measures . "
zypries added that it should only be applied as a last resort . also applicable to teenagers the proposed law governing preventive detention is a reaction by schröder 's government to a february ruling by germany 's constitutional court that overturned similar state laws , saying that only the federal government had the right to implement such laws .
in an additional ruling , the judges agreed that unlimited preventive detention was indeed in accordance with the constitution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inmates in prison the german government has also made clear that preventive detention could only be applied in the case of particularly dangerous criminals who have been sentenced to at least four years in prison and whose victims ' lives have been physically threatened . it would be applicable to culprits who were deemed " risky " even after undergoing psychiatric treatment and to delinquents between 18 and 21 years as well .
the decision to implement preventive detention would also have to be reviewed every two years . critics slam proposed legislation the proposed legislation , which is expected to become law in summer , has its share of critics . one of them is christian ströbele , a parliamentarian of the green party , the junior partner in the ruling government coalition .

a plan to reform germany 's state-backed pension system has passed a vote in parliament .
the reform aims to stabilize the system in the long term in the face of a rapidly ageing population . germany 's younger generation will have to start taking more responsibility for their retirement , since after today 's vote the country 's state-backed pensions will not be as generous in the future .
the german parliament , or bundestag , passed the reform plan as expected with a necessary majority of social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- and green party members , 302 in total .
the opposition cast 291 votes against the plan and one spd member abstained .
the reform plan does not need to go to the upper house , the bundesrat , for approval .
the plan , introduced last year as part of chancellor gerhard schröder 's agenda 2010 spate of labor market and welfare reforms , changes the formula that determines how pension benefit levels are set and tries to limit the growing rising contribution rates employees pay into the system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulla schmidt according to ulla schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- , the minister for health and social security , a state pension alone in the future will no longer be enough to maintain living standards employees had before they retired .
overview a central element of the reform takes into consideration germany 's graying population and seeks to slow down annual rises in pension benefits .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pensioners will have to get by with less .
low birth rates and increased longevity have led to critical pressures on the system , a pay-as-you-go plan based on tax-paying workers supporting retirees through compulsory contributions .
as the ratio of working-age germans to pensioners narrows , expected to fall from two taxpayers per retiree to one over the next decades , the system is becoming increasingly unsustainable .
in the future , pension benefit rates will rise more slowly than overall income levels .
pensioners will have to forego an increase in benefits this year .
next year , as the formula comes into effect , modest increases of .38 percent in western germany and .61 percent in the eastern part of the country are expected .
obligatory contributions to the state system , which are paid jointly by employees and employers , are now set at 19.5 percent of wages .
according to the government , these contributions will stay under 20 percent until 2020 and will remain under 22 percent until 2030 .
currently , pension benefits stand at about 53 percent of the average wage of the retiree during his or her working life , less social security contributions .
according to estimated government revenues , pension benefits will fall to 46 percent of the average wage by 2020 and down to around 43 percent by 2030 .
but in order to quell a possible rebellion by some left-leaning spd members , the government has introduced a clause that requires future governments to keep pension payments from falling below the 43 percent mark in the future .
the reform plan makes this possible by increasing federal contributions to the system from tax revenues or raising the retirement age from 65 to 67 .
the parliament will decide on the retirement age increase in 2008 at the earliest .
fuzzy math opposition politicians accused the government coalition of using numbers that do not add up .
according to horst seehofer , the social affairs point man for the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , setting a benefits floor at 46 percent while limiting the contributions ceiling to 22 percent by 2030 is not possible .
maintaining the 46 percent rate would require an increase of contribution levels to 24 percent , or a retirement age of 70 .
" otherwise , these aims make no sense , " he told reporters , accusing the government 's reform of being only a prelude to further cuts .
politicians from the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- also had sharp words for the benefits floor .
heinrich kolb , social affairs expert for the fdp , criticized the 46 percent number as being unrealistic .
" those who do n't want to go under the 46 percent mark ca n't be committed to maintaining the system 's sustainability , " he told the associated press . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parliament freezes pensions german pensioners will get less money next year after parliament voted to cap pensions and require the elderly to pay for nursing insurance .

"
" head-on , " the much talked-about german film which won the berlin film festival 's highest award , opens in theaters in germany on thursday .
the movie gained notoriety when its female star 's porn past came to light . " head-on " by director fatih akin has seen some turbulent times in the weeks before its official release .
it was first hailed by the media for putting german film back on the map when it won the coveted golden bear at last month 's berlinale , being the first german film to take top honors there in 18 years .
barely a week later , the mass-circulation tabloid bild revealed that the film 's female star , 23-year-old sibel kekilli , had made pornographic films in the past .
critics might argue that either way the film has benefited from the wave of publicity , but now german viewers will get the chance to cut through the sensationalism and make up their own minds about " head-on " when it opens across germany on thursday .
sex , drugs and violence the story tells of the painful emancipation of a young german-turkish woman played by kekilli , who lands in a psychiatric clinic after a suicide attempt .
there she meets a turkish-german alcoholic punk cahit , played by birol ünel -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , who is twice her age .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish-born actors sibel kekilli , left , and birol ünel anxious to escape the clutches of her conservative family , sibel convinces cahit to enter into a marriage of convenience with her .

" head-on , " the much talked-about german film which won the berlin film festival 's highest award , opens in theaters in germany on thursday .
the movie gained notoriety when its female star 's porn past came to light . " head-on " by director fatih akin has seen some turbulent times in the weeks before its official release .
it was first hailed by the media for putting german film back on the map when it won the coveted golden bear at last month 's berlinale , being the first german film to take top honors there in 18 years .
barely a week later , the mass-circulation tabloid bild revealed that the film 's female star , 23-year-old sibel kekilli , had made pornographic films in the past .
critics might argue that either way the film has benefited from the wave of publicity , but now german viewers will get the chance to cut through the sensationalism and make up their own minds about " head-on " when it opens across germany on thursday .
sex , drugs and violence the story tells of the painful emancipation of a young german-turkish woman played by kekilli , who lands in a psychiatric clinic after a suicide attempt .
there she meets a turkish-german alcoholic punk cahit , played by birol ünel -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , who is twice her age .

now that europe 's central banks have agreed on how much gold they can sell over the next five years , germany is considering using its profits to stop top researchers from leaving the country . he may have the support of german chancellor gerhard schröder , but ernst welteke , head of germany 's central bank , the bundesbank , is having a hard time selling his idea to parliament .
in january , welteke proposed setting up a research foundation to distribute profits made from the sale of 20 percent of the bundesbank 's gold reserves .
he reasoned this would go a long way in appeasing top german researchers , who complain that a lack of state funding is forcing them to look for jobs abroad .
but welteke 's idea met with disapproval from the parliamentary budget committee on wednesday .
" i did n't hear from anyone who was in favor of welteke 's suggestion , " said deputy finance minister karl diller .
back to the drawing board bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ernst welteke , president of the bundesbank .
following the parliamentary committee session , welteke admitted that much more work needed to be done to convince politicians of his proposal 's merit .
but that will be difficult .
his plan would necessitate changing german law , which stipulates that any profits from gold sales be used to reduce the national deficit . that is a top priority now , as germany is set to breach eu budget deficit rules for a third year in a row in 2004 .
welteke would also have to amend his proposal to fall in line with a new gold deal agreed by europe 's central banks on monday .
the deal commits the european central bank , and the banks of every eu nation except the uk and denmark , to cap gold sales at 500 metric tons a year for the next five years .
the overall limit for the accord is 2,500 tons , up from 2,000 tons under the previous 1999 agreement .
" gold will remain an important element of global monetary reserves , " said the joint statement of the 14 central banks and the ecb .
gold operates as a safe haven for investors in troubled times .
while the trend in recent years has seen central banks shedding gold in favor of hard currencies , gold is currently in demand because of the weak u.s. dollar .
national gold reserves are a holdover from the bretton woods accord of 1944 , in which the value of currencies was pegged to gold .
with a total value of around € 46 billion , germany is the world 's second largest holder of gold reserves behind the u.s. before the new deal was struck , the bundesbank had requested an option to sell 600 tons .
that will now have to be scaled down in line with the new limits .
finding resonance in france the german proposal to use gold profits to stem the flow of its best researchers abroad has found favor in neighboring france , which faces growing protest by top scientists .
on tuesday , 2,000 scientists stopped their administrative work at laboratories to demand more state support for research .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 11.03.2004 spanish pm vows to catch bombers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a day in the " history of infamy , " said aznar .
spanish prime minister jose maria aznar has vowed to catch those responsible for the madrid train bombings thursday morning that killed 190 and injured more than 1,240 .
the government is blaming the separatist group eta . ten bombs in total exploded during thursday morning 's commute in the worst terrorist attack in spain 's history .
" march 11 , 2004 has taken its place in the history of infamy , " prime minster aznar said in a national address .
he said those who set off the bombs would be hunted down and punished .
he and other government ministries , as well as much of the country 's news media , have pointed the finger at the basque separatist group eta .
" we will defeat them -lrb- eta -rrb- , " aznar said .
" we will succeed in finishing off the terrorist band , with the strength of the rule of law and with the unity of all spaniards . "
" terrorist band " is a term the spanish government regularly uses to refer to eta .
spain 's interior ministry said tests showed the explosives used in the attacks were a kind of dynamite normally used by eta .
aznar 's office said the explosives were a material called titadine , a kind of compressed dynamite found in a van-bomb intercepted last month as it headed for madrid , according to an associated press report .
on feb .
29 , police intercepted a madrid-bound van packed with more than 500 kilos -lrb- 1,100 pounds -rrb- of explosives traced back to the basque separatists ; two men were arrested on charges of terrorism .
on christmas eve , police thwarted an attempted bombing at chamartin , another madrid rail station , and arrested two suspected eta members .
however , the government is also not ruling out that islamic extremists could be involved in the attacks .
in the town of alcala de henares east of madrid a stolen truck was found that contained detonators and an audio tape with verses from the koran in arabic , according to interior minister angel acebes . he said all possibilities were being investigated , although eta remains the chief suspect . eta denies involvement a political group close to eta , the banned basque separatist party batasuna , denied that it was responsible for the attacks .
in the past , eta attacks have been preceded by warnings from the group .
officials received no such warning before thursday 's explosions .
speaking on radio popular arnold otegi blamed " arab resistance " for the attacks , the worst in spain 's history .
" spain maintains occupation forces in iraq and we should not forget that it had a responsibility for the war in iraq , " he said .
eta , which stands for basque homeland and freedom , was thought by many to be weakened and on its way out after the string of arrests and seizures of weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the group , which police believe to number only several dozen hard-core militants , has been responsible for some 800 deaths since it began its armed fight for basque independence in 1968 .
most of eta 's attacks have been assassinations or small-scale attacks .
if the thursday bombings are its work , it represents a remarkable increase in scale , ruthlessness and coordination .
" this is a step ahead of previous attacks by eta .
it could be a splinter group , it could be hardliners trying to extract as many casualties as they could , " paul wilkinson , a terrorism expert at the university of st. andrews , told reuters .
remote control the bombings are being described as the worst in europe since the 1988 bombing of pan-am flight 103 , which was blown out of the sky over the town of lockerbie , scotland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : debris lies next to a destroyed train car after the bombs exploded in the atocha railway station in madrid .
thursday 's powerful explosions , which authorities say appear to have been set off by remote control , rocked several madrid train stations during morning rush hour .

spanish prime minister jose maria aznar has vowed to catch those responsible for the madrid train bombings thursday morning that killed 190 and injured more than 1,240 .
the government is blaming the separatist group eta . ten bombs in total exploded during thursday morning 's commute in the worst terrorist attack in spain 's history .
" march 11 , 2004 has taken its place in the history of infamy , " prime minster aznar said in a national address .
he said those who set off the bombs would be hunted down and punished .
he and other government ministries , as well as much of the country 's news media , have pointed the finger at the basque separatist group eta .
" we will defeat them -lrb- eta -rrb- , " aznar said .
" we will succeed in finishing off the terrorist band , with the strength of the rule of law and with the unity of all spaniards . "
" terrorist band " is a term the spanish government regularly uses to refer to eta .
spain 's interior ministry said tests showed the explosives used in the attacks were a kind of dynamite normally used by eta .
aznar 's office said the explosives were a material called titadine , a kind of compressed dynamite found in a van-bomb intercepted last month as it headed for madrid , according to an associated press report .

"
" head-on , " the much talked-about german film which won the berlin film festival 's highest award , opens in theaters in germany on thursday .
the movie gained notoriety when its female star 's porn past came to light . " head-on " by director fatih akin has seen some turbulent times in the weeks before its official release .
it was first hailed by the media for putting german film back on the map when it won the coveted golden bear at last month 's berlinale , being the first german film to take top honors there in 18 years .
barely a week later , the mass-circulation tabloid bild revealed that the film 's female star , 23-year-old sibel kekilli , had made pornographic films in the past .
critics might argue that either way the film has benefited from the wave of publicity , but now german viewers will get the chance to cut through the sensationalism and make up their own minds about " head-on " when it opens across germany on thursday .
sex , drugs and violence the story tells of the painful emancipation of a young german-turkish woman played by kekilli , who lands in a psychiatric clinic after a suicide attempt .
there she meets a turkish-german alcoholic punk cahit , played by birol ünel -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , who is twice her age .

their wedding marks the beginning of a life of freedom for sibel , who 's eager to try out parties , drugs and lots of sex .
as sibel and cahit live it up and indulge in separate sexual affairs , the two eventually fall in love .
the love story ends , however , when cahit kills one of sibel 's lovers in a jealous rage .
controversy among the turks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fatih akin , german director of turkish origin hamburg-based director akin -lrb- photo -rrb- , 31 , is the son of turkish immigrants .
he is aware that the german-turkish love story is bound to spark controversy among the more conservative members of germany 's 2.5-million-strong turkish community . even before the film has been released to the wider public , the director has been accused of exploiting the problems facing turkish women in germany in his film .
" there 's already a discussion on the internet calling for a boycott of the film , " akin said in an interview with deutsche welle .
but the director , whose has in the past explored the issue of young turks in germany straddling two cultures , says the release of the film will straighten out things .
he has won critical acclaim for his previous films , " short sharp shock " , " solino " and " in july . "
" those who 've seen the film , whether it 's been poor people or rich , whether conservatives or left-leaning people , women or men - all were pretty convinced so far , " akin said .

now that europe 's central banks have agreed on how much gold they can sell over the next five years , germany is considering using its profits to stop top researchers from leaving the country . he may have the support of german chancellor gerhard schröder , but ernst welteke , head of germany 's central bank , the bundesbank , is having a hard time selling his idea to parliament .
in january , welteke proposed setting up a research foundation to distribute profits made from the sale of 20 percent of the bundesbank 's gold reserves .
he reasoned this would go a long way in appeasing top german researchers , who complain that a lack of state funding is forcing them to look for jobs abroad .
but welteke 's idea met with disapproval from the parliamentary budget committee on wednesday .
" i did n't hear from anyone who was in favor of welteke 's suggestion , " said deputy finance minister karl diller .
back to the drawing board bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ernst welteke , president of the bundesbank .
following the parliamentary committee session , welteke admitted that much more work needed to be done to convince politicians of his proposal 's merit .
but that will be difficult .
his plan would necessitate changing german law , which stipulates that any profits from gold sales be used to reduce the national deficit . that is a top priority now , as germany is set to breach eu budget deficit rules for a third year in a row in 2004 .
welteke would also have to amend his proposal to fall in line with a new gold deal agreed by europe 's central banks on monday .
the deal commits the european central bank , and the banks of every eu nation except the uk and denmark , to cap gold sales at 500 metric tons a year for the next five years .
the overall limit for the accord is 2,500 tons , up from 2,000 tons under the previous 1999 agreement .
" gold will remain an important element of global monetary reserves , " said the joint statement of the 14 central banks and the ecb .
gold operates as a safe haven for investors in troubled times .
while the trend in recent years has seen central banks shedding gold in favor of hard currencies , gold is currently in demand because of the weak u.s. dollar .
national gold reserves are a holdover from the bretton woods accord of 1944 , in which the value of currencies was pegged to gold .
with a total value of around € 46 billion , germany is the world 's second largest holder of gold reserves behind the u.s. before the new deal was struck , the bundesbank had requested an option to sell 600 tons .
that will now have to be scaled down in line with the new limits .
finding resonance in france the german proposal to use gold profits to stem the flow of its best researchers abroad has found favor in neighboring france , which faces growing protest by top scientists .
on tuesday , 2,000 scientists stopped their administrative work at laboratories to demand more state support for research .

now that europe 's central banks have agreed on how much gold they can sell over the next five years , germany is considering using its profits to stop top researchers from leaving the country . he may have the support of german chancellor gerhard schröder , but ernst welteke , head of germany 's central bank , the bundesbank , is having a hard time selling his idea to parliament .
in january , welteke proposed setting up a research foundation to distribute profits made from the sale of 20 percent of the bundesbank 's gold reserves .
he reasoned this would go a long way in appeasing top german researchers , who complain that a lack of state funding is forcing them to look for jobs abroad .
but welteke 's idea met with disapproval from the parliamentary budget committee on wednesday .

his plan would necessitate changing german law , which stipulates that any profits from gold sales be used to reduce the national deficit . that is a top priority now , as germany is set to breach eu budget deficit rules for a third year in a row in 2004 .
welteke would also have to amend his proposal to fall in line with a new gold deal agreed by europe 's central banks on monday .
the deal commits the european central bank , and the banks of every eu nation except the uk and denmark , to cap gold sales at 500 metric tons a year for the next five years .
the overall limit for the accord is 2,500 tons , up from 2,000 tons under the previous 1999 agreement .

"
" head-on , " the much talked-about german film which won the berlin film festival 's highest award , opens in theaters in germany on thursday .
the movie gained notoriety when its female star 's porn past came to light . " head-on " by director fatih akin has seen some turbulent times in the weeks before its official release .
it was first hailed by the media for putting german film back on the map when it won the coveted golden bear at last month 's berlinale , being the first german film to take top honors there in 18 years .
barely a week later , the mass-circulation tabloid bild revealed that the film 's female star , 23-year-old sibel kekilli , had made pornographic films in the past .
critics might argue that either way the film has benefited from the wave of publicity , but now german viewers will get the chance to cut through the sensationalism and make up their own minds about " head-on " when it opens across germany on thursday .
sex , drugs and violence the story tells of the painful emancipation of a young german-turkish woman played by kekilli , who lands in a psychiatric clinic after a suicide attempt .
there she meets a turkish-german alcoholic punk cahit , played by birol ünel -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , who is twice her age .

their wedding marks the beginning of a life of freedom for sibel , who 's eager to try out parties , drugs and lots of sex .
as sibel and cahit live it up and indulge in separate sexual affairs , the two eventually fall in love .
the love story ends , however , when cahit kills one of sibel 's lovers in a jealous rage .
controversy among the turks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fatih akin , german director of turkish origin hamburg-based director akin -lrb- photo -rrb- , 31 , is the son of turkish immigrants .
he is aware that the german-turkish love story is bound to spark controversy among the more conservative members of germany 's 2.5-million-strong turkish community . even before the film has been released to the wider public , the director has been accused of exploiting the problems facing turkish women in germany in his film .
" there 's already a discussion on the internet calling for a boycott of the film , " akin said in an interview with deutsche welle .
but the director , whose has in the past explored the issue of young turks in germany straddling two cultures , says the release of the film will straighten out things .
he has won critical acclaim for his previous films , " short sharp shock " , " solino " and " in july . "
" those who 've seen the film , whether it 's been poor people or rich , whether conservatives or left-leaning people , women or men - all were pretty convinced so far , " akin said .

spanish prime minister jose maria aznar has vowed to catch those responsible for the madrid train bombings thursday morning that killed 190 and injured more than 1,240 .
the government is blaming the separatist group eta . ten bombs in total exploded during thursday morning 's commute in the worst terrorist attack in spain 's history .
" march 11 , 2004 has taken its place in the history of infamy , " prime minster aznar said in a national address .
he said those who set off the bombs would be hunted down and punished .
he and other government ministries , as well as much of the country 's news media , have pointed the finger at the basque separatist group eta .
" we will defeat them -lrb- eta -rrb- , " aznar said .
" we will succeed in finishing off the terrorist band , with the strength of the rule of law and with the unity of all spaniards . "
" terrorist band " is a term the spanish government regularly uses to refer to eta .
spain 's interior ministry said tests showed the explosives used in the attacks were a kind of dynamite normally used by eta .
aznar 's office said the explosives were a material called titadine , a kind of compressed dynamite found in a van-bomb intercepted last month as it headed for madrid , according to an associated press report .
on feb .
29 , police intercepted a madrid-bound van packed with more than 500 kilos -lrb- 1,100 pounds -rrb- of explosives traced back to the basque separatists ; two men were arrested on charges of terrorism .
on christmas eve , police thwarted an attempted bombing at chamartin , another madrid rail station , and arrested two suspected eta members .
however , the government is also not ruling out that islamic extremists could be involved in the attacks .
in the town of alcala de henares east of madrid a stolen truck was found that contained detonators and an audio tape with verses from the koran in arabic , according to interior minister angel acebes . he said all possibilities were being investigated , although eta remains the chief suspect . eta denies involvement a political group close to eta , the banned basque separatist party batasuna , denied that it was responsible for the attacks .
in the past , eta attacks have been preceded by warnings from the group .
officials received no such warning before thursday 's explosions .
speaking on radio popular arnold otegi blamed " arab resistance " for the attacks , the worst in spain 's history .
" spain maintains occupation forces in iraq and we should not forget that it had a responsibility for the war in iraq , " he said .
eta , which stands for basque homeland and freedom , was thought by many to be weakened and on its way out after the string of arrests and seizures of weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the group , which police believe to number only several dozen hard-core militants , has been responsible for some 800 deaths since it began its armed fight for basque independence in 1968 .
most of eta 's attacks have been assassinations or small-scale attacks .
if the thursday bombings are its work , it represents a remarkable increase in scale , ruthlessness and coordination .
" this is a step ahead of previous attacks by eta .
it could be a splinter group , it could be hardliners trying to extract as many casualties as they could , " paul wilkinson , a terrorism expert at the university of st. andrews , told reuters .
remote control the bombings are being described as the worst in europe since the 1988 bombing of pan-am flight 103 , which was blown out of the sky over the town of lockerbie , scotland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : debris lies next to a destroyed train car after the bombs exploded in the atocha railway station in madrid .
thursday 's powerful explosions , which authorities say appear to have been set off by remote control , rocked several madrid train stations during morning rush hour .
news reports said two bombs went off in a high-speed commuter train arriving at the busy downtown atocha station at 7:30 a.m. local time .
blasts also ripped through two other stops - santa eugenia and el pozo - the news agency efe reported .
" people started to scream and run , some bumping into each other , " juani fernandez , who was on the platform at atocha when the bombs went off , told the associated press .
spanish national radio quoted witnesses saying they saw people lying on the ground and train cars ripped open .
people in tears and bloodied could be seen running away from the station in panic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medics carry a woman injured by an explosion .
the latest count is at least 190 people dead and more than 1,240 injured .
hospitals appealed for people to donate blood .
make-shift emergency rooms were set up in neighboring sports centers , and taxis and buses were turned into ambulances to transport the severely wounded to nearby emergency rooms .
the country 's rail authority renfe has halted all commuter traffic into the capital .
politicians for the major parties have called off all campaigning ahead of the weekend 's general election .
three days of national mourning have been declared .
world condemnation world leaders were quick to condemn the bombings and sympathy poured in from capitals around the globe .
" there is a general election due in spain on sunday .
what happened today is a declaration of war on democracy , " said european parliament president pat cox in the legislature in strasbourg , france .
in germany , chancellor gerhard schröder said he was " deeply dismayed by this inhuman attack . "
he offered to send specialists from the country 's federal criminal office to spain .
u.s. president george w. bush spoke by telephone to the spanish prime minister .
" i appreciate so very much the spanish government 's fight against terror , their resolute stand against terrorist organizations like the eta , and the united states stands with them , " he told reporters .
the u.s. , britain and russia emphasized that the bombs underlined the need for the international community to toughen its resolve against terrorism .
demonstrations spanish prime minister jose maria aznar called for nationwide protests against the basque separatist group eta in the wake of deadly train bombings that left 190 dead and more than 1,240 wounded .
" the government asks spaniards to demonstrate tomorrow in the streets of all of spain .
demonstrations have been called in all spanish cities tomorrow at 7 p.m. under the slogan ' with the victims , with constitution and for the defeat of terrorism ' , " aznar said .
bildunterschrift : students during a spontaneous protest against eta .

spanish prime minister jose maria aznar has vowed to catch those responsible for the madrid train bombings thursday morning that killed 190 and injured more than 1,240 .
the government is blaming the separatist group eta . ten bombs in total exploded during thursday morning 's commute in the worst terrorist attack in spain 's history .
" march 11 , 2004 has taken its place in the history of infamy , " prime minster aznar said in a national address .
he said those who set off the bombs would be hunted down and punished .
he and other government ministries , as well as much of the country 's news media , have pointed the finger at the basque separatist group eta .
" we will defeat them -lrb- eta -rrb- , " aznar said .
" we will succeed in finishing off the terrorist band , with the strength of the rule of law and with the unity of all spaniards . "
" terrorist band " is a term the spanish government regularly uses to refer to eta .
spain 's interior ministry said tests showed the explosives used in the attacks were a kind of dynamite normally used by eta .
aznar 's office said the explosives were a material called titadine , a kind of compressed dynamite found in a van-bomb intercepted last month as it headed for madrid , according to an associated press report .
on feb .
29 , police intercepted a madrid-bound van packed with more than 500 kilos -lrb- 1,100 pounds -rrb- of explosives traced back to the basque separatists ; two men were arrested on charges of terrorism .
on christmas eve , police thwarted an attempted bombing at chamartin , another madrid rail station , and arrested two suspected eta members .
however , the government is also not ruling out that islamic extremists could be involved in the attacks .
in the town of alcala de henares east of madrid a stolen truck was found that contained detonators and an audio tape with verses from the koran in arabic , according to interior minister angel acebes . he said all possibilities were being investigated , although eta remains the chief suspect . eta denies involvement a political group close to eta , the banned basque separatist party batasuna , denied that it was responsible for the attacks .
in the past , eta attacks have been preceded by warnings from the group .
officials received no such warning before thursday 's explosions .
speaking on radio popular arnold otegi blamed " arab resistance " for the attacks , the worst in spain 's history .
" spain maintains occupation forces in iraq and we should not forget that it had a responsibility for the war in iraq , " he said .
eta , which stands for basque homeland and freedom , was thought by many to be weakened and on its way out after the string of arrests and seizures of weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the group , which police believe to number only several dozen hard-core militants , has been responsible for some 800 deaths since it began its armed fight for basque independence in 1968 .
most of eta 's attacks have been assassinations or small-scale attacks .
if the thursday bombings are its work , it represents a remarkable increase in scale , ruthlessness and coordination .
" this is a step ahead of previous attacks by eta .
it could be a splinter group , it could be hardliners trying to extract as many casualties as they could , " paul wilkinson , a terrorism expert at the university of st. andrews , told reuters .
remote control the bombings are being described as the worst in europe since the 1988 bombing of pan-am flight 103 , which was blown out of the sky over the town of lockerbie , scotland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : debris lies next to a destroyed train car after the bombs exploded in the atocha railway station in madrid .

the german government wants to lock away particularly violent criminals and sex offenders with a law that would allow them to be held indefinitely in preventive detention even after they have been sentenced to prison . when the partly-charred body of eight-year-old julia was found on a smoldering wood pile near giessen in the state of hesse in july 2001 , the brutality of the crime shook the nation . german chancellor gerhard schröder said at the time about the culprit : " lock him away - and forever . "
exactly three weeks ago , the 35-year-old culprit thorsten volk was sentenced for the murder and sexual abuse of julia . though julia 's tormentor and murderer might be a free man someday , the same may not be the case for future offenders considered too dangerous to be walking around freely , if chancellor schröder 's government has its way . protecting society from madmen on wednesday , the schröder 's cabinet agreed on a legal blueprint that will enable lawmakers to incarcerate accused individuals before trial on the assumption that their release would compromise the security of society . the practice , known as " preventive detention , " can in future also be used in the case of criminals who have served their sentence in jail but are still deemed too risky to be allowed to move freely outside prison walls .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte zypries , german justice minister german justice minister brigitte zypries -lrb- photo -rrb- said that the planned legislation would serve to protect society from dangerous criminals as far as possible .
preventive legislation , as opposed to a normal prison sentence , can be applied for an indefinite period of time . " ultimate means in penal law " zypries added that the planned law would also allow judges to recommend preventive detention even if the danger posed by the criminal is only confirmed after his sentencing , such as in the case of a sexual offender , whose earlier series of rape come to light after he 's already received a jail term .
" with it , it 's possible that one could remain in preventive detention till the end of his life , " zypries said . up to now , the provision of preventive detention in germany , had to be contained in the verdict or at least be mentioned as a caveat , though exceptions have been made in four cases . at the same time the justice minister stressed that the practice of preventive detention had to be subject to stringent checks and requirements since it dealt with " imprisonment without guilt " and " absolute measures . "
zypries added that it should only be applied as a last resort . also applicable to teenagers the proposed law governing preventive detention is a reaction by schröder 's government to a february ruling by germany 's constitutional court that overturned similar state laws , saying that only the federal government had the right to implement such laws .
in an additional ruling , the judges agreed that unlimited preventive detention was indeed in accordance with the constitution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inmates in prison the german government has also made clear that preventive detention could only be applied in the case of particularly dangerous criminals who have been sentenced to at least four years in prison and whose victims ' lives have been physically threatened . it would be applicable to culprits who were deemed " risky " even after undergoing psychiatric treatment and to delinquents between 18 and 21 years as well .
the decision to implement preventive detention would also have to be reviewed every two years . critics slam proposed legislation the proposed legislation , which is expected to become law in summer , has its share of critics . one of them is christian ströbele , a parliamentarian of the green party , the junior partner in the ruling government coalition .

the german government wants to lock away particularly violent criminals and sex offenders with a law that would allow them to be held indefinitely in preventive detention even after they have been sentenced to prison . when the partly-charred body of eight-year-old julia was found on a smoldering wood pile near giessen in the state of hesse in july 2001 , the brutality of the crime shook the nation . german chancellor gerhard schröder said at the time about the culprit : " lock him away - and forever . "
exactly three weeks ago , the 35-year-old culprit thorsten volk was sentenced for the murder and sexual abuse of julia . though julia 's tormentor and murderer might be a free man someday , the same may not be the case for future offenders considered too dangerous to be walking around freely , if chancellor schröder 's government has its way . protecting society from madmen on wednesday , the schröder 's cabinet agreed on a legal blueprint that will enable lawmakers to incarcerate accused individuals before trial on the assumption that their release would compromise the security of society . the practice , known as " preventive detention , " can in future also be used in the case of criminals who have served their sentence in jail but are still deemed too risky to be allowed to move freely outside prison walls .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte zypries , german justice minister german justice minister brigitte zypries -lrb- photo -rrb- said that the planned legislation would serve to protect society from dangerous criminals as far as possible .
preventive legislation , as opposed to a normal prison sentence , can be applied for an indefinite period of time . " ultimate means in penal law " zypries added that the planned law would also allow judges to recommend preventive detention even if the danger posed by the criminal is only confirmed after his sentencing , such as in the case of a sexual offender , whose earlier series of rape come to light after he 's already received a jail term .
" with it , it 's possible that one could remain in preventive detention till the end of his life , " zypries said . up to now , the provision of preventive detention in germany , had to be contained in the verdict or at least be mentioned as a caveat , though exceptions have been made in four cases . at the same time the justice minister stressed that the practice of preventive detention had to be subject to stringent checks and requirements since it dealt with " imprisonment without guilt " and " absolute measures . "
zypries added that it should only be applied as a last resort . also applicable to teenagers the proposed law governing preventive detention is a reaction by schröder 's government to a february ruling by germany 's constitutional court that overturned similar state laws , saying that only the federal government had the right to implement such laws .
in an additional ruling , the judges agreed that unlimited preventive detention was indeed in accordance with the constitution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inmates in prison the german government has also made clear that preventive detention could only be applied in the case of particularly dangerous criminals who have been sentenced to at least four years in prison and whose victims ' lives have been physically threatened . it would be applicable to culprits who were deemed " risky " even after undergoing psychiatric treatment and to delinquents between 18 and 21 years as well .
the decision to implement preventive detention would also have to be reviewed every two years . critics slam proposed legislation the proposed legislation , which is expected to become law in summer , has its share of critics . one of them is christian ströbele , a parliamentarian of the green party , the junior partner in the ruling government coalition .
" the result is n't acceptable in this current form , " ströbele told the süddeutsche zeitung daily .
ströbele slammed the fact that the law could in future be applied to young adults aged 18 and above in particular , as well as for criminals who would be sentenced for the first time . even erwin huber , head of the bavarian state chancellery and member of the opposition conservative christian social union , rejected the draft legislation as " unsatisfactory " and added that it was n't clear why preventive detention could only be applied in the case of a minimum sentencing of four years .

a plan to reform germany 's state-backed pension system has passed a vote in parliament .
the reform aims to stabilize the system in the long term in the face of a rapidly ageing population . germany 's younger generation will have to start taking more responsibility for their retirement , since after today 's vote the country 's state-backed pensions will not be as generous in the future .
the german parliament , or bundestag , passed the reform plan as expected with a necessary majority of social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- and green party members , 302 in total .
the opposition cast 291 votes against the plan and one spd member abstained .
the reform plan does not need to go to the upper house , the bundesrat , for approval .
the plan , introduced last year as part of chancellor gerhard schröder 's agenda 2010 spate of labor market and welfare reforms , changes the formula that determines how pension benefit levels are set and tries to limit the growing rising contribution rates employees pay into the system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulla schmidt according to ulla schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- , the minister for health and social security , a state pension alone in the future will no longer be enough to maintain living standards employees had before they retired .
overview a central element of the reform takes into consideration germany 's graying population and seeks to slow down annual rises in pension benefits .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pensioners will have to get by with less .
low birth rates and increased longevity have led to critical pressures on the system , a pay-as-you-go plan based on tax-paying workers supporting retirees through compulsory contributions .
as the ratio of working-age germans to pensioners narrows , expected to fall from two taxpayers per retiree to one over the next decades , the system is becoming increasingly unsustainable .
in the future , pension benefit rates will rise more slowly than overall income levels .
pensioners will have to forego an increase in benefits this year .
next year , as the formula comes into effect , modest increases of .38 percent in western germany and .61 percent in the eastern part of the country are expected .
obligatory contributions to the state system , which are paid jointly by employees and employers , are now set at 19.5 percent of wages .
according to the government , these contributions will stay under 20 percent until 2020 and will remain under 22 percent until 2030 .
currently , pension benefits stand at about 53 percent of the average wage of the retiree during his or her working life , less social security contributions .
according to estimated government revenues , pension benefits will fall to 46 percent of the average wage by 2020 and down to around 43 percent by 2030 .
but in order to quell a possible rebellion by some left-leaning spd members , the government has introduced a clause that requires future governments to keep pension payments from falling below the 43 percent mark in the future .
the reform plan makes this possible by increasing federal contributions to the system from tax revenues or raising the retirement age from 65 to 67 .
the parliament will decide on the retirement age increase in 2008 at the earliest .
fuzzy math opposition politicians accused the government coalition of using numbers that do not add up .
according to horst seehofer , the social affairs point man for the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , setting a benefits floor at 46 percent while limiting the contributions ceiling to 22 percent by 2030 is not possible .
maintaining the 46 percent rate would require an increase of contribution levels to 24 percent , or a retirement age of 70 .
" otherwise , these aims make no sense , " he told reporters , accusing the government 's reform of being only a prelude to further cuts .
politicians from the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- also had sharp words for the benefits floor .
heinrich kolb , social affairs expert for the fdp , criticized the 46 percent number as being unrealistic .
" those who do n't want to go under the 46 percent mark ca n't be committed to maintaining the system 's sustainability , " he told the associated press . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parliament freezes pensions german pensioners will get less money next year after parliament voted to cap pensions and require the elderly to pay for nursing insurance .

a plan to reform germany 's state-backed pension system has passed a vote in parliament .
the reform aims to stabilize the system in the long term in the face of a rapidly ageing population . germany 's younger generation will have to start taking more responsibility for their retirement , since after today 's vote the country 's state-backed pensions will not be as generous in the future .
the german parliament , or bundestag , passed the reform plan as expected with a necessary majority of social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- and green party members , 302 in total .
the opposition cast 291 votes against the plan and one spd member abstained .
the reform plan does not need to go to the upper house , the bundesrat , for approval .
the plan , introduced last year as part of chancellor gerhard schröder 's agenda 2010 spate of labor market and welfare reforms , changes the formula that determines how pension benefit levels are set and tries to limit the growing rising contribution rates employees pay into the system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulla schmidt according to ulla schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- , the minister for health and social security , a state pension alone in the future will no longer be enough to maintain living standards employees had before they retired .
overview a central element of the reform takes into consideration germany 's graying population and seeks to slow down annual rises in pension benefits .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pensioners will have to get by with less .
low birth rates and increased longevity have led to critical pressures on the system , a pay-as-you-go plan based on tax-paying workers supporting retirees through compulsory contributions .
as the ratio of working-age germans to pensioners narrows , expected to fall from two taxpayers per retiree to one over the next decades , the system is becoming increasingly unsustainable .
in the future , pension benefit rates will rise more slowly than overall income levels .
pensioners will have to forego an increase in benefits this year .
next year , as the formula comes into effect , modest increases of .38 percent in western germany and .61 percent in the eastern part of the country are expected .
obligatory contributions to the state system , which are paid jointly by employees and employers , are now set at 19.5 percent of wages .
according to the government , these contributions will stay under 20 percent until 2020 and will remain under 22 percent until 2030 .
currently , pension benefits stand at about 53 percent of the average wage of the retiree during his or her working life , less social security contributions .
according to estimated government revenues , pension benefits will fall to 46 percent of the average wage by 2020 and down to around 43 percent by 2030 .
but in order to quell a possible rebellion by some left-leaning spd members , the government has introduced a clause that requires future governments to keep pension payments from falling below the 43 percent mark in the future .
the reform plan makes this possible by increasing federal contributions to the system from tax revenues or raising the retirement age from 65 to 67 .
the parliament will decide on the retirement age increase in 2008 at the earliest .
fuzzy math opposition politicians accused the government coalition of using numbers that do not add up .
according to horst seehofer , the social affairs point man for the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , setting a benefits floor at 46 percent while limiting the contributions ceiling to 22 percent by 2030 is not possible .
maintaining the 46 percent rate would require an increase of contribution levels to 24 percent , or a retirement age of 70 .
" otherwise , these aims make no sense , " he told reporters , accusing the government 's reform of being only a prelude to further cuts .
politicians from the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- also had sharp words for the benefits floor .

"
" head-on , " the much talked-about german film which won the berlin film festival 's highest award , opens in theaters in germany on thursday .
the movie gained notoriety when its female star 's porn past came to light . " head-on " by director fatih akin has seen some turbulent times in the weeks before its official release .
it was first hailed by the media for putting german film back on the map when it won the coveted golden bear at last month 's berlinale , being the first german film to take top honors there in 18 years .
barely a week later , the mass-circulation tabloid bild revealed that the film 's female star , 23-year-old sibel kekilli , had made pornographic films in the past .
critics might argue that either way the film has benefited from the wave of publicity , but now german viewers will get the chance to cut through the sensationalism and make up their own minds about " head-on " when it opens across germany on thursday .
sex , drugs and violence the story tells of the painful emancipation of a young german-turkish woman played by kekilli , who lands in a psychiatric clinic after a suicide attempt .
there she meets a turkish-german alcoholic punk cahit , played by birol ünel -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , who is twice her age .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish-born actors sibel kekilli , left , and birol ünel anxious to escape the clutches of her conservative family , sibel convinces cahit to enter into a marriage of convenience with her .
their wedding marks the beginning of a life of freedom for sibel , who 's eager to try out parties , drugs and lots of sex .
as sibel and cahit live it up and indulge in separate sexual affairs , the two eventually fall in love .
the love story ends , however , when cahit kills one of sibel 's lovers in a jealous rage .
controversy among the turks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fatih akin , german director of turkish origin hamburg-based director akin -lrb- photo -rrb- , 31 , is the son of turkish immigrants .
he is aware that the german-turkish love story is bound to spark controversy among the more conservative members of germany 's 2.5-million-strong turkish community . even before the film has been released to the wider public , the director has been accused of exploiting the problems facing turkish women in germany in his film .
" there 's already a discussion on the internet calling for a boycott of the film , " akin said in an interview with deutsche welle .
but the director , whose has in the past explored the issue of young turks in germany straddling two cultures , says the release of the film will straighten out things .
he has won critical acclaim for his previous films , " short sharp shock " , " solino " and " in july . "
" those who 've seen the film , whether it 's been poor people or rich , whether conservatives or left-leaning people , women or men - all were pretty convinced so far , " akin said .

spanish prime minister jose maria aznar has vowed to catch those responsible for the madrid train bombings thursday morning that killed 190 and injured more than 1,240 .
the government is blaming the separatist group eta . ten bombs in total exploded during thursday morning 's commute in the worst terrorist attack in spain 's history .
" march 11 , 2004 has taken its place in the history of infamy , " prime minster aznar said in a national address .
he said those who set off the bombs would be hunted down and punished .
he and other government ministries , as well as much of the country 's news media , have pointed the finger at the basque separatist group eta .
" we will defeat them -lrb- eta -rrb- , " aznar said .
" we will succeed in finishing off the terrorist band , with the strength of the rule of law and with the unity of all spaniards . "
" terrorist band " is a term the spanish government regularly uses to refer to eta .
spain 's interior ministry said tests showed the explosives used in the attacks were a kind of dynamite normally used by eta .
aznar 's office said the explosives were a material called titadine , a kind of compressed dynamite found in a van-bomb intercepted last month as it headed for madrid , according to an associated press report .
on feb .
29 , police intercepted a madrid-bound van packed with more than 500 kilos -lrb- 1,100 pounds -rrb- of explosives traced back to the basque separatists ; two men were arrested on charges of terrorism .
on christmas eve , police thwarted an attempted bombing at chamartin , another madrid rail station , and arrested two suspected eta members .
however , the government is also not ruling out that islamic extremists could be involved in the attacks .
in the town of alcala de henares east of madrid a stolen truck was found that contained detonators and an audio tape with verses from the koran in arabic , according to interior minister angel acebes . he said all possibilities were being investigated , although eta remains the chief suspect . eta denies involvement a political group close to eta , the banned basque separatist party batasuna , denied that it was responsible for the attacks .
in the past , eta attacks have been preceded by warnings from the group .
officials received no such warning before thursday 's explosions .
speaking on radio popular arnold otegi blamed " arab resistance " for the attacks , the worst in spain 's history .
" spain maintains occupation forces in iraq and we should not forget that it had a responsibility for the war in iraq , " he said .
eta , which stands for basque homeland and freedom , was thought by many to be weakened and on its way out after the string of arrests and seizures of weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the group , which police believe to number only several dozen hard-core militants , has been responsible for some 800 deaths since it began its armed fight for basque independence in 1968 .
most of eta 's attacks have been assassinations or small-scale attacks .
if the thursday bombings are its work , it represents a remarkable increase in scale , ruthlessness and coordination .
" this is a step ahead of previous attacks by eta .
it could be a splinter group , it could be hardliners trying to extract as many casualties as they could , " paul wilkinson , a terrorism expert at the university of st. andrews , told reuters .
remote control the bombings are being described as the worst in europe since the 1988 bombing of pan-am flight 103 , which was blown out of the sky over the town of lockerbie , scotland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : debris lies next to a destroyed train car after the bombs exploded in the atocha railway station in madrid .
thursday 's powerful explosions , which authorities say appear to have been set off by remote control , rocked several madrid train stations during morning rush hour .
news reports said two bombs went off in a high-speed commuter train arriving at the busy downtown atocha station at 7:30 a.m. local time .
blasts also ripped through two other stops - santa eugenia and el pozo - the news agency efe reported .
" people started to scream and run , some bumping into each other , " juani fernandez , who was on the platform at atocha when the bombs went off , told the associated press .
spanish national radio quoted witnesses saying they saw people lying on the ground and train cars ripped open .
people in tears and bloodied could be seen running away from the station in panic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medics carry a woman injured by an explosion .
the latest count is at least 190 people dead and more than 1,240 injured .
hospitals appealed for people to donate blood .
make-shift emergency rooms were set up in neighboring sports centers , and taxis and buses were turned into ambulances to transport the severely wounded to nearby emergency rooms .
the country 's rail authority renfe has halted all commuter traffic into the capital .
politicians for the major parties have called off all campaigning ahead of the weekend 's general election .
three days of national mourning have been declared .
world condemnation world leaders were quick to condemn the bombings and sympathy poured in from capitals around the globe .
" there is a general election due in spain on sunday .
what happened today is a declaration of war on democracy , " said european parliament president pat cox in the legislature in strasbourg , france .
in germany , chancellor gerhard schröder said he was " deeply dismayed by this inhuman attack . "
he offered to send specialists from the country 's federal criminal office to spain .
u.s. president george w. bush spoke by telephone to the spanish prime minister .
" i appreciate so very much the spanish government 's fight against terror , their resolute stand against terrorist organizations like the eta , and the united states stands with them , " he told reporters .
the u.s. , britain and russia emphasized that the bombs underlined the need for the international community to toughen its resolve against terrorism .
demonstrations spanish prime minister jose maria aznar called for nationwide protests against the basque separatist group eta in the wake of deadly train bombings that left 190 dead and more than 1,240 wounded .
" the government asks spaniards to demonstrate tomorrow in the streets of all of spain .
demonstrations have been called in all spanish cities tomorrow at 7 p.m. under the slogan ' with the victims , with constitution and for the defeat of terrorism ' , " aznar said .

" head-on , " the much talked-about german film which won the berlin film festival 's highest award , opens in theaters in germany on thursday .
the movie gained notoriety when its female star 's porn past came to light . " head-on " by director fatih akin has seen some turbulent times in the weeks before its official release .
it was first hailed by the media for putting german film back on the map when it won the coveted golden bear at last month 's berlinale , being the first german film to take top honors there in 18 years .
barely a week later , the mass-circulation tabloid bild revealed that the film 's female star , 23-year-old sibel kekilli , had made pornographic films in the past .
critics might argue that either way the film has benefited from the wave of publicity , but now german viewers will get the chance to cut through the sensationalism and make up their own minds about " head-on " when it opens across germany on thursday .
sex , drugs and violence the story tells of the painful emancipation of a young german-turkish woman played by kekilli , who lands in a psychiatric clinic after a suicide attempt .
there she meets a turkish-german alcoholic punk cahit , played by birol ünel -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , who is twice her age .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish-born actors sibel kekilli , left , and birol ünel anxious to escape the clutches of her conservative family , sibel convinces cahit to enter into a marriage of convenience with her .
their wedding marks the beginning of a life of freedom for sibel , who 's eager to try out parties , drugs and lots of sex .
as sibel and cahit live it up and indulge in separate sexual affairs , the two eventually fall in love .
the love story ends , however , when cahit kills one of sibel 's lovers in a jealous rage .
controversy among the turks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fatih akin , german director of turkish origin hamburg-based director akin -lrb- photo -rrb- , 31 , is the son of turkish immigrants .
he is aware that the german-turkish love story is bound to spark controversy among the more conservative members of germany 's 2.5-million-strong turkish community . even before the film has been released to the wider public , the director has been accused of exploiting the problems facing turkish women in germany in his film .
" there 's already a discussion on the internet calling for a boycott of the film , " akin said in an interview with deutsche welle .
but the director , whose has in the past explored the issue of young turks in germany straddling two cultures , says the release of the film will straighten out things .
he has won critical acclaim for his previous films , " short sharp shock " , " solino " and " in july . "
" those who 've seen the film , whether it 's been poor people or rich , whether conservatives or left-leaning people , women or men - all were pretty convinced so far , " akin said .

a plan to reform germany 's state-backed pension system has passed a vote in parliament .
the reform aims to stabilize the system in the long term in the face of a rapidly ageing population . germany 's younger generation will have to start taking more responsibility for their retirement , since after today 's vote the country 's state-backed pensions will not be as generous in the future .
the german parliament , or bundestag , passed the reform plan as expected with a necessary majority of social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- and green party members , 302 in total .
the opposition cast 291 votes against the plan and one spd member abstained .
the reform plan does not need to go to the upper house , the bundesrat , for approval .
the plan , introduced last year as part of chancellor gerhard schröder 's agenda 2010 spate of labor market and welfare reforms , changes the formula that determines how pension benefit levels are set and tries to limit the growing rising contribution rates employees pay into the system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulla schmidt according to ulla schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- , the minister for health and social security , a state pension alone in the future will no longer be enough to maintain living standards employees had before they retired .
overview a central element of the reform takes into consideration germany 's graying population and seeks to slow down annual rises in pension benefits .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pensioners will have to get by with less .
low birth rates and increased longevity have led to critical pressures on the system , a pay-as-you-go plan based on tax-paying workers supporting retirees through compulsory contributions .
as the ratio of working-age germans to pensioners narrows , expected to fall from two taxpayers per retiree to one over the next decades , the system is becoming increasingly unsustainable .
in the future , pension benefit rates will rise more slowly than overall income levels .
pensioners will have to forego an increase in benefits this year .
next year , as the formula comes into effect , modest increases of .38 percent in western germany and .61 percent in the eastern part of the country are expected .
obligatory contributions to the state system , which are paid jointly by employees and employers , are now set at 19.5 percent of wages .
according to the government , these contributions will stay under 20 percent until 2020 and will remain under 22 percent until 2030 .
currently , pension benefits stand at about 53 percent of the average wage of the retiree during his or her working life , less social security contributions .
according to estimated government revenues , pension benefits will fall to 46 percent of the average wage by 2020 and down to around 43 percent by 2030 .
but in order to quell a possible rebellion by some left-leaning spd members , the government has introduced a clause that requires future governments to keep pension payments from falling below the 43 percent mark in the future .
the reform plan makes this possible by increasing federal contributions to the system from tax revenues or raising the retirement age from 65 to 67 .
the parliament will decide on the retirement age increase in 2008 at the earliest .
fuzzy math opposition politicians accused the government coalition of using numbers that do not add up .
according to horst seehofer , the social affairs point man for the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , setting a benefits floor at 46 percent while limiting the contributions ceiling to 22 percent by 2030 is not possible .
maintaining the 46 percent rate would require an increase of contribution levels to 24 percent , or a retirement age of 70 .
" otherwise , these aims make no sense , " he told reporters , accusing the government 's reform of being only a prelude to further cuts .
politicians from the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- also had sharp words for the benefits floor .
heinrich kolb , social affairs expert for the fdp , criticized the 46 percent number as being unrealistic .
" those who do n't want to go under the 46 percent mark ca n't be committed to maintaining the system 's sustainability , " he told the associated press . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parliament freezes pensions german pensioners will get less money next year after parliament voted to cap pensions and require the elderly to pay for nursing insurance .

a plan to reform germany 's state-backed pension system has passed a vote in parliament .
the reform aims to stabilize the system in the long term in the face of a rapidly ageing population . germany 's younger generation will have to start taking more responsibility for their retirement , since after today 's vote the country 's state-backed pensions will not be as generous in the future .
the german parliament , or bundestag , passed the reform plan as expected with a necessary majority of social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- and green party members , 302 in total .
the opposition cast 291 votes against the plan and one spd member abstained .
the reform plan does not need to go to the upper house , the bundesrat , for approval .
the plan , introduced last year as part of chancellor gerhard schröder 's agenda 2010 spate of labor market and welfare reforms , changes the formula that determines how pension benefit levels are set and tries to limit the growing rising contribution rates employees pay into the system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulla schmidt according to ulla schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- , the minister for health and social security , a state pension alone in the future will no longer be enough to maintain living standards employees had before they retired .
overview a central element of the reform takes into consideration germany 's graying population and seeks to slow down annual rises in pension benefits .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pensioners will have to get by with less .
low birth rates and increased longevity have led to critical pressures on the system , a pay-as-you-go plan based on tax-paying workers supporting retirees through compulsory contributions .
as the ratio of working-age germans to pensioners narrows , expected to fall from two taxpayers per retiree to one over the next decades , the system is becoming increasingly unsustainable .
in the future , pension benefit rates will rise more slowly than overall income levels .
pensioners will have to forego an increase in benefits this year .
next year , as the formula comes into effect , modest increases of .38 percent in western germany and .61 percent in the eastern part of the country are expected .
obligatory contributions to the state system , which are paid jointly by employees and employers , are now set at 19.5 percent of wages .
according to the government , these contributions will stay under 20 percent until 2020 and will remain under 22 percent until 2030 .
currently , pension benefits stand at about 53 percent of the average wage of the retiree during his or her working life , less social security contributions .
according to estimated government revenues , pension benefits will fall to 46 percent of the average wage by 2020 and down to around 43 percent by 2030 .
but in order to quell a possible rebellion by some left-leaning spd members , the government has introduced a clause that requires future governments to keep pension payments from falling below the 43 percent mark in the future .
the reform plan makes this possible by increasing federal contributions to the system from tax revenues or raising the retirement age from 65 to 67 .
the parliament will decide on the retirement age increase in 2008 at the earliest .
fuzzy math opposition politicians accused the government coalition of using numbers that do not add up .
according to horst seehofer , the social affairs point man for the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , setting a benefits floor at 46 percent while limiting the contributions ceiling to 22 percent by 2030 is not possible .
maintaining the 46 percent rate would require an increase of contribution levels to 24 percent , or a retirement age of 70 .
" otherwise , these aims make no sense , " he told reporters , accusing the government 's reform of being only a prelude to further cuts .
politicians from the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- also had sharp words for the benefits floor .
heinrich kolb , social affairs expert for the fdp , criticized the 46 percent number as being unrealistic .
" those who do n't want to go under the 46 percent mark ca n't be committed to maintaining the system 's sustainability , " he told the associated press . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parliament freezes pensions german pensioners will get less money next year after parliament voted to cap pensions and require the elderly to pay for nursing insurance .

now that europe 's central banks have agreed on how much gold they can sell over the next five years , germany is considering using its profits to stop top researchers from leaving the country . he may have the support of german chancellor gerhard schröder , but ernst welteke , head of germany 's central bank , the bundesbank , is having a hard time selling his idea to parliament .
in january , welteke proposed setting up a research foundation to distribute profits made from the sale of 20 percent of the bundesbank 's gold reserves .
he reasoned this would go a long way in appeasing top german researchers , who complain that a lack of state funding is forcing them to look for jobs abroad .
but welteke 's idea met with disapproval from the parliamentary budget committee on wednesday .
" i did n't hear from anyone who was in favor of welteke 's suggestion , " said deputy finance minister karl diller .
back to the drawing board bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ernst welteke , president of the bundesbank .
following the parliamentary committee session , welteke admitted that much more work needed to be done to convince politicians of his proposal 's merit .
but that will be difficult .
his plan would necessitate changing german law , which stipulates that any profits from gold sales be used to reduce the national deficit . that is a top priority now , as germany is set to breach eu budget deficit rules for a third year in a row in 2004 .
welteke would also have to amend his proposal to fall in line with a new gold deal agreed by europe 's central banks on monday .
the deal commits the european central bank , and the banks of every eu nation except the uk and denmark , to cap gold sales at 500 metric tons a year for the next five years .
the overall limit for the accord is 2,500 tons , up from 2,000 tons under the previous 1999 agreement .
" gold will remain an important element of global monetary reserves , " said the joint statement of the 14 central banks and the ecb .
gold operates as a safe haven for investors in troubled times .
while the trend in recent years has seen central banks shedding gold in favor of hard currencies , gold is currently in demand because of the weak u.s. dollar .
national gold reserves are a holdover from the bretton woods accord of 1944 , in which the value of currencies was pegged to gold .
with a total value of around € 46 billion , germany is the world 's second largest holder of gold reserves behind the u.s. before the new deal was struck , the bundesbank had requested an option to sell 600 tons .
that will now have to be scaled down in line with the new limits .
finding resonance in france the german proposal to use gold profits to stem the flow of its best researchers abroad has found favor in neighboring france , which faces growing protest by top scientists .
on tuesday , 2,000 scientists stopped their administrative work at laboratories to demand more state support for research .
following the protest action , france 's research minister claudie haigneré suggested raising cash either through the sale of gold or more privatizations .

while the trend in recent years has seen central banks shedding gold in favor of hard currencies , gold is currently in demand because of the weak u.s. dollar .
national gold reserves are a holdover from the bretton woods accord of 1944 , in which the value of currencies was pegged to gold .
with a total value of around € 46 billion , germany is the world 's second largest holder of gold reserves behind the u.s. before the new deal was struck , the bundesbank had requested an option to sell 600 tons .
that will now have to be scaled down in line with the new limits .
finding resonance in france the german proposal to use gold profits to stem the flow of its best researchers abroad has found favor in neighboring france , which faces growing protest by top scientists .
on tuesday , 2,000 scientists stopped their administrative work at laboratories to demand more state support for research .
following the protest action , france 's research minister claudie haigneré suggested raising cash either through the sale of gold or more privatizations .
the bank of france has not sold gold in recent years and had no immediate comment on haigneré 's suggestion . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de brain drain hurting germany germany 's brightest and best qualified young professionals are leaving the country in droves and securing lucrative positions abroad . -lrb- feb.9 , 2004 -rrb- 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

thursday morning rush hour in spain 's capital came to a halt when several bombs went off in a commuter train station , killing 182 people just days ahead of national elections . powerful explosions rocked several madrid train stations during morning rush hour .
news reports said two bombs went off in a high-speed commuter train arriving at the busy downtown atocha station at 7:30 a.m. local time .
blasts also ripped through two other stops - santa eugenia and el pozo - on a southeastern commuter line leading to atocha , the news agency efe reported .
spanish national radio quoted witnesses saying they saw people lying on the ground and train cars ripped open .
people in tears and bloodied could be seen running away from the station in panic .
the spanish interior ministry has reported at least 182 people dead and more than 900 injured .
hospitals appealed for people to donate blood .
make-shift emergency rooms were set up in neighboring sports centers , and taxis and buses were turned into ambulances to transport the severely wounded to nearby emergency rooms .
the country 's rail authority renfe has halted all commuter traffic into the capital .
politicians for the major parties have called off all campaigning ahead of the weekend 's general election .
the work of eta ?
so far there has been no claim of responsibility , but police were quick to point their finger at the basque separatist group eta .
security offices throughout the country have been on high alert for separatist violence ahead of the country 's general elections on sunday .
spain 's conservative ruling party , which has built up its campaign on a hard-line stance against eta , is currently leading in the polls .
in the last several weeks , the government has made several high-profile arrests of eta members .
" this is a collective killing by the criminal band which is eta , " government spokesman eduardo zaplana told cadena ser radio station .
spain 's interior ministry also said tests showed the explosives used in the attacks were a kind of dynamite normally used by eta .
aznar 's office said the explosives were a material called titadine , a kind of compressed dynamite found in a van-bomb intercepted last month as it headed for madrid , according to an associated press report .
on feb .
29 , police intercepted a madrid-bound van packed with more than 500 kilos -lrb- 1,100 pounds -rrb- of explosives traced back to the basque separatists ; two men were arrested on charges of terrorism .
on christmas eve , police thwarted an attempted bombing at chamartin , another madrid rail station , and arrested two suspected eta members .
the leader of the banned basque separatist party batasuna , however , denied that its armed group eta was behind the coordinated bombings . speaking on radio popular arnold otegi blamed " arab resistance " for the attacks , the worst in spain 's history .
history of terror bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wreckage of a spanish intercity train destroyed by an explosion lies on the track at atocha railway station in madrid spain , thursday , march 11 , 2004 .
the european union and the united states have listed eta , which stands for basque homeland and freedom , as a terrorist organization .
the group has committed itself to an armed fight for an independent basque state , comprising the basque regions of north-western spain as well as parts of southern france .
a partial cease fire announced in feb .
18 for the region of catalonia has done little to reduce the group 's potential threat to security in spain ahead of the elections .
in the past eta has been known to stage attacks around big events and anniversaries .
in the run-up to the last general election four years ago , eta ended a 14-month cease fire with a series of deadly bombings in madrid and the basque country .
since taking up arms in the 1960s the group has killed more than 800 people . based on wire reports -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world leaders call for unity against terror just hours after a series of explosions ripped through spain 's capital thursday morning , european leaders responded with words of shock and condemnation .

the german government wants to lock away particularly violent criminals and sex offenders with a law that would allow them to be held indefinitely in preventive detention even after they have been sentenced to prison . when the partly-charred body of eight-year-old julia was found on a smoldering wood pile near giessen in the state of hesse in july 2001 , the brutality of the crime shook the nation . german chancellor gerhard schröder said at the time about the culprit : " lock him away - and forever . "
exactly three weeks ago , the 35-year-old culprit thorsten volk was sentenced for the murder and sexual abuse of julia . though julia 's tormentor and murderer might be a free man someday , the same may not be the case for future offenders considered too dangerous to be walking around freely , if chancellor schröder 's government has its way . protecting society from madmen on wednesday , the schröder 's cabinet agreed on a legal blueprint that will enable lawmakers to incarcerate accused individuals before trial on the assumption that their release would compromise the security of society . the practice , known as " preventive detention , " can in future also be used in the case of criminals who have served their sentence in jail but are still deemed too risky to be allowed to move freely outside prison walls .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte zypries , german justice minister german justice minister brigitte zypries -lrb- photo -rrb- said that the planned legislation would serve to protect society from dangerous criminals as far as possible .
preventive legislation , as opposed to a normal prison sentence , can be applied for an indefinite period of time . " ultimate means in penal law " zypries added that the planned law would also allow judges to recommend preventive detention even if the danger posed by the criminal is only confirmed after his sentencing , such as in the case of a sexual offender , whose earlier series of rape come to light after he 's already received a jail term .
" with it , it 's possible that one could remain in preventive detention till the end of his life , " zypries said . up to now , the provision of preventive detention in germany , had to be contained in the verdict or at least be mentioned as a caveat , though exceptions have been made in four cases . at the same time the justice minister stressed that the practice of preventive detention had to be subject to stringent checks and requirements since it dealt with " imprisonment without guilt " and " absolute measures . "
zypries added that it should only be applied as a last resort . also applicable to teenagers the proposed law governing preventive detention is a reaction by schröder 's government to a february ruling by germany 's constitutional court that overturned similar state laws , saying that only the federal government had the right to implement such laws .
in an additional ruling , the judges agreed that unlimited preventive detention was indeed in accordance with the constitution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inmates in prison the german government has also made clear that preventive detention could only be applied in the case of particularly dangerous criminals who have been sentenced to at least four years in prison and whose victims ' lives have been physically threatened . it would be applicable to culprits who were deemed " risky " even after undergoing psychiatric treatment and to delinquents between 18 and 21 years as well .
the decision to implement preventive detention would also have to be reviewed every two years . critics slam proposed legislation the proposed legislation , which is expected to become law in summer , has its share of critics . one of them is christian ströbele , a parliamentarian of the green party , the junior partner in the ruling government coalition .
" the result is n't acceptable in this current form , " ströbele told the süddeutsche zeitung daily .
ströbele slammed the fact that the law could in future be applied to young adults aged 18 and above in particular , as well as for criminals who would be sentenced for the first time . even erwin huber , head of the bavarian state chancellery and member of the opposition conservative christian social union , rejected the draft legislation as " unsatisfactory " and added that it was n't clear why preventive detention could only be applied in the case of a minimum sentencing of four years .

" with it , it 's possible that one could remain in preventive detention till the end of his life , " zypries said . up to now , the provision of preventive detention in germany , had to be contained in the verdict or at least be mentioned as a caveat , though exceptions have been made in four cases . at the same time the justice minister stressed that the practice of preventive detention had to be subject to stringent checks and requirements since it dealt with " imprisonment without guilt " and " absolute measures . "
zypries added that it should only be applied as a last resort . also applicable to teenagers the proposed law governing preventive detention is a reaction by schröder 's government to a february ruling by germany 's constitutional court that overturned similar state laws , saying that only the federal government had the right to implement such laws .

the german government wants to lock away particularly violent criminals and sex offenders with a law that would allow them to be held indefinitely in preventive detention even after they have been sentenced to prison . when the partly-charred body of eight-year-old julia was found on a smoldering wood pile near giessen in the state of hesse in july 2001 , the brutality of the crime shook the nation . german chancellor gerhard schröder said at the time about the culprit : " lock him away - and forever . "
exactly three weeks ago , the 35-year-old culprit thorsten volk was sentenced for the murder and sexual abuse of julia . though julia 's tormentor and murderer might be a free man someday , the same may not be the case for future offenders considered too dangerous to be walking around freely , if chancellor schröder 's government has its way . protecting society from madmen on wednesday , the schröder 's cabinet agreed on a legal blueprint that will enable lawmakers to incarcerate accused individuals before trial on the assumption that their release would compromise the security of society . the practice , known as " preventive detention , " can in future also be used in the case of criminals who have served their sentence in jail but are still deemed too risky to be allowed to move freely outside prison walls .

thursday morning rush hour in spain 's capital came to a halt when several bombs went off in a commuter train station , killing 182 people just days ahead of national elections . powerful explosions rocked several madrid train stations during morning rush hour .
news reports said two bombs went off in a high-speed commuter train arriving at the busy downtown atocha station at 7:30 a.m. local time .
blasts also ripped through two other stops - santa eugenia and el pozo - on a southeastern commuter line leading to atocha , the news agency efe reported .
spanish national radio quoted witnesses saying they saw people lying on the ground and train cars ripped open .
people in tears and bloodied could be seen running away from the station in panic .
the spanish interior ministry has reported at least 182 people dead and more than 900 injured .
hospitals appealed for people to donate blood .
make-shift emergency rooms were set up in neighboring sports centers , and taxis and buses were turned into ambulances to transport the severely wounded to nearby emergency rooms .
the country 's rail authority renfe has halted all commuter traffic into the capital .
politicians for the major parties have called off all campaigning ahead of the weekend 's general election .
the work of eta ?
so far there has been no claim of responsibility , but police were quick to point their finger at the basque separatist group eta .
security offices throughout the country have been on high alert for separatist violence ahead of the country 's general elections on sunday .
spain 's conservative ruling party , which has built up its campaign on a hard-line stance against eta , is currently leading in the polls .
in the last several weeks , the government has made several high-profile arrests of eta members .
" this is a collective killing by the criminal band which is eta , " government spokesman eduardo zaplana told cadena ser radio station .
spain 's interior ministry also said tests showed the explosives used in the attacks were a kind of dynamite normally used by eta .
aznar 's office said the explosives were a material called titadine , a kind of compressed dynamite found in a van-bomb intercepted last month as it headed for madrid , according to an associated press report .
on feb .
29 , police intercepted a madrid-bound van packed with more than 500 kilos -lrb- 1,100 pounds -rrb- of explosives traced back to the basque separatists ; two men were arrested on charges of terrorism .
on christmas eve , police thwarted an attempted bombing at chamartin , another madrid rail station , and arrested two suspected eta members .
the leader of the banned basque separatist party batasuna , however , denied that its armed group eta was behind the coordinated bombings . speaking on radio popular arnold otegi blamed " arab resistance " for the attacks , the worst in spain 's history .
history of terror bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wreckage of a spanish intercity train destroyed by an explosion lies on the track at atocha railway station in madrid spain , thursday , march 11 , 2004 .
the european union and the united states have listed eta , which stands for basque homeland and freedom , as a terrorist organization .
the group has committed itself to an armed fight for an independent basque state , comprising the basque regions of north-western spain as well as parts of southern france .
a partial cease fire announced in feb .
18 for the region of catalonia has done little to reduce the group 's potential threat to security in spain ahead of the elections .
in the past eta has been known to stage attacks around big events and anniversaries .
in the run-up to the last general election four years ago , eta ended a 14-month cease fire with a series of deadly bombings in madrid and the basque country .
since taking up arms in the 1960s the group has killed more than 800 people . based on wire reports -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world leaders call for unity against terror just hours after a series of explosions ripped through spain 's capital thursday morning , european leaders responded with words of shock and condemnation .

thursday morning rush hour in spain 's capital came to a halt when several bombs went off in a commuter train station , killing 182 people just days ahead of national elections . powerful explosions rocked several madrid train stations during morning rush hour .
news reports said two bombs went off in a high-speed commuter train arriving at the busy downtown atocha station at 7:30 a.m. local time .
blasts also ripped through two other stops - santa eugenia and el pozo - on a southeastern commuter line leading to atocha , the news agency efe reported .
spanish national radio quoted witnesses saying they saw people lying on the ground and train cars ripped open .
people in tears and bloodied could be seen running away from the station in panic .
the spanish interior ministry has reported at least 182 people dead and more than 900 injured .
hospitals appealed for people to donate blood .
make-shift emergency rooms were set up in neighboring sports centers , and taxis and buses were turned into ambulances to transport the severely wounded to nearby emergency rooms .
the country 's rail authority renfe has halted all commuter traffic into the capital .
politicians for the major parties have called off all campaigning ahead of the weekend 's general election .
the work of eta ?
so far there has been no claim of responsibility , but police were quick to point their finger at the basque separatist group eta .
security offices throughout the country have been on high alert for separatist violence ahead of the country 's general elections on sunday .
spain 's conservative ruling party , which has built up its campaign on a hard-line stance against eta , is currently leading in the polls .
in the last several weeks , the government has made several high-profile arrests of eta members .
" this is a collective killing by the criminal band which is eta , " government spokesman eduardo zaplana told cadena ser radio station .
spain 's interior ministry also said tests showed the explosives used in the attacks were a kind of dynamite normally used by eta .
aznar 's office said the explosives were a material called titadine , a kind of compressed dynamite found in a van-bomb intercepted last month as it headed for madrid , according to an associated press report .
on feb .
29 , police intercepted a madrid-bound van packed with more than 500 kilos -lrb- 1,100 pounds -rrb- of explosives traced back to the basque separatists ; two men were arrested on charges of terrorism .
on christmas eve , police thwarted an attempted bombing at chamartin , another madrid rail station , and arrested two suspected eta members .
the leader of the banned basque separatist party batasuna , however , denied that its armed group eta was behind the coordinated bombings . speaking on radio popular arnold otegi blamed " arab resistance " for the attacks , the worst in spain 's history .
history of terror bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wreckage of a spanish intercity train destroyed by an explosion lies on the track at atocha railway station in madrid spain , thursday , march 11 , 2004 .
the european union and the united states have listed eta , which stands for basque homeland and freedom , as a terrorist organization .
the group has committed itself to an armed fight for an independent basque state , comprising the basque regions of north-western spain as well as parts of southern france .
a partial cease fire announced in feb .
18 for the region of catalonia has done little to reduce the group 's potential threat to security in spain ahead of the elections .
in the past eta has been known to stage attacks around big events and anniversaries .
in the run-up to the last general election four years ago , eta ended a 14-month cease fire with a series of deadly bombings in madrid and the basque country .
since taking up arms in the 1960s the group has killed more than 800 people . based on wire reports -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world leaders call for unity against terror just hours after a series of explosions ripped through spain 's capital thursday morning , european leaders responded with words of shock and condemnation .

a plan to reform germany 's state-backed pension system has passed a vote in parliament .
the reform aims to stabilize the system in the long term in the face of a rapidly ageing population . germany 's younger generation will have to start taking more responsibility for their retirement , since after today 's vote the country 's state-backed pensions will not be as generous in the future .
the german parliament , or bundestag , passed the reform plan as expected with a necessary majority of social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- and green party members , 302 in total .
the opposition cast 291 votes against the plan and one spd member abstained .
the reform plan does not need to go to the upper house , the bundesrat , for approval .
the plan , introduced last year as part of chancellor gerhard schröder 's agenda 2010 spate of labor market and welfare reforms , changes the formula that determines how pension benefit levels are set and tries to limit the growing rising contribution rates employees pay into the system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulla schmidt according to ulla schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- , the minister for health and social security , a state pension alone in the future will no longer be enough to maintain living standards employees had before they retired .
overview a central element of the reform takes into consideration germany 's graying population and seeks to slow down annual rises in pension benefits .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pensioners will have to get by with less .
low birth rates and increased longevity have led to critical pressures on the system , a pay-as-you-go plan based on tax-paying workers supporting retirees through compulsory contributions .
as the ratio of working-age germans to pensioners narrows , expected to fall from two taxpayers per retiree to one over the next decades , the system is becoming increasingly unsustainable .
in the future , pension benefit rates will rise more slowly than overall income levels .
pensioners will have to forego an increase in benefits this year .
next year , as the formula comes into effect , modest increases of .38 percent in western germany and .61 percent in the eastern part of the country are expected .
obligatory contributions to the state system , which are paid jointly by employees and employers , are now set at 19.5 percent of wages .
according to the government , these contributions will stay under 20 percent until 2020 and will remain under 22 percent until 2030 .
currently , pension benefits stand at about 53 percent of the average wage of the retiree during his or her working life , less social security contributions .
according to estimated government revenues , pension benefits will fall to 46 percent of the average wage by 2020 and down to around 43 percent by 2030 .
but in order to quell a possible rebellion by some left-leaning spd members , the government has introduced a clause that requires future governments to keep pension payments from falling below the 43 percent mark in the future .
the reform plan makes this possible by increasing federal contributions to the system from tax revenues or raising the retirement age from 65 to 67 .
the parliament will decide on the retirement age increase in 2008 at the earliest .
fuzzy math opposition politicians accused the government coalition of using numbers that do not add up .
according to horst seehofer , the social affairs point man for the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , setting a benefits floor at 46 percent while limiting the contributions ceiling to 22 percent by 2030 is not possible .
maintaining the 46 percent rate would require an increase of contribution levels to 24 percent , or a retirement age of 70 .
" otherwise , these aims make no sense , " he told reporters , accusing the government 's reform of being only a prelude to further cuts .
politicians from the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- also had sharp words for the benefits floor .
heinrich kolb , social affairs expert for the fdp , criticized the 46 percent number as being unrealistic .
" those who do n't want to go under the 46 percent mark ca n't be committed to maintaining the system 's sustainability , " he told the associated press . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parliament freezes pensions german pensioners will get less money next year after parliament voted to cap pensions and require the elderly to pay for nursing insurance .

now that europe 's central banks have agreed on how much gold they can sell over the next five years , germany is considering using its profits to stop top researchers from leaving the country . he may have the support of german chancellor gerhard schröder , but ernst welteke , head of germany 's central bank , the bundesbank , is having a hard time selling his idea to parliament .
in january , welteke proposed setting up a research foundation to distribute profits made from the sale of 20 percent of the bundesbank 's gold reserves .
he reasoned this would go a long way in appeasing top german researchers , who complain that a lack of state funding is forcing them to look for jobs abroad .
but welteke 's idea met with disapproval from the parliamentary budget committee on wednesday .
" i did n't hear from anyone who was in favor of welteke 's suggestion , " said deputy finance minister karl diller .
back to the drawing board bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ernst welteke , president of the bundesbank .
following the parliamentary committee session , welteke admitted that much more work needed to be done to convince politicians of his proposal 's merit .
but that will be difficult .
his plan would necessitate changing german law , which stipulates that any profits from gold sales be used to reduce the national deficit . that is a top priority now , as germany is set to breach eu budget deficit rules for a third year in a row in 2004 .
welteke would also have to amend his proposal to fall in line with a new gold deal agreed by europe 's central banks on monday .
the deal commits the european central bank , and the banks of every eu nation except the uk and denmark , to cap gold sales at 500 metric tons a year for the next five years .
the overall limit for the accord is 2,500 tons , up from 2,000 tons under the previous 1999 agreement .
" gold will remain an important element of global monetary reserves , " said the joint statement of the 14 central banks and the ecb .
gold operates as a safe haven for investors in troubled times .
while the trend in recent years has seen central banks shedding gold in favor of hard currencies , gold is currently in demand because of the weak u.s. dollar .
national gold reserves are a holdover from the bretton woods accord of 1944 , in which the value of currencies was pegged to gold .
with a total value of around € 46 billion , germany is the world 's second largest holder of gold reserves behind the u.s. before the new deal was struck , the bundesbank had requested an option to sell 600 tons .
that will now have to be scaled down in line with the new limits .
finding resonance in france the german proposal to use gold profits to stem the flow of its best researchers abroad has found favor in neighboring france , which faces growing protest by top scientists .
on tuesday , 2,000 scientists stopped their administrative work at laboratories to demand more state support for research .
following the protest action , france 's research minister claudie haigneré suggested raising cash either through the sale of gold or more privatizations .
the bank of france has not sold gold in recent years and had no immediate comment on haigneré 's suggestion . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de brain drain hurting germany germany 's brightest and best qualified young professionals are leaving the country in droves and securing lucrative positions abroad . -lrb- feb.9 , 2004 -rrb- 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

now that europe 's central banks have agreed on how much gold they can sell over the next five years , germany is considering using its profits to stop top researchers from leaving the country . he may have the support of german chancellor gerhard schröder , but ernst welteke , head of germany 's central bank , the bundesbank , is having a hard time selling his idea to parliament .
in january , welteke proposed setting up a research foundation to distribute profits made from the sale of 20 percent of the bundesbank 's gold reserves .
he reasoned this would go a long way in appeasing top german researchers , who complain that a lack of state funding is forcing them to look for jobs abroad .
but welteke 's idea met with disapproval from the parliamentary budget committee on wednesday .
" i did n't hear from anyone who was in favor of welteke 's suggestion , " said deputy finance minister karl diller .
back to the drawing board bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ernst welteke , president of the bundesbank .
following the parliamentary committee session , welteke admitted that much more work needed to be done to convince politicians of his proposal 's merit .
but that will be difficult .
his plan would necessitate changing german law , which stipulates that any profits from gold sales be used to reduce the national deficit . that is a top priority now , as germany is set to breach eu budget deficit rules for a third year in a row in 2004 .
welteke would also have to amend his proposal to fall in line with a new gold deal agreed by europe 's central banks on monday .
the deal commits the european central bank , and the banks of every eu nation except the uk and denmark , to cap gold sales at 500 metric tons a year for the next five years .
the overall limit for the accord is 2,500 tons , up from 2,000 tons under the previous 1999 agreement .
" gold will remain an important element of global monetary reserves , " said the joint statement of the 14 central banks and the ecb .
gold operates as a safe haven for investors in troubled times .
while the trend in recent years has seen central banks shedding gold in favor of hard currencies , gold is currently in demand because of the weak u.s. dollar .
national gold reserves are a holdover from the bretton woods accord of 1944 , in which the value of currencies was pegged to gold .
with a total value of around € 46 billion , germany is the world 's second largest holder of gold reserves behind the u.s. before the new deal was struck , the bundesbank had requested an option to sell 600 tons .
that will now have to be scaled down in line with the new limits .
finding resonance in france the german proposal to use gold profits to stem the flow of its best researchers abroad has found favor in neighboring france , which faces growing protest by top scientists .
on tuesday , 2,000 scientists stopped their administrative work at laboratories to demand more state support for research .
following the protest action , france 's research minister claudie haigneré suggested raising cash either through the sale of gold or more privatizations .
the bank of france has not sold gold in recent years and had no immediate comment on haigneré 's suggestion . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de brain drain hurting germany germany 's brightest and best qualified young professionals are leaving the country in droves and securing lucrative positions abroad . -lrb- feb.9 , 2004 -rrb- feedback should germany be allowed to sell gold in order to fund research ?

"
" head-on , " the much talked-about german film which won the berlin film festival 's highest award , opens in theaters in germany on thursday .
the movie gained notoriety when its female star 's porn past came to light . " head-on " by director fatih akin has seen some turbulent times in the weeks before its official release .
it was first hailed by the media for putting german film back on the map when it won the coveted golden bear at last month 's berlinale , being the first german film to take top honors there in 18 years .
barely a week later , the mass-circulation tabloid bild revealed that the film 's female star , 23-year-old sibel kekilli , had made pornographic films in the past .
critics might argue that either way the film has benefited from the wave of publicity , but now german viewers will get the chance to cut through the sensationalism and make up their own minds about " head-on " when it opens across germany on thursday .
sex , drugs and violence the story tells of the painful emancipation of a young german-turkish woman played by kekilli , who lands in a psychiatric clinic after a suicide attempt .
there she meets a turkish-german alcoholic punk cahit , played by birol ünel -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , who is twice her age .

their wedding marks the beginning of a life of freedom for sibel , who 's eager to try out parties , drugs and lots of sex .
as sibel and cahit live it up and indulge in separate sexual affairs , the two eventually fall in love .
the love story ends , however , when cahit kills one of sibel 's lovers in a jealous rage .
controversy among the turks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fatih akin , german director of turkish origin hamburg-based director akin -lrb- photo -rrb- , 31 , is the son of turkish immigrants .
he is aware that the german-turkish love story is bound to spark controversy among the more conservative members of germany 's 2.5-million-strong turkish community . even before the film has been released to the wider public , the director has been accused of exploiting the problems facing turkish women in germany in his film .
" there 's already a discussion on the internet calling for a boycott of the film , " akin said in an interview with deutsche welle .
but the director , whose has in the past explored the issue of young turks in germany straddling two cultures , says the release of the film will straighten out things .
he has won critical acclaim for his previous films , " short sharp shock " , " solino " and " in july . "
" those who 've seen the film , whether it 's been poor people or rich , whether conservatives or left-leaning people , women or men - all were pretty convinced so far , " akin said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 11.03.2004 -pipe- 14:00 utc bmw reports lower profits german carmaker bmw said thursday that net profits fell 3.6 percent in 2003 from the previous year 's record earnings .
profits dropped to € 1.947 billion -lrb- $ 2.414 billion -rrb- from € 2.020 billion in 2002 .
the company said the downswing was due to rising costs connected to changes in germany 's early retirement law and differences in corporate tax credits .
the southern german carmaker also said it had increased expenses related to the launch of several new models , including a new version of its mainstay 5-series .

profits dropped to € 1.947 billion -lrb- $ 2.414 billion -rrb- from € 2.020 billion in 2002 .
the company said the downswing was due to rising costs connected to changes in germany 's early retirement law and differences in corporate tax credits .
the southern german carmaker also said it had increased expenses related to the launch of several new models , including a new version of its mainstay 5-series .
despite the drop in profits , chief executive officer helmut panke said the company met all its targets and was on track for " positive development in the current financial year by increasing sales volumes and earnings . "

now that europe 's central banks have agreed on how much gold they can sell over the next five years , germany is considering using its profits to stop top researchers from leaving the country . he may have the support of german chancellor gerhard schröder , but ernst welteke , head of germany 's central bank , the bundesbank , is having a hard time selling his idea to parliament .
in january , welteke proposed setting up a research foundation to distribute profits made from the sale of 20 percent of the bundesbank 's gold reserves .
he reasoned this would go a long way in appeasing top german researchers , who complain that a lack of state funding is forcing them to look for jobs abroad .
but welteke 's idea met with disapproval from the parliamentary budget committee on wednesday .
" i did n't hear from anyone who was in favor of welteke 's suggestion , " said deputy finance minister karl diller .
back to the drawing board bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ernst welteke , president of the bundesbank .
following the parliamentary committee session , welteke admitted that much more work needed to be done to convince politicians of his proposal 's merit .
but that will be difficult .
his plan would necessitate changing german law , which stipulates that any profits from gold sales be used to reduce the national deficit . that is a top priority now , as germany is set to breach eu budget deficit rules for a third year in a row in 2004 .
welteke would also have to amend his proposal to fall in line with a new gold deal agreed by europe 's central banks on monday .
the deal commits the european central bank , and the banks of every eu nation except the uk and denmark , to cap gold sales at 500 metric tons a year for the next five years .
the overall limit for the accord is 2,500 tons , up from 2,000 tons under the previous 1999 agreement .
" gold will remain an important element of global monetary reserves , " said the joint statement of the 14 central banks and the ecb .
gold operates as a safe haven for investors in troubled times .
while the trend in recent years has seen central banks shedding gold in favor of hard currencies , gold is currently in demand because of the weak u.s. dollar .
national gold reserves are a holdover from the bretton woods accord of 1944 , in which the value of currencies was pegged to gold .
with a total value of around € 46 billion , germany is the world 's second largest holder of gold reserves behind the u.s. before the new deal was struck , the bundesbank had requested an option to sell 600 tons .
that will now have to be scaled down in line with the new limits .
finding resonance in france the german proposal to use gold profits to stem the flow of its best researchers abroad has found favor in neighboring france , which faces growing protest by top scientists .
on tuesday , 2,000 scientists stopped their administrative work at laboratories to demand more state support for research .
following the protest action , france 's research minister claudie haigneré suggested raising cash either through the sale of gold or more privatizations .
the bank of france has not sold gold in recent years and had no immediate comment on haigneré 's suggestion . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de brain drain hurting germany germany 's brightest and best qualified young professionals are leaving the country in droves and securing lucrative positions abroad . -lrb- feb.9 , 2004 -rrb- feedback should germany be allowed to sell gold in order to fund research ?

now that europe 's central banks have agreed on how much gold they can sell over the next five years , germany is considering using its profits to stop top researchers from leaving the country . he may have the support of german chancellor gerhard schröder , but ernst welteke , head of germany 's central bank , the bundesbank , is having a hard time selling his idea to parliament .
in january , welteke proposed setting up a research foundation to distribute profits made from the sale of 20 percent of the bundesbank 's gold reserves .
he reasoned this would go a long way in appeasing top german researchers , who complain that a lack of state funding is forcing them to look for jobs abroad .
but welteke 's idea met with disapproval from the parliamentary budget committee on wednesday .
" i did n't hear from anyone who was in favor of welteke 's suggestion , " said deputy finance minister karl diller .
back to the drawing board bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ernst welteke , president of the bundesbank .
following the parliamentary committee session , welteke admitted that much more work needed to be done to convince politicians of his proposal 's merit .
but that will be difficult .
his plan would necessitate changing german law , which stipulates that any profits from gold sales be used to reduce the national deficit . that is a top priority now , as germany is set to breach eu budget deficit rules for a third year in a row in 2004 .
welteke would also have to amend his proposal to fall in line with a new gold deal agreed by europe 's central banks on monday .
the deal commits the european central bank , and the banks of every eu nation except the uk and denmark , to cap gold sales at 500 metric tons a year for the next five years .
the overall limit for the accord is 2,500 tons , up from 2,000 tons under the previous 1999 agreement .
" gold will remain an important element of global monetary reserves , " said the joint statement of the 14 central banks and the ecb .
gold operates as a safe haven for investors in troubled times .
while the trend in recent years has seen central banks shedding gold in favor of hard currencies , gold is currently in demand because of the weak u.s. dollar .
national gold reserves are a holdover from the bretton woods accord of 1944 , in which the value of currencies was pegged to gold .
with a total value of around € 46 billion , germany is the world 's second largest holder of gold reserves behind the u.s. before the new deal was struck , the bundesbank had requested an option to sell 600 tons .
that will now have to be scaled down in line with the new limits .
finding resonance in france the german proposal to use gold profits to stem the flow of its best researchers abroad has found favor in neighboring france , which faces growing protest by top scientists .
on tuesday , 2,000 scientists stopped their administrative work at laboratories to demand more state support for research .
following the protest action , france 's research minister claudie haigneré suggested raising cash either through the sale of gold or more privatizations .

" the risks of an economic deterioration are greater than the upward risks for europe and germany , " he told reporters in frankfurt .
welteke , who is also a member of the european central bank 's governing council , seemed to contradict the ecb 's latest monthly report in which the dangers to germany 's slowly recovering economy were said to be " broadly balanced . "
he did , however , concede that it was feasible the german economy , the biggest in europe and the one hardest hit by an overall market downturn , could grow by two percent this year . more briefs 11.03.2004 -pipe- deutsche bahn € 470 million in the red in 2003 11.03.2004 -pipe- bmw reports lower profits 10.03.2004 -pipe- tourism industry optimistic as itb fair looms 10.03.2004 -pipe- adidas faces plummeting north america sales 10.03.2004 -pipe- german export economy gathers speed 10.03.2004 -pipe- telekom pays dearly for toll system delay 09.03.2004 -pipe- international vision for deutsche post 09.03.2004 -pipe- german retailers battle on radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

"
" head-on , " the much talked-about german film which won the berlin film festival 's highest award , opens in theaters in germany on thursday .
the movie gained notoriety when its female star 's porn past came to light . " head-on " by director fatih akin has seen some turbulent times in the weeks before its official release .
it was first hailed by the media for putting german film back on the map when it won the coveted golden bear at last month 's berlinale , being the first german film to take top honors there in 18 years .
barely a week later , the mass-circulation tabloid bild revealed that the film 's female star , 23-year-old sibel kekilli , had made pornographic films in the past .
critics might argue that either way the film has benefited from the wave of publicity , but now german viewers will get the chance to cut through the sensationalism and make up their own minds about " head-on " when it opens across germany on thursday .
sex , drugs and violence the story tells of the painful emancipation of a young german-turkish woman played by kekilli , who lands in a psychiatric clinic after a suicide attempt .
there she meets a turkish-german alcoholic punk cahit , played by birol ünel -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , who is twice her age .

as sibel and cahit live it up and indulge in separate sexual affairs , the two eventually fall in love .
the love story ends , however , when cahit kills one of sibel 's lovers in a jealous rage .
controversy among the turks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fatih akin , german director of turkish origin hamburg-based director akin -lrb- photo -rrb- , 31 , is the son of turkish immigrants .
he is aware that the german-turkish love story is bound to spark controversy among the more conservative members of germany 's 2.5-million-strong turkish community . even before the film has been released to the wider public , the director has been accused of exploiting the problems facing turkish women in germany in his film .
" there 's already a discussion on the internet calling for a boycott of the film , " akin said in an interview with deutsche welle .
but the director , whose has in the past explored the issue of young turks in germany straddling two cultures , says the release of the film will straighten out things .
he has won critical acclaim for his previous films , " short sharp shock " , " solino " and " in july . "

thursday morning rush hour in spain 's capital came to a halt when several bombs went off in a commuter train station , killing 182 people just days ahead of national elections . powerful explosions rocked several madrid train stations during morning rush hour .
news reports said two bombs went off in a high-speed commuter train arriving at the busy downtown atocha station at 7:30 a.m. local time .
blasts also ripped through two other stops - santa eugenia and el pozo - on a southeastern commuter line leading to atocha , the news agency efe reported .
spanish national radio quoted witnesses saying they saw people lying on the ground and train cars ripped open .
people in tears and bloodied could be seen running away from the station in panic .
the spanish interior ministry has reported at least 182 people dead and more than 900 injured .
hospitals appealed for people to donate blood .
make-shift emergency rooms were set up in neighboring sports centers , and taxis and buses were turned into ambulances to transport the severely wounded to nearby emergency rooms .
the country 's rail authority renfe has halted all commuter traffic into the capital .
politicians for the major parties have called off all campaigning ahead of the weekend 's general election .
the work of eta ?
so far there has been no claim of responsibility , but police were quick to point their finger at the basque separatist group eta .
security offices throughout the country have been on high alert for separatist violence ahead of the country 's general elections on sunday .
spain 's conservative ruling party , which has built up its campaign on a hard-line stance against eta , is currently leading in the polls .
in the last several weeks , the government has made several high-profile arrests of eta members .
" this is a collective killing by the criminal band which is eta , " government spokesman eduardo zaplana told cadena ser radio station .
spain 's interior ministry also said tests showed the explosives used in the attacks were a kind of dynamite normally used by eta .
aznar 's office said the explosives were a material called titadine , a kind of compressed dynamite found in a van-bomb intercepted last month as it headed for madrid , according to an associated press report .
on feb .
29 , police intercepted a madrid-bound van packed with more than 500 kilos -lrb- 1,100 pounds -rrb- of explosives traced back to the basque separatists ; two men were arrested on charges of terrorism .
on christmas eve , police thwarted an attempted bombing at chamartin , another madrid rail station , and arrested two suspected eta members .
the leader of the banned basque separatist party batasuna , however , denied that its armed group eta was behind the coordinated bombings . speaking on radio popular arnold otegi blamed " arab resistance " for the attacks , the worst in spain 's history .
history of terror bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wreckage of a spanish intercity train destroyed by an explosion lies on the track at atocha railway station in madrid spain , thursday , march 11 , 2004 .
the european union and the united states have listed eta , which stands for basque homeland and freedom , as a terrorist organization .
the group has committed itself to an armed fight for an independent basque state , comprising the basque regions of north-western spain as well as parts of southern france .
a partial cease fire announced in feb .
18 for the region of catalonia has done little to reduce the group 's potential threat to security in spain ahead of the elections .
in the past eta has been known to stage attacks around big events and anniversaries .
in the run-up to the last general election four years ago , eta ended a 14-month cease fire with a series of deadly bombings in madrid and the basque country .

there she meets a turkish-german alcoholic punk cahit , played by birol ünel -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , who is twice her age .

"
" head-on , " the much talked-about german film which won the berlin film festival 's highest award , opens in theaters in germany on thursday .
the movie gained notoriety when its female star 's porn past came to light . " head-on " by director fatih akin has seen some turbulent times in the weeks before its official release .
it was first hailed by the media for putting german film back on the map when it won the coveted golden bear at last month 's berlinale , being the first german film to take top honors there in 18 years .
barely a week later , the mass-circulation tabloid bild revealed that the film 's female star , 23-year-old sibel kekilli , had made pornographic films in the past .
critics might argue that either way the film has benefited from the wave of publicity , but now german viewers will get the chance to cut through the sensationalism and make up their own minds about " head-on " when it opens across germany on thursday .
sex , drugs and violence the story tells of the painful emancipation of a young german-turkish woman played by kekilli , who lands in a psychiatric clinic after a suicide attempt .
there she meets a turkish-german alcoholic punk cahit , played by birol ünel -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , who is twice her age .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish-born actors sibel kekilli , left , and birol ünel anxious to escape the clutches of her conservative family , sibel convinces cahit to enter into a marriage of convenience with her .
their wedding marks the beginning of a life of freedom for sibel , who 's eager to try out parties , drugs and lots of sex .
as sibel and cahit live it up and indulge in separate sexual affairs , the two eventually fall in love .
the love story ends , however , when cahit kills one of sibel 's lovers in a jealous rage .
controversy among the turks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fatih akin , german director of turkish origin hamburg-based director akin -lrb- photo -rrb- , 31 , is the son of turkish immigrants .
he is aware that the german-turkish love story is bound to spark controversy among the more conservative members of germany 's 2.5-million-strong turkish community . even before the film has been released to the wider public , the director has been accused of exploiting the problems facing turkish women in germany in his film .
" there 's already a discussion on the internet calling for a boycott of the film , " akin said in an interview with deutsche welle .
but the director , whose has in the past explored the issue of young turks in germany straddling two cultures , says the release of the film will straighten out things .
he has won critical acclaim for his previous films , " short sharp shock " , " solino " and " in july . "
" those who 've seen the film , whether it 's been poor people or rich , whether conservatives or left-leaning people , women or men - all were pretty convinced so far , " akin said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 11.03.2004 parliament approves pension reform plan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an important part of schröder 's reform program has become law .
a plan to reform germany 's state-backed pension system has passed a vote in parliament .
the reform aims to stabilize the system in the long term in the face of a rapidly ageing population . germany 's younger generation will have to start taking more responsibility for their retirement , since after today 's vote the country 's state-backed pensions will not be as generous in the future .
the german parliament , or bundestag , passed the reform plan as expected with a necessary majority of social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- and green party members , 302 in total .
the opposition cast 291 votes against the plan and one spd member abstained .
the reform plan does not need to go to the upper house , the bundesrat , for approval .
the plan , introduced last year as part of chancellor gerhard schröder 's agenda 2010 spate of labor market and welfare reforms , changes the formula that determines how pension benefit levels are set and tries to limit the growing rising contribution rates employees pay into the system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulla schmidt according to ulla schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- , the minister for health and social security , a state pension alone in the future will no longer be enough to maintain living standards employees had before they retired .
overview a central element of the reform takes into consideration germany 's graying population and seeks to slow down annual rises in pension benefits .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pensioners will have to get by with less .
low birth rates and increased longevity have led to critical pressures on the system , a pay-as-you-go plan based on tax-paying workers supporting retirees through compulsory contributions .
as the ratio of working-age germans to pensioners narrows , expected to fall from two taxpayers per retiree to one over the next decades , the system is becoming increasingly unsustainable .
in the future , pension benefit rates will rise more slowly than overall income levels .
pensioners will have to forego an increase in benefits this year .
next year , as the formula comes into effect , modest increases of .38 percent in western germany and .61 percent in the eastern part of the country are expected .
obligatory contributions to the state system , which are paid jointly by employees and employers , are now set at 19.5 percent of wages .
according to the government , these contributions will stay under 20 percent until 2020 and will remain under 22 percent until 2030 .
currently , pension benefits stand at about 53 percent of the average wage of the retiree during his or her working life , less social security contributions .
according to estimated government revenues , pension benefits will fall to 46 percent of the average wage by 2020 and down to around 43 percent by 2030 .
but in order to quell a possible rebellion by some left-leaning spd members , the government has introduced a clause that requires future governments to keep pension payments from falling below the 43 percent mark in the future .
the reform plan makes this possible by increasing federal contributions to the system from tax revenues or raising the retirement age from 65 to 67 .
the parliament will decide on the retirement age increase in 2008 at the earliest .
fuzzy math opposition politicians accused the government coalition of using numbers that do not add up .
according to horst seehofer , the social affairs point man for the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , setting a benefits floor at 46 percent while limiting the contributions ceiling to 22 percent by 2030 is not possible .
maintaining the 46 percent rate would require an increase of contribution levels to 24 percent , or a retirement age of 70 .
" otherwise , these aims make no sense , " he told reporters , accusing the government 's reform of being only a prelude to further cuts .
politicians from the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- also had sharp words for the benefits floor .
heinrich kolb , social affairs expert for the fdp , criticized the 46 percent number as being unrealistic .
" those who do n't want to go under the 46 percent mark ca n't be committed to maintaining the system 's sustainability , " he told the associated press . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parliament freezes pensions german pensioners will get less money next year after parliament voted to cap pensions and require the elderly to pay for nursing insurance .

the german government wants to lock away particularly violent criminals and sex offenders with a law that would allow them to be held indefinitely in preventive detention even after they have been sentenced to prison . when the partly-charred body of eight-year-old julia was found on a smoldering wood pile near giessen in the state of hesse in july 2001 , the brutality of the crime shook the nation . german chancellor gerhard schröder said at the time about the culprit : " lock him away - and forever . "
exactly three weeks ago , the 35-year-old culprit thorsten volk was sentenced for the murder and sexual abuse of julia . though julia 's tormentor and murderer might be a free man someday , the same may not be the case for future offenders considered too dangerous to be walking around freely , if chancellor schröder 's government has its way . protecting society from madmen on wednesday , the schröder 's cabinet agreed on a legal blueprint that will enable lawmakers to incarcerate accused individuals before trial on the assumption that their release would compromise the security of society . the practice , known as " preventive detention , " can in future also be used in the case of criminals who have served their sentence in jail but are still deemed too risky to be allowed to move freely outside prison walls .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte zypries , german justice minister german justice minister brigitte zypries -lrb- photo -rrb- said that the planned legislation would serve to protect society from dangerous criminals as far as possible .
preventive legislation , as opposed to a normal prison sentence , can be applied for an indefinite period of time . " ultimate means in penal law " zypries added that the planned law would also allow judges to recommend preventive detention even if the danger posed by the criminal is only confirmed after his sentencing , such as in the case of a sexual offender , whose earlier series of rape come to light after he 's already received a jail term .
" with it , it 's possible that one could remain in preventive detention till the end of his life , " zypries said . up to now , the provision of preventive detention in germany , had to be contained in the verdict or at least be mentioned as a caveat , though exceptions have been made in four cases . at the same time the justice minister stressed that the practice of preventive detention had to be subject to stringent checks and requirements since it dealt with " imprisonment without guilt " and " absolute measures . "
zypries added that it should only be applied as a last resort . also applicable to teenagers the proposed law governing preventive detention is a reaction by schröder 's government to a february ruling by germany 's constitutional court that overturned similar state laws , saying that only the federal government had the right to implement such laws .
in an additional ruling , the judges agreed that unlimited preventive detention was indeed in accordance with the constitution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inmates in prison the german government has also made clear that preventive detention could only be applied in the case of particularly dangerous criminals who have been sentenced to at least four years in prison and whose victims ' lives have been physically threatened . it would be applicable to culprits who were deemed " risky " even after undergoing psychiatric treatment and to delinquents between 18 and 21 years as well .
the decision to implement preventive detention would also have to be reviewed every two years . critics slam proposed legislation the proposed legislation , which is expected to become law in summer , has its share of critics . one of them is christian ströbele , a parliamentarian of the green party , the junior partner in the ruling government coalition .
" the result is n't acceptable in this current form , " ströbele told the süddeutsche zeitung daily .
ströbele slammed the fact that the law could in future be applied to young adults aged 18 and above in particular , as well as for criminals who would be sentenced for the first time . even erwin huber , head of the bavarian state chancellery and member of the opposition conservative christian social union , rejected the draft legislation as " unsatisfactory " and added that it was n't clear why preventive detention could only be applied in the case of a minimum sentencing of four years .

exactly three weeks ago , the 35-year-old culprit thorsten volk was sentenced for the murder and sexual abuse of julia . though julia 's tormentor and murderer might be a free man someday , the same may not be the case for future offenders considered too dangerous to be walking around freely , if chancellor schröder 's government has its way . protecting society from madmen on wednesday , the schröder 's cabinet agreed on a legal blueprint that will enable lawmakers to incarcerate accused individuals before trial on the assumption that their release would compromise the security of society . the practice , known as " preventive detention , " can in future also be used in the case of criminals who have served their sentence in jail but are still deemed too risky to be allowed to move freely outside prison walls .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte zypries , german justice minister german justice minister brigitte zypries -lrb- photo -rrb- said that the planned legislation would serve to protect society from dangerous criminals as far as possible .
preventive legislation , as opposed to a normal prison sentence , can be applied for an indefinite period of time . " ultimate means in penal law " zypries added that the planned law would also allow judges to recommend preventive detention even if the danger posed by the criminal is only confirmed after his sentencing , such as in the case of a sexual offender , whose earlier series of rape come to light after he 's already received a jail term .
" with it , it 's possible that one could remain in preventive detention till the end of his life , " zypries said . up to now , the provision of preventive detention in germany , had to be contained in the verdict or at least be mentioned as a caveat , though exceptions have been made in four cases . at the same time the justice minister stressed that the practice of preventive detention had to be subject to stringent checks and requirements since it dealt with " imprisonment without guilt " and " absolute measures . "
zypries added that it should only be applied as a last resort . also applicable to teenagers the proposed law governing preventive detention is a reaction by schröder 's government to a february ruling by germany 's constitutional court that overturned similar state laws , saying that only the federal government had the right to implement such laws .
in an additional ruling , the judges agreed that unlimited preventive detention was indeed in accordance with the constitution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inmates in prison the german government has also made clear that preventive detention could only be applied in the case of particularly dangerous criminals who have been sentenced to at least four years in prison and whose victims ' lives have been physically threatened . it would be applicable to culprits who were deemed " risky " even after undergoing psychiatric treatment and to delinquents between 18 and 21 years as well .
the decision to implement preventive detention would also have to be reviewed every two years . critics slam proposed legislation the proposed legislation , which is expected to become law in summer , has its share of critics . one of them is christian ströbele , a parliamentarian of the green party , the junior partner in the ruling government coalition .
" the result is n't acceptable in this current form , " ströbele told the süddeutsche zeitung daily .
ströbele slammed the fact that the law could in future be applied to young adults aged 18 and above in particular , as well as for criminals who would be sentenced for the first time . even erwin huber , head of the bavarian state chancellery and member of the opposition conservative christian social union , rejected the draft legislation as " unsatisfactory " and added that it was n't clear why preventive detention could only be applied in the case of a minimum sentencing of four years .

the german government wants to lock away particularly violent criminals and sex offenders with a law that would allow them to be held indefinitely in preventive detention even after they have been sentenced to prison . when the partly-charred body of eight-year-old julia was found on a smoldering wood pile near giessen in the state of hesse in july 2001 , the brutality of the crime shook the nation . german chancellor gerhard schröder said at the time about the culprit : " lock him away - and forever . "
exactly three weeks ago , the 35-year-old culprit thorsten volk was sentenced for the murder and sexual abuse of julia . though julia 's tormentor and murderer might be a free man someday , the same may not be the case for future offenders considered too dangerous to be walking around freely , if chancellor schröder 's government has its way . protecting society from madmen on wednesday , the schröder 's cabinet agreed on a legal blueprint that will enable lawmakers to incarcerate accused individuals before trial on the assumption that their release would compromise the security of society . the practice , known as " preventive detention , " can in future also be used in the case of criminals who have served their sentence in jail but are still deemed too risky to be allowed to move freely outside prison walls .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte zypries , german justice minister german justice minister brigitte zypries -lrb- photo -rrb- said that the planned legislation would serve to protect society from dangerous criminals as far as possible .
preventive legislation , as opposed to a normal prison sentence , can be applied for an indefinite period of time . " ultimate means in penal law " zypries added that the planned law would also allow judges to recommend preventive detention even if the danger posed by the criminal is only confirmed after his sentencing , such as in the case of a sexual offender , whose earlier series of rape come to light after he 's already received a jail term .
" with it , it 's possible that one could remain in preventive detention till the end of his life , " zypries said . up to now , the provision of preventive detention in germany , had to be contained in the verdict or at least be mentioned as a caveat , though exceptions have been made in four cases . at the same time the justice minister stressed that the practice of preventive detention had to be subject to stringent checks and requirements since it dealt with " imprisonment without guilt " and " absolute measures . "
zypries added that it should only be applied as a last resort . also applicable to teenagers the proposed law governing preventive detention is a reaction by schröder 's government to a february ruling by germany 's constitutional court that overturned similar state laws , saying that only the federal government had the right to implement such laws .
in an additional ruling , the judges agreed that unlimited preventive detention was indeed in accordance with the constitution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inmates in prison the german government has also made clear that preventive detention could only be applied in the case of particularly dangerous criminals who have been sentenced to at least four years in prison and whose victims ' lives have been physically threatened . it would be applicable to culprits who were deemed " risky " even after undergoing psychiatric treatment and to delinquents between 18 and 21 years as well .
the decision to implement preventive detention would also have to be reviewed every two years . critics slam proposed legislation the proposed legislation , which is expected to become law in summer , has its share of critics . one of them is christian ströbele , a parliamentarian of the green party , the junior partner in the ruling government coalition .
" the result is n't acceptable in this current form , " ströbele told the süddeutsche zeitung daily .
ströbele slammed the fact that the law could in future be applied to young adults aged 18 and above in particular , as well as for criminals who would be sentenced for the first time . even erwin huber , head of the bavarian state chancellery and member of the opposition conservative christian social union , rejected the draft legislation as " unsatisfactory " and added that it was n't clear why preventive detention could only be applied in the case of a minimum sentencing of four years .

after reportedly tense negotiations over who will run the show , it emerged that nato will only keep " a couple of hundred " people , mostly civilians in the former yugoslav republic .
the united states has been keen to retain some control of the operation , something which had not gone down well in brussels .
the mission is likely to be the eu ’ s most taxing militarily and logistically .
nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer , said on wednesday after a meeting with the eu head of foreign policy , javier solana , that there would be a chain of command which is " good and transparent , " according to the spanish paper el mundo .
solana said that after the eu takes over - which is expected towards the end of this year - nato ’ s force would be " some hundreds of people , many of them civilians , more looking into questions of intelligence and maintaining vigilance over possible contacts with other terrorist organizations .

under the new directive , which is set to become national law in 2006 , eu citizens who live in member states other than their own for five years automatically be accorded permanent residence .
the residency rights will also apply to partners as long as the member state where the couple want to move recognizes the partnership .
this means that a non-eu citizen with a gay partner in denmark could move to belgium and have automatic residence rights , since partnerships between gay couples are recognized in both countries .
however , the same would not apply if the couple were to move to spain or greece , where gay partnerships are n't legally recognized .

a plan to reform germany 's state-backed pension system has passed a vote in parliament .
the reform aims to stabilize the system in the long term in the face of a rapidly ageing population . germany 's younger generation will have to start taking more responsibility for their retirement , since after today 's vote the country 's state-backed pensions will not be as generous in the future .
the german parliament , or bundestag , passed the reform plan as expected with a necessary majority of social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- and green party members , 302 in total .
the opposition cast 291 votes against the plan and one spd member abstained .
the reform plan does not need to go to the upper house , the bundesrat , for approval .
the plan , introduced last year as part of chancellor gerhard schröder 's agenda 2010 spate of labor market and welfare reforms , changes the formula that determines how pension benefit levels are set and tries to limit the growing rising contribution rates employees pay into the system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulla schmidt according to ulla schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- , the minister for health and social security , a state pension alone in the future will no longer be enough to maintain living standards employees had before they retired .
overview a central element of the reform takes into consideration germany 's graying population and seeks to slow down annual rises in pension benefits .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pensioners will have to get by with less .
low birth rates and increased longevity have led to critical pressures on the system , a pay-as-you-go plan based on tax-paying workers supporting retirees through compulsory contributions .
as the ratio of working-age germans to pensioners narrows , expected to fall from two taxpayers per retiree to one over the next decades , the system is becoming increasingly unsustainable .
in the future , pension benefit rates will rise more slowly than overall income levels .
pensioners will have to forego an increase in benefits this year .
next year , as the formula comes into effect , modest increases of .38 percent in western germany and .61 percent in the eastern part of the country are expected .
obligatory contributions to the state system , which are paid jointly by employees and employers , are now set at 19.5 percent of wages .
according to the government , these contributions will stay under 20 percent until 2020 and will remain under 22 percent until 2030 .
currently , pension benefits stand at about 53 percent of the average wage of the retiree during his or her working life , less social security contributions .
according to estimated government revenues , pension benefits will fall to 46 percent of the average wage by 2020 and down to around 43 percent by 2030 .
but in order to quell a possible rebellion by some left-leaning spd members , the government has introduced a clause that requires future governments to keep pension payments from falling below the 43 percent mark in the future .
the reform plan makes this possible by increasing federal contributions to the system from tax revenues or raising the retirement age from 65 to 67 .
the parliament will decide on the retirement age increase in 2008 at the earliest .
fuzzy math opposition politicians accused the government coalition of using numbers that do not add up .
according to horst seehofer , the social affairs point man for the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , setting a benefits floor at 46 percent while limiting the contributions ceiling to 22 percent by 2030 is not possible .
maintaining the 46 percent rate would require an increase of contribution levels to 24 percent , or a retirement age of 70 .
" otherwise , these aims make no sense , " he told reporters , accusing the government 's reform of being only a prelude to further cuts .
politicians from the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- also had sharp words for the benefits floor .
heinrich kolb , social affairs expert for the fdp , criticized the 46 percent number as being unrealistic .
" those who do n't want to go under the 46 percent mark ca n't be committed to maintaining the system 's sustainability , " he told the associated press . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parliament freezes pensions german pensioners will get less money next year after parliament voted to cap pensions and require the elderly to pay for nursing insurance .

low birth rates and increased longevity have led to critical pressures on the system , a pay-as-you-go plan based on tax-paying workers supporting retirees through compulsory contributions .
as the ratio of working-age germans to pensioners narrows , expected to fall from two taxpayers per retiree to one over the next decades , the system is becoming increasingly unsustainable .
in the future , pension benefit rates will rise more slowly than overall income levels .
pensioners will have to forego an increase in benefits this year .
next year , as the formula comes into effect , modest increases of .38 percent in western germany and .61 percent in the eastern part of the country are expected .
obligatory contributions to the state system , which are paid jointly by employees and employers , are now set at 19.5 percent of wages .
according to the government , these contributions will stay under 20 percent until 2020 and will remain under 22 percent until 2030 .
currently , pension benefits stand at about 53 percent of the average wage of the retiree during his or her working life , less social security contributions .
according to estimated government revenues , pension benefits will fall to 46 percent of the average wage by 2020 and down to around 43 percent by 2030 .
but in order to quell a possible rebellion by some left-leaning spd members , the government has introduced a clause that requires future governments to keep pension payments from falling below the 43 percent mark in the future .
the reform plan makes this possible by increasing federal contributions to the system from tax revenues or raising the retirement age from 65 to 67 .
the parliament will decide on the retirement age increase in 2008 at the earliest .

according to horst seehofer , the social affairs point man for the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , setting a benefits floor at 46 percent while limiting the contributions ceiling to 22 percent by 2030 is not possible .
maintaining the 46 percent rate would require an increase of contribution levels to 24 percent , or a retirement age of 70 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 11.03.2004 -pipe- 14:00 utc eu-nato deal on bosnia closer nato will only have a " residual role " in bosnia once the eu takes over peacekeeping operations there .
after reportedly tense negotiations over who will run the show , it emerged that nato will only keep " a couple of hundred " people , mostly civilians in the former yugoslav republic .
the united states has been keen to retain some control of the operation , something which had not gone down well in brussels .
the mission is likely to be the eu ’ s most taxing militarily and logistically .
nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer , said on wednesday after a meeting with the eu head of foreign policy , javier solana , that there would be a chain of command which is " good and transparent , " according to the spanish paper el mundo .

profits dropped to € 1.947 billion -lrb- $ 2.414 billion -rrb- from € 2.020 billion in 2002 .
the company said the downswing was due to rising costs connected to changes in germany 's early retirement law and differences in corporate tax credits .
the southern german carmaker also said it had increased expenses related to the launch of several new models , including a new version of its mainstay 5-series .
despite the drop in profits , chief executive officer helmut panke said the company met all its targets and was on track for " positive development in the current financial year by increasing sales volumes and earnings . "
with its focus on more expensive models , bmw has managed to survive a slump in consumer demand for european autos better than the larger german carmakers daimlerchrysler and volkswagen , who have focused efforts on producing for the highly competitive mid-price range .
bmw was also better equipped to shield itself from the effects of the strong euro by producing key models at its u.s. plant in south carolina . dw-world.de volkswagen faces " miserable " earnings europe 's biggest carmaker blamed a sluggish auto market , the poor german economy and the weak dollar for a sharp downturn in profits .
it plans to slash jobs and introduce a cost-cutting program to counteract the effects .

after reportedly tense negotiations over who will run the show , it emerged that nato will only keep " a couple of hundred " people , mostly civilians in the former yugoslav republic .
the united states has been keen to retain some control of the operation , something which had not gone down well in brussels .
the mission is likely to be the eu ’ s most taxing militarily and logistically .
nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer , said on wednesday after a meeting with the eu head of foreign policy , javier solana , that there would be a chain of command which is " good and transparent , " according to the spanish paper el mundo .
solana said that after the eu takes over - which is expected towards the end of this year - nato ’ s force would be " some hundreds of people , many of them civilians , more looking into questions of intelligence and maintaining vigilance over possible contacts with other terrorist organizations .

the german government wants to lock away particularly violent criminals and sex offenders with a law that would allow them to be held indefinitely in preventive detention even after they have been sentenced to prison . when the partly-charred body of eight-year-old julia was found on a smoldering wood pile near giessen in the state of hesse in july 2001 , the brutality of the crime shook the nation . german chancellor gerhard schröder said at the time about the culprit : " lock him away - and forever . "
exactly three weeks ago , the 35-year-old culprit thorsten volk was sentenced for the murder and sexual abuse of julia . though julia 's tormentor and murderer might be a free man someday , the same may not be the case for future offenders considered too dangerous to be walking around freely , if chancellor schröder 's government has its way . protecting society from madmen on wednesday , the schröder 's cabinet agreed on a legal blueprint that will enable lawmakers to incarcerate accused individuals before trial on the assumption that their release would compromise the security of society . the practice , known as " preventive detention , " can in future also be used in the case of criminals who have served their sentence in jail but are still deemed too risky to be allowed to move freely outside prison walls .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte zypries , german justice minister german justice minister brigitte zypries -lrb- photo -rrb- said that the planned legislation would serve to protect society from dangerous criminals as far as possible .
preventive legislation , as opposed to a normal prison sentence , can be applied for an indefinite period of time . " ultimate means in penal law " zypries added that the planned law would also allow judges to recommend preventive detention even if the danger posed by the criminal is only confirmed after his sentencing , such as in the case of a sexual offender , whose earlier series of rape come to light after he 's already received a jail term .
" with it , it 's possible that one could remain in preventive detention till the end of his life , " zypries said . up to now , the provision of preventive detention in germany , had to be contained in the verdict or at least be mentioned as a caveat , though exceptions have been made in four cases . at the same time the justice minister stressed that the practice of preventive detention had to be subject to stringent checks and requirements since it dealt with " imprisonment without guilt " and " absolute measures . "
zypries added that it should only be applied as a last resort . also applicable to teenagers the proposed law governing preventive detention is a reaction by schröder 's government to a february ruling by germany 's constitutional court that overturned similar state laws , saying that only the federal government had the right to implement such laws .
in an additional ruling , the judges agreed that unlimited preventive detention was indeed in accordance with the constitution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inmates in prison the german government has also made clear that preventive detention could only be applied in the case of particularly dangerous criminals who have been sentenced to at least four years in prison and whose victims ' lives have been physically threatened . it would be applicable to culprits who were deemed " risky " even after undergoing psychiatric treatment and to delinquents between 18 and 21 years as well .
the decision to implement preventive detention would also have to be reviewed every two years . critics slam proposed legislation the proposed legislation , which is expected to become law in summer , has its share of critics . one of them is christian ströbele , a parliamentarian of the green party , the junior partner in the ruling government coalition .
" the result is n't acceptable in this current form , " ströbele told the süddeutsche zeitung daily .
ströbele slammed the fact that the law could in future be applied to young adults aged 18 and above in particular , as well as for criminals who would be sentenced for the first time . even erwin huber , head of the bavarian state chancellery and member of the opposition conservative christian social union , rejected the draft legislation as " unsatisfactory " and added that it was n't clear why preventive detention could only be applied in the case of a minimum sentencing of four years .

" with it , it 's possible that one could remain in preventive detention till the end of his life , " zypries said . up to now , the provision of preventive detention in germany , had to be contained in the verdict or at least be mentioned as a caveat , though exceptions have been made in four cases . at the same time the justice minister stressed that the practice of preventive detention had to be subject to stringent checks and requirements since it dealt with " imprisonment without guilt " and " absolute measures .

the german government wants to lock away particularly violent criminals and sex offenders with a law that would allow them to be held indefinitely in preventive detention even after they have been sentenced to prison . when the partly-charred body of eight-year-old julia was found on a smoldering wood pile near giessen in the state of hesse in july 2001 , the brutality of the crime shook the nation . german chancellor gerhard schröder said at the time about the culprit : " lock him away - and forever . "
exactly three weeks ago , the 35-year-old culprit thorsten volk was sentenced for the murder and sexual abuse of julia . though julia 's tormentor and murderer might be a free man someday , the same may not be the case for future offenders considered too dangerous to be walking around freely , if chancellor schröder 's government has its way . protecting society from madmen on wednesday , the schröder 's cabinet agreed on a legal blueprint that will enable lawmakers to incarcerate accused individuals before trial on the assumption that their release would compromise the security of society . the practice , known as " preventive detention , " can in future also be used in the case of criminals who have served their sentence in jail but are still deemed too risky to be allowed to move freely outside prison walls .

a plan to reform germany 's state-backed pension system has passed a vote in parliament .
the reform aims to stabilize the system in the long term in the face of a rapidly ageing population . germany 's younger generation will have to start taking more responsibility for their retirement , since after today 's vote the country 's state-backed pensions will not be as generous in the future .
the german parliament , or bundestag , passed the reform plan as expected with a necessary majority of social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- and green party members , 302 in total .
the opposition cast 291 votes against the plan and one spd member abstained .
the reform plan does not need to go to the upper house , the bundesrat , for approval .
the plan , introduced last year as part of chancellor gerhard schröder 's agenda 2010 spate of labor market and welfare reforms , changes the formula that determines how pension benefit levels are set and tries to limit the growing rising contribution rates employees pay into the system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulla schmidt according to ulla schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- , the minister for health and social security , a state pension alone in the future will no longer be enough to maintain living standards employees had before they retired .
overview a central element of the reform takes into consideration germany 's graying population and seeks to slow down annual rises in pension benefits .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pensioners will have to get by with less .
low birth rates and increased longevity have led to critical pressures on the system , a pay-as-you-go plan based on tax-paying workers supporting retirees through compulsory contributions .
as the ratio of working-age germans to pensioners narrows , expected to fall from two taxpayers per retiree to one over the next decades , the system is becoming increasingly unsustainable .
in the future , pension benefit rates will rise more slowly than overall income levels .
pensioners will have to forego an increase in benefits this year .
next year , as the formula comes into effect , modest increases of .38 percent in western germany and .61 percent in the eastern part of the country are expected .
obligatory contributions to the state system , which are paid jointly by employees and employers , are now set at 19.5 percent of wages .
according to the government , these contributions will stay under 20 percent until 2020 and will remain under 22 percent until 2030 .
currently , pension benefits stand at about 53 percent of the average wage of the retiree during his or her working life , less social security contributions .
according to estimated government revenues , pension benefits will fall to 46 percent of the average wage by 2020 and down to around 43 percent by 2030 .
but in order to quell a possible rebellion by some left-leaning spd members , the government has introduced a clause that requires future governments to keep pension payments from falling below the 43 percent mark in the future .
the reform plan makes this possible by increasing federal contributions to the system from tax revenues or raising the retirement age from 65 to 67 .
the parliament will decide on the retirement age increase in 2008 at the earliest .
fuzzy math opposition politicians accused the government coalition of using numbers that do not add up .
according to horst seehofer , the social affairs point man for the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , setting a benefits floor at 46 percent while limiting the contributions ceiling to 22 percent by 2030 is not possible .
maintaining the 46 percent rate would require an increase of contribution levels to 24 percent , or a retirement age of 70 .
" otherwise , these aims make no sense , " he told reporters , accusing the government 's reform of being only a prelude to further cuts .
politicians from the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- also had sharp words for the benefits floor .
heinrich kolb , social affairs expert for the fdp , criticized the 46 percent number as being unrealistic .
" those who do n't want to go under the 46 percent mark ca n't be committed to maintaining the system 's sustainability , " he told the associated press . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parliament freezes pensions german pensioners will get less money next year after parliament voted to cap pensions and require the elderly to pay for nursing insurance .

the german parliament , or bundestag , passed the reform plan as expected with a necessary majority of social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- and green party members , 302 in total .
the opposition cast 291 votes against the plan and one spd member abstained .
the reform plan does not need to go to the upper house , the bundesrat , for approval .
the plan , introduced last year as part of chancellor gerhard schröder 's agenda 2010 spate of labor market and welfare reforms , changes the formula that determines how pension benefit levels are set and tries to limit the growing rising contribution rates employees pay into the system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulla schmidt according to ulla schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- , the minister for health and social security , a state pension alone in the future will no longer be enough to maintain living standards employees had before they retired .
overview a central element of the reform takes into consideration germany 's graying population and seeks to slow down annual rises in pension benefits .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pensioners will have to get by with less .
low birth rates and increased longevity have led to critical pressures on the system , a pay-as-you-go plan based on tax-paying workers supporting retirees through compulsory contributions .
as the ratio of working-age germans to pensioners narrows , expected to fall from two taxpayers per retiree to one over the next decades , the system is becoming increasingly unsustainable .
in the future , pension benefit rates will rise more slowly than overall income levels .
pensioners will have to forego an increase in benefits this year .
next year , as the formula comes into effect , modest increases of .38 percent in western germany and .61 percent in the eastern part of the country are expected .
obligatory contributions to the state system , which are paid jointly by employees and employers , are now set at 19.5 percent of wages .
according to the government , these contributions will stay under 20 percent until 2020 and will remain under 22 percent until 2030 .
currently , pension benefits stand at about 53 percent of the average wage of the retiree during his or her working life , less social security contributions .
according to estimated government revenues , pension benefits will fall to 46 percent of the average wage by 2020 and down to around 43 percent by 2030 .
but in order to quell a possible rebellion by some left-leaning spd members , the government has introduced a clause that requires future governments to keep pension payments from falling below the 43 percent mark in the future .
the reform plan makes this possible by increasing federal contributions to the system from tax revenues or raising the retirement age from 65 to 67 .
the parliament will decide on the retirement age increase in 2008 at the earliest .
fuzzy math opposition politicians accused the government coalition of using numbers that do not add up .
according to horst seehofer , the social affairs point man for the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , setting a benefits floor at 46 percent while limiting the contributions ceiling to 22 percent by 2030 is not possible .
maintaining the 46 percent rate would require an increase of contribution levels to 24 percent , or a retirement age of 70 .
" otherwise , these aims make no sense , " he told reporters , accusing the government 's reform of being only a prelude to further cuts .
politicians from the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- also had sharp words for the benefits floor .
heinrich kolb , social affairs expert for the fdp , criticized the 46 percent number as being unrealistic .
" those who do n't want to go under the 46 percent mark ca n't be committed to maintaining the system 's sustainability , " he told the associated press . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parliament freezes pensions german pensioners will get less money next year after parliament voted to cap pensions and require the elderly to pay for nursing insurance .

a plan to reform germany 's state-backed pension system has passed a vote in parliament .
the reform aims to stabilize the system in the long term in the face of a rapidly ageing population . germany 's younger generation will have to start taking more responsibility for their retirement , since after today 's vote the country 's state-backed pensions will not be as generous in the future .
the german parliament , or bundestag , passed the reform plan as expected with a necessary majority of social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- and green party members , 302 in total .
the opposition cast 291 votes against the plan and one spd member abstained .
the reform plan does not need to go to the upper house , the bundesrat , for approval .
the plan , introduced last year as part of chancellor gerhard schröder 's agenda 2010 spate of labor market and welfare reforms , changes the formula that determines how pension benefit levels are set and tries to limit the growing rising contribution rates employees pay into the system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulla schmidt according to ulla schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- , the minister for health and social security , a state pension alone in the future will no longer be enough to maintain living standards employees had before they retired .
overview a central element of the reform takes into consideration germany 's graying population and seeks to slow down annual rises in pension benefits .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pensioners will have to get by with less .
low birth rates and increased longevity have led to critical pressures on the system , a pay-as-you-go plan based on tax-paying workers supporting retirees through compulsory contributions .
as the ratio of working-age germans to pensioners narrows , expected to fall from two taxpayers per retiree to one over the next decades , the system is becoming increasingly unsustainable .
in the future , pension benefit rates will rise more slowly than overall income levels .
pensioners will have to forego an increase in benefits this year .
next year , as the formula comes into effect , modest increases of .38 percent in western germany and .61 percent in the eastern part of the country are expected .
obligatory contributions to the state system , which are paid jointly by employees and employers , are now set at 19.5 percent of wages .
according to the government , these contributions will stay under 20 percent until 2020 and will remain under 22 percent until 2030 .
currently , pension benefits stand at about 53 percent of the average wage of the retiree during his or her working life , less social security contributions .
according to estimated government revenues , pension benefits will fall to 46 percent of the average wage by 2020 and down to around 43 percent by 2030 .
but in order to quell a possible rebellion by some left-leaning spd members , the government has introduced a clause that requires future governments to keep pension payments from falling below the 43 percent mark in the future .
the reform plan makes this possible by increasing federal contributions to the system from tax revenues or raising the retirement age from 65 to 67 .
the parliament will decide on the retirement age increase in 2008 at the earliest .
fuzzy math opposition politicians accused the government coalition of using numbers that do not add up .
according to horst seehofer , the social affairs point man for the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , setting a benefits floor at 46 percent while limiting the contributions ceiling to 22 percent by 2030 is not possible .
maintaining the 46 percent rate would require an increase of contribution levels to 24 percent , or a retirement age of 70 .
" otherwise , these aims make no sense , " he told reporters , accusing the government 's reform of being only a prelude to further cuts .
politicians from the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- also had sharp words for the benefits floor .
heinrich kolb , social affairs expert for the fdp , criticized the 46 percent number as being unrealistic .
" those who do n't want to go under the 46 percent mark ca n't be committed to maintaining the system 's sustainability , " he told the associated press . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parliament freezes pensions german pensioners will get less money next year after parliament voted to cap pensions and require the elderly to pay for nursing insurance .

"
" head-on , " the much talked-about german film which won the berlin film festival 's highest award , opens in theaters in germany on thursday .
the movie gained notoriety when its female star 's porn past came to light . " head-on " by director fatih akin has seen some turbulent times in the weeks before its official release .
it was first hailed by the media for putting german film back on the map when it won the coveted golden bear at last month 's berlinale , being the first german film to take top honors there in 18 years .
barely a week later , the mass-circulation tabloid bild revealed that the film 's female star , 23-year-old sibel kekilli , had made pornographic films in the past .
critics might argue that either way the film has benefited from the wave of publicity , but now german viewers will get the chance to cut through the sensationalism and make up their own minds about " head-on " when it opens across germany on thursday .
sex , drugs and violence the story tells of the painful emancipation of a young german-turkish woman played by kekilli , who lands in a psychiatric clinic after a suicide attempt .
there she meets a turkish-german alcoholic punk cahit , played by birol ünel -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , who is twice her age .

as sibel and cahit live it up and indulge in separate sexual affairs , the two eventually fall in love .
the love story ends , however , when cahit kills one of sibel 's lovers in a jealous rage .

he is aware that the german-turkish love story is bound to spark controversy among the more conservative members of germany 's 2.5-million-strong turkish community . even before the film has been released to the wider public , the director has been accused of exploiting the problems facing turkish women in germany in his film .
" there 's already a discussion on the internet calling for a boycott of the film , " akin said in an interview with deutsche welle .
but the director , whose has in the past explored the issue of young turks in germany straddling two cultures , says the release of the film will straighten out things .
he has won critical acclaim for his previous films , " short sharp shock " , " solino " and " in july . "
" those who 've seen the film , whether it 's been poor people or rich , whether conservatives or left-leaning people , women or men - all were pretty convinced so far , " akin said .

"
" head-on , " the much talked-about german film which won the berlin film festival 's highest award , opens in theaters in germany on thursday .
the movie gained notoriety when its female star 's porn past came to light . " head-on " by director fatih akin has seen some turbulent times in the weeks before its official release .
it was first hailed by the media for putting german film back on the map when it won the coveted golden bear at last month 's berlinale , being the first german film to take top honors there in 18 years .
barely a week later , the mass-circulation tabloid bild revealed that the film 's female star , 23-year-old sibel kekilli , had made pornographic films in the past .
critics might argue that either way the film has benefited from the wave of publicity , but now german viewers will get the chance to cut through the sensationalism and make up their own minds about " head-on " when it opens across germany on thursday .
sex , drugs and violence the story tells of the painful emancipation of a young german-turkish woman played by kekilli , who lands in a psychiatric clinic after a suicide attempt .
there she meets a turkish-german alcoholic punk cahit , played by birol ünel -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , who is twice her age .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish-born actors sibel kekilli , left , and birol ünel anxious to escape the clutches of her conservative family , sibel convinces cahit to enter into a marriage of convenience with her .
their wedding marks the beginning of a life of freedom for sibel , who 's eager to try out parties , drugs and lots of sex .
as sibel and cahit live it up and indulge in separate sexual affairs , the two eventually fall in love .
the love story ends , however , when cahit kills one of sibel 's lovers in a jealous rage .
controversy among the turks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fatih akin , german director of turkish origin hamburg-based director akin -lrb- photo -rrb- , 31 , is the son of turkish immigrants .
he is aware that the german-turkish love story is bound to spark controversy among the more conservative members of germany 's 2.5-million-strong turkish community . even before the film has been released to the wider public , the director has been accused of exploiting the problems facing turkish women in germany in his film .
" there 's already a discussion on the internet calling for a boycott of the film , " akin said in an interview with deutsche welle .
but the director , whose has in the past explored the issue of young turks in germany straddling two cultures , says the release of the film will straighten out things .
he has won critical acclaim for his previous films , " short sharp shock " , " solino " and " in july . "
" those who 've seen the film , whether it 's been poor people or rich , whether conservatives or left-leaning people , women or men - all were pretty convinced so far , " akin said .

now that europe 's central banks have agreed on how much gold they can sell over the next five years , germany is considering using its profits to stop top researchers from leaving the country . he may have the support of german chancellor gerhard schröder , but ernst welteke , head of germany 's central bank , the bundesbank , is having a hard time selling his idea to parliament .
in january , welteke proposed setting up a research foundation to distribute profits made from the sale of 20 percent of the bundesbank 's gold reserves .
he reasoned this would go a long way in appeasing top german researchers , who complain that a lack of state funding is forcing them to look for jobs abroad .
but welteke 's idea met with disapproval from the parliamentary budget committee on wednesday .
" i did n't hear from anyone who was in favor of welteke 's suggestion , " said deputy finance minister karl diller .
back to the drawing board bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ernst welteke , president of the bundesbank .
following the parliamentary committee session , welteke admitted that much more work needed to be done to convince politicians of his proposal 's merit .
but that will be difficult .
his plan would necessitate changing german law , which stipulates that any profits from gold sales be used to reduce the national deficit . that is a top priority now , as germany is set to breach eu budget deficit rules for a third year in a row in 2004 .
welteke would also have to amend his proposal to fall in line with a new gold deal agreed by europe 's central banks on monday .
the deal commits the european central bank , and the banks of every eu nation except the uk and denmark , to cap gold sales at 500 metric tons a year for the next five years .
the overall limit for the accord is 2,500 tons , up from 2,000 tons under the previous 1999 agreement .
" gold will remain an important element of global monetary reserves , " said the joint statement of the 14 central banks and the ecb .
gold operates as a safe haven for investors in troubled times .
while the trend in recent years has seen central banks shedding gold in favor of hard currencies , gold is currently in demand because of the weak u.s. dollar .
national gold reserves are a holdover from the bretton woods accord of 1944 , in which the value of currencies was pegged to gold .
with a total value of around € 46 billion , germany is the world 's second largest holder of gold reserves behind the u.s. before the new deal was struck , the bundesbank had requested an option to sell 600 tons .
that will now have to be scaled down in line with the new limits .
finding resonance in france the german proposal to use gold profits to stem the flow of its best researchers abroad has found favor in neighboring france , which faces growing protest by top scientists .
on tuesday , 2,000 scientists stopped their administrative work at laboratories to demand more state support for research .
following the protest action , france 's research minister claudie haigneré suggested raising cash either through the sale of gold or more privatizations .

now that europe 's central banks have agreed on how much gold they can sell over the next five years , germany is considering using its profits to stop top researchers from leaving the country . he may have the support of german chancellor gerhard schröder , but ernst welteke , head of germany 's central bank , the bundesbank , is having a hard time selling his idea to parliament .
in january , welteke proposed setting up a research foundation to distribute profits made from the sale of 20 percent of the bundesbank 's gold reserves .
he reasoned this would go a long way in appeasing top german researchers , who complain that a lack of state funding is forcing them to look for jobs abroad .

spanish prime minister jose maria aznar has vowed to catch those responsible for the madrid train bombings thursday morning that killed 190 and injured more than 1,240 .
the government is blaming the separatist group eta . ten bombs in total exploded during thursday morning 's commute in the worst terrorist attack in spain 's history .
" march 11 , 2004 has taken its place in the history of infamy , " prime minster aznar said in a national address .
he said those who set off the bombs would be hunted down and punished .
he and other government ministries , as well as much of the country 's news media , have pointed the finger at the basque separatist group eta .
" we will defeat them -lrb- eta -rrb- , " aznar said .
" we will succeed in finishing off the terrorist band , with the strength of the rule of law and with the unity of all spaniards . "
" terrorist band " is a term the spanish government regularly uses to refer to eta .
spain 's interior ministry said tests showed the explosives used in the attacks were a kind of dynamite normally used by eta .
aznar 's office said the explosives were a material called titadine , a kind of compressed dynamite found in a van-bomb intercepted last month as it headed for madrid , according to an associated press report .
on feb .
29 , police intercepted a madrid-bound van packed with more than 500 kilos -lrb- 1,100 pounds -rrb- of explosives traced back to the basque separatists ; two men were arrested on charges of terrorism .
on christmas eve , police thwarted an attempted bombing at chamartin , another madrid rail station , and arrested two suspected eta members .
however , the government is also not ruling out that islamic extremists could be involved in the attacks .
in the town of alcala de henares east of madrid a stolen truck was found that contained detonators and an audio tape with verses from the koran in arabic , according to interior minister angel acebes . he said all possibilities were being investigated , although eta remains the chief suspect . eta denies involvement a political group close to eta , the banned basque separatist party batasuna , denied that it was responsible for the attacks .
in the past , eta attacks have been preceded by warnings from the group .
officials received no such warning before thursday 's explosions .
speaking on radio popular arnold otegi blamed " arab resistance " for the attacks , the worst in spain 's history .
" spain maintains occupation forces in iraq and we should not forget that it had a responsibility for the war in iraq , " he said .
eta , which stands for basque homeland and freedom , was thought by many to be weakened and on its way out after the string of arrests and seizures of weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the group , which police believe to number only several dozen hard-core militants , has been responsible for some 800 deaths since it began its armed fight for basque independence in 1968 .
most of eta 's attacks have been assassinations or small-scale attacks .
if the thursday bombings are its work , it represents a remarkable increase in scale , ruthlessness and coordination .
" this is a step ahead of previous attacks by eta .
it could be a splinter group , it could be hardliners trying to extract as many casualties as they could , " paul wilkinson , a terrorism expert at the university of st. andrews , told reuters .
remote control the bombings are being described as the worst in europe since the 1988 bombing of pan-am flight 103 , which was blown out of the sky over the town of lockerbie , scotland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : debris lies next to a destroyed train car after the bombs exploded in the atocha railway station in madrid .
thursday 's powerful explosions , which authorities say appear to have been set off by remote control , rocked several madrid train stations during morning rush hour .
news reports said two bombs went off in a high-speed commuter train arriving at the busy downtown atocha station at 7:30 a.m. local time .
blasts also ripped through two other stops - santa eugenia and el pozo - the news agency efe reported .
" people started to scream and run , some bumping into each other , " juani fernandez , who was on the platform at atocha when the bombs went off , told the associated press .
spanish national radio quoted witnesses saying they saw people lying on the ground and train cars ripped open .
people in tears and bloodied could be seen running away from the station in panic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medics carry a woman injured by an explosion .
the latest count is at least 190 people dead and more than 1,240 injured .
hospitals appealed for people to donate blood .
make-shift emergency rooms were set up in neighboring sports centers , and taxis and buses were turned into ambulances to transport the severely wounded to nearby emergency rooms .
the country 's rail authority renfe has halted all commuter traffic into the capital .
politicians for the major parties have called off all campaigning ahead of the weekend 's general election .
three days of national mourning have been declared .
world condemnation world leaders were quick to condemn the bombings and sympathy poured in from capitals around the globe .
" there is a general election due in spain on sunday .
what happened today is a declaration of war on democracy , " said european parliament president pat cox in the legislature in strasbourg , france .
in germany , chancellor gerhard schröder said he was " deeply dismayed by this inhuman attack . "
he offered to send specialists from the country 's federal criminal office to spain .
u.s. president george w. bush spoke by telephone to the spanish prime minister .
" i appreciate so very much the spanish government 's fight against terror , their resolute stand against terrorist organizations like the eta , and the united states stands with them , " he told reporters .
the u.s. , britain and russia emphasized that the bombs underlined the need for the international community to toughen its resolve against terrorism .
demonstrations spanish prime minister jose maria aznar called for nationwide protests against the basque separatist group eta in the wake of deadly train bombings that left 190 dead and more than 1,240 wounded .
" the government asks spaniards to demonstrate tomorrow in the streets of all of spain .
demonstrations have been called in all spanish cities tomorrow at 7 p.m. under the slogan ' with the victims , with constitution and for the defeat of terrorism ' , " aznar said .
bildunterschrift : students during a spontaneous protest against eta .

it 's being called an obesity time bomb - and it 's ticking away within our children .
nearly one in ten six year olds in britain is now classified not just as fat , but clinically obese - that 's treble the number of children two decades ago .
for teenagers , the problem is even worse , with 15 % of 15 year olds classified as clinically obese .
so - what 's making our children so fat ?
and would tightening the rules on advertising soft drinks , sweets and crisps to children really make a difference ?
that 's the subject being debated today by government policy chiefs from the food standards agency .
breakfast debated the role of advertising with sir john krebs from the fsa and hamish pringle , from the advertising industry watch our debate we also heard from a school breakfast club in south wales , where they 're using fruit and toast to give children a good start to the day sian lloyd visited a breakfast club in merthyr tydfil fsa recommendations developing advice for food industry on acceptable levels of fat , sugar and salt providing information on food labelling free gifts or promotions for healthier foods address the imbalance in tv advertising to children in favour of healthier options the fsa website the food standards agency is considering a ban on advertising junk food during children 's tv programmes .
at the moment , it says , 40 % of all children 's tv advertising is for food and drink - and most of that is for sweets , soft drinks , fast food and sugary breakfast cereals .
it says the ' current imbalance must be redressed ' and a shift made towards more healthy foods .
the fsa has also said others should follow the bbc 's lead and introduce ' nutritional criteria ' where children 's characters are used in relation to food promotions .

companies have been queuing up to get their logos and details on a herd of the animals at gelli aur farm in llandeilo .
the idea of dressing the cows in lightweight sponsored jackets was dreamed up by five pupils at the town 's ysgol tregib secondary school .
it has won them first prize in the inter-schools celtic enterprise competition run by careers wales .
the coats are extremely light and are similar to the blankets you see on cows at the royal welsh show tim williams the year 12 pupils make the jackets themselves and charge companies £ 35 a time to have their names or logos emblazoned on the side .
sponsorship on all 10 cows in the herd has been snapped up by businesses ranging from a car dealership to a sun tanning salon .
the school 's business and enterprise teacher tim williams said the cows were in an ideal place to give companies maximum exposure as gelli aur country park is popular with hundreds of visitors .
" the coats are extremely light and are similar to the blankets you see on cows at the royal welsh show , " he said .
" there are velcro straps so they are fully adjustable for the fuller figure .
" some of the companies involved include a limousine hire company , an animal feed company and the company that makes our school uniform . "
the school is no stranger to the business world as in the last two years pupils have won and come second in the uk wide young enterprise competition .
" because tregib is in a rural area we feel very strongly that we have got to give the pupils a taste of the enterprise world if we are to get them to continue living in the area when they have left school , " he added .
" these are extra-curricular activities that they do during their lunch time or after school and there is a lot of competition to join . "

the 2003 film does not try to copy the original sounds enough , does n't it ?
but in all other ways the original has dated quite terribly and it is good that this new version generally ignores it .
mark wahlberg , charlize theron and edward norton star in a crime-caper-heist-revenge kind of plot .
with cars .
it is fun and the extras on this dvd are extensive , including deleted scenes .
unexpectedly , for an action film , one extra is devoted to the writing of the story .
but then the rest lovingly detail the cars , the stunts and how the actors learnt to drive as audaciously as they do in the movie .
black books : the second series joyously miserable , this is the sitcom about three people who vary from mildly irritating to extremely repulsive and yet whom you will come to love .
a bit .
dylan moran , bill bailey and tamsin greig star in an anarchic piece that is broadly about a bookshop - and they also provide an anarchic commentary .
" it 's like the muppets doing chekhov , " explains dylan moran at one point .
the new series on channel 4 had a brief moment with puppet versions of the characters .
this dvd has a whole puppet episode - a five-minute short called black dolls .
there is also a trailer for the new series but it is really the episodes and silly commentary that you should buy this for .
once upon a time in mexico your mileage may vary .
if you are like the many viewers who have championed this film , you 'll love the incredible visuals and action scenes .
johnny depp puts on a fine performance but you might also find it all a bit empty .
this is the second sort-of sequel to el mariachi and desperado and fans of those can not miss this one .
antonio banderas stars again as the guitar-playing gunman but this time is joined by a very good johnny depp .
when is n't he good ?
the dvd has a particularly strong set of extras .
director robert rodriquez commentates on the film and its deleted scenes .
he then demonstrates how to make a meal featured in the film .
he also shows us around his house , which is part-home , part-studio .

mr susilo , seen as a possible challenger for the presidency in july 's election , said his relationship with mrs megawati had become " disrupted " .
" it is becoming difficult to keep doing my job properly , " he told reporters .
his resignation offer came on the day campaigning opened for indonesia 's 5 april general elections .
by many measures , the elections are going to be one of the largest single acts of democratic choice in the world .
some 147m people are eligible to vote for 500,000 candidates for national , regional and local authorities .
the vote 's outcome will also have an important say in indonesia 's first direct presidential elections , due in july , since parties need to win at least 3 % of the seats on offer to nominate candidates for the presidential race .
indonesia 's packed election year mr susilo is seen as one of mrs megawati most popular and competent ministers , making him a potentially strong competitor for president .
however , he does not yet have the backing of a major party .
carnival campaigning opened a carnival atmosphere , as the floats of political parties further clogging jakarta 's already notorious traffic .
but the three-week campaign is likely to be hard fought between the 24 eligible parties .
although the current administration managed to stabilise the economy when it came to power after two years of turmoil , there are still many problems that need to be addressed - simmering separatist insurgencies in the north and east of the country , rampant corruption and a stagnating economy , among others .
observers expect the vote to be dominated by the two big nationalist secular parties , the ruling indonesian democratic party of struggle -lrb- pdi-p -rrb- and the golkar party , which disgraced president suharto used to maintain his grip on power until his downfall in1998 .
so far , all parties have been long on promises but short on policies .
observers say that the next three weeks will be crucial .
much of the electorate say they 're still undecided about who to vote for and analysts say that with little to differentiate the parties beyond personalities , people will be scrutinising the parties plans with unusual attention .

while pre-tax profits slipped to £ 244m from £ 258m a year earlier , ihg said conditions were " improving steadily in both the americas and the uk " .
it added the asia pacific region had also recovered substantially following the recent sars scare .
but it warned trade in continental europe remained tough - partly due to the weakness of the dollar .
sales at the group increased to £ 2.16bn from £ 2.15bn a year earlier .
hard times looking to the future , ihg said it planned to return £ 250m to shareholders through a share buy-back programme .
the group , which runs more than 3,400 hotels worldwide , also said it planned to sell off assets worth £ 800m to £ 1bn .
in april last year , ihg warned it was facing " some of the worst conditions the industry has ever encountered " with the group hard hit by the effects of the iraq war , deadly sars outbreak and weakness in the global economy .
the problems sparked a profits warning early last year , and prompted the firm to cut 800 worldwide from its 2,600-strong back office workforce .

the hong kong star is suing china 's konka group for $ 720,000 -lrb- £ 400,000 -rrb- saying they used his image after his 1999 one-year endorsement deal expired .
the dispute was initially settled in 2001 when konka apologised and paid chow $ 88,000 -lrb- £ 49,000 -rrb- in damages .
but chow 's lawyers said the image was seen in a chinese airport a year later .
konka deny breach of contract .
konka 's lawyer said the company had taken the initiative to remove all advertisements containing chow 's image when the contract expired , according to hong kong 's south china morning post .
as the airport in the city of chongqing was a restricted area , it was not possible for the company to go in and remove the advertisement , the lawyer said .
fame chow was already a big star in his native country before coming to the attention of western audiences when he starred alongside us actress jodie foster in a remake of anna and the king .
ang lee 's oscar-winning crouching tiger followed shortly after and won the oscar for best foreign language film in 2001 .
chow had several different jobs , including working in a factory , an office and an hotel before eventually turning to acting .
he has appeared in more than 72 movies and won numerous awards , including best actor at the hong kong film awards , the taiwan golden horse award and the asia pacific film festival in tokyo .

the west african state of equatorial guinea has been awash for weeks now with rumours of trouble brewing .
but events seem to have come to a head .
on sunday , the authorities in zimbabwe impounded a plane which flew in from south africa with 64 alleged mercenaries on board .
what exactly they were up to was n't clear - particularly as they did n't have any actual weapons with them .
plot but on tuesday , information minister august nse nfamu claimed that 15 more mercenaries had been arrested in his country and that they were an advance party for the group detained in zimbabwe .
he said their aim was to overthrow and kill equatorial guinea 's president teodoro obiang nguema .
the president then went further , declaring that the alleged coup plot had been funded by what he called enemy powers and multinational companies .
then in a bbc interview , justice minister ruben mangue , pointed the finger specifically at a leading exiled politician , severo moto , head of the opposition progress party .
for its part , the progress party denied involvement in any such plot .
mr moto said the president was just trying to damage his reputation .
" i have absolutely nothing to do with this story .
i believe that once again in the face of my announcement of my return to equatorial guinea , president obiang has become nervous and of course he has no trouble plotting and preparing traps like this in order to tarnish my political career and really keep the population on tenterhooks " .
old tricks ?
it is not the first time that the government of equatorial guinea has alleged its political opponents were plotting to overthrow it .
such allegations have sometimes coincided with the run-up to elections and led to the arrest of opposition politicians - and another opposition leader , bakale celestino , claims that , with local elections coming up in april , the government is up to its old tricks again .
but some equatorial guinea-watchers think that this time the rumours may be correct .
patrick smith , the editor of africa confidential magazine , says there is n't any evidence , but military sources in south africa " are absolutely categorical that the south african soldiers on that plane to zimbabwe on sunday were involved in the equatorial guinea adventure " .
he says they also claim that severo moto had a series of discussions with the spanish prime minister aznar , with a view to getting recognition , were he to succeed in overthrowing the obiang government .
patrick smith says that in recent months , there 's been a lot of unease within the equatorial guinean military , particularly over the succession issue .
" it is felt that president obiang 's health is not good , and that should he die precipitously , there would be a bloody struggle to succeed him .
and one of the key characters likely to lead that struggle would be his son , teodorin , who is heartily disliked by many other people in the equatorial guinea military .
explosive mix justice minister ruben mangue says that rumours of a power struggle are commonplace everywhere but - he insists - completely untrue .
" the president has just been elected last year for seven years .
the president is healthy ... it is not serious to talk about the succession to the president now " .
it may be too early to know where the truth lies .
but anthony goldman , africa analyst for clearwater research services , says that the sudden arrival of oil wealth in what until a few years ago was one of the poorest countries in the world has " created an explosive mix " in equatorial guinea .
" it 's had an unfortunate passage of dictatorships from the colonial period and then after independence - regimes of unparalleled brutality even in africa .
" in the 1970s a third of the population were killed or fled into exile under the regime of masias nguema .
his nephew seized power in 1979 , promising to liberalise the country .
" and although now in theory it 's a multi-party democracy , opposition supporters , diplomats and a number of human rights activists maintain that it remains a dictatorial regime , fuelled now by the arrival of oil , " he says .
it may be no coincidence that , again according to anthony goldman , equatorial guinea has long had the image of being the kind of small , sleepy place where a handful of mercenaries could quickly seize power .
if so , it seems that the country 's image is now out of date .

the west african state of equatorial guinea has been awash for weeks now with rumours of trouble brewing .
president obiang says " enemy powers " are trying to overthrow him but events seem to have come to a head .
on sunday , the authorities in zimbabwe impounded a plane which flew in from south africa with 64 alleged mercenaries on board .
what exactly they were up to was n't clear - particularly as they did n't have any actual weapons with them .
plot but on tuesday , information minister august nse nfamu claimed that 15 more mercenaries had been arrested in his country and that they were an advance party for the group detained in zimbabwe .
he said their aim was to overthrow and kill equatorial guinea 's president teodoro obiang nguema .
the president then went further , declaring that the alleged coup plot had been funded by what he called enemy powers and multinational companies .
then in a bbc interview , justice minister ruben mangue , pointed the finger specifically at a leading exiled politician , severo moto , head of the opposition progress party .
for its part , the progress party denied involvement in any such plot .
mr moto said the president was just trying to damage his reputation .
" i have absolutely nothing to do with this story .
i believe that once again in the face of my announcement of my return to equatorial guinea , president obiang has become nervous and of course he has no trouble plotting and preparing traps like this in order to tarnish my political career and really keep the population on tenterhooks " .
old tricks ?
it is not the first time that the government of equatorial guinea has alleged its political opponents were plotting to overthrow it .
the benefits of oil have been slow to trickle down such allegations have sometimes coincided with the run-up to elections and led to the arrest of opposition politicians - and another opposition leader , bakale celestino , claims that , with local elections coming up in april , the government is up to its old tricks again .
but some equatorial guinea-watchers think that this time the rumours may be correct .
patrick smith , the editor of africa confidential magazine , says there is n't any evidence , but military sources in south africa " are absolutely categorical that the south african soldiers on that plane to zimbabwe on sunday were involved in the equatorial guinea adventure " .
he says they also claim that severo moto had a series of discussions with the spanish prime minister aznar , with a view to getting recognition , were he to succeed in overthrowing the obiang government .
patrick smith says that in recent months , there 's been a lot of unease within the equatorial guinean military , particularly over the succession issue .
" it is felt that president obiang 's health is not good , and that should he die precipitously , there would be a bloody struggle to succeed him .
and one of the key characters likely to lead that struggle would be his son , teodorin , who is heartily disliked by many other people in the equatorial guinea military .
explosive mix justice minister ruben mangue says that rumours of a power struggle are commonplace everywhere but - he insists - completely untrue .
the plane was heading to equatorial guinea , the government believes " the president has just been elected last year for seven years .
the president is healthy ... it is not serious to talk about the succession to the president now " .
it may be too early to know where the truth lies .
but anthony goldman , africa analyst for clearwater research services , says that the sudden arrival of oil wealth in what until a few years ago was one of the poorest countries in the world has " created an explosive mix " in equatorial guinea .
" it 's had an unfortunate passage of dictatorships from the colonial period and then after independence - regimes of unparalleled brutality even in africa .
" in the 1970s a third of the population were killed or fled into exile under the regime of masias nguema .
his nephew seized power in 1979 , promising to liberalise the country .

the international fund for animal welfare -lrb- ifaw -rrb- says nearly all ivory sold in the uk is sold illegally , because of " worrying " legal loopholes .
ifaw 's report , elephants on the high street , also blames internet auction sites for creating a " huge , unregulated highway " for the illegal ivory trade .
selling african ivory stockpiles could be legalised this month , but ifaw is campaigning to prevent that happening .
fuelling the trade a committee of the un convention on international trade in endangered species -lrb- cites -rrb- is meeting from 15 to 19 march , and could vote to allow a one-off sale of ivory stockpiles from southern africa , where some countries say they have too many elephants .
the price of ivory they say they would use the money raised from the sales for conservation , but ifaw says reopening the legal trade would lead to more poaching and ivory smuggling .
ifaw says the us has been labelled a " problem country " by cites .
it says the uk is the third largest source of intercepted illegal ivory entering the us .
the report says : " the policing and prosecution of wildlife crime in the uk is far more advanced and better resourced than in most other countries in the world .
" in this context , the ability of any country to control domestic elephant ivory trade is in serious doubt , particularly those with much fewer resources for law enforcement . "
ifaw says high consumer demand in the uk has led to new ivory being carved to look antique .
but it acknowledges that a lack of policing makes it " nearly impossible " to judge how much ivory is sold this way .
' no ' vote demanded it criticises regulations which allow antique dealers themselves to evaluate the age of their ivory , a process known as self-appraisal .
" very few " of the dealers ifaw interviewed had much idea how old their ivory was .
refuge in the elephants ' orphanage ifaw also says 90 % of internet sellers were either unaware of uk ivory trade law or were prepared to break it .
the report urges the government to vote against re-opening the legal ivory trade , and recommends the introduction of independent registered experts to replace the self-appraisal system .
dr richard leakey , former head of the kenya wildlife service , says in the report : " it would be a truly ironic tragedy if a decision made by british politicians led to elephants in kenya , or anywhere else , being gunned down for ivory trinkets to be sold in the uk . "
too few restraints kenya had at most 65,000 elephants in the late 1970s , according to iucn-the world conservation union .
but poachers and other threats have reduced the herds to between 22,000 and 29,000 .
james isiche , ifaw 's east africa office director , says : " the illegal ivory trade has reached alarming proportions as the enforcement of existing legislation is massively under-resourced worldwide .

the international fund for animal welfare -lrb- ifaw -rrb- says nearly all ivory sold in the uk is sold illegally , because of " worrying " legal loopholes .
ifaw 's report , elephants on the high street , also blames internet auction sites for creating a " huge , unregulated highway " for the illegal ivory trade .
selling african ivory stockpiles could be legalised this month , but ifaw is campaigning to prevent that happening .
fuelling the trade a committee of the un convention on international trade in endangered species -lrb- cites -rrb- is meeting from 15 to 19 march , and could vote to allow a one-off sale of ivory stockpiles from southern africa , where some countries say they have too many elephants .
the price of ivory they say they would use the money raised from the sales for conservation , but ifaw says reopening the legal trade would lead to more poaching and ivory smuggling .
ifaw says the us has been labelled a " problem country " by cites .
it says the uk is the third largest source of intercepted illegal ivory entering the us .
the report says : " the policing and prosecution of wildlife crime in the uk is far more advanced and better resourced than in most other countries in the world .
" in this context , the ability of any country to control domestic elephant ivory trade is in serious doubt , particularly those with much fewer resources for law enforcement . "
ifaw says high consumer demand in the uk has led to new ivory being carved to look antique .
but it acknowledges that a lack of policing makes it " nearly impossible " to judge how much ivory is sold this way .

the report urges the government to vote against re-opening the legal ivory trade , and recommends the introduction of independent registered experts to replace the self-appraisal system .
dr richard leakey , former head of the kenya wildlife service , says in the report : " it would be a truly ironic tragedy if a decision made by british politicians led to elephants in kenya , or anywhere else , being gunned down for ivory trinkets to be sold in the uk . "

but poachers and other threats have reduced the herds to between 22,000 and 29,000 .
james isiche , ifaw 's east africa office director , says : " the illegal ivory trade has reached alarming proportions as the enforcement of existing legislation is massively under-resourced worldwide .

a study by researchers said the reforms introduced in 1999 had succeeded in their aim of providing " opportunity for all " .
but professor david raffe , of edinburgh university , said : " this has not always led to attainment for all . "
higher still replaced the previous system of post-16 courses in scotland 's schools and colleges .
the aim was to create a unified curriculum and assessment system offering opportunity for all .
mixed verdict researchers at edinburgh university 's moray house school of education have carried out two surveys of data from all of the country 's secondary schools and colleges .
their work is part of a four-year study into the reforms .
prof raffe said the research had delivered a mixed verdict .
schools have used higher still to enable them to deliver a more flexible curriculum for their diverse client groups prof david raffe " it has made scottish education more inclusive and more coherent but it has not fully achieved the ' unified system ' it aimed to create , " he said .
" in the sense of providing opportunity for a flexible system which all people can access , we think it has generally been a success .
" but when we look at what people have actually achieved within this system , we find a somewhat more disturbing account . "
the researchers found higher still had improved opportunities , especially for middle and lower attaining students .
different results but pass rates were still much lower for students with poor standard grade results - even though the level of their courses was matched to their standard grade attainment .
prof raffe added : " ten years ago we expected these differences because the curriculum students were taking was n't sufficiently differentiated to match their different backgrounds .
" now we should be expecting more equal levels of attainment because the courses are more tailored to where students came from and their prior attainment .
" but we 're not finding that , we 're finding differences of , at one end , 85 % for credit level students and , on the other hand , 40 % success rates for foundation students . "
the study did say the new qualifications had made better progress in schools than in colleges .
students with special needs had been given better access to national certification .
but the report concluded the overall aim of building a ' climbing frame ' of learning opportunities , with flexible entry and exit points and flexible movement within the system , had proved difficult to realise .
we now have a qualification system which provides genuine opportunities for all pupils , from those with special needs through to the most able peter peacock education minister these conclusions came as no surprise to the general secretary of the scottish secondary teachers association -lrb- ssta -rrb- , david eaglesham .
he said : " the ssta called for the higher still to be delayed by a further year , if not two years , and the minister at the time did not listen to us .
" i think we see part of the problem here in that the thing went ahead before it was fully ready .
" so it 's not surprising if there 's some degree of deficiency at the moment . "
the convenor of the scottish parent teacher council -lrb- sptc -rrb- , judith gillespie , suggested further reforms might be needed with a move away from the exam system .
she said : " passing exams is a skill and it 's a skill some people have and some people do n't have .
" what we perhaps need to do is to look at offering these particular youngsters routes that are exam free . "
however , education and young people minister peter peacock defended the system in a written statement .
he wrote : " we now have a qualification system which provides genuine opportunities for all pupils , from those with special needs through to the most able .
" it 's also good news that schools are using the new national qualifications to deliver a more flexible curriculum . "
the findings were presented at a seminar in edinburgh on thursday .

a study by researchers said the reforms introduced in 1999 had succeeded in their aim of providing " opportunity for all " .
but professor david raffe , of edinburgh university , said : " this has not always led to attainment for all . "
higher still replaced the previous system of post-16 courses in scotland 's schools and colleges .
the aim was to create a unified curriculum and assessment system offering opportunity for all .
mixed verdict researchers at edinburgh university 's moray house school of education have carried out two surveys of data from all of the country 's secondary schools and colleges .
their work is part of a four-year study into the reforms .
prof raffe said the research had delivered a mixed verdict .
schools have used higher still to enable them to deliver a more flexible curriculum for their diverse client groups prof david raffe " it has made scottish education more inclusive and more coherent but it has not fully achieved the ' unified system ' it aimed to create , " he said .
" in the sense of providing opportunity for a flexible system which all people can access , we think it has generally been a success .
" but when we look at what people have actually achieved within this system , we find a somewhat more disturbing account . "
the researchers found higher still had improved opportunities , especially for middle and lower attaining students .
different results but pass rates were still much lower for students with poor standard grade results - even though the level of their courses was matched to their standard grade attainment .
prof raffe added : " ten years ago we expected these differences because the curriculum students were taking was n't sufficiently differentiated to match their different backgrounds .
" now we should be expecting more equal levels of attainment because the courses are more tailored to where students came from and their prior attainment .
" but we 're not finding that , we 're finding differences of , at one end , 85 % for credit level students and , on the other hand , 40 % success rates for foundation students . "
the study did say the new qualifications had made better progress in schools than in colleges .
