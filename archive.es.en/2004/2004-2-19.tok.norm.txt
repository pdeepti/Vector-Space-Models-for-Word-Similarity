prosecutors at the international war crimes tribunal will wrap up their case against slobodan milosevic in the next few days .
the former serb leader plans a defense strategy that could extend the trial until 2006 . on most days , slobodan milosevic enters the court room in his customary blue suit .
with the light disinterested gaze of a 61-year-old man with nothing left to lose , he peers back and forth between witnesses testifying on the stand .
for the past two years , the former president of serbia and yugoslavia has stood in the dock of the international war crimes tribunal in the hague .
milosevic , whose case has been modified several times , is charged with 60 war crimes including genocide in bosnia-herzegovina and crimes against humanity in croatia and kosovo .
he is accused in the killings of tens of thousands and the displacement of thousands of people from their homes in the last decade during wars that ravaged the former yugoslavia .
if convicted , he could face a life sentence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.n. war crimes prosecutor carla del ponte .
chief prosecutor carla del ponte -lrb- photo -rrb- and her team are expected to wrap up their case against the ex-dictator in the next week .
the closing arguments will mark the end of the first part of the trial .
milosevic , who has chosen to defend himself , and the two attorneys and legal aide helping him can then prepare a defense strategy and a list of witnesses .
but first , milosevic has the option of requesting an audit of the prosecution 's case .
the three-judge panel then can shoot down arguments and charges for which there is insufficient evidence .
prosecutor 's tough case the process could be damaging for del ponte , who has already been criticized for being too headstrong and not allowing the judges to make their mark on the case .
the shakiest part is believed to be the genocide charge , a weakness even del ponte has conceded .
no one has been able to prove in court that milosevic himself ordered the slaughter of more than 7,000 bosnian muslims in srebrenica in 1995 .
philipp morillon , the former united nations commander in bosnia , who has testified about the massacre , has even partially defended milosevic , saying he had headed off the first possible attack on srebrenica ’ s muslims .
the war crimes charges stemming from croatia and bosnia could also prove problematic .
the prosecution has built the charges on the premise that milosevic was operating a “ criminal organization ” with the goal of building a “ great serbia ” that stretched into parts of croatia and bosnia .
but legal expert sluiter says prosecutors have failed to turn up written evidence .
del ponte has also had trouble finding cooperative witnesses to prove the case against milosevic .
should be enough for long prison term international law expert gören sluiter warns not to place too much blame on del ponte herself .
sluiter said the judges have also made mistakes by failing to set time limits for prosecutors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slobodan milosevic enters the courtroom .
" they have done that to a certain degree ... but giving the prosecutors two years to present the case is extremely long and does not force the prosecutor to be more selective , " sluiter told dw-world .
the prosecution team has managed to present some very effective witnesses , like former nato generals wesley clark and klaus naumann , who have provided would could be deeply incriminating evidence against milosevic .
the generals ' testimony could be especially useful in regard to the crimes against humanity charges in kosovo , sluiter said .
testimony combined with information out of police and army archives in belgrade should be enough to convict the former serb leader and put him behind bars for a long time .
trial could last until 2006 but first milosevic will have the opportunity to defend himself against these charges .
legal observers expect his defense to take as much time and include as many witnesses as del ponte ’ s prosecution .
after a first ruling in the case , an appeals process is anticipated , with no final decision expected before the end of 2006 .
whether milosevic is convicted or not , the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia will continue to play an important role in the truth and reconciliation process of the balkans , according to sluiter .
“ one should also not exaggerate the importance of the milosevic trial .
it comes at a time when the tribunal has already been functioning for a number of years and over those years they have dealt with all of these incidents , " he said .
" so i think as to the effects of the case and the responsibilities , i think the groundwork has already been done and even without the milosevic trial the is of significant importance for the history of the balkans . ” dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ten years on : the fight for justice in the balkans continues the u.n. tribunal for war crimes in the former yugoslavia marks its ten-year anniversary this week , but it 's business as usual in the hague as the trials of those accused of atrocities in the balkan wars continue .

eurocrats in brussels are fed up with the many myths peddled by the media about the european union .
a european commission website sets out to put the record straight . last year , british tabloid the daily mail informed its readers that the eu was planning to ban corgis .
" certain breeds of the queen 's favorite dog could be outlawed under a controversial eu convention being considered by ministers , " it revealed . the shock revelation which outraged animal lovers across the country and fuelled anti-european sentiment in fact had nothing to do with the eu .
the story originated with a committee of animal protection experts which drew up a european convention for the protection of pet animals designed to improve the welfare of household pets . whatever .
readers were all too willing to believe the eu was up to its usual nonsense . this sort of scare-mongering plays right into the hands of euroskeptics - as brussels is all too aware .
the european commission now features on its website a compilation of popular misconceptions ranging from the sublime to the ridiculous , giving the inside story , laying out the facts and debunking the myths . media-fuelled hostility a lot of europhiles feel the press coverage contributes to widespread bewilderment and hostility towards europe , feeding a popular attitude that the eu is a dangerous behemoth deliberately blinding its citizens with layers of impenetrable bureaucracy and ludicrous laws . admittedly , brussels is an easy target .
a tangle of competing institutions and different agendas , eu bodies are notorious for excessive red tape , corruption scandals and mystifying rules and regulations .
it all contributes to a culture of confusion that leaves the public willing to believe just about anything . according to michael mann from the european commission press office , the british media is a main offender , with the tabloids all trying to outdo one another with sensational stories . mann is now busy collecting myths and countering them with facts .
in his opinion , the problem is that the level of debate about europe is n't as high as it should be . a reflection of national reservations the misunderstandings and prejudices come in all shapes and sizes .
maintaining that eu officials are grossly overpaid is one thing - but the idea that male members of staff are reimbursed for the medical costs of viagra pills is slightly less well-founded . horror stories from brussels are part of the media 's daily diet , but reveal an astonishing gullibility on the part of many europeans .
on the euro-myth silly scale , old favorites such as greengrocers having to conform to rules covering size , length , color and texture of fruit and vegetables are less believable than proposals for a new european flag , but the sheer quantity of misapprehensions goes to show how little the public understands the workings of the european union .
viola eggert from the european commission 's berlin office attributes the problem to the commission 's zeal for regulations , saying many myths about the eu popular in germany " are based on over-regulation and the idea that the eu tells its citizens what they 're allowed to do , and has too big an influence on their lives . "
so although gullibility may be to blame for many of the myths , the volume of misinformation appears to reflect strong national reservations about the sort of things the european commission would like to do if left to its own devices .
anti-eu groups are all too willing to twist the facts about brussels ' law-making , but the eu would do well to conclude it should , in future , explain itself better .
after all , brussels does have one of the most extensive press corps in the world .

" certain breeds of the queen 's favorite dog could be outlawed under a controversial eu convention being considered by ministers , " it revealed . the shock revelation which outraged animal lovers across the country and fuelled anti-european sentiment in fact had nothing to do with the eu .
the story originated with a committee of animal protection experts which drew up a european convention for the protection of pet animals designed to improve the welfare of household pets . whatever .
readers were all too willing to believe the eu was up to its usual nonsense . this sort of scare-mongering plays right into the hands of euroskeptics - as brussels is all too aware .
the european commission now features on its website a compilation of popular misconceptions ranging from the sublime to the ridiculous , giving the inside story , laying out the facts and debunking the myths . media-fuelled hostility a lot of europhiles feel the press coverage contributes to widespread bewilderment and hostility towards europe , feeding a popular attitude that the eu is a dangerous behemoth deliberately blinding its citizens with layers of impenetrable bureaucracy and ludicrous laws . admittedly , brussels is an easy target .
a tangle of competing institutions and different agendas , eu bodies are notorious for excessive red tape , corruption scandals and mystifying rules and regulations .
it all contributes to a culture of confusion that leaves the public willing to believe just about anything . according to michael mann from the european commission press office , the british media is a main offender , with the tabloids all trying to outdo one another with sensational stories . mann is now busy collecting myths and countering them with facts .
in his opinion , the problem is that the level of debate about europe is n't as high as it should be . a reflection of national reservations the misunderstandings and prejudices come in all shapes and sizes .
maintaining that eu officials are grossly overpaid is one thing - but the idea that male members of staff are reimbursed for the medical costs of viagra pills is slightly less well-founded . horror stories from brussels are part of the media 's daily diet , but reveal an astonishing gullibility on the part of many europeans .
on the euro-myth silly scale , old favorites such as greengrocers having to conform to rules covering size , length , color and texture of fruit and vegetables are less believable than proposals for a new european flag , but the sheer quantity of misapprehensions goes to show how little the public understands the workings of the european union .
viola eggert from the european commission 's berlin office attributes the problem to the commission 's zeal for regulations , saying many myths about the eu popular in germany " are based on over-regulation and the idea that the eu tells its citizens what they 're allowed to do , and has too big an influence on their lives . "
so although gullibility may be to blame for many of the myths , the volume of misinformation appears to reflect strong national reservations about the sort of things the european commission would like to do if left to its own devices .
anti-eu groups are all too willing to twist the facts about brussels ' law-making , but the eu would do well to conclude it should , in future , explain itself better .
after all , brussels does have one of the most extensive press corps in the world .
but as michael mann points out , brussels can only do so much - and the rest is up to national governments .
" they have to start serious discussions with the public about what europe is and why it 's a good thing , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links get the facts straight european commission press office webpage 9801 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

prosecutors at the international war crimes tribunal will wrap up their case against slobodan milosevic in the next few days .
the former serb leader plans a defense strategy that could extend the trial until 2006 . on most days , slobodan milosevic enters the court room in his customary blue suit .
with the light disinterested gaze of a 61-year-old man with nothing left to lose , he peers back and forth between witnesses testifying on the stand .
for the past two years , the former president of serbia and yugoslavia has stood in the dock of the international war crimes tribunal in the hague .
milosevic , whose case has been modified several times , is charged with 60 war crimes including genocide in bosnia-herzegovina and crimes against humanity in croatia and kosovo .
he is accused in the killings of tens of thousands and the displacement of thousands of people from their homes in the last decade during wars that ravaged the former yugoslavia .
if convicted , he could face a life sentence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.n. war crimes prosecutor carla del ponte .
chief prosecutor carla del ponte -lrb- photo -rrb- and her team are expected to wrap up their case against the ex-dictator in the next week .
the closing arguments will mark the end of the first part of the trial .
milosevic , who has chosen to defend himself , and the two attorneys and legal aide helping him can then prepare a defense strategy and a list of witnesses .
but first , milosevic has the option of requesting an audit of the prosecution 's case .
the three-judge panel then can shoot down arguments and charges for which there is insufficient evidence .
prosecutor 's tough case the process could be damaging for del ponte , who has already been criticized for being too headstrong and not allowing the judges to make their mark on the case .
the shakiest part is believed to be the genocide charge , a weakness even del ponte has conceded .
no one has been able to prove in court that milosevic himself ordered the slaughter of more than 7,000 bosnian muslims in srebrenica in 1995 .
philipp morillon , the former united nations commander in bosnia , who has testified about the massacre , has even partially defended milosevic , saying he had headed off the first possible attack on srebrenica ’ s muslims .
the war crimes charges stemming from croatia and bosnia could also prove problematic .
the prosecution has built the charges on the premise that milosevic was operating a “ criminal organization ” with the goal of building a “ great serbia ” that stretched into parts of croatia and bosnia .
but legal expert sluiter says prosecutors have failed to turn up written evidence .
del ponte has also had trouble finding cooperative witnesses to prove the case against milosevic .
should be enough for long prison term international law expert gören sluiter warns not to place too much blame on del ponte herself .
sluiter said the judges have also made mistakes by failing to set time limits for prosecutors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slobodan milosevic enters the courtroom .
" they have done that to a certain degree ... but giving the prosecutors two years to present the case is extremely long and does not force the prosecutor to be more selective , " sluiter told dw-world .
the prosecution team has managed to present some very effective witnesses , like former nato generals wesley clark and klaus naumann , who have provided would could be deeply incriminating evidence against milosevic .
the generals ' testimony could be especially useful in regard to the crimes against humanity charges in kosovo , sluiter said .
testimony combined with information out of police and army archives in belgrade should be enough to convict the former serb leader and put him behind bars for a long time .
trial could last until 2006 but first milosevic will have the opportunity to defend himself against these charges .
legal observers expect his defense to take as much time and include as many witnesses as del ponte ’ s prosecution .
after a first ruling in the case , an appeals process is anticipated , with no final decision expected before the end of 2006 .
whether milosevic is convicted or not , the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia will continue to play an important role in the truth and reconciliation process of the balkans , according to sluiter .
“ one should also not exaggerate the importance of the milosevic trial .
it comes at a time when the tribunal has already been functioning for a number of years and over those years they have dealt with all of these incidents , " he said .
" so i think as to the effects of the case and the responsibilities , i think the groundwork has already been done and even without the milosevic trial the is of significant importance for the history of the balkans . ” dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ten years on : the fight for justice in the balkans continues the u.n. tribunal for war crimes in the former yugoslavia marks its ten-year anniversary this week , but it 's business as usual in the hague as the trials of those accused of atrocities in the balkan wars continue .

marriage bait in some cases , stasi officials would hook new recruits by threatening to bust them for infractions of east german laws during visits - like crossing the border back to west germany too late at night or for exchanging money on the black market or even if they had inadvertently taken a snapshot of a stasi building . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the old east german sign points the way in for visitors to the tränenpalast - " palace of tears " - in the early 1990s .
the former border crossing between east and west berlin is now a venue for concerts and comedy acts .
many of the turkish men were assigned as so-called " fly catchers " : they were supposed to inform the stasi about east german women who were trying to marry foreigners in order to leave east germany .
more than 6,000 west berlin turks made day trips to the other side of the berlin wall during the 1980s , and they were popular targets for east german women looking for a better life . despite its eagerness to work with foreigners , the stasi often held a prejudicial view of them .
in the 1970s , then east german state security minister erich mielke expressed his fear that foreigners coming in from west berlin included " many anti-social and criminal " types who could pose a threat to security during their visits there . officials feared airplane hijackings , attacks against embassies and even drug smuggling .
the tensions at the time between turkish and other foreign groups in west berlin fuelled those emotions .
because turks were - and still are - the largest minority group in germany , they made up the majority of the stasi 's foreign collaborators .
little known though there has been little public discussion over the foreigners working for the stasi , there have been some low-profile court cases .
but most of the accused got off lightly without anyone having to sit out a jail sentence , herbstritt said . that 's because few foreigners serving as top spies .
non-germans just did n't have the access .
nor did they have the opportunity to make a career in politics or the military .
they often came as simple laborers to germany and the stasi deployed them where they could be useful . but they have n't escaped the notice of history , with herbstritt now compiling research on this unplumbed aspect of germany 's cold war years . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stasi allegations dog leipzig olympic bid the stasi scandal which has threatened leipzig ’ s olympic bid has not abated despite the resignation of two leading members of the german committee .

prosecutors at the international war crimes tribunal will wrap up their case against slobodan milosevic in the next few days .
the former serb leader plans a defense strategy that could extend the trial until 2006 . on most days , slobodan milosevic enters the court room in his customary blue suit .
with the light disinterested gaze of a 61-year-old man with nothing left to lose , he peers back and forth between witnesses testifying on the stand .
for the past two years , the former president of serbia and yugoslavia has stood in the dock of the international war crimes tribunal in the hague .
milosevic , whose case has been modified several times , is charged with 60 war crimes including genocide in bosnia-herzegovina and crimes against humanity in croatia and kosovo .
he is accused in the killings of tens of thousands and the displacement of thousands of people from their homes in the last decade during wars that ravaged the former yugoslavia .
if convicted , he could face a life sentence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.n. war crimes prosecutor carla del ponte .
chief prosecutor carla del ponte -lrb- photo -rrb- and her team are expected to wrap up their case against the ex-dictator in the next week .
the closing arguments will mark the end of the first part of the trial .
milosevic , who has chosen to defend himself , and the two attorneys and legal aide helping him can then prepare a defense strategy and a list of witnesses .
but first , milosevic has the option of requesting an audit of the prosecution 's case .
the three-judge panel then can shoot down arguments and charges for which there is insufficient evidence .
prosecutor 's tough case the process could be damaging for del ponte , who has already been criticized for being too headstrong and not allowing the judges to make their mark on the case .
the shakiest part is believed to be the genocide charge , a weakness even del ponte has conceded .
no one has been able to prove in court that milosevic himself ordered the slaughter of more than 7,000 bosnian muslims in srebrenica in 1995 .
philipp morillon , the former united nations commander in bosnia , who has testified about the massacre , has even partially defended milosevic , saying he had headed off the first possible attack on srebrenica ’ s muslims .
the war crimes charges stemming from croatia and bosnia could also prove problematic .
the prosecution has built the charges on the premise that milosevic was operating a “ criminal organization ” with the goal of building a “ great serbia ” that stretched into parts of croatia and bosnia .
but legal expert sluiter says prosecutors have failed to turn up written evidence .
del ponte has also had trouble finding cooperative witnesses to prove the case against milosevic .
should be enough for long prison term international law expert gören sluiter warns not to place too much blame on del ponte herself .
sluiter said the judges have also made mistakes by failing to set time limits for prosecutors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slobodan milosevic enters the courtroom .
" they have done that to a certain degree ... but giving the prosecutors two years to present the case is extremely long and does not force the prosecutor to be more selective , " sluiter told dw-world .
the prosecution team has managed to present some very effective witnesses , like former nato generals wesley clark and klaus naumann , who have provided would could be deeply incriminating evidence against milosevic .
the generals ' testimony could be especially useful in regard to the crimes against humanity charges in kosovo , sluiter said .
testimony combined with information out of police and army archives in belgrade should be enough to convict the former serb leader and put him behind bars for a long time .
trial could last until 2006 but first milosevic will have the opportunity to defend himself against these charges .
legal observers expect his defense to take as much time and include as many witnesses as del ponte ’ s prosecution .
after a first ruling in the case , an appeals process is anticipated , with no final decision expected before the end of 2006 .
whether milosevic is convicted or not , the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia will continue to play an important role in the truth and reconciliation process of the balkans , according to sluiter .
“ one should also not exaggerate the importance of the milosevic trial .
it comes at a time when the tribunal has already been functioning for a number of years and over those years they have dealt with all of these incidents , " he said .
" so i think as to the effects of the case and the responsibilities , i think the groundwork has already been done and even without the milosevic trial the is of significant importance for the history of the balkans . ” dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ten years on : the fight for justice in the balkans continues the u.n. tribunal for war crimes in the former yugoslavia marks its ten-year anniversary this week , but it 's business as usual in the hague as the trials of those accused of atrocities in the balkan wars continue .

the agency administering the files of the former east german secret police has uncovered a little-known chapter in the history of germany 's immigrant guest workers : some served as spies for the stasi . " kemal " had a good knowledge of german and even though he was n't a member of any political party , he was sympathetic to socialist ideals . in the spring of 1981 , he needed help .
his residency permit for west berlin was about to expire and he was on the verge of getting deported to turkey .
these circumstances made kemal an attractive candidate for the east german secret police , or stasi , which promptly took advantage of the situation . " they arranged a german wife for him and allowed her to move to west berlin .
as a guest worker with a german wife , he was then able to stay in west berlin , " birthler authority researcher georg herbstritt told deutsche welle . herbstritt said this was a typical method used by the stasi to recruit foreigners living in west germany , where they served as low-level spies for the east .

the agency administering the files of the former east german secret police has uncovered a little-known chapter in the history of germany 's immigrant guest workers : some served as spies for the stasi . " kemal " had a good knowledge of german and even though he was n't a member of any political party , he was sympathetic to socialist ideals . in the spring of 1981 , he needed help .
his residency permit for west berlin was about to expire and he was on the verge of getting deported to turkey .
these circumstances made kemal an attractive candidate for the east german secret police , or stasi , which promptly took advantage of the situation . " they arranged a german wife for him and allowed her to move to west berlin .
as a guest worker with a german wife , he was then able to stay in west berlin , " birthler authority researcher georg herbstritt told deutsche welle . herbstritt said this was a typical method used by the stasi to recruit foreigners living in west germany , where they served as low-level spies for the east .
the birthler authority estimates that five percent of the stasi 's so-called " unofficial collaborators " during the 1980s were foreigners .
marriage bait in some cases , stasi officials would hook new recruits by threatening to bust them for infractions of east german laws during visits - like crossing the border back to west germany too late at night or for exchanging money on the black market or even if they had inadvertently taken a snapshot of a stasi building . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the old east german sign points the way in for visitors to the tränenpalast - " palace of tears " - in the early 1990s .
the former border crossing between east and west berlin is now a venue for concerts and comedy acts .
many of the turkish men were assigned as so-called " fly catchers " : they were supposed to inform the stasi about east german women who were trying to marry foreigners in order to leave east germany .
more than 6,000 west berlin turks made day trips to the other side of the berlin wall during the 1980s , and they were popular targets for east german women looking for a better life . despite its eagerness to work with foreigners , the stasi often held a prejudicial view of them .
in the 1970s , then east german state security minister erich mielke expressed his fear that foreigners coming in from west berlin included " many anti-social and criminal " types who could pose a threat to security during their visits there . officials feared airplane hijackings , attacks against embassies and even drug smuggling .
the tensions at the time between turkish and other foreign groups in west berlin fuelled those emotions .
because turks were - and still are - the largest minority group in germany , they made up the majority of the stasi 's foreign collaborators .
little known though there has been little public discussion over the foreigners working for the stasi , there have been some low-profile court cases .
but most of the accused got off lightly without anyone having to sit out a jail sentence , herbstritt said . that 's because few foreigners serving as top spies .
non-germans just did n't have the access .
nor did they have the opportunity to make a career in politics or the military .
they often came as simple laborers to germany and the stasi deployed them where they could be useful . but they have n't escaped the notice of history , with herbstritt now compiling research on this unplumbed aspect of germany 's cold war years . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stasi allegations dog leipzig olympic bid the stasi scandal which has threatened leipzig ’ s olympic bid has not abated despite the resignation of two leading members of the german committee .

german finance minister hans eichel created an uproar after proposing a law that would send the labor police after domestic staff working illegally .
he 's since backed off . if eichel had his way , people who employed a cleaning lady or babysitter in germany could possibly be made into outlaws . as part of a tough government initiative to tackle germany 's booming illegal jobs market , eichel wanted to target all illegal workers and their employers .
under his bill proposal , domestic help , from cleaners to part-time tutors would be subject to the same constraints and rules as construction workers , office staff and employees in the commercial sector .
that meant that they could face prosecution under german labor laws if they were not registered workers , much in the same way that other workers such as builders , carpenters and technicians were .

barbara hendricks , a deputy finance minister , declared after the cabinet decision : " the private area has become decriminalized . "
people working in the part-time domestic services sector are now not required to register for so-called " mini-jobs . " the government re-introduced the " minijobs " - which allow workers to earn up to € 400 without having to pay taxes or social benefits - in an effort to streamline registration and encourage workers to come out of the illegal sector .
labor police to look elsewhere an initiative put forward by the finance ministry had mobilized a force of 2,000 customs officers to track down and investigate cleaning ladies and other domestic staff who were working in the so-called shadow economy . a new ministry task force composed of 7,000 officers has been set up to investigate illegal workers and their employers .
their search will now be limited to the restaurant , construction , gaming and tourism industry . the police trade union and metalworkers union ig metall has criticized the new rules , claiming that illegal is illegal and the private sector should be monitored and regulated just as any other .
the government 's reversal came after the increasing clamor over the " cleaning lady debate " from many members of the public who felt it was unfair to treat domestic help in the same way as other areas of employment and include it in labor law categories along with drug dealers and prostitutes who evade taxation and social security levies . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de labor market reforms spelled out germany 's parliament votes on october 17 on labor market reforms that critics say will lead to painful cuts for people in and out of work .

" the government re-introduced the " minijobs " - which allow workers to earn up to € 400 without having to pay taxes or social benefits - in an effort to streamline registration and encourage workers to come out of the illegal sector .
labor police to look elsewhere an initiative put forward by the finance ministry had mobilized a force of 2,000 customs officers to track down and investigate cleaning ladies and other domestic staff who were working in the so-called shadow economy . a new ministry task force composed of 7,000 officers has been set up to investigate illegal workers and their employers .
their search will now be limited to the restaurant , construction , gaming and tourism industry . the police trade union and metalworkers union ig metall has criticized the new rules , claiming that illegal is illegal and the private sector should be monitored and regulated just as any other .
the government 's reversal came after the increasing clamor over the " cleaning lady debate " from many members of the public who felt it was unfair to treat domestic help in the same way as other areas of employment and include it in labor law categories along with drug dealers and prostitutes who evade taxation and social security levies . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de labor market reforms spelled out germany 's parliament votes on october 17 on labor market reforms that critics say will lead to painful cuts for people in and out of work .

he also said he would urge eu interior affairs and justice ministers to explore law enforcement measures and " pre-emptive acition in the field of education . "
" we want concrete results , " prodi told the gathering of jewish groups thursday .
the italian commission president comments came after months in which the eu came under heavy criticism for standing by amid a rising wave of anti-semitism in europe and the body 's perceived anti-israeli sentiment .
a " european disease " jewish leaders said the eu should monitor anti-jewish incidents more strictly , penalize the perpetrators of the violence more harshly and educate young europeans about the legacy of centuries of persecution on their continent .
though anti-semitism exists in many places in the world , it is also a distinctly " european disease , " nobel-prize winner and holocaust survivor eli wiesel told the gathering .

jewish european leaders criticized eu leaders of looking on indifferently as the number of attacks against against jews and desecration of jewish sites rose in recent years . youths from the large communities of arab immigrants in france , belgium and other countries are largely blamed for the attacks .
" the challenge of anti-semitism exists as long as schools , synagogues and kindergartens are threatened , " german foreign minister joschka fischer said .
anti-semitic not to be confused with anti-israeli fischer , however , joined other european officials in drawing a distinct line between criticism of jews and criticism of israel .
while praising israeli prime minister ariel sharon 's recent decision to pull out of the gaza strip , fischer said it should also be possible to criticize the israeli government without being labeled anti-semitic .
prodi also criticized statements made by people like the united states envoy to the eu that draw lines between the levels of anti-semitism today and in the 1930s .
" europe today is not the europe of the 1930s and 1940s and to say that would be quite wrong - we must not insult the memory of the shoah -lrb- hebrew for holocaust -rrb- by equating what is happening today ... with what happened then , " he said , according to reuters .
reports criticized the eu nevertheless has a lot of work to do , according to jewish leaders .
the new york-based world jewish congress called an eu poll last year in which israel topped a list of nations seen as threatening world peace as " dangerously inflammatory . "
the european jewish congress also criticized the eu 's european monitoring center on racism and xenophobia foir witholding a report last year that blamed the rise in anti-semitic attacks on right-wing extremists or young muslims " mostly of arab descent . "
the jewish group said the eu had suppressed the report because it linked arab immigrants to anti-semitic violence in europe .

prodi also criticized statements made by people like the united states envoy to the eu that draw lines between the levels of anti-semitism today and in the 1930s .
" europe today is not the europe of the 1930s and 1940s and to say that would be quite wrong - we must not insult the memory of the shoah -lrb- hebrew for holocaust -rrb- by equating what is happening today ... with what happened then , " he said , according to reuters .
reports criticized the eu nevertheless has a lot of work to do , according to jewish leaders .
the new york-based world jewish congress called an eu poll last year in which israel topped a list of nations seen as threatening world peace as " dangerously inflammatory . "
the european jewish congress also criticized the eu 's european monitoring center on racism and xenophobia foir witholding a report last year that blamed the rise in anti-semitic attacks on right-wing extremists or young muslims " mostly of arab descent . "
the jewish group said the eu had suppressed the report because it linked arab immigrants to anti-semitic violence in europe .
the monitoring center , however , said it had withheld the report because it was of " poor quality and lacking in empirical evidence .

substitute carsten ramelow snatched victory from the jaws of a mediocre stalemate in croatia on wednesday night as germany won 2-1 in the team 's latest preparation match for the european championships this summer . it was business as usual for the german national soccer team on wednesday night .
despite an unconvincing performance against opposition which would normally have been brushed aside by a team of germany 's standing , rudi völler 's men labored to victory once more with a last minute 2-1 win over croatia in split . with their reputation as a football power waning after weak displays against lithuania , iceland and scotland in qualifying for the european championships in portugal , germany was looking to dispatch the opposition in style with the soccer showpiece looming ahead in june . the croatians , however , have proved to germany in the past that they are no pushovers , and it was they who started the better in this friendly warm-up game for euro 2004 . donning his countrymen 's jersey , bayern munich defender robert kovac almost put the home side ahead on 15 minutes when he directed a corner kick goalwards with a strong headed attempt but was thwarted by germany 's 20-year-old debutant philipp lahm who cleared the effort off the line much to the dismay of the croatian crowd .
stuttgart 's kuranyi proves elusive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kevin kuranyi .
the three-time world cup winners had to wait another quarter of an hour before they first really threatened stipe pletikosa in the croatian goal .
vfb stuttgart 's kevin kuranyi -lrb- photo -rrb- slipped through the dawdling defenders to meet a looping cross but sent his header wide of the far post .
in fact , it was croatia 's wobbly defence - important for euro 2004 group opponents england , france and switzerland - which led to their downfall .
after pegging the germans back for most of the first half , another kuranyi surge exposed croatia 's poor marking and with the croatian rearguard standing motionless , miroslav klose somehow forced his cross home with his knee on 34 minutes .
makeshift midfield charged with stabilization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's coach rudi völler .
germany missed world cup hero michael ballack , who was ruled out late with bronchitis , and the absense of the bayern munich playmaker was sorely felt as the second half opened with the germans in uninspiring form .
coach völler had made several forced changes in his team selection before the game , reshuffling his midfield around the returning liverpool midfielder dietmar hamann and the unsettled dortmunder torsten frings .
again it was croatia and kovac who provided the first real chance of the second period .
with the uncertain looking oliver kahn once more hesitant in goal , kovac whipped in a free kick which skipped off the turf , causing germany 's number one to spill the shot .
luckily for the german captain there were no waiting croatian attackers to tap the loose ball into the empty net .
kuranyi , proving to be germany 's most lively player , then missed his second glorious chance of the game when he poked an effort through pletikosa ' legs only to see the ball roll agonisingly wide of the far post .
chances go begging for croatia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn was floored again .
as the game ebbed and flowed , croatia once again found their rhythm and with 70 minutes on the clock , substitute nino bule should have equalized when it was germany 's defenders ' turn to be caught asleep .
with only kahn to beat , bule considered his options for too long before tamely passing the ball into the waiting goalkeeper 's arms .
the croatians should have been level minutes later when they somehow managed to miss guilt-edged chances from two huge goalmouth scrambles in the closing stages of the match .
but with four minutes remaining , mato neretljak succeeded where oliver kahn had failed by getting on the end of a looping corner and heading past the flapping keeper .

substitute carsten ramelow snatched victory from the jaws of a mediocre stalemate in croatia on wednesday night as germany won 2-1 in the team 's latest preparation match for the european championships this summer . it was business as usual for the german national soccer team on wednesday night .
despite an unconvincing performance against opposition which would normally have been brushed aside by a team of germany 's standing , rudi völler 's men labored to victory once more with a last minute 2-1 win over croatia in split . with their reputation as a football power waning after weak displays against lithuania , iceland and scotland in qualifying for the european championships in portugal , germany was looking to dispatch the opposition in style with the soccer showpiece looming ahead in june . the croatians , however , have proved to germany in the past that they are no pushovers , and it was they who started the better in this friendly warm-up game for euro 2004 . donning his countrymen 's jersey , bayern munich defender robert kovac almost put the home side ahead on 15 minutes when he directed a corner kick goalwards with a strong headed attempt but was thwarted by germany 's 20-year-old debutant philipp lahm who cleared the effort off the line much to the dismay of the croatian crowd .
stuttgart 's kuranyi proves elusive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kevin kuranyi .
the three-time world cup winners had to wait another quarter of an hour before they first really threatened stipe pletikosa in the croatian goal .
vfb stuttgart 's kevin kuranyi -lrb- photo -rrb- slipped through the dawdling defenders to meet a looping cross but sent his header wide of the far post .
in fact , it was croatia 's wobbly defence - important for euro 2004 group opponents england , france and switzerland - which led to their downfall .
after pegging the germans back for most of the first half , another kuranyi surge exposed croatia 's poor marking and with the croatian rearguard standing motionless , miroslav klose somehow forced his cross home with his knee on 34 minutes .
makeshift midfield charged with stabilization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's coach rudi völler .
germany missed world cup hero michael ballack , who was ruled out late with bronchitis , and the absense of the bayern munich playmaker was sorely felt as the second half opened with the germans in uninspiring form .
coach völler had made several forced changes in his team selection before the game , reshuffling his midfield around the returning liverpool midfielder dietmar hamann and the unsettled dortmunder torsten frings .
again it was croatia and kovac who provided the first real chance of the second period .
with the uncertain looking oliver kahn once more hesitant in goal , kovac whipped in a free kick which skipped off the turf , causing germany 's number one to spill the shot .
luckily for the german captain there were no waiting croatian attackers to tap the loose ball into the empty net .
kuranyi , proving to be germany 's most lively player , then missed his second glorious chance of the game when he poked an effort through pletikosa ' legs only to see the ball roll agonisingly wide of the far post .
chances go begging for croatia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn was floored again .
as the game ebbed and flowed , croatia once again found their rhythm and with 70 minutes on the clock , substitute nino bule should have equalized when it was germany 's defenders ' turn to be caught asleep .
with only kahn to beat , bule considered his options for too long before tamely passing the ball into the waiting goalkeeper 's arms .
the croatians should have been level minutes later when they somehow managed to miss guilt-edged chances from two huge goalmouth scrambles in the closing stages of the match .
but with four minutes remaining , mato neretljak succeeded where oliver kahn had failed by getting on the end of a looping corner and heading past the flapping keeper .
last minute hero bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carsten ramelow .
with another lackluster draw in the making , substitute carsten ramelow entered the picture .
the bayer leverkusen player saved the blushes of his team mates , and his captain especially , by volleying home the winner in the 90th minute to secure a flattering victory . germany 's next warm-up for the european championships comes on march 31 when it takes on belgium in cologne . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to face old foes in euro 2004 old scores and local rivalries are set to be settled in the opening stages of the european championships in portugal next summer as the soccer teams of germany and holland have been placed together in group d.

the leaders of france , germany and great britain urged europe to adapt to the changing world economy and make the continent more investor-friendly . president jacques chirac , british prime minister tony blair and chancellor gerhard schröder spoke after a two-a-half hour meeting in berlin wednesday .
as a sign of both the cordiality and the importance of topics on the table , the discussions will continue throughout the evening over dinner . the focal point of the afternoon discussions were the need for the three nations and europe as a whole to adapt their national economies and social security systems in the face of globalization and aging populations . " our own people and europe as a whole know there is an economic world that is changing very rapidly , and what this means is , is that the response of government on the national and european level has to be quick and equally adaptable to changing circumstances , " said british prime minister tony blair . make europe investor-friendly , dynamic the three signed a letter which will be sent to current european union president bertie ahern of ireland .
in the letter , the three countries urged the european commission , which initiates policy in the eu , to play a stronger rule in urging economic and health reforms and making europe more investor-friendly . the three called for a new super commissioner responsible for economics to be added to the body as part of changes being discussed by the new european constitution .
the three said the eu should keep its goal of being the most competitive and dynamic economy on earth by 2010 . chancellor gerhard schröder said the three had similar goals on investing in research , universities and innovation .
the chancellor , whose country is one of many european countries experiencing a brain drain of good scientists to the u.s. , talked about investing in the " fields of the future . " similar problems , similar solutions " we saw that there was a large amount of similarity in the types of problems we had , " said schröder . schröder and his social democratic green party coalition are experiencing plumetting popularity rates as a result of economic reforms that seek to dismantle the country 's generous welfare system and rejig the labor market . chirac and blair are undergoing similar fights in their own countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- l . -rrb- and french president jacques chirac both france and germany have been violators of the european union 's economic growth and stability pact , which sets public debt limits in eu member states .
by refusing to trim public spending to keep their social systems afloat during sluggish economic growth , both governments ran afoul of eu monetary officials , who sought legal action . " we need to change the system , without destroying it , " said schröder .
" only if we change it , can we keep it and can we afford it . " " big three " meeting no cause for concern the three leaders brushed back criticism that they were aiming to create an eu triumvirate that would block smaller member states .
blair pointed to the joint defense plan agreed on by the three countries last week and the efforts by german , french and british diplomats to curb iran 's nuclear ambitions as achievements that were good for all of europe . " if these three countries , which comprise almost half of the population in europe … work on clear agreements , then that is a good thing for our three countries but also for europe and there should n't be any concerns about exclusivity , " blair said . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's budding ménage à trois the leaders of britain , france and germany meet in berlin on wednesday to push for further european economic cooperation .

in the letter , the three countries urged the european commission , which initiates policy in the eu , to play a stronger rule in urging economic and health reforms and making europe more investor-friendly . the three called for a new super commissioner responsible for economics to be added to the body as part of changes being discussed by the new european constitution .
the three said the eu should keep its goal of being the most competitive and dynamic economy on earth by 2010 . chancellor gerhard schröder said the three had similar goals on investing in research , universities and innovation .

german finance minister hans eichel created an uproar after proposing a law that would send the labor police after domestic staff working illegally .
he 's since backed off . if eichel had his way , people who employed a cleaning lady or babysitter in germany could possibly be made into outlaws . as part of a tough government initiative to tackle germany 's booming illegal jobs market , eichel wanted to target all illegal workers and their employers .
under his bill proposal , domestic help , from cleaners to part-time tutors would be subject to the same constraints and rules as construction workers , office staff and employees in the commercial sector .
that meant that they could face prosecution under german labor laws if they were not registered workers , much in the same way that other workers such as builders , carpenters and technicians were .
private sector is decriminalized after an uproar among opposition politicians and members of the government 's junion coalition partner , the greens , chancellor gehard schröder 's cabinet reduced the severity of the law .
barbara hendricks , a deputy finance minister , declared after the cabinet decision : " the private area has become decriminalized . "
people working in the part-time domestic services sector are now not required to register for so-called " mini-jobs . " the government re-introduced the " minijobs " - which allow workers to earn up to € 400 without having to pay taxes or social benefits - in an effort to streamline registration and encourage workers to come out of the illegal sector .
labor police to look elsewhere an initiative put forward by the finance ministry had mobilized a force of 2,000 customs officers to track down and investigate cleaning ladies and other domestic staff who were working in the so-called shadow economy . a new ministry task force composed of 7,000 officers has been set up to investigate illegal workers and their employers .
their search will now be limited to the restaurant , construction , gaming and tourism industry . the police trade union and metalworkers union ig metall has criticized the new rules , claiming that illegal is illegal and the private sector should be monitored and regulated just as any other .
the government 's reversal came after the increasing clamor over the " cleaning lady debate " from many members of the public who felt it was unfair to treat domestic help in the same way as other areas of employment and include it in labor law categories along with drug dealers and prostitutes who evade taxation and social security levies . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de labor market reforms spelled out germany 's parliament votes on october 17 on labor market reforms that critics say will lead to painful cuts for people in and out of work .

he also said he would urge eu interior affairs and justice ministers to explore law enforcement measures and " pre-emptive acition in the field of education . "
" we want concrete results , " prodi told the gathering of jewish groups thursday .
the italian commission president comments came after months in which the eu came under heavy criticism for standing by amid a rising wave of anti-semitism in europe and the body 's perceived anti-israeli sentiment .
a " european disease " jewish leaders said the eu should monitor anti-jewish incidents more strictly , penalize the perpetrators of the violence more harshly and educate young europeans about the legacy of centuries of persecution on their continent .

" the challenge of anti-semitism exists as long as schools , synagogues and kindergartens are threatened , " german foreign minister joschka fischer said .
anti-semitic not to be confused with anti-israeli fischer , however , joined other european officials in drawing a distinct line between criticism of jews and criticism of israel .
while praising israeli prime minister ariel sharon 's recent decision to pull out of the gaza strip , fischer said it should also be possible to criticize the israeli government without being labeled anti-semitic .
prodi also criticized statements made by people like the united states envoy to the eu that draw lines between the levels of anti-semitism today and in the 1930s .
" europe today is not the europe of the 1930s and 1940s and to say that would be quite wrong - we must not insult the memory of the shoah -lrb- hebrew for holocaust -rrb- by equating what is happening today ... with what happened then , " he said , according to reuters .

the new york-based world jewish congress called an eu poll last year in which israel topped a list of nations seen as threatening world peace as " dangerously inflammatory . "
the european jewish congress also criticized the eu 's european monitoring center on racism and xenophobia foir witholding a report last year that blamed the rise in anti-semitic attacks on right-wing extremists or young muslims " mostly of arab descent . "
the jewish group said the eu had suppressed the report because it linked arab immigrants to anti-semitic violence in europe .

a " european disease " jewish leaders said the eu should monitor anti-jewish incidents more strictly , penalize the perpetrators of the violence more harshly and educate young europeans about the legacy of centuries of persecution on their continent .
though anti-semitism exists in many places in the world , it is also a distinctly " european disease , " nobel-prize winner and holocaust survivor eli wiesel told the gathering .

jewish european leaders criticized eu leaders of looking on indifferently as the number of attacks against against jews and desecration of jewish sites rose in recent years . youths from the large communities of arab immigrants in france , belgium and other countries are largely blamed for the attacks .
" the challenge of anti-semitism exists as long as schools , synagogues and kindergartens are threatened , " german foreign minister joschka fischer said .
anti-semitic not to be confused with anti-israeli fischer , however , joined other european officials in drawing a distinct line between criticism of jews and criticism of israel .
while praising israeli prime minister ariel sharon 's recent decision to pull out of the gaza strip , fischer said it should also be possible to criticize the israeli government without being labeled anti-semitic .
prodi also criticized statements made by people like the united states envoy to the eu that draw lines between the levels of anti-semitism today and in the 1930s .
" europe today is not the europe of the 1930s and 1940s and to say that would be quite wrong - we must not insult the memory of the shoah -lrb- hebrew for holocaust -rrb- by equating what is happening today ... with what happened then , " he said , according to reuters .
reports criticized the eu nevertheless has a lot of work to do , according to jewish leaders .
the new york-based world jewish congress called an eu poll last year in which israel topped a list of nations seen as threatening world peace as " dangerously inflammatory . "
the european jewish congress also criticized the eu 's european monitoring center on racism and xenophobia foir witholding a report last year that blamed the rise in anti-semitic attacks on right-wing extremists or young muslims " mostly of arab descent . "
the jewish group said the eu had suppressed the report because it linked arab immigrants to anti-semitic violence in europe .
the monitoring center , however , said it had withheld the report because it was of " poor quality and lacking in empirical evidence .

substitute carsten ramelow snatched victory from the jaws of a mediocre stalemate in croatia on wednesday night as germany won 2-1 in the team 's latest preparation match for the european championships this summer . it was business as usual for the german national soccer team on wednesday night .
despite an unconvincing performance against opposition which would normally have been brushed aside by a team of germany 's standing , rudi völler 's men labored to victory once more with a last minute 2-1 win over croatia in split . with their reputation as a football power waning after weak displays against lithuania , iceland and scotland in qualifying for the european championships in portugal , germany was looking to dispatch the opposition in style with the soccer showpiece looming ahead in june . the croatians , however , have proved to germany in the past that they are no pushovers , and it was they who started the better in this friendly warm-up game for euro 2004 . donning his countrymen 's jersey , bayern munich defender robert kovac almost put the home side ahead on 15 minutes when he directed a corner kick goalwards with a strong headed attempt but was thwarted by germany 's 20-year-old debutant philipp lahm who cleared the effort off the line much to the dismay of the croatian crowd .
stuttgart 's kuranyi proves elusive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kevin kuranyi .
the three-time world cup winners had to wait another quarter of an hour before they first really threatened stipe pletikosa in the croatian goal .
vfb stuttgart 's kevin kuranyi -lrb- photo -rrb- slipped through the dawdling defenders to meet a looping cross but sent his header wide of the far post .
in fact , it was croatia 's wobbly defence - important for euro 2004 group opponents england , france and switzerland - which led to their downfall .
after pegging the germans back for most of the first half , another kuranyi surge exposed croatia 's poor marking and with the croatian rearguard standing motionless , miroslav klose somehow forced his cross home with his knee on 34 minutes .
makeshift midfield charged with stabilization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's coach rudi völler .
germany missed world cup hero michael ballack , who was ruled out late with bronchitis , and the absense of the bayern munich playmaker was sorely felt as the second half opened with the germans in uninspiring form .
coach völler had made several forced changes in his team selection before the game , reshuffling his midfield around the returning liverpool midfielder dietmar hamann and the unsettled dortmunder torsten frings .
again it was croatia and kovac who provided the first real chance of the second period .
with the uncertain looking oliver kahn once more hesitant in goal , kovac whipped in a free kick which skipped off the turf , causing germany 's number one to spill the shot .
luckily for the german captain there were no waiting croatian attackers to tap the loose ball into the empty net .
kuranyi , proving to be germany 's most lively player , then missed his second glorious chance of the game when he poked an effort through pletikosa ' legs only to see the ball roll agonisingly wide of the far post .
chances go begging for croatia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn was floored again .
as the game ebbed and flowed , croatia once again found their rhythm and with 70 minutes on the clock , substitute nino bule should have equalized when it was germany 's defenders ' turn to be caught asleep .
with only kahn to beat , bule considered his options for too long before tamely passing the ball into the waiting goalkeeper 's arms .
the croatians should have been level minutes later when they somehow managed to miss guilt-edged chances from two huge goalmouth scrambles in the closing stages of the match .
but with four minutes remaining , mato neretljak succeeded where oliver kahn had failed by getting on the end of a looping corner and heading past the flapping keeper .
last minute hero bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carsten ramelow .
with another lackluster draw in the making , substitute carsten ramelow entered the picture .
the bayer leverkusen player saved the blushes of his team mates , and his captain especially , by volleying home the winner in the 90th minute to secure a flattering victory . germany 's next warm-up for the european championships comes on march 31 when it takes on belgium in cologne . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to face old foes in euro 2004 old scores and local rivalries are set to be settled in the opening stages of the european championships in portugal next summer as the soccer teams of germany and holland have been placed together in group d.

substitute carsten ramelow snatched victory from the jaws of a mediocre stalemate in croatia on wednesday night as germany won 2-1 in the team 's latest preparation match for the european championships this summer . it was business as usual for the german national soccer team on wednesday night .
despite an unconvincing performance against opposition which would normally have been brushed aside by a team of germany 's standing , rudi völler 's men labored to victory once more with a last minute 2-1 win over croatia in split . with their reputation as a football power waning after weak displays against lithuania , iceland and scotland in qualifying for the european championships in portugal , germany was looking to dispatch the opposition in style with the soccer showpiece looming ahead in june . the croatians , however , have proved to germany in the past that they are no pushovers , and it was they who started the better in this friendly warm-up game for euro 2004 . donning his countrymen 's jersey , bayern munich defender robert kovac almost put the home side ahead on 15 minutes when he directed a corner kick goalwards with a strong headed attempt but was thwarted by germany 's 20-year-old debutant philipp lahm who cleared the effort off the line much to the dismay of the croatian crowd .
stuttgart 's kuranyi proves elusive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kevin kuranyi .
the three-time world cup winners had to wait another quarter of an hour before they first really threatened stipe pletikosa in the croatian goal .
vfb stuttgart 's kevin kuranyi -lrb- photo -rrb- slipped through the dawdling defenders to meet a looping cross but sent his header wide of the far post .
in fact , it was croatia 's wobbly defence - important for euro 2004 group opponents england , france and switzerland - which led to their downfall .
after pegging the germans back for most of the first half , another kuranyi surge exposed croatia 's poor marking and with the croatian rearguard standing motionless , miroslav klose somehow forced his cross home with his knee on 34 minutes .
makeshift midfield charged with stabilization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's coach rudi völler .
germany missed world cup hero michael ballack , who was ruled out late with bronchitis , and the absense of the bayern munich playmaker was sorely felt as the second half opened with the germans in uninspiring form .
coach völler had made several forced changes in his team selection before the game , reshuffling his midfield around the returning liverpool midfielder dietmar hamann and the unsettled dortmunder torsten frings .
again it was croatia and kovac who provided the first real chance of the second period .
with the uncertain looking oliver kahn once more hesitant in goal , kovac whipped in a free kick which skipped off the turf , causing germany 's number one to spill the shot .
luckily for the german captain there were no waiting croatian attackers to tap the loose ball into the empty net .
kuranyi , proving to be germany 's most lively player , then missed his second glorious chance of the game when he poked an effort through pletikosa ' legs only to see the ball roll agonisingly wide of the far post .
chances go begging for croatia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn was floored again .
as the game ebbed and flowed , croatia once again found their rhythm and with 70 minutes on the clock , substitute nino bule should have equalized when it was germany 's defenders ' turn to be caught asleep .
with only kahn to beat , bule considered his options for too long before tamely passing the ball into the waiting goalkeeper 's arms .
the croatians should have been level minutes later when they somehow managed to miss guilt-edged chances from two huge goalmouth scrambles in the closing stages of the match .
but with four minutes remaining , mato neretljak succeeded where oliver kahn had failed by getting on the end of a looping corner and heading past the flapping keeper .
last minute hero bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carsten ramelow .
with another lackluster draw in the making , substitute carsten ramelow entered the picture .
the bayer leverkusen player saved the blushes of his team mates , and his captain especially , by volleying home the winner in the 90th minute to secure a flattering victory . germany 's next warm-up for the european championships comes on march 31 when it takes on belgium in cologne . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to face old foes in euro 2004 old scores and local rivalries are set to be settled in the opening stages of the european championships in portugal next summer as the soccer teams of germany and holland have been placed together in group d.

despite an unconvincing performance against opposition which would normally have been brushed aside by a team of germany 's standing , rudi völler 's men labored to victory once more with a last minute 2-1 win over croatia in split . with their reputation as a football power waning after weak displays against lithuania , iceland and scotland in qualifying for the european championships in portugal , germany was looking to dispatch the opposition in style with the soccer showpiece looming ahead in june . the croatians , however , have proved to germany in the past that they are no pushovers , and it was they who started the better in this friendly warm-up game for euro 2004 . donning his countrymen 's jersey , bayern munich defender robert kovac almost put the home side ahead on 15 minutes when he directed a corner kick goalwards with a strong headed attempt but was thwarted by germany 's 20-year-old debutant philipp lahm who cleared the effort off the line much to the dismay of the croatian crowd .
stuttgart 's kuranyi proves elusive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kevin kuranyi .
the three-time world cup winners had to wait another quarter of an hour before they first really threatened stipe pletikosa in the croatian goal .
vfb stuttgart 's kevin kuranyi -lrb- photo -rrb- slipped through the dawdling defenders to meet a looping cross but sent his header wide of the far post .
in fact , it was croatia 's wobbly defence - important for euro 2004 group opponents england , france and switzerland - which led to their downfall .
after pegging the germans back for most of the first half , another kuranyi surge exposed croatia 's poor marking and with the croatian rearguard standing motionless , miroslav klose somehow forced his cross home with his knee on 34 minutes .
makeshift midfield charged with stabilization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's coach rudi völler .
germany missed world cup hero michael ballack , who was ruled out late with bronchitis , and the absense of the bayern munich playmaker was sorely felt as the second half opened with the germans in uninspiring form .
coach völler had made several forced changes in his team selection before the game , reshuffling his midfield around the returning liverpool midfielder dietmar hamann and the unsettled dortmunder torsten frings .
again it was croatia and kovac who provided the first real chance of the second period .
with the uncertain looking oliver kahn once more hesitant in goal , kovac whipped in a free kick which skipped off the turf , causing germany 's number one to spill the shot .
luckily for the german captain there were no waiting croatian attackers to tap the loose ball into the empty net .
kuranyi , proving to be germany 's most lively player , then missed his second glorious chance of the game when he poked an effort through pletikosa ' legs only to see the ball roll agonisingly wide of the far post .
chances go begging for croatia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn was floored again .
as the game ebbed and flowed , croatia once again found their rhythm and with 70 minutes on the clock , substitute nino bule should have equalized when it was germany 's defenders ' turn to be caught asleep .
with only kahn to beat , bule considered his options for too long before tamely passing the ball into the waiting goalkeeper 's arms .
the croatians should have been level minutes later when they somehow managed to miss guilt-edged chances from two huge goalmouth scrambles in the closing stages of the match .
but with four minutes remaining , mato neretljak succeeded where oliver kahn had failed by getting on the end of a looping corner and heading past the flapping keeper .
last minute hero bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carsten ramelow .
with another lackluster draw in the making , substitute carsten ramelow entered the picture .
the bayer leverkusen player saved the blushes of his team mates , and his captain especially , by volleying home the winner in the 90th minute to secure a flattering victory . germany 's next warm-up for the european championships comes on march 31 when it takes on belgium in cologne . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to face old foes in euro 2004 old scores and local rivalries are set to be settled in the opening stages of the european championships in portugal next summer as the soccer teams of germany and holland have been placed together in group d.

the leaders of france , germany and great britain urged europe to adapt to the changing world economy and make the continent more investor-friendly . president jacques chirac , british prime minister tony blair and chancellor gerhard schröder spoke after a two-a-half hour meeting in berlin wednesday .
as a sign of both the cordiality and the importance of topics on the table , the discussions will continue throughout the evening over dinner . the focal point of the afternoon discussions were the need for the three nations and europe as a whole to adapt their national economies and social security systems in the face of globalization and aging populations . " our own people and europe as a whole know there is an economic world that is changing very rapidly , and what this means is , is that the response of government on the national and european level has to be quick and equally adaptable to changing circumstances , " said british prime minister tony blair . make europe investor-friendly , dynamic the three signed a letter which will be sent to current european union president bertie ahern of ireland .
in the letter , the three countries urged the european commission , which initiates policy in the eu , to play a stronger rule in urging economic and health reforms and making europe more investor-friendly . the three called for a new super commissioner responsible for economics to be added to the body as part of changes being discussed by the new european constitution .
the three said the eu should keep its goal of being the most competitive and dynamic economy on earth by 2010 . chancellor gerhard schröder said the three had similar goals on investing in research , universities and innovation .
the chancellor , whose country is one of many european countries experiencing a brain drain of good scientists to the u.s. , talked about investing in the " fields of the future . " similar problems , similar solutions " we saw that there was a large amount of similarity in the types of problems we had , " said schröder . schröder and his social democratic green party coalition are experiencing plumetting popularity rates as a result of economic reforms that seek to dismantle the country 's generous welfare system and rejig the labor market . chirac and blair are undergoing similar fights in their own countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- l . -rrb- and french president jacques chirac both france and germany have been violators of the european union 's economic growth and stability pact , which sets public debt limits in eu member states .
by refusing to trim public spending to keep their social systems afloat during sluggish economic growth , both governments ran afoul of eu monetary officials , who sought legal action . " we need to change the system , without destroying it , " said schröder .
" only if we change it , can we keep it and can we afford it . " " big three " meeting no cause for concern the three leaders brushed back criticism that they were aiming to create an eu triumvirate that would block smaller member states .

as a sign of both the cordiality and the importance of topics on the table , the discussions will continue throughout the evening over dinner . the focal point of the afternoon discussions were the need for the three nations and europe as a whole to adapt their national economies and social security systems in the face of globalization and aging populations . " our own people and europe as a whole know there is an economic world that is changing very rapidly , and what this means is , is that the response of government on the national and european level has to be quick and equally adaptable to changing circumstances , " said british prime minister tony blair . make europe investor-friendly , dynamic the three signed a letter which will be sent to current european union president bertie ahern of ireland .
in the letter , the three countries urged the european commission , which initiates policy in the eu , to play a stronger rule in urging economic and health reforms and making europe more investor-friendly . the three called for a new super commissioner responsible for economics to be added to the body as part of changes being discussed by the new european constitution .
the three said the eu should keep its goal of being the most competitive and dynamic economy on earth by 2010 . chancellor gerhard schröder said the three had similar goals on investing in research , universities and innovation .
the chancellor , whose country is one of many european countries experiencing a brain drain of good scientists to the u.s. , talked about investing in the " fields of the future . " similar problems , similar solutions " we saw that there was a large amount of similarity in the types of problems we had , " said schröder . schröder and his social democratic green party coalition are experiencing plumetting popularity rates as a result of economic reforms that seek to dismantle the country 's generous welfare system and rejig the labor market . chirac and blair are undergoing similar fights in their own countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- l . -rrb- and french president jacques chirac both france and germany have been violators of the european union 's economic growth and stability pact , which sets public debt limits in eu member states .
by refusing to trim public spending to keep their social systems afloat during sluggish economic growth , both governments ran afoul of eu monetary officials , who sought legal action . " we need to change the system , without destroying it , " said schröder .
" only if we change it , can we keep it and can we afford it . " " big three " meeting no cause for concern the three leaders brushed back criticism that they were aiming to create an eu triumvirate that would block smaller member states .
blair pointed to the joint defense plan agreed on by the three countries last week and the efforts by german , french and british diplomats to curb iran 's nuclear ambitions as achievements that were good for all of europe . " if these three countries , which comprise almost half of the population in europe … work on clear agreements , then that is a good thing for our three countries but also for europe and there should n't be any concerns about exclusivity , " blair said . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's budding ménage à trois the leaders of britain , france and germany meet in berlin on wednesday to push for further european economic cooperation .

the leaders of britain , france and germany meet in berlin on wednesday to push for further european economic cooperation .
but others in the eu fear the trio are trying to run europe . a year after the men were at odds over the war in iraq , the leaders of europe 's big three have been working hard at rapprochement these days .
the most visible sign of that new spirit has been an agreement on a common european defense policy reached last december . " that 's an outstanding event that can not be overestimated , " german chancellor schröder told reporters at the time .
this common defense policy and the recent announcement to establish rapid response forces have laid the foundation for an eu " core group . " british premier tony blair might dispute the existence of such a trilateral eu directorate .
but fearing to be side-stepped in an expanded european union , blair has effectively joined germany and france as the bloc 's driving force .
" i strongly believe that britain should play a leading role in the center of europe and not stand aside , " he said . many of the union 's smaller member states are sceptical about the increased trilateral cooperation .
blair does n't think that 's a problem though : the british leader sees himself as the spokesman for new members , who are pro-british and pro-american , in his opinion .
" many states that are now entering the union share the british vision for europe , " he said . moving ahead after constitution talks fail failure to reach a compromise on a proposed eu constitution last december prompted schröder and french president jacques chirac to moot the possibility of turning the eu 's franco-german-led engine into a group of pioneers willing to push ahead with further unification . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro monument is illuminated in front of the european central bank in frankfurt .
" this means that these countries will move ahead , just as has already happened with the euro or the schengen agreement , " chirac said , referring to the abolishment of border controls between most eu countries . although belgium , hungary , the czech republic and greece have expressed interest in joining a leading group , italy , spain and poland oppose making distinctions within the bloc . " europe does n't need a directorate , that would only mess things up , " italian premier silvio berlusconi said on tuesday .
" that 's my opinion , which is shared by other european states except the three in question . " a europe of different speeds schröder , on the other hand , believes that a europe of different speeds will become inevitable should the negotiations over an eu constitution fail for good .
" germany is willing to enter what 's called closer cooperation with france , britain and other eu members , " the chancellor said .
" there 's no question about it . " schröder , who has worked closely with the conservative chirac , is glad to see blair , a fellow social democrat , come aboard .
and according to schröder , the only way to ensure an effective foreign and security policy for the union is to have britain in a leading group . driving or deciding europe 's future unification ? back in 1998 , when joschka fischer took on the job of german foreign minister , he still warned against making britain a part of the franco-german eu engine : britain had n't accepted the eu 's common currency and was opposed to closer cooperation , fischer explained at the time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu family is getting a lot bigger in may .
but now , the troika might push along the unwieldy union with 25 member states and guarantee desperately needed leadership .
that 's the optimistic view .
pessimists see things differently .
first , france and germany suspended the euro zone 's stability pact , together with britain they will now try to affix their seal on the union 's foreign and economic policy , they say . indeed , blair , chirac and schröder plan to write a critical letter to the european commission on wednesday , demanding significant changes to the bloc 's investment program , which is scheduled for adoption at a summit at the end of march . bernd riegert -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair and schröder deny plans for " triumvirate " with chirac german chancellor gerhard schröder and british prime minister tony blair met in berlin on thursday ahead of a three-way summit with france next week .

prosecutors at the international war crimes tribunal will wrap up their case against slobodan milosevic in the next few days .
the former serb leader plans a defense strategy that could extend the trial until 2006 . on most days , slobodan milosevic enters the court room in his customary blue suit .
with the light disinterested gaze of a 61-year-old man with nothing left to lose , he peers back and forth between witnesses testifying on the stand .
for the past two years , the former president of serbia and yugoslavia has stood in the dock of the international war crimes tribunal in the hague .
milosevic , whose case has been modified several times , is charged with 60 war crimes including genocide in bosnia-herzegovina and crimes against humanity in croatia and kosovo .
he is accused in the killings of tens of thousands and the displacement of thousands of people from their homes in the last decade during wars that ravaged the former yugoslavia .
if convicted , he could face a life sentence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.n. war crimes prosecutor carla del ponte .
chief prosecutor carla del ponte -lrb- photo -rrb- and her team are expected to wrap up their case against the ex-dictator in the next week .
the closing arguments will mark the end of the first part of the trial .
milosevic , who has chosen to defend himself , and the two attorneys and legal aide helping him can then prepare a defense strategy and a list of witnesses .
but first , milosevic has the option of requesting an audit of the prosecution 's case .
the three-judge panel then can shoot down arguments and charges for which there is insufficient evidence .
prosecutor 's tough case the process could be damaging for del ponte , who has already been criticized for being too headstrong and not allowing the judges to make their mark on the case .
the shakiest part is believed to be the genocide charge , a weakness even del ponte has conceded .
no one has been able to prove in court that milosevic himself ordered the slaughter of more than 7,000 bosnian muslims in srebrenica in 1995 .
philipp morillon , the former united nations commander in bosnia , who has testified about the massacre , has even partially defended milosevic , saying he had headed off the first possible attack on srebrenica ’ s muslims .
the war crimes charges stemming from croatia and bosnia could also prove problematic .
the prosecution has built the charges on the premise that milosevic was operating a “ criminal organization ” with the goal of building a “ great serbia ” that stretched into parts of croatia and bosnia .
but legal expert sluiter says prosecutors have failed to turn up written evidence .
del ponte has also had trouble finding cooperative witnesses to prove the case against milosevic .
should be enough for long prison term international law expert gören sluiter warns not to place too much blame on del ponte herself .
sluiter said the judges have also made mistakes by failing to set time limits for prosecutors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slobodan milosevic enters the courtroom .
" they have done that to a certain degree ... but giving the prosecutors two years to present the case is extremely long and does not force the prosecutor to be more selective , " sluiter told dw-world .
the prosecution team has managed to present some very effective witnesses , like former nato generals wesley clark and klaus naumann , who have provided would could be deeply incriminating evidence against milosevic .
the generals ' testimony could be especially useful in regard to the crimes against humanity charges in kosovo , sluiter said .
testimony combined with information out of police and army archives in belgrade should be enough to convict the former serb leader and put him behind bars for a long time .
trial could last until 2006 but first milosevic will have the opportunity to defend himself against these charges .
legal observers expect his defense to take as much time and include as many witnesses as del ponte ’ s prosecution .
after a first ruling in the case , an appeals process is anticipated , with no final decision expected before the end of 2006 .
whether milosevic is convicted or not , the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia will continue to play an important role in the truth and reconciliation process of the balkans , according to sluiter .
“ one should also not exaggerate the importance of the milosevic trial .
it comes at a time when the tribunal has already been functioning for a number of years and over those years they have dealt with all of these incidents , " he said .

prosecutors at the international war crimes tribunal will wrap up their case against slobodan milosevic in the next few days .
the former serb leader plans a defense strategy that could extend the trial until 2006 . on most days , slobodan milosevic enters the court room in his customary blue suit .
with the light disinterested gaze of a 61-year-old man with nothing left to lose , he peers back and forth between witnesses testifying on the stand .
for the past two years , the former president of serbia and yugoslavia has stood in the dock of the international war crimes tribunal in the hague .
milosevic , whose case has been modified several times , is charged with 60 war crimes including genocide in bosnia-herzegovina and crimes against humanity in croatia and kosovo .
he is accused in the killings of tens of thousands and the displacement of thousands of people from their homes in the last decade during wars that ravaged the former yugoslavia .
if convicted , he could face a life sentence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.n. war crimes prosecutor carla del ponte .
chief prosecutor carla del ponte -lrb- photo -rrb- and her team are expected to wrap up their case against the ex-dictator in the next week .
the closing arguments will mark the end of the first part of the trial .
milosevic , who has chosen to defend himself , and the two attorneys and legal aide helping him can then prepare a defense strategy and a list of witnesses .
but first , milosevic has the option of requesting an audit of the prosecution 's case .
the three-judge panel then can shoot down arguments and charges for which there is insufficient evidence .
prosecutor 's tough case the process could be damaging for del ponte , who has already been criticized for being too headstrong and not allowing the judges to make their mark on the case .
the shakiest part is believed to be the genocide charge , a weakness even del ponte has conceded .
no one has been able to prove in court that milosevic himself ordered the slaughter of more than 7,000 bosnian muslims in srebrenica in 1995 .
philipp morillon , the former united nations commander in bosnia , who has testified about the massacre , has even partially defended milosevic , saying he had headed off the first possible attack on srebrenica ’ s muslims .
the war crimes charges stemming from croatia and bosnia could also prove problematic .
the prosecution has built the charges on the premise that milosevic was operating a “ criminal organization ” with the goal of building a “ great serbia ” that stretched into parts of croatia and bosnia .
but legal expert sluiter says prosecutors have failed to turn up written evidence .
del ponte has also had trouble finding cooperative witnesses to prove the case against milosevic .
should be enough for long prison term international law expert gören sluiter warns not to place too much blame on del ponte herself .
sluiter said the judges have also made mistakes by failing to set time limits for prosecutors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slobodan milosevic enters the courtroom .
" they have done that to a certain degree ... but giving the prosecutors two years to present the case is extremely long and does not force the prosecutor to be more selective , " sluiter told dw-world .
the prosecution team has managed to present some very effective witnesses , like former nato generals wesley clark and klaus naumann , who have provided would could be deeply incriminating evidence against milosevic .
the generals ' testimony could be especially useful in regard to the crimes against humanity charges in kosovo , sluiter said .
testimony combined with information out of police and army archives in belgrade should be enough to convict the former serb leader and put him behind bars for a long time .
trial could last until 2006 but first milosevic will have the opportunity to defend himself against these charges .
legal observers expect his defense to take as much time and include as many witnesses as del ponte ’ s prosecution .
after a first ruling in the case , an appeals process is anticipated , with no final decision expected before the end of 2006 .
whether milosevic is convicted or not , the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia will continue to play an important role in the truth and reconciliation process of the balkans , according to sluiter .
“ one should also not exaggerate the importance of the milosevic trial .
it comes at a time when the tribunal has already been functioning for a number of years and over those years they have dealt with all of these incidents , " he said .

the leaders of france , germany and great britain urged europe to adapt to the changing world economy and make the continent more investor-friendly . president jacques chirac , british prime minister tony blair and chancellor gerhard schröder spoke after a two-a-half hour meeting in berlin wednesday .
as a sign of both the cordiality and the importance of topics on the table , the discussions will continue throughout the evening over dinner . the focal point of the afternoon discussions were the need for the three nations and europe as a whole to adapt their national economies and social security systems in the face of globalization and aging populations . " our own people and europe as a whole know there is an economic world that is changing very rapidly , and what this means is , is that the response of government on the national and european level has to be quick and equally adaptable to changing circumstances , " said british prime minister tony blair . make europe investor-friendly , dynamic the three signed a letter which will be sent to current european union president bertie ahern of ireland .
in the letter , the three countries urged the european commission , which initiates policy in the eu , to play a stronger rule in urging economic and health reforms and making europe more investor-friendly . the three called for a new super commissioner responsible for economics to be added to the body as part of changes being discussed by the new european constitution .
the three said the eu should keep its goal of being the most competitive and dynamic economy on earth by 2010 . chancellor gerhard schröder said the three had similar goals on investing in research , universities and innovation .
the chancellor , whose country is one of many european countries experiencing a brain drain of good scientists to the u.s. , talked about investing in the " fields of the future . " similar problems , similar solutions " we saw that there was a large amount of similarity in the types of problems we had , " said schröder . schröder and his social democratic green party coalition are experiencing plumetting popularity rates as a result of economic reforms that seek to dismantle the country 's generous welfare system and rejig the labor market . chirac and blair are undergoing similar fights in their own countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- l . -rrb- and french president jacques chirac both france and germany have been violators of the european union 's economic growth and stability pact , which sets public debt limits in eu member states .
by refusing to trim public spending to keep their social systems afloat during sluggish economic growth , both governments ran afoul of eu monetary officials , who sought legal action . " we need to change the system , without destroying it , " said schröder .
" only if we change it , can we keep it and can we afford it . " " big three " meeting no cause for concern the three leaders brushed back criticism that they were aiming to create an eu triumvirate that would block smaller member states .
blair pointed to the joint defense plan agreed on by the three countries last week and the efforts by german , french and british diplomats to curb iran 's nuclear ambitions as achievements that were good for all of europe . " if these three countries , which comprise almost half of the population in europe … work on clear agreements , then that is a good thing for our three countries but also for europe and there should n't be any concerns about exclusivity , " blair said . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's budding ménage à trois the leaders of britain , france and germany meet in berlin on wednesday to push for further european economic cooperation .

eurocrats in brussels are fed up with the many myths peddled by the media about the european union .
a european commission website sets out to put the record straight . last year , british tabloid the daily mail informed its readers that the eu was planning to ban corgis .
" certain breeds of the queen 's favorite dog could be outlawed under a controversial eu convention being considered by ministers , " it revealed . the shock revelation which outraged animal lovers across the country and fuelled anti-european sentiment in fact had nothing to do with the eu .
the story originated with a committee of animal protection experts which drew up a european convention for the protection of pet animals designed to improve the welfare of household pets . whatever .
readers were all too willing to believe the eu was up to its usual nonsense . this sort of scare-mongering plays right into the hands of euroskeptics - as brussels is all too aware .
the european commission now features on its website a compilation of popular misconceptions ranging from the sublime to the ridiculous , giving the inside story , laying out the facts and debunking the myths . media-fuelled hostility a lot of europhiles feel the press coverage contributes to widespread bewilderment and hostility towards europe , feeding a popular attitude that the eu is a dangerous behemoth deliberately blinding its citizens with layers of impenetrable bureaucracy and ludicrous laws . admittedly , brussels is an easy target .
a tangle of competing institutions and different agendas , eu bodies are notorious for excessive red tape , corruption scandals and mystifying rules and regulations .
it all contributes to a culture of confusion that leaves the public willing to believe just about anything . according to michael mann from the european commission press office , the british media is a main offender , with the tabloids all trying to outdo one another with sensational stories . mann is now busy collecting myths and countering them with facts .
in his opinion , the problem is that the level of debate about europe is n't as high as it should be . a reflection of national reservations the misunderstandings and prejudices come in all shapes and sizes .
maintaining that eu officials are grossly overpaid is one thing - but the idea that male members of staff are reimbursed for the medical costs of viagra pills is slightly less well-founded . horror stories from brussels are part of the media 's daily diet , but reveal an astonishing gullibility on the part of many europeans .
on the euro-myth silly scale , old favorites such as greengrocers having to conform to rules covering size , length , color and texture of fruit and vegetables are less believable than proposals for a new european flag , but the sheer quantity of misapprehensions goes to show how little the public understands the workings of the european union .
viola eggert from the european commission 's berlin office attributes the problem to the commission 's zeal for regulations , saying many myths about the eu popular in germany " are based on over-regulation and the idea that the eu tells its citizens what they 're allowed to do , and has too big an influence on their lives . "
so although gullibility may be to blame for many of the myths , the volume of misinformation appears to reflect strong national reservations about the sort of things the european commission would like to do if left to its own devices .
anti-eu groups are all too willing to twist the facts about brussels ' law-making , but the eu would do well to conclude it should , in future , explain itself better .
after all , brussels does have one of the most extensive press corps in the world .
but as michael mann points out , brussels can only do so much - and the rest is up to national governments .

the leaders of britain , france and germany meet in berlin on wednesday to push for further european economic cooperation .
but others in the eu fear the trio are trying to run europe . a year after the men were at odds over the war in iraq , the leaders of europe 's big three have been working hard at rapprochement these days .
the most visible sign of that new spirit has been an agreement on a common european defense policy reached last december . " that 's an outstanding event that can not be overestimated , " german chancellor schröder told reporters at the time .
this common defense policy and the recent announcement to establish rapid response forces have laid the foundation for an eu " core group . " british premier tony blair might dispute the existence of such a trilateral eu directorate .
but fearing to be side-stepped in an expanded european union , blair has effectively joined germany and france as the bloc 's driving force .
" i strongly believe that britain should play a leading role in the center of europe and not stand aside , " he said . many of the union 's smaller member states are sceptical about the increased trilateral cooperation .
blair does n't think that 's a problem though : the british leader sees himself as the spokesman for new members , who are pro-british and pro-american , in his opinion .
" many states that are now entering the union share the british vision for europe , " he said . moving ahead after constitution talks fail failure to reach a compromise on a proposed eu constitution last december prompted schröder and french president jacques chirac to moot the possibility of turning the eu 's franco-german-led engine into a group of pioneers willing to push ahead with further unification . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro monument is illuminated in front of the european central bank in frankfurt .
" this means that these countries will move ahead , just as has already happened with the euro or the schengen agreement , " chirac said , referring to the abolishment of border controls between most eu countries . although belgium , hungary , the czech republic and greece have expressed interest in joining a leading group , italy , spain and poland oppose making distinctions within the bloc . " europe does n't need a directorate , that would only mess things up , " italian premier silvio berlusconi said on tuesday .
" that 's my opinion , which is shared by other european states except the three in question . " a europe of different speeds schröder , on the other hand , believes that a europe of different speeds will become inevitable should the negotiations over an eu constitution fail for good .
" germany is willing to enter what 's called closer cooperation with france , britain and other eu members , " the chancellor said .
" there 's no question about it . " schröder , who has worked closely with the conservative chirac , is glad to see blair , a fellow social democrat , come aboard .
and according to schröder , the only way to ensure an effective foreign and security policy for the union is to have britain in a leading group . driving or deciding europe 's future unification ? back in 1998 , when joschka fischer took on the job of german foreign minister , he still warned against making britain a part of the franco-german eu engine : britain had n't accepted the eu 's common currency and was opposed to closer cooperation , fischer explained at the time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu family is getting a lot bigger in may .
but now , the troika might push along the unwieldy union with 25 member states and guarantee desperately needed leadership .
that 's the optimistic view .
pessimists see things differently .
first , france and germany suspended the euro zone 's stability pact , together with britain they will now try to affix their seal on the union 's foreign and economic policy , they say . indeed , blair , chirac and schröder plan to write a critical letter to the european commission on wednesday , demanding significant changes to the bloc 's investment program , which is scheduled for adoption at a summit at the end of march . bernd riegert -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair and schröder deny plans for " triumvirate " with chirac german chancellor gerhard schröder and british prime minister tony blair met in berlin on thursday ahead of a three-way summit with france next week .

the leaders of britain , france and germany meet in berlin on wednesday to push for further european economic cooperation .
but others in the eu fear the trio are trying to run europe . a year after the men were at odds over the war in iraq , the leaders of europe 's big three have been working hard at rapprochement these days .
the most visible sign of that new spirit has been an agreement on a common european defense policy reached last december . " that 's an outstanding event that can not be overestimated , " german chancellor schröder told reporters at the time .
this common defense policy and the recent announcement to establish rapid response forces have laid the foundation for an eu " core group . " british premier tony blair might dispute the existence of such a trilateral eu directorate .
but fearing to be side-stepped in an expanded european union , blair has effectively joined germany and france as the bloc 's driving force .
" i strongly believe that britain should play a leading role in the center of europe and not stand aside , " he said . many of the union 's smaller member states are sceptical about the increased trilateral cooperation .
blair does n't think that 's a problem though : the british leader sees himself as the spokesman for new members , who are pro-british and pro-american , in his opinion .
" many states that are now entering the union share the british vision for europe , " he said . moving ahead after constitution talks fail failure to reach a compromise on a proposed eu constitution last december prompted schröder and french president jacques chirac to moot the possibility of turning the eu 's franco-german-led engine into a group of pioneers willing to push ahead with further unification . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro monument is illuminated in front of the european central bank in frankfurt .
" this means that these countries will move ahead , just as has already happened with the euro or the schengen agreement , " chirac said , referring to the abolishment of border controls between most eu countries . although belgium , hungary , the czech republic and greece have expressed interest in joining a leading group , italy , spain and poland oppose making distinctions within the bloc . " europe does n't need a directorate , that would only mess things up , " italian premier silvio berlusconi said on tuesday .
" that 's my opinion , which is shared by other european states except the three in question . " a europe of different speeds schröder , on the other hand , believes that a europe of different speeds will become inevitable should the negotiations over an eu constitution fail for good .
" germany is willing to enter what 's called closer cooperation with france , britain and other eu members , " the chancellor said .
" there 's no question about it . " schröder , who has worked closely with the conservative chirac , is glad to see blair , a fellow social democrat , come aboard .
and according to schröder , the only way to ensure an effective foreign and security policy for the union is to have britain in a leading group . driving or deciding europe 's future unification ? back in 1998 , when joschka fischer took on the job of german foreign minister , he still warned against making britain a part of the franco-german eu engine : britain had n't accepted the eu 's common currency and was opposed to closer cooperation , fischer explained at the time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu family is getting a lot bigger in may .
but now , the troika might push along the unwieldy union with 25 member states and guarantee desperately needed leadership .
that 's the optimistic view .
pessimists see things differently .
first , france and germany suspended the euro zone 's stability pact , together with britain they will now try to affix their seal on the union 's foreign and economic policy , they say . indeed , blair , chirac and schröder plan to write a critical letter to the european commission on wednesday , demanding significant changes to the bloc 's investment program , which is scheduled for adoption at a summit at the end of march . bernd riegert -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair and schröder deny plans for " triumvirate " with chirac german chancellor gerhard schröder and british prime minister tony blair met in berlin on thursday ahead of a three-way summit with france next week .

german finance minister hans eichel created an uproar after proposing a law that would send the labor police after domestic staff working illegally .
he 's since backed off . if eichel had his way , people who employed a cleaning lady or babysitter in germany could possibly be made into outlaws . as part of a tough government initiative to tackle germany 's booming illegal jobs market , eichel wanted to target all illegal workers and their employers .
under his bill proposal , domestic help , from cleaners to part-time tutors would be subject to the same constraints and rules as construction workers , office staff and employees in the commercial sector .
that meant that they could face prosecution under german labor laws if they were not registered workers , much in the same way that other workers such as builders , carpenters and technicians were .
private sector is decriminalized after an uproar among opposition politicians and members of the government 's junion coalition partner , the greens , chancellor gehard schröder 's cabinet reduced the severity of the law .
barbara hendricks , a deputy finance minister , declared after the cabinet decision : " the private area has become decriminalized . "
people working in the part-time domestic services sector are now not required to register for so-called " mini-jobs . " the government re-introduced the " minijobs " - which allow workers to earn up to € 400 without having to pay taxes or social benefits - in an effort to streamline registration and encourage workers to come out of the illegal sector .
labor police to look elsewhere an initiative put forward by the finance ministry had mobilized a force of 2,000 customs officers to track down and investigate cleaning ladies and other domestic staff who were working in the so-called shadow economy . a new ministry task force composed of 7,000 officers has been set up to investigate illegal workers and their employers .
their search will now be limited to the restaurant , construction , gaming and tourism industry . the police trade union and metalworkers union ig metall has criticized the new rules , claiming that illegal is illegal and the private sector should be monitored and regulated just as any other .
the government 's reversal came after the increasing clamor over the " cleaning lady debate " from many members of the public who felt it was unfair to treat domestic help in the same way as other areas of employment and include it in labor law categories along with drug dealers and prostitutes who evade taxation and social security levies . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de labor market reforms spelled out germany 's parliament votes on october 17 on labor market reforms that critics say will lead to painful cuts for people in and out of work .

under his bill proposal , domestic help , from cleaners to part-time tutors would be subject to the same constraints and rules as construction workers , office staff and employees in the commercial sector .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 19.02.2004 eu want to get the facts -lrb- not carrots -rrb- straight großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a leading british newspaper wrongly reported that the eu wanted regulate carrot size .
eurocrats in brussels are fed up with the many myths peddled by the media about the european union .
a european commission website sets out to put the record straight . last year , british tabloid the daily mail informed its readers that the eu was planning to ban corgis .
" certain breeds of the queen 's favorite dog could be outlawed under a controversial eu convention being considered by ministers , " it revealed . the shock revelation which outraged animal lovers across the country and fuelled anti-european sentiment in fact had nothing to do with the eu .
the story originated with a committee of animal protection experts which drew up a european convention for the protection of pet animals designed to improve the welfare of household pets . whatever .
readers were all too willing to believe the eu was up to its usual nonsense . this sort of scare-mongering plays right into the hands of euroskeptics - as brussels is all too aware .
the european commission now features on its website a compilation of popular misconceptions ranging from the sublime to the ridiculous , giving the inside story , laying out the facts and debunking the myths . media-fuelled hostility a lot of europhiles feel the press coverage contributes to widespread bewilderment and hostility towards europe , feeding a popular attitude that the eu is a dangerous behemoth deliberately blinding its citizens with layers of impenetrable bureaucracy and ludicrous laws . admittedly , brussels is an easy target .
a tangle of competing institutions and different agendas , eu bodies are notorious for excessive red tape , corruption scandals and mystifying rules and regulations .
it all contributes to a culture of confusion that leaves the public willing to believe just about anything . according to michael mann from the european commission press office , the british media is a main offender , with the tabloids all trying to outdo one another with sensational stories . mann is now busy collecting myths and countering them with facts .
in his opinion , the problem is that the level of debate about europe is n't as high as it should be . a reflection of national reservations the misunderstandings and prejudices come in all shapes and sizes .
maintaining that eu officials are grossly overpaid is one thing - but the idea that male members of staff are reimbursed for the medical costs of viagra pills is slightly less well-founded . horror stories from brussels are part of the media 's daily diet , but reveal an astonishing gullibility on the part of many europeans .
on the euro-myth silly scale , old favorites such as greengrocers having to conform to rules covering size , length , color and texture of fruit and vegetables are less believable than proposals for a new european flag , but the sheer quantity of misapprehensions goes to show how little the public understands the workings of the european union .
viola eggert from the european commission 's berlin office attributes the problem to the commission 's zeal for regulations , saying many myths about the eu popular in germany " are based on over-regulation and the idea that the eu tells its citizens what they 're allowed to do , and has too big an influence on their lives . "
so although gullibility may be to blame for many of the myths , the volume of misinformation appears to reflect strong national reservations about the sort of things the european commission would like to do if left to its own devices .
anti-eu groups are all too willing to twist the facts about brussels ' law-making , but the eu would do well to conclude it should , in future , explain itself better .
after all , brussels does have one of the most extensive press corps in the world .
but as michael mann points out , brussels can only do so much - and the rest is up to national governments .
" they have to start serious discussions with the public about what europe is and why it 's a good thing , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links get the facts straight european commission press office webpage media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

substitute carsten ramelow snatched victory from the jaws of a mediocre stalemate in croatia on wednesday night as germany won 2-1 in the team 's latest preparation match for the european championships this summer . it was business as usual for the german national soccer team on wednesday night .
despite an unconvincing performance against opposition which would normally have been brushed aside by a team of germany 's standing , rudi völler 's men labored to victory once more with a last minute 2-1 win over croatia in split . with their reputation as a football power waning after weak displays against lithuania , iceland and scotland in qualifying for the european championships in portugal , germany was looking to dispatch the opposition in style with the soccer showpiece looming ahead in june . the croatians , however , have proved to germany in the past that they are no pushovers , and it was they who started the better in this friendly warm-up game for euro 2004 . donning his countrymen 's jersey , bayern munich defender robert kovac almost put the home side ahead on 15 minutes when he directed a corner kick goalwards with a strong headed attempt but was thwarted by germany 's 20-year-old debutant philipp lahm who cleared the effort off the line much to the dismay of the croatian crowd .
stuttgart 's kuranyi proves elusive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kevin kuranyi .
the three-time world cup winners had to wait another quarter of an hour before they first really threatened stipe pletikosa in the croatian goal .
vfb stuttgart 's kevin kuranyi -lrb- photo -rrb- slipped through the dawdling defenders to meet a looping cross but sent his header wide of the far post .
in fact , it was croatia 's wobbly defence - important for euro 2004 group opponents england , france and switzerland - which led to their downfall .
after pegging the germans back for most of the first half , another kuranyi surge exposed croatia 's poor marking and with the croatian rearguard standing motionless , miroslav klose somehow forced his cross home with his knee on 34 minutes .
makeshift midfield charged with stabilization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's coach rudi völler .
germany missed world cup hero michael ballack , who was ruled out late with bronchitis , and the absense of the bayern munich playmaker was sorely felt as the second half opened with the germans in uninspiring form .
coach völler had made several forced changes in his team selection before the game , reshuffling his midfield around the returning liverpool midfielder dietmar hamann and the unsettled dortmunder torsten frings .
again it was croatia and kovac who provided the first real chance of the second period .
with the uncertain looking oliver kahn once more hesitant in goal , kovac whipped in a free kick which skipped off the turf , causing germany 's number one to spill the shot .
luckily for the german captain there were no waiting croatian attackers to tap the loose ball into the empty net .
kuranyi , proving to be germany 's most lively player , then missed his second glorious chance of the game when he poked an effort through pletikosa ' legs only to see the ball roll agonisingly wide of the far post .
chances go begging for croatia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn was floored again .
as the game ebbed and flowed , croatia once again found their rhythm and with 70 minutes on the clock , substitute nino bule should have equalized when it was germany 's defenders ' turn to be caught asleep .
with only kahn to beat , bule considered his options for too long before tamely passing the ball into the waiting goalkeeper 's arms .
the croatians should have been level minutes later when they somehow managed to miss guilt-edged chances from two huge goalmouth scrambles in the closing stages of the match .
but with four minutes remaining , mato neretljak succeeded where oliver kahn had failed by getting on the end of a looping corner and heading past the flapping keeper .
last minute hero bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carsten ramelow .
with another lackluster draw in the making , substitute carsten ramelow entered the picture .

the leaders of france , germany and great britain urged europe to adapt to the changing world economy and make the continent more investor-friendly . president jacques chirac , british prime minister tony blair and chancellor gerhard schröder spoke after a two-a-half hour meeting in berlin wednesday .
as a sign of both the cordiality and the importance of topics on the table , the discussions will continue throughout the evening over dinner . the focal point of the afternoon discussions were the need for the three nations and europe as a whole to adapt their national economies and social security systems in the face of globalization and aging populations . " our own people and europe as a whole know there is an economic world that is changing very rapidly , and what this means is , is that the response of government on the national and european level has to be quick and equally adaptable to changing circumstances , " said british prime minister tony blair . make europe investor-friendly , dynamic the three signed a letter which will be sent to current european union president bertie ahern of ireland .
in the letter , the three countries urged the european commission , which initiates policy in the eu , to play a stronger rule in urging economic and health reforms and making europe more investor-friendly . the three called for a new super commissioner responsible for economics to be added to the body as part of changes being discussed by the new european constitution .
the three said the eu should keep its goal of being the most competitive and dynamic economy on earth by 2010 . chancellor gerhard schröder said the three had similar goals on investing in research , universities and innovation .
the chancellor , whose country is one of many european countries experiencing a brain drain of good scientists to the u.s. , talked about investing in the " fields of the future . " similar problems , similar solutions " we saw that there was a large amount of similarity in the types of problems we had , " said schröder . schröder and his social democratic green party coalition are experiencing plumetting popularity rates as a result of economic reforms that seek to dismantle the country 's generous welfare system and rejig the labor market . chirac and blair are undergoing similar fights in their own countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- l . -rrb- and french president jacques chirac both france and germany have been violators of the european union 's economic growth and stability pact , which sets public debt limits in eu member states .
by refusing to trim public spending to keep their social systems afloat during sluggish economic growth , both governments ran afoul of eu monetary officials , who sought legal action . " we need to change the system , without destroying it , " said schröder .
" only if we change it , can we keep it and can we afford it . " " big three " meeting no cause for concern the three leaders brushed back criticism that they were aiming to create an eu triumvirate that would block smaller member states .
blair pointed to the joint defense plan agreed on by the three countries last week and the efforts by german , french and british diplomats to curb iran 's nuclear ambitions as achievements that were good for all of europe . " if these three countries , which comprise almost half of the population in europe … work on clear agreements , then that is a good thing for our three countries but also for europe and there should n't be any concerns about exclusivity , " blair said . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's budding ménage à trois the leaders of britain , france and germany meet in berlin on wednesday to push for further european economic cooperation .

many of the turkish men were assigned as so-called " fly catchers " : they were supposed to inform the stasi about east german women who were trying to marry foreigners in order to leave east germany .
more than 6,000 west berlin turks made day trips to the other side of the berlin wall during the 1980s , and they were popular targets for east german women looking for a better life . despite its eagerness to work with foreigners , the stasi often held a prejudicial view of them .
in the 1970s , then east german state security minister erich mielke expressed his fear that foreigners coming in from west berlin included " many anti-social and criminal " types who could pose a threat to security during their visits there . officials feared airplane hijackings , attacks against embassies and even drug smuggling .
the tensions at the time between turkish and other foreign groups in west berlin fuelled those emotions .
because turks were - and still are - the largest minority group in germany , they made up the majority of the stasi 's foreign collaborators .

more than 6,000 west berlin turks made day trips to the other side of the berlin wall during the 1980s , and they were popular targets for east german women looking for a better life . despite its eagerness to work with foreigners , the stasi often held a prejudicial view of them .
in the 1970s , then east german state security minister erich mielke expressed his fear that foreigners coming in from west berlin included " many anti-social and criminal " types who could pose a threat to security during their visits there . officials feared airplane hijackings , attacks against embassies and even drug smuggling .
the tensions at the time between turkish and other foreign groups in west berlin fuelled those emotions .

eurocrats in brussels are fed up with the many myths peddled by the media about the european union .
a european commission website sets out to put the record straight . last year , british tabloid the daily mail informed its readers that the eu was planning to ban corgis .
" certain breeds of the queen 's favorite dog could be outlawed under a controversial eu convention being considered by ministers , " it revealed . the shock revelation which outraged animal lovers across the country and fuelled anti-european sentiment in fact had nothing to do with the eu .
the story originated with a committee of animal protection experts which drew up a european convention for the protection of pet animals designed to improve the welfare of household pets . whatever .
readers were all too willing to believe the eu was up to its usual nonsense . this sort of scare-mongering plays right into the hands of euroskeptics - as brussels is all too aware .
the european commission now features on its website a compilation of popular misconceptions ranging from the sublime to the ridiculous , giving the inside story , laying out the facts and debunking the myths . media-fuelled hostility a lot of europhiles feel the press coverage contributes to widespread bewilderment and hostility towards europe , feeding a popular attitude that the eu is a dangerous behemoth deliberately blinding its citizens with layers of impenetrable bureaucracy and ludicrous laws . admittedly , brussels is an easy target .
a tangle of competing institutions and different agendas , eu bodies are notorious for excessive red tape , corruption scandals and mystifying rules and regulations .
it all contributes to a culture of confusion that leaves the public willing to believe just about anything . according to michael mann from the european commission press office , the british media is a main offender , with the tabloids all trying to outdo one another with sensational stories . mann is now busy collecting myths and countering them with facts .
in his opinion , the problem is that the level of debate about europe is n't as high as it should be . a reflection of national reservations the misunderstandings and prejudices come in all shapes and sizes .
maintaining that eu officials are grossly overpaid is one thing - but the idea that male members of staff are reimbursed for the medical costs of viagra pills is slightly less well-founded . horror stories from brussels are part of the media 's daily diet , but reveal an astonishing gullibility on the part of many europeans .
on the euro-myth silly scale , old favorites such as greengrocers having to conform to rules covering size , length , color and texture of fruit and vegetables are less believable than proposals for a new european flag , but the sheer quantity of misapprehensions goes to show how little the public understands the workings of the european union .
viola eggert from the european commission 's berlin office attributes the problem to the commission 's zeal for regulations , saying many myths about the eu popular in germany " are based on over-regulation and the idea that the eu tells its citizens what they 're allowed to do , and has too big an influence on their lives . "
so although gullibility may be to blame for many of the myths , the volume of misinformation appears to reflect strong national reservations about the sort of things the european commission would like to do if left to its own devices .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the road to portugal germany beats faroe islands by a hair reticent germans face possible curse of the faroes " mcberti " takes on his former team german soccer team avoids embarrassing draw culture & lifestyle -pipe- 19.02.2004 last minute goal saves germany embarrassment großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german player miroslav klose , left , steals the ball from croatia 's boris zivkovic .
substitute carsten ramelow snatched victory from the jaws of a mediocre stalemate in croatia on wednesday night as germany won 2-1 in the team 's latest preparation match for the european championships this summer . it was business as usual for the german national soccer team on wednesday night .
despite an unconvincing performance against opposition which would normally have been brushed aside by a team of germany 's standing , rudi völler 's men labored to victory once more with a last minute 2-1 win over croatia in split . with their reputation as a football power waning after weak displays against lithuania , iceland and scotland in qualifying for the european championships in portugal , germany was looking to dispatch the opposition in style with the soccer showpiece looming ahead in june . the croatians , however , have proved to germany in the past that they are no pushovers , and it was they who started the better in this friendly warm-up game for euro 2004 . donning his countrymen 's jersey , bayern munich defender robert kovac almost put the home side ahead on 15 minutes when he directed a corner kick goalwards with a strong headed attempt but was thwarted by germany 's 20-year-old debutant philipp lahm who cleared the effort off the line much to the dismay of the croatian crowd .
stuttgart 's kuranyi proves elusive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kevin kuranyi .
the three-time world cup winners had to wait another quarter of an hour before they first really threatened stipe pletikosa in the croatian goal .
vfb stuttgart 's kevin kuranyi -lrb- photo -rrb- slipped through the dawdling defenders to meet a looping cross but sent his header wide of the far post .
in fact , it was croatia 's wobbly defence - important for euro 2004 group opponents england , france and switzerland - which led to their downfall .
after pegging the germans back for most of the first half , another kuranyi surge exposed croatia 's poor marking and with the croatian rearguard standing motionless , miroslav klose somehow forced his cross home with his knee on 34 minutes .
makeshift midfield charged with stabilization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's coach rudi völler .
germany missed world cup hero michael ballack , who was ruled out late with bronchitis , and the absense of the bayern munich playmaker was sorely felt as the second half opened with the germans in uninspiring form .
coach völler had made several forced changes in his team selection before the game , reshuffling his midfield around the returning liverpool midfielder dietmar hamann and the unsettled dortmunder torsten frings .
again it was croatia and kovac who provided the first real chance of the second period .
with the uncertain looking oliver kahn once more hesitant in goal , kovac whipped in a free kick which skipped off the turf , causing germany 's number one to spill the shot .
luckily for the german captain there were no waiting croatian attackers to tap the loose ball into the empty net .
kuranyi , proving to be germany 's most lively player , then missed his second glorious chance of the game when he poked an effort through pletikosa ' legs only to see the ball roll agonisingly wide of the far post .
chances go begging for croatia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn was floored again .
as the game ebbed and flowed , croatia once again found their rhythm and with 70 minutes on the clock , substitute nino bule should have equalized when it was germany 's defenders ' turn to be caught asleep .
with only kahn to beat , bule considered his options for too long before tamely passing the ball into the waiting goalkeeper 's arms .
the croatians should have been level minutes later when they somehow managed to miss guilt-edged chances from two huge goalmouth scrambles in the closing stages of the match .
but with four minutes remaining , mato neretljak succeeded where oliver kahn had failed by getting on the end of a looping corner and heading past the flapping keeper .
last minute hero bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carsten ramelow .
with another lackluster draw in the making , substitute carsten ramelow entered the picture .
the bayer leverkusen player saved the blushes of his team mates , and his captain especially , by volleying home the winner in the 90th minute to secure a flattering victory . germany 's next warm-up for the european championships comes on march 31 when it takes on belgium in cologne . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to face old foes in euro 2004 old scores and local rivalries are set to be settled in the opening stages of the european championships in portugal next summer as the soccer teams of germany and holland have been placed together in group d.

substitute carsten ramelow snatched victory from the jaws of a mediocre stalemate in croatia on wednesday night as germany won 2-1 in the team 's latest preparation match for the european championships this summer . it was business as usual for the german national soccer team on wednesday night .
despite an unconvincing performance against opposition which would normally have been brushed aside by a team of germany 's standing , rudi völler 's men labored to victory once more with a last minute 2-1 win over croatia in split . with their reputation as a football power waning after weak displays against lithuania , iceland and scotland in qualifying for the european championships in portugal , germany was looking to dispatch the opposition in style with the soccer showpiece looming ahead in june . the croatians , however , have proved to germany in the past that they are no pushovers , and it was they who started the better in this friendly warm-up game for euro 2004 . donning his countrymen 's jersey , bayern munich defender robert kovac almost put the home side ahead on 15 minutes when he directed a corner kick goalwards with a strong headed attempt but was thwarted by germany 's 20-year-old debutant philipp lahm who cleared the effort off the line much to the dismay of the croatian crowd .
stuttgart 's kuranyi proves elusive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kevin kuranyi .
the three-time world cup winners had to wait another quarter of an hour before they first really threatened stipe pletikosa in the croatian goal .
vfb stuttgart 's kevin kuranyi -lrb- photo -rrb- slipped through the dawdling defenders to meet a looping cross but sent his header wide of the far post .
in fact , it was croatia 's wobbly defence - important for euro 2004 group opponents england , france and switzerland - which led to their downfall .
after pegging the germans back for most of the first half , another kuranyi surge exposed croatia 's poor marking and with the croatian rearguard standing motionless , miroslav klose somehow forced his cross home with his knee on 34 minutes .
makeshift midfield charged with stabilization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's coach rudi völler .
germany missed world cup hero michael ballack , who was ruled out late with bronchitis , and the absense of the bayern munich playmaker was sorely felt as the second half opened with the germans in uninspiring form .
coach völler had made several forced changes in his team selection before the game , reshuffling his midfield around the returning liverpool midfielder dietmar hamann and the unsettled dortmunder torsten frings .
again it was croatia and kovac who provided the first real chance of the second period .
with the uncertain looking oliver kahn once more hesitant in goal , kovac whipped in a free kick which skipped off the turf , causing germany 's number one to spill the shot .
luckily for the german captain there were no waiting croatian attackers to tap the loose ball into the empty net .
kuranyi , proving to be germany 's most lively player , then missed his second glorious chance of the game when he poked an effort through pletikosa ' legs only to see the ball roll agonisingly wide of the far post .
chances go begging for croatia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn was floored again .
as the game ebbed and flowed , croatia once again found their rhythm and with 70 minutes on the clock , substitute nino bule should have equalized when it was germany 's defenders ' turn to be caught asleep .
with only kahn to beat , bule considered his options for too long before tamely passing the ball into the waiting goalkeeper 's arms .
the croatians should have been level minutes later when they somehow managed to miss guilt-edged chances from two huge goalmouth scrambles in the closing stages of the match .
but with four minutes remaining , mato neretljak succeeded where oliver kahn had failed by getting on the end of a looping corner and heading past the flapping keeper .
last minute hero bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carsten ramelow .
with another lackluster draw in the making , substitute carsten ramelow entered the picture .

german finance minister hans eichel created an uproar after proposing a law that would send the labor police after domestic staff working illegally .
he 's since backed off . if eichel had his way , people who employed a cleaning lady or babysitter in germany could possibly be made into outlaws . as part of a tough government initiative to tackle germany 's booming illegal jobs market , eichel wanted to target all illegal workers and their employers .
under his bill proposal , domestic help , from cleaners to part-time tutors would be subject to the same constraints and rules as construction workers , office staff and employees in the commercial sector .
that meant that they could face prosecution under german labor laws if they were not registered workers , much in the same way that other workers such as builders , carpenters and technicians were .
private sector is decriminalized after an uproar among opposition politicians and members of the government 's junion coalition partner , the greens , chancellor gehard schröder 's cabinet reduced the severity of the law .
barbara hendricks , a deputy finance minister , declared after the cabinet decision : " the private area has become decriminalized . "
people working in the part-time domestic services sector are now not required to register for so-called " mini-jobs . " the government re-introduced the " minijobs " - which allow workers to earn up to € 400 without having to pay taxes or social benefits - in an effort to streamline registration and encourage workers to come out of the illegal sector .
labor police to look elsewhere an initiative put forward by the finance ministry had mobilized a force of 2,000 customs officers to track down and investigate cleaning ladies and other domestic staff who were working in the so-called shadow economy . a new ministry task force composed of 7,000 officers has been set up to investigate illegal workers and their employers .
their search will now be limited to the restaurant , construction , gaming and tourism industry . the police trade union and metalworkers union ig metall has criticized the new rules , claiming that illegal is illegal and the private sector should be monitored and regulated just as any other .
the government 's reversal came after the increasing clamor over the " cleaning lady debate " from many members of the public who felt it was unfair to treat domestic help in the same way as other areas of employment and include it in labor law categories along with drug dealers and prostitutes who evade taxation and social security levies . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de labor market reforms spelled out germany 's parliament votes on october 17 on labor market reforms that critics say will lead to painful cuts for people in and out of work .

he also said he would urge eu interior affairs and justice ministers to explore law enforcement measures and " pre-emptive acition in the field of education . "
" we want concrete results , " prodi told the gathering of jewish groups thursday .
the italian commission president comments came after months in which the eu came under heavy criticism for standing by amid a rising wave of anti-semitism in europe and the body 's perceived anti-israeli sentiment .
a " european disease " jewish leaders said the eu should monitor anti-jewish incidents more strictly , penalize the perpetrators of the violence more harshly and educate young europeans about the legacy of centuries of persecution on their continent .
though anti-semitism exists in many places in the world , it is also a distinctly " european disease , " nobel-prize winner and holocaust survivor eli wiesel told the gathering .

jewish european leaders criticized eu leaders of looking on indifferently as the number of attacks against against jews and desecration of jewish sites rose in recent years . youths from the large communities of arab immigrants in france , belgium and other countries are largely blamed for the attacks .
" the challenge of anti-semitism exists as long as schools , synagogues and kindergartens are threatened , " german foreign minister joschka fischer said .
anti-semitic not to be confused with anti-israeli fischer , however , joined other european officials in drawing a distinct line between criticism of jews and criticism of israel .
while praising israeli prime minister ariel sharon 's recent decision to pull out of the gaza strip , fischer said it should also be possible to criticize the israeli government without being labeled anti-semitic .
prodi also criticized statements made by people like the united states envoy to the eu that draw lines between the levels of anti-semitism today and in the 1930s .
" europe today is not the europe of the 1930s and 1940s and to say that would be quite wrong - we must not insult the memory of the shoah -lrb- hebrew for holocaust -rrb- by equating what is happening today ... with what happened then , " he said , according to reuters .
reports criticized the eu nevertheless has a lot of work to do , according to jewish leaders .
the new york-based world jewish congress called an eu poll last year in which israel topped a list of nations seen as threatening world peace as " dangerously inflammatory . "
the european jewish congress also criticized the eu 's european monitoring center on racism and xenophobia foir witholding a report last year that blamed the rise in anti-semitic attacks on right-wing extremists or young muslims " mostly of arab descent . "
the jewish group said the eu had suppressed the report because it linked arab immigrants to anti-semitic violence in europe .
the monitoring center , however , said it had withheld the report because it was of " poor quality and lacking in empirical evidence .

he also said he would urge eu interior affairs and justice ministers to explore law enforcement measures and " pre-emptive acition in the field of education . "
" we want concrete results , " prodi told the gathering of jewish groups thursday .
the italian commission president comments came after months in which the eu came under heavy criticism for standing by amid a rising wave of anti-semitism in europe and the body 's perceived anti-israeli sentiment .
a " european disease " jewish leaders said the eu should monitor anti-jewish incidents more strictly , penalize the perpetrators of the violence more harshly and educate young europeans about the legacy of centuries of persecution on their continent .
though anti-semitism exists in many places in the world , it is also a distinctly " european disease , " nobel-prize winner and holocaust survivor eli wiesel told the gathering .

jewish european leaders criticized eu leaders of looking on indifferently as the number of attacks against against jews and desecration of jewish sites rose in recent years . youths from the large communities of arab immigrants in france , belgium and other countries are largely blamed for the attacks .
" the challenge of anti-semitism exists as long as schools , synagogues and kindergartens are threatened , " german foreign minister joschka fischer said .
anti-semitic not to be confused with anti-israeli fischer , however , joined other european officials in drawing a distinct line between criticism of jews and criticism of israel .
while praising israeli prime minister ariel sharon 's recent decision to pull out of the gaza strip , fischer said it should also be possible to criticize the israeli government without being labeled anti-semitic .
prodi also criticized statements made by people like the united states envoy to the eu that draw lines between the levels of anti-semitism today and in the 1930s .
" europe today is not the europe of the 1930s and 1940s and to say that would be quite wrong - we must not insult the memory of the shoah -lrb- hebrew for holocaust -rrb- by equating what is happening today ... with what happened then , " he said , according to reuters .
reports criticized the eu nevertheless has a lot of work to do , according to jewish leaders .
the new york-based world jewish congress called an eu poll last year in which israel topped a list of nations seen as threatening world peace as " dangerously inflammatory . "
the european jewish congress also criticized the eu 's european monitoring center on racism and xenophobia foir witholding a report last year that blamed the rise in anti-semitic attacks on right-wing extremists or young muslims " mostly of arab descent . "
the jewish group said the eu had suppressed the report because it linked arab immigrants to anti-semitic violence in europe .
the monitoring center , however , said it had withheld the report because it was of " poor quality and lacking in empirical evidence .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.02.2004 eu vows to combat anti-semitism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe has work to do , as long as " synagogues and kindergartens are threatened , " said the german foreign minister the european commission 's president called for member states to take a hard line against anti-semitism , after a day-long seminar with jewish and other european leaders in brussels . romano prodi said he would encourage eu governments to take a tougher stance against all manifestations of racism and intolerance by endorsing a draft u.n. resolution against anti-semitism .
he also said he would urge eu interior affairs and justice ministers to explore law enforcement measures and " pre-emptive acition in the field of education . "
" we want concrete results , " prodi told the gathering of jewish groups thursday .
the italian commission president comments came after months in which the eu came under heavy criticism for standing by amid a rising wave of anti-semitism in europe and the body 's perceived anti-israeli sentiment .
a " european disease " jewish leaders said the eu should monitor anti-jewish incidents more strictly , penalize the perpetrators of the violence more harshly and educate young europeans about the legacy of centuries of persecution on their continent .
though anti-semitism exists in many places in the world , it is also a distinctly " european disease , " nobel-prize winner and holocaust survivor eli wiesel told the gathering .
" the monster is here with us one more time , " said cobi benatoff , president of the european jewish congress . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the jewish community look at fire damages to a synagogue in marseille , france on april 1 , 2002 .
jewish european leaders criticized eu leaders of looking on indifferently as the number of attacks against against jews and desecration of jewish sites rose in recent years . youths from the large communities of arab immigrants in france , belgium and other countries are largely blamed for the attacks .
" the challenge of anti-semitism exists as long as schools , synagogues and kindergartens are threatened , " german foreign minister joschka fischer said .
anti-semitic not to be confused with anti-israeli fischer , however , joined other european officials in drawing a distinct line between criticism of jews and criticism of israel .
while praising israeli prime minister ariel sharon 's recent decision to pull out of the gaza strip , fischer said it should also be possible to criticize the israeli government without being labeled anti-semitic .
prodi also criticized statements made by people like the united states envoy to the eu that draw lines between the levels of anti-semitism today and in the 1930s .
" europe today is not the europe of the 1930s and 1940s and to say that would be quite wrong - we must not insult the memory of the shoah -lrb- hebrew for holocaust -rrb- by equating what is happening today ... with what happened then , " he said , according to reuters .
reports criticized the eu nevertheless has a lot of work to do , according to jewish leaders .
the new york-based world jewish congress called an eu poll last year in which israel topped a list of nations seen as threatening world peace as " dangerously inflammatory . "
the european jewish congress also criticized the eu 's european monitoring center on racism and xenophobia foir witholding a report last year that blamed the rise in anti-semitic attacks on right-wing extremists or young muslims " mostly of arab descent . "
the jewish group said the eu had suppressed the report because it linked arab immigrants to anti-semitic violence in europe .
the monitoring center , however , said it had withheld the report because it was of " poor quality and lacking in empirical evidence .

a court in salzburg , austria , has acquitted all 16 people who were charged in the ski-train blaze that killed 155 people in the alpine resort of kaprun in november 2000 . an austrian judge on thursday cleared all charges of criminal negligence in a cable car fire in kaprun that killed 155 people in the country 's most deadly peacetime disaster .
judge manfred seiss ruled there was insufficient evidence to convict the 16 suspects - including train operators , suppliers and inspectors - held responsible for conditions that allowed a faulty heater to short circuit and engulf the train in a deadly inferno on nov .
11 , 2000 .
the verdict was received with shouts of protests from victims ' relatives , many of whom had traveled to salzburg for the verdict .
" this is unbelievable - it simply ca n't be true , " a relative of one of the victims told reporters .
most victims were skiers and snowboarders from austria and germany .
eight were americans , others were from japan , slovenia , the netherlands and the czech republic .
the youngest victim was a 6-year-old boy .
only 12 people managed to escape the train as it turned into a fireball inside a tunnel on the side of the kitzsteinhorn glacier 60 miles south of salzburg .
many of the victims could only be identified weeks later after analysis of their dna .
during the hearings , prosecutors alleged that officials from the company that ran the ski-train , the manufacturers and installers of the heater , and government officials who carried out safety inspections were responsible for neglecting to ensure the train 's heater was in good working condition .
all 16 defendants had pleaded innocent .
if convicted , they would have faced up to five years in prison .
survivors testified the court heard testimonies from 95 witnesses , including survivors , and compiled some 500 pages in expert analysis .
according to experts who reviewed the wreck , the blaze was probably caused by a faulty part in the heater , and this in turn ignited oil dripping from a system for hydraulic brakes .
when the fire spread to the plastic-coated floors of the train , it was already too late .
passengers sitting at the back of the train , where the heater was located , managed to break the windows and escape by running downhill out of the tunnel .
those who fled uphill , however , were quickly overcome by toxic fumes .
the trial which lasted more than 18 months , was marked by a series of delays , and one of the main technical experts had to be replaced due to illness .
separate civil trials are also under way in new york and in germany , where lawyers for american and german victims are seeking billions of euros in compensation .

a court in salzburg , austria , has acquitted all 16 people who were charged in the ski-train blaze that killed 155 people in the alpine resort of kaprun in november 2000 . an austrian judge on thursday cleared all charges of criminal negligence in a cable car fire in kaprun that killed 155 people in the country 's most deadly peacetime disaster .
judge manfred seiss ruled there was insufficient evidence to convict the 16 suspects - including train operators , suppliers and inspectors - held responsible for conditions that allowed a faulty heater to short circuit and engulf the train in a deadly inferno on nov .
11 , 2000 .
the verdict was received with shouts of protests from victims ' relatives , many of whom had traveled to salzburg for the verdict .
" this is unbelievable - it simply ca n't be true , " a relative of one of the victims told reporters .
most victims were skiers and snowboarders from austria and germany .
eight were americans , others were from japan , slovenia , the netherlands and the czech republic .
the youngest victim was a 6-year-old boy .
only 12 people managed to escape the train as it turned into a fireball inside a tunnel on the side of the kitzsteinhorn glacier 60 miles south of salzburg .
many of the victims could only be identified weeks later after analysis of their dna .
during the hearings , prosecutors alleged that officials from the company that ran the ski-train , the manufacturers and installers of the heater , and government officials who carried out safety inspections were responsible for neglecting to ensure the train 's heater was in good working condition .
all 16 defendants had pleaded innocent .
if convicted , they would have faced up to five years in prison .
survivors testified the court heard testimonies from 95 witnesses , including survivors , and compiled some 500 pages in expert analysis .

german finance minister hans eichel created an uproar after proposing a law that would send the labor police after domestic staff working illegally .
he 's since backed off . if eichel had his way , people who employed a cleaning lady or babysitter in germany could possibly be made into outlaws . as part of a tough government initiative to tackle germany 's booming illegal jobs market , eichel wanted to target all illegal workers and their employers .
under his bill proposal , domestic help , from cleaners to part-time tutors would be subject to the same constraints and rules as construction workers , office staff and employees in the commercial sector .
that meant that they could face prosecution under german labor laws if they were not registered workers , much in the same way that other workers such as builders , carpenters and technicians were .
private sector is decriminalized after an uproar among opposition politicians and members of the government 's junion coalition partner , the greens , chancellor gehard schröder 's cabinet reduced the severity of the law .
barbara hendricks , a deputy finance minister , declared after the cabinet decision : " the private area has become decriminalized . "
people working in the part-time domestic services sector are now not required to register for so-called " mini-jobs . " the government re-introduced the " minijobs " - which allow workers to earn up to € 400 without having to pay taxes or social benefits - in an effort to streamline registration and encourage workers to come out of the illegal sector .
labor police to look elsewhere an initiative put forward by the finance ministry had mobilized a force of 2,000 customs officers to track down and investigate cleaning ladies and other domestic staff who were working in the so-called shadow economy . a new ministry task force composed of 7,000 officers has been set up to investigate illegal workers and their employers .
their search will now be limited to the restaurant , construction , gaming and tourism industry . the police trade union and metalworkers union ig metall has criticized the new rules , claiming that illegal is illegal and the private sector should be monitored and regulated just as any other .
the government 's reversal came after the increasing clamor over the " cleaning lady debate " from many members of the public who felt it was unfair to treat domestic help in the same way as other areas of employment and include it in labor law categories along with drug dealers and prostitutes who evade taxation and social security levies . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de labor market reforms spelled out germany 's parliament votes on october 17 on labor market reforms that critics say will lead to painful cuts for people in and out of work .

german finance minister hans eichel created an uproar after proposing a law that would send the labor police after domestic staff working illegally .
he 's since backed off . if eichel had his way , people who employed a cleaning lady or babysitter in germany could possibly be made into outlaws . as part of a tough government initiative to tackle germany 's booming illegal jobs market , eichel wanted to target all illegal workers and their employers .
under his bill proposal , domestic help , from cleaners to part-time tutors would be subject to the same constraints and rules as construction workers , office staff and employees in the commercial sector .
that meant that they could face prosecution under german labor laws if they were not registered workers , much in the same way that other workers such as builders , carpenters and technicians were .
private sector is decriminalized after an uproar among opposition politicians and members of the government 's junion coalition partner , the greens , chancellor gehard schröder 's cabinet reduced the severity of the law .
barbara hendricks , a deputy finance minister , declared after the cabinet decision : " the private area has become decriminalized . "
people working in the part-time domestic services sector are now not required to register for so-called " mini-jobs . " the government re-introduced the " minijobs " - which allow workers to earn up to € 400 without having to pay taxes or social benefits - in an effort to streamline registration and encourage workers to come out of the illegal sector .
labor police to look elsewhere an initiative put forward by the finance ministry had mobilized a force of 2,000 customs officers to track down and investigate cleaning ladies and other domestic staff who were working in the so-called shadow economy . a new ministry task force composed of 7,000 officers has been set up to investigate illegal workers and their employers .
their search will now be limited to the restaurant , construction , gaming and tourism industry . the police trade union and metalworkers union ig metall has criticized the new rules , claiming that illegal is illegal and the private sector should be monitored and regulated just as any other .
the government 's reversal came after the increasing clamor over the " cleaning lady debate " from many members of the public who felt it was unfair to treat domestic help in the same way as other areas of employment and include it in labor law categories along with drug dealers and prostitutes who evade taxation and social security levies . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de labor market reforms spelled out germany 's parliament votes on october 17 on labor market reforms that critics say will lead to painful cuts for people in and out of work .

he also said he would urge eu interior affairs and justice ministers to explore law enforcement measures and " pre-emptive acition in the field of education . "
" we want concrete results , " prodi told the gathering of jewish groups thursday .
the italian commission president comments came after months in which the eu came under heavy criticism for standing by amid a rising wave of anti-semitism in europe and the body 's perceived anti-israeli sentiment .
a " european disease " jewish leaders said the eu should monitor anti-jewish incidents more strictly , penalize the perpetrators of the violence more harshly and educate young europeans about the legacy of centuries of persecution on their continent .
though anti-semitism exists in many places in the world , it is also a distinctly " european disease , " nobel-prize winner and holocaust survivor eli wiesel told the gathering .

jewish european leaders criticized eu leaders of looking on indifferently as the number of attacks against against jews and desecration of jewish sites rose in recent years . youths from the large communities of arab immigrants in france , belgium and other countries are largely blamed for the attacks .
" the challenge of anti-semitism exists as long as schools , synagogues and kindergartens are threatened , " german foreign minister joschka fischer said .
anti-semitic not to be confused with anti-israeli fischer , however , joined other european officials in drawing a distinct line between criticism of jews and criticism of israel .
while praising israeli prime minister ariel sharon 's recent decision to pull out of the gaza strip , fischer said it should also be possible to criticize the israeli government without being labeled anti-semitic .
prodi also criticized statements made by people like the united states envoy to the eu that draw lines between the levels of anti-semitism today and in the 1930s .
" europe today is not the europe of the 1930s and 1940s and to say that would be quite wrong - we must not insult the memory of the shoah -lrb- hebrew for holocaust -rrb- by equating what is happening today ... with what happened then , " he said , according to reuters .
reports criticized the eu nevertheless has a lot of work to do , according to jewish leaders .
the new york-based world jewish congress called an eu poll last year in which israel topped a list of nations seen as threatening world peace as " dangerously inflammatory . "
the european jewish congress also criticized the eu 's european monitoring center on racism and xenophobia foir witholding a report last year that blamed the rise in anti-semitic attacks on right-wing extremists or young muslims " mostly of arab descent . "
the jewish group said the eu had suppressed the report because it linked arab immigrants to anti-semitic violence in europe .

though anti-semitism exists in many places in the world , it is also a distinctly " european disease , " nobel-prize winner and holocaust survivor eli wiesel told the gathering .

jewish european leaders criticized eu leaders of looking on indifferently as the number of attacks against against jews and desecration of jewish sites rose in recent years . youths from the large communities of arab immigrants in france , belgium and other countries are largely blamed for the attacks .
" the challenge of anti-semitism exists as long as schools , synagogues and kindergartens are threatened , " german foreign minister joschka fischer said .
anti-semitic not to be confused with anti-israeli fischer , however , joined other european officials in drawing a distinct line between criticism of jews and criticism of israel .
while praising israeli prime minister ariel sharon 's recent decision to pull out of the gaza strip , fischer said it should also be possible to criticize the israeli government without being labeled anti-semitic .
prodi also criticized statements made by people like the united states envoy to the eu that draw lines between the levels of anti-semitism today and in the 1930s .
" europe today is not the europe of the 1930s and 1940s and to say that would be quite wrong - we must not insult the memory of the shoah -lrb- hebrew for holocaust -rrb- by equating what is happening today ... with what happened then , " he said , according to reuters .
reports criticized the eu nevertheless has a lot of work to do , according to jewish leaders .
the new york-based world jewish congress called an eu poll last year in which israel topped a list of nations seen as threatening world peace as " dangerously inflammatory . "
the european jewish congress also criticized the eu 's european monitoring center on racism and xenophobia foir witholding a report last year that blamed the rise in anti-semitic attacks on right-wing extremists or young muslims " mostly of arab descent . "
the jewish group said the eu had suppressed the report because it linked arab immigrants to anti-semitic violence in europe .
the monitoring center , however , said it had withheld the report because it was of " poor quality and lacking in empirical evidence .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.02.2004 europe 's budding ménage à trois großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two 's company , but three is certainly not a crowd , tony .
the leaders of britain , france and germany meet in berlin on wednesday to push for further european economic cooperation .
but others in the eu fear the trio are trying to run europe . a year after the men were at odds over the war in iraq , the leaders of europe 's big three have been working hard at rapprochement these days .
the most visible sign of that new spirit has been an agreement on a common european defense policy reached last december . " that 's an outstanding event that can not be overestimated , " german chancellor schröder told reporters at the time .
this common defense policy and the recent announcement to establish rapid response forces have laid the foundation for an eu " core group . " british premier tony blair might dispute the existence of such a trilateral eu directorate .
but fearing to be side-stepped in an expanded european union , blair has effectively joined germany and france as the bloc 's driving force .
" i strongly believe that britain should play a leading role in the center of europe and not stand aside , " he said . many of the union 's smaller member states are sceptical about the increased trilateral cooperation .
blair does n't think that 's a problem though : the british leader sees himself as the spokesman for new members , who are pro-british and pro-american , in his opinion .
" many states that are now entering the union share the british vision for europe , " he said . moving ahead after constitution talks fail failure to reach a compromise on a proposed eu constitution last december prompted schröder and french president jacques chirac to moot the possibility of turning the eu 's franco-german-led engine into a group of pioneers willing to push ahead with further unification . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro monument is illuminated in front of the european central bank in frankfurt .
" this means that these countries will move ahead , just as has already happened with the euro or the schengen agreement , " chirac said , referring to the abolishment of border controls between most eu countries . although belgium , hungary , the czech republic and greece have expressed interest in joining a leading group , italy , spain and poland oppose making distinctions within the bloc . " europe does n't need a directorate , that would only mess things up , " italian premier silvio berlusconi said on tuesday .
" that 's my opinion , which is shared by other european states except the three in question . " a europe of different speeds schröder , on the other hand , believes that a europe of different speeds will become inevitable should the negotiations over an eu constitution fail for good .
" germany is willing to enter what 's called closer cooperation with france , britain and other eu members , " the chancellor said .
" there 's no question about it . " schröder , who has worked closely with the conservative chirac , is glad to see blair , a fellow social democrat , come aboard .
and according to schröder , the only way to ensure an effective foreign and security policy for the union is to have britain in a leading group . driving or deciding europe 's future unification ? back in 1998 , when joschka fischer took on the job of german foreign minister , he still warned against making britain a part of the franco-german eu engine : britain had n't accepted the eu 's common currency and was opposed to closer cooperation , fischer explained at the time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu family is getting a lot bigger in may .
but now , the troika might push along the unwieldy union with 25 member states and guarantee desperately needed leadership .
that 's the optimistic view .
pessimists see things differently .
first , france and germany suspended the euro zone 's stability pact , together with britain they will now try to affix their seal on the union 's foreign and economic policy , they say . indeed , blair , chirac and schröder plan to write a critical letter to the european commission on wednesday , demanding significant changes to the bloc 's investment program , which is scheduled for adoption at a summit at the end of march . bernd riegert -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair and schröder deny plans for " triumvirate " with chirac german chancellor gerhard schröder and british prime minister tony blair met in berlin on thursday ahead of a three-way summit with france next week .
they denied the formation of a leading " triumvirate " within the eu .

the leaders of britain , france and germany meet in berlin on wednesday to push for further european economic cooperation .
but others in the eu fear the trio are trying to run europe . a year after the men were at odds over the war in iraq , the leaders of europe 's big three have been working hard at rapprochement these days .
the most visible sign of that new spirit has been an agreement on a common european defense policy reached last december . " that 's an outstanding event that can not be overestimated , " german chancellor schröder told reporters at the time .
this common defense policy and the recent announcement to establish rapid response forces have laid the foundation for an eu " core group . " british premier tony blair might dispute the existence of such a trilateral eu directorate .
but fearing to be side-stepped in an expanded european union , blair has effectively joined germany and france as the bloc 's driving force .
" i strongly believe that britain should play a leading role in the center of europe and not stand aside , " he said . many of the union 's smaller member states are sceptical about the increased trilateral cooperation .
blair does n't think that 's a problem though : the british leader sees himself as the spokesman for new members , who are pro-british and pro-american , in his opinion .
" many states that are now entering the union share the british vision for europe , " he said . moving ahead after constitution talks fail failure to reach a compromise on a proposed eu constitution last december prompted schröder and french president jacques chirac to moot the possibility of turning the eu 's franco-german-led engine into a group of pioneers willing to push ahead with further unification . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro monument is illuminated in front of the european central bank in frankfurt .
" this means that these countries will move ahead , just as has already happened with the euro or the schengen agreement , " chirac said , referring to the abolishment of border controls between most eu countries . although belgium , hungary , the czech republic and greece have expressed interest in joining a leading group , italy , spain and poland oppose making distinctions within the bloc . " europe does n't need a directorate , that would only mess things up , " italian premier silvio berlusconi said on tuesday .
" that 's my opinion , which is shared by other european states except the three in question . " a europe of different speeds schröder , on the other hand , believes that a europe of different speeds will become inevitable should the negotiations over an eu constitution fail for good .
" germany is willing to enter what 's called closer cooperation with france , britain and other eu members , " the chancellor said .
" there 's no question about it . " schröder , who has worked closely with the conservative chirac , is glad to see blair , a fellow social democrat , come aboard .
and according to schröder , the only way to ensure an effective foreign and security policy for the union is to have britain in a leading group . driving or deciding europe 's future unification ? back in 1998 , when joschka fischer took on the job of german foreign minister , he still warned against making britain a part of the franco-german eu engine : britain had n't accepted the eu 's common currency and was opposed to closer cooperation , fischer explained at the time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu family is getting a lot bigger in may .
but now , the troika might push along the unwieldy union with 25 member states and guarantee desperately needed leadership .
that 's the optimistic view .
pessimists see things differently .
first , france and germany suspended the euro zone 's stability pact , together with britain they will now try to affix their seal on the union 's foreign and economic policy , they say . indeed , blair , chirac and schröder plan to write a critical letter to the european commission on wednesday , demanding significant changes to the bloc 's investment program , which is scheduled for adoption at a summit at the end of march . bernd riegert -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair and schröder deny plans for " triumvirate " with chirac german chancellor gerhard schröder and british prime minister tony blair met in berlin on thursday ahead of a three-way summit with france next week .

the leaders of britain , france and germany meet in berlin on wednesday to push for further european economic cooperation .
but others in the eu fear the trio are trying to run europe . a year after the men were at odds over the war in iraq , the leaders of europe 's big three have been working hard at rapprochement these days .
the most visible sign of that new spirit has been an agreement on a common european defense policy reached last december . " that 's an outstanding event that can not be overestimated , " german chancellor schröder told reporters at the time .
this common defense policy and the recent announcement to establish rapid response forces have laid the foundation for an eu " core group . " british premier tony blair might dispute the existence of such a trilateral eu directorate .
but fearing to be side-stepped in an expanded european union , blair has effectively joined germany and france as the bloc 's driving force .
" i strongly believe that britain should play a leading role in the center of europe and not stand aside , " he said . many of the union 's smaller member states are sceptical about the increased trilateral cooperation .
blair does n't think that 's a problem though : the british leader sees himself as the spokesman for new members , who are pro-british and pro-american , in his opinion .
" many states that are now entering the union share the british vision for europe , " he said . moving ahead after constitution talks fail failure to reach a compromise on a proposed eu constitution last december prompted schröder and french president jacques chirac to moot the possibility of turning the eu 's franco-german-led engine into a group of pioneers willing to push ahead with further unification . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro monument is illuminated in front of the european central bank in frankfurt .
" this means that these countries will move ahead , just as has already happened with the euro or the schengen agreement , " chirac said , referring to the abolishment of border controls between most eu countries . although belgium , hungary , the czech republic and greece have expressed interest in joining a leading group , italy , spain and poland oppose making distinctions within the bloc .

prosecutors at the international war crimes tribunal will wrap up their case against slobodan milosevic in the next few days .
the former serb leader plans a defense strategy that could extend the trial until 2006 . on most days , slobodan milosevic enters the court room in his customary blue suit .
with the light disinterested gaze of a 61-year-old man with nothing left to lose , he peers back and forth between witnesses testifying on the stand .
for the past two years , the former president of serbia and yugoslavia has stood in the dock of the international war crimes tribunal in the hague .
milosevic , whose case has been modified several times , is charged with 60 war crimes including genocide in bosnia-herzegovina and crimes against humanity in croatia and kosovo .
he is accused in the killings of tens of thousands and the displacement of thousands of people from their homes in the last decade during wars that ravaged the former yugoslavia .
if convicted , he could face a life sentence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.n. war crimes prosecutor carla del ponte .
chief prosecutor carla del ponte -lrb- photo -rrb- and her team are expected to wrap up their case against the ex-dictator in the next week .
the closing arguments will mark the end of the first part of the trial .
milosevic , who has chosen to defend himself , and the two attorneys and legal aide helping him can then prepare a defense strategy and a list of witnesses .
but first , milosevic has the option of requesting an audit of the prosecution 's case .
the three-judge panel then can shoot down arguments and charges for which there is insufficient evidence .
prosecutor 's tough case the process could be damaging for del ponte , who has already been criticized for being too headstrong and not allowing the judges to make their mark on the case .
the shakiest part is believed to be the genocide charge , a weakness even del ponte has conceded .
no one has been able to prove in court that milosevic himself ordered the slaughter of more than 7,000 bosnian muslims in srebrenica in 1995 .
philipp morillon , the former united nations commander in bosnia , who has testified about the massacre , has even partially defended milosevic , saying he had headed off the first possible attack on srebrenica ’ s muslims .
the war crimes charges stemming from croatia and bosnia could also prove problematic .
the prosecution has built the charges on the premise that milosevic was operating a “ criminal organization ” with the goal of building a “ great serbia ” that stretched into parts of croatia and bosnia .
but legal expert sluiter says prosecutors have failed to turn up written evidence .
del ponte has also had trouble finding cooperative witnesses to prove the case against milosevic .
should be enough for long prison term international law expert gören sluiter warns not to place too much blame on del ponte herself .
sluiter said the judges have also made mistakes by failing to set time limits for prosecutors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slobodan milosevic enters the courtroom .
" they have done that to a certain degree ... but giving the prosecutors two years to present the case is extremely long and does not force the prosecutor to be more selective , " sluiter told dw-world .
the prosecution team has managed to present some very effective witnesses , like former nato generals wesley clark and klaus naumann , who have provided would could be deeply incriminating evidence against milosevic .
the generals ' testimony could be especially useful in regard to the crimes against humanity charges in kosovo , sluiter said .
testimony combined with information out of police and army archives in belgrade should be enough to convict the former serb leader and put him behind bars for a long time .
trial could last until 2006 but first milosevic will have the opportunity to defend himself against these charges .
legal observers expect his defense to take as much time and include as many witnesses as del ponte ’ s prosecution .
after a first ruling in the case , an appeals process is anticipated , with no final decision expected before the end of 2006 .
whether milosevic is convicted or not , the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia will continue to play an important role in the truth and reconciliation process of the balkans , according to sluiter .
“ one should also not exaggerate the importance of the milosevic trial .
it comes at a time when the tribunal has already been functioning for a number of years and over those years they have dealt with all of these incidents , " he said .
" so i think as to the effects of the case and the responsibilities , i think the groundwork has already been done and even without the milosevic trial the is of significant importance for the history of the balkans . ” dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ten years on : the fight for justice in the balkans continues the u.n. tribunal for war crimes in the former yugoslavia marks its ten-year anniversary this week , but it 's business as usual in the hague as the trials of those accused of atrocities in the balkan wars continue .

prosecutors at the international war crimes tribunal will wrap up their case against slobodan milosevic in the next few days .
the former serb leader plans a defense strategy that could extend the trial until 2006 . on most days , slobodan milosevic enters the court room in his customary blue suit .
with the light disinterested gaze of a 61-year-old man with nothing left to lose , he peers back and forth between witnesses testifying on the stand .
for the past two years , the former president of serbia and yugoslavia has stood in the dock of the international war crimes tribunal in the hague .
milosevic , whose case has been modified several times , is charged with 60 war crimes including genocide in bosnia-herzegovina and crimes against humanity in croatia and kosovo .
he is accused in the killings of tens of thousands and the displacement of thousands of people from their homes in the last decade during wars that ravaged the former yugoslavia .
if convicted , he could face a life sentence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.n. war crimes prosecutor carla del ponte .
chief prosecutor carla del ponte -lrb- photo -rrb- and her team are expected to wrap up their case against the ex-dictator in the next week .
the closing arguments will mark the end of the first part of the trial .
milosevic , who has chosen to defend himself , and the two attorneys and legal aide helping him can then prepare a defense strategy and a list of witnesses .
but first , milosevic has the option of requesting an audit of the prosecution 's case .
the three-judge panel then can shoot down arguments and charges for which there is insufficient evidence .
prosecutor 's tough case the process could be damaging for del ponte , who has already been criticized for being too headstrong and not allowing the judges to make their mark on the case .
the shakiest part is believed to be the genocide charge , a weakness even del ponte has conceded .
no one has been able to prove in court that milosevic himself ordered the slaughter of more than 7,000 bosnian muslims in srebrenica in 1995 .
philipp morillon , the former united nations commander in bosnia , who has testified about the massacre , has even partially defended milosevic , saying he had headed off the first possible attack on srebrenica ’ s muslims .
the war crimes charges stemming from croatia and bosnia could also prove problematic .
the prosecution has built the charges on the premise that milosevic was operating a “ criminal organization ” with the goal of building a “ great serbia ” that stretched into parts of croatia and bosnia .
but legal expert sluiter says prosecutors have failed to turn up written evidence .
del ponte has also had trouble finding cooperative witnesses to prove the case against milosevic .
should be enough for long prison term international law expert gören sluiter warns not to place too much blame on del ponte herself .
sluiter said the judges have also made mistakes by failing to set time limits for prosecutors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slobodan milosevic enters the courtroom .
" they have done that to a certain degree ... but giving the prosecutors two years to present the case is extremely long and does not force the prosecutor to be more selective , " sluiter told dw-world .
the prosecution team has managed to present some very effective witnesses , like former nato generals wesley clark and klaus naumann , who have provided would could be deeply incriminating evidence against milosevic .
the generals ' testimony could be especially useful in regard to the crimes against humanity charges in kosovo , sluiter said .
testimony combined with information out of police and army archives in belgrade should be enough to convict the former serb leader and put him behind bars for a long time .
trial could last until 2006 but first milosevic will have the opportunity to defend himself against these charges .
legal observers expect his defense to take as much time and include as many witnesses as del ponte ’ s prosecution .
after a first ruling in the case , an appeals process is anticipated , with no final decision expected before the end of 2006 .
whether milosevic is convicted or not , the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia will continue to play an important role in the truth and reconciliation process of the balkans , according to sluiter .
“ one should also not exaggerate the importance of the milosevic trial .
it comes at a time when the tribunal has already been functioning for a number of years and over those years they have dealt with all of these incidents , " he said .

prosecutors at the international war crimes tribunal will wrap up their case against slobodan milosevic in the next few days .
the former serb leader plans a defense strategy that could extend the trial until 2006 . on most days , slobodan milosevic enters the court room in his customary blue suit .
with the light disinterested gaze of a 61-year-old man with nothing left to lose , he peers back and forth between witnesses testifying on the stand .
for the past two years , the former president of serbia and yugoslavia has stood in the dock of the international war crimes tribunal in the hague .
milosevic , whose case has been modified several times , is charged with 60 war crimes including genocide in bosnia-herzegovina and crimes against humanity in croatia and kosovo .
he is accused in the killings of tens of thousands and the displacement of thousands of people from their homes in the last decade during wars that ravaged the former yugoslavia .
if convicted , he could face a life sentence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.n. war crimes prosecutor carla del ponte .
chief prosecutor carla del ponte -lrb- photo -rrb- and her team are expected to wrap up their case against the ex-dictator in the next week .
the closing arguments will mark the end of the first part of the trial .
milosevic , who has chosen to defend himself , and the two attorneys and legal aide helping him can then prepare a defense strategy and a list of witnesses .
but first , milosevic has the option of requesting an audit of the prosecution 's case .
the three-judge panel then can shoot down arguments and charges for which there is insufficient evidence .
prosecutor 's tough case the process could be damaging for del ponte , who has already been criticized for being too headstrong and not allowing the judges to make their mark on the case .
the shakiest part is believed to be the genocide charge , a weakness even del ponte has conceded .
no one has been able to prove in court that milosevic himself ordered the slaughter of more than 7,000 bosnian muslims in srebrenica in 1995 .
philipp morillon , the former united nations commander in bosnia , who has testified about the massacre , has even partially defended milosevic , saying he had headed off the first possible attack on srebrenica ’ s muslims .
the war crimes charges stemming from croatia and bosnia could also prove problematic .
the prosecution has built the charges on the premise that milosevic was operating a “ criminal organization ” with the goal of building a “ great serbia ” that stretched into parts of croatia and bosnia .
but legal expert sluiter says prosecutors have failed to turn up written evidence .
del ponte has also had trouble finding cooperative witnesses to prove the case against milosevic .
should be enough for long prison term international law expert gören sluiter warns not to place too much blame on del ponte herself .
sluiter said the judges have also made mistakes by failing to set time limits for prosecutors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slobodan milosevic enters the courtroom .
" they have done that to a certain degree ... but giving the prosecutors two years to present the case is extremely long and does not force the prosecutor to be more selective , " sluiter told dw-world .
the prosecution team has managed to present some very effective witnesses , like former nato generals wesley clark and klaus naumann , who have provided would could be deeply incriminating evidence against milosevic .
the generals ' testimony could be especially useful in regard to the crimes against humanity charges in kosovo , sluiter said .
testimony combined with information out of police and army archives in belgrade should be enough to convict the former serb leader and put him behind bars for a long time .
trial could last until 2006 but first milosevic will have the opportunity to defend himself against these charges .
legal observers expect his defense to take as much time and include as many witnesses as del ponte ’ s prosecution .
after a first ruling in the case , an appeals process is anticipated , with no final decision expected before the end of 2006 .
whether milosevic is convicted or not , the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia will continue to play an important role in the truth and reconciliation process of the balkans , according to sluiter .
“ one should also not exaggerate the importance of the milosevic trial .
it comes at a time when the tribunal has already been functioning for a number of years and over those years they have dealt with all of these incidents , " he said .
" so i think as to the effects of the case and the responsibilities , i think the groundwork has already been done and even without the milosevic trial the is of significant importance for the history of the balkans . ” dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ten years on : the fight for justice in the balkans continues the u.n. tribunal for war crimes in the former yugoslavia marks its ten-year anniversary this week , but it 's business as usual in the hague as the trials of those accused of atrocities in the balkan wars continue .

eurocrats in brussels are fed up with the many myths peddled by the media about the european union .
a european commission website sets out to put the record straight . last year , british tabloid the daily mail informed its readers that the eu was planning to ban corgis .
" certain breeds of the queen 's favorite dog could be outlawed under a controversial eu convention being considered by ministers , " it revealed . the shock revelation which outraged animal lovers across the country and fuelled anti-european sentiment in fact had nothing to do with the eu .
the story originated with a committee of animal protection experts which drew up a european convention for the protection of pet animals designed to improve the welfare of household pets . whatever .
readers were all too willing to believe the eu was up to its usual nonsense . this sort of scare-mongering plays right into the hands of euroskeptics - as brussels is all too aware .
the european commission now features on its website a compilation of popular misconceptions ranging from the sublime to the ridiculous , giving the inside story , laying out the facts and debunking the myths . media-fuelled hostility a lot of europhiles feel the press coverage contributes to widespread bewilderment and hostility towards europe , feeding a popular attitude that the eu is a dangerous behemoth deliberately blinding its citizens with layers of impenetrable bureaucracy and ludicrous laws . admittedly , brussels is an easy target .
a tangle of competing institutions and different agendas , eu bodies are notorious for excessive red tape , corruption scandals and mystifying rules and regulations .
it all contributes to a culture of confusion that leaves the public willing to believe just about anything . according to michael mann from the european commission press office , the british media is a main offender , with the tabloids all trying to outdo one another with sensational stories . mann is now busy collecting myths and countering them with facts .
in his opinion , the problem is that the level of debate about europe is n't as high as it should be . a reflection of national reservations the misunderstandings and prejudices come in all shapes and sizes .
maintaining that eu officials are grossly overpaid is one thing - but the idea that male members of staff are reimbursed for the medical costs of viagra pills is slightly less well-founded . horror stories from brussels are part of the media 's daily diet , but reveal an astonishing gullibility on the part of many europeans .
on the euro-myth silly scale , old favorites such as greengrocers having to conform to rules covering size , length , color and texture of fruit and vegetables are less believable than proposals for a new european flag , but the sheer quantity of misapprehensions goes to show how little the public understands the workings of the european union .
viola eggert from the european commission 's berlin office attributes the problem to the commission 's zeal for regulations , saying many myths about the eu popular in germany " are based on over-regulation and the idea that the eu tells its citizens what they 're allowed to do , and has too big an influence on their lives . "
so although gullibility may be to blame for many of the myths , the volume of misinformation appears to reflect strong national reservations about the sort of things the european commission would like to do if left to its own devices .
anti-eu groups are all too willing to twist the facts about brussels ' law-making , but the eu would do well to conclude it should , in future , explain itself better .
after all , brussels does have one of the most extensive press corps in the world .

" certain breeds of the queen 's favorite dog could be outlawed under a controversial eu convention being considered by ministers , " it revealed . the shock revelation which outraged animal lovers across the country and fuelled anti-european sentiment in fact had nothing to do with the eu .
the story originated with a committee of animal protection experts which drew up a european convention for the protection of pet animals designed to improve the welfare of household pets . whatever .
readers were all too willing to believe the eu was up to its usual nonsense . this sort of scare-mongering plays right into the hands of euroskeptics - as brussels is all too aware .
the european commission now features on its website a compilation of popular misconceptions ranging from the sublime to the ridiculous , giving the inside story , laying out the facts and debunking the myths . media-fuelled hostility a lot of europhiles feel the press coverage contributes to widespread bewilderment and hostility towards europe , feeding a popular attitude that the eu is a dangerous behemoth deliberately blinding its citizens with layers of impenetrable bureaucracy and ludicrous laws . admittedly , brussels is an easy target .
a tangle of competing institutions and different agendas , eu bodies are notorious for excessive red tape , corruption scandals and mystifying rules and regulations .
it all contributes to a culture of confusion that leaves the public willing to believe just about anything . according to michael mann from the european commission press office , the british media is a main offender , with the tabloids all trying to outdo one another with sensational stories . mann is now busy collecting myths and countering them with facts .
in his opinion , the problem is that the level of debate about europe is n't as high as it should be . a reflection of national reservations the misunderstandings and prejudices come in all shapes and sizes .
maintaining that eu officials are grossly overpaid is one thing - but the idea that male members of staff are reimbursed for the medical costs of viagra pills is slightly less well-founded . horror stories from brussels are part of the media 's daily diet , but reveal an astonishing gullibility on the part of many europeans .
on the euro-myth silly scale , old favorites such as greengrocers having to conform to rules covering size , length , color and texture of fruit and vegetables are less believable than proposals for a new european flag , but the sheer quantity of misapprehensions goes to show how little the public understands the workings of the european union .
viola eggert from the european commission 's berlin office attributes the problem to the commission 's zeal for regulations , saying many myths about the eu popular in germany " are based on over-regulation and the idea that the eu tells its citizens what they 're allowed to do , and has too big an influence on their lives . "
so although gullibility may be to blame for many of the myths , the volume of misinformation appears to reflect strong national reservations about the sort of things the european commission would like to do if left to its own devices .
anti-eu groups are all too willing to twist the facts about brussels ' law-making , but the eu would do well to conclude it should , in future , explain itself better .
after all , brussels does have one of the most extensive press corps in the world .

the leaders of france , germany and great britain urged europe to adapt to the changing world economy and make the continent more investor-friendly . president jacques chirac , british prime minister tony blair and chancellor gerhard schröder spoke after a two-a-half hour meeting in berlin wednesday .
as a sign of both the cordiality and the importance of topics on the table , the discussions will continue throughout the evening over dinner . the focal point of the afternoon discussions were the need for the three nations and europe as a whole to adapt their national economies and social security systems in the face of globalization and aging populations . " our own people and europe as a whole know there is an economic world that is changing very rapidly , and what this means is , is that the response of government on the national and european level has to be quick and equally adaptable to changing circumstances , " said british prime minister tony blair . make europe investor-friendly , dynamic the three signed a letter which will be sent to current european union president bertie ahern of ireland .
in the letter , the three countries urged the european commission , which initiates policy in the eu , to play a stronger rule in urging economic and health reforms and making europe more investor-friendly . the three called for a new super commissioner responsible for economics to be added to the body as part of changes being discussed by the new european constitution .
the three said the eu should keep its goal of being the most competitive and dynamic economy on earth by 2010 . chancellor gerhard schröder said the three had similar goals on investing in research , universities and innovation .
the chancellor , whose country is one of many european countries experiencing a brain drain of good scientists to the u.s. , talked about investing in the " fields of the future . " similar problems , similar solutions " we saw that there was a large amount of similarity in the types of problems we had , " said schröder . schröder and his social democratic green party coalition are experiencing plumetting popularity rates as a result of economic reforms that seek to dismantle the country 's generous welfare system and rejig the labor market . chirac and blair are undergoing similar fights in their own countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- l . -rrb- and french president jacques chirac both france and germany have been violators of the european union 's economic growth and stability pact , which sets public debt limits in eu member states .
by refusing to trim public spending to keep their social systems afloat during sluggish economic growth , both governments ran afoul of eu monetary officials , who sought legal action . " we need to change the system , without destroying it , " said schröder .
" only if we change it , can we keep it and can we afford it . " " big three " meeting no cause for concern the three leaders brushed back criticism that they were aiming to create an eu triumvirate that would block smaller member states .
blair pointed to the joint defense plan agreed on by the three countries last week and the efforts by german , french and british diplomats to curb iran 's nuclear ambitions as achievements that were good for all of europe . " if these three countries , which comprise almost half of the population in europe … work on clear agreements , then that is a good thing for our three countries but also for europe and there should n't be any concerns about exclusivity , " blair said . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's budding ménage à trois the leaders of britain , france and germany meet in berlin on wednesday to push for further european economic cooperation .

the leaders of france , germany and great britain urged europe to adapt to the changing world economy and make the continent more investor-friendly . president jacques chirac , british prime minister tony blair and chancellor gerhard schröder spoke after a two-a-half hour meeting in berlin wednesday .
as a sign of both the cordiality and the importance of topics on the table , the discussions will continue throughout the evening over dinner . the focal point of the afternoon discussions were the need for the three nations and europe as a whole to adapt their national economies and social security systems in the face of globalization and aging populations . " our own people and europe as a whole know there is an economic world that is changing very rapidly , and what this means is , is that the response of government on the national and european level has to be quick and equally adaptable to changing circumstances , " said british prime minister tony blair . make europe investor-friendly , dynamic the three signed a letter which will be sent to current european union president bertie ahern of ireland .
in the letter , the three countries urged the european commission , which initiates policy in the eu , to play a stronger rule in urging economic and health reforms and making europe more investor-friendly . the three called for a new super commissioner responsible for economics to be added to the body as part of changes being discussed by the new european constitution .
the three said the eu should keep its goal of being the most competitive and dynamic economy on earth by 2010 . chancellor gerhard schröder said the three had similar goals on investing in research , universities and innovation .
the chancellor , whose country is one of many european countries experiencing a brain drain of good scientists to the u.s. , talked about investing in the " fields of the future . " similar problems , similar solutions " we saw that there was a large amount of similarity in the types of problems we had , " said schröder . schröder and his social democratic green party coalition are experiencing plumetting popularity rates as a result of economic reforms that seek to dismantle the country 's generous welfare system and rejig the labor market . chirac and blair are undergoing similar fights in their own countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- l . -rrb- and french president jacques chirac both france and germany have been violators of the european union 's economic growth and stability pact , which sets public debt limits in eu member states .
by refusing to trim public spending to keep their social systems afloat during sluggish economic growth , both governments ran afoul of eu monetary officials , who sought legal action . " we need to change the system , without destroying it , " said schröder .
" only if we change it , can we keep it and can we afford it . " " big three " meeting no cause for concern the three leaders brushed back criticism that they were aiming to create an eu triumvirate that would block smaller member states .
blair pointed to the joint defense plan agreed on by the three countries last week and the efforts by german , french and british diplomats to curb iran 's nuclear ambitions as achievements that were good for all of europe . " if these three countries , which comprise almost half of the population in europe … work on clear agreements , then that is a good thing for our three countries but also for europe and there should n't be any concerns about exclusivity , " blair said . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's budding ménage à trois the leaders of britain , france and germany meet in berlin on wednesday to push for further european economic cooperation .

the leaders of france , germany and great britain urged europe to adapt to the changing world economy and make the continent more investor-friendly . president jacques chirac , british prime minister tony blair and chancellor gerhard schröder spoke after a two-a-half hour meeting in berlin wednesday .
as a sign of both the cordiality and the importance of topics on the table , the discussions will continue throughout the evening over dinner . the focal point of the afternoon discussions were the need for the three nations and europe as a whole to adapt their national economies and social security systems in the face of globalization and aging populations . " our own people and europe as a whole know there is an economic world that is changing very rapidly , and what this means is , is that the response of government on the national and european level has to be quick and equally adaptable to changing circumstances , " said british prime minister tony blair . make europe investor-friendly , dynamic the three signed a letter which will be sent to current european union president bertie ahern of ireland .
in the letter , the three countries urged the european commission , which initiates policy in the eu , to play a stronger rule in urging economic and health reforms and making europe more investor-friendly . the three called for a new super commissioner responsible for economics to be added to the body as part of changes being discussed by the new european constitution .
the three said the eu should keep its goal of being the most competitive and dynamic economy on earth by 2010 . chancellor gerhard schröder said the three had similar goals on investing in research , universities and innovation .
the chancellor , whose country is one of many european countries experiencing a brain drain of good scientists to the u.s. , talked about investing in the " fields of the future . " similar problems , similar solutions " we saw that there was a large amount of similarity in the types of problems we had , " said schröder . schröder and his social democratic green party coalition are experiencing plumetting popularity rates as a result of economic reforms that seek to dismantle the country 's generous welfare system and rejig the labor market . chirac and blair are undergoing similar fights in their own countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- l . -rrb- and french president jacques chirac both france and germany have been violators of the european union 's economic growth and stability pact , which sets public debt limits in eu member states .
by refusing to trim public spending to keep their social systems afloat during sluggish economic growth , both governments ran afoul of eu monetary officials , who sought legal action . " we need to change the system , without destroying it , " said schröder .
" only if we change it , can we keep it and can we afford it . " " big three " meeting no cause for concern the three leaders brushed back criticism that they were aiming to create an eu triumvirate that would block smaller member states .
blair pointed to the joint defense plan agreed on by the three countries last week and the efforts by german , french and british diplomats to curb iran 's nuclear ambitions as achievements that were good for all of europe . " if these three countries , which comprise almost half of the population in europe … work on clear agreements , then that is a good thing for our three countries but also for europe and there should n't be any concerns about exclusivity , " blair said . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's budding ménage à trois the leaders of britain , france and germany meet in berlin on wednesday to push for further european economic cooperation .

german finance minister hans eichel created an uproar after proposing a law that would send the labor police after domestic staff working illegally .
he 's since backed off . if eichel had his way , people who employed a cleaning lady or babysitter in germany could possibly be made into outlaws . as part of a tough government initiative to tackle germany 's booming illegal jobs market , eichel wanted to target all illegal workers and their employers .
under his bill proposal , domestic help , from cleaners to part-time tutors would be subject to the same constraints and rules as construction workers , office staff and employees in the commercial sector .
that meant that they could face prosecution under german labor laws if they were not registered workers , much in the same way that other workers such as builders , carpenters and technicians were .
private sector is decriminalized after an uproar among opposition politicians and members of the government 's junion coalition partner , the greens , chancellor gehard schröder 's cabinet reduced the severity of the law .
barbara hendricks , a deputy finance minister , declared after the cabinet decision : " the private area has become decriminalized . "
people working in the part-time domestic services sector are now not required to register for so-called " mini-jobs . " the government re-introduced the " minijobs " - which allow workers to earn up to € 400 without having to pay taxes or social benefits - in an effort to streamline registration and encourage workers to come out of the illegal sector .
labor police to look elsewhere an initiative put forward by the finance ministry had mobilized a force of 2,000 customs officers to track down and investigate cleaning ladies and other domestic staff who were working in the so-called shadow economy . a new ministry task force composed of 7,000 officers has been set up to investigate illegal workers and their employers .
their search will now be limited to the restaurant , construction , gaming and tourism industry . the police trade union and metalworkers union ig metall has criticized the new rules , claiming that illegal is illegal and the private sector should be monitored and regulated just as any other .
the government 's reversal came after the increasing clamor over the " cleaning lady debate " from many members of the public who felt it was unfair to treat domestic help in the same way as other areas of employment and include it in labor law categories along with drug dealers and prostitutes who evade taxation and social security levies . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de labor market reforms spelled out germany 's parliament votes on october 17 on labor market reforms that critics say will lead to painful cuts for people in and out of work .

german finance minister hans eichel created an uproar after proposing a law that would send the labor police after domestic staff working illegally .
he 's since backed off . if eichel had his way , people who employed a cleaning lady or babysitter in germany could possibly be made into outlaws . as part of a tough government initiative to tackle germany 's booming illegal jobs market , eichel wanted to target all illegal workers and their employers .
under his bill proposal , domestic help , from cleaners to part-time tutors would be subject to the same constraints and rules as construction workers , office staff and employees in the commercial sector .
that meant that they could face prosecution under german labor laws if they were not registered workers , much in the same way that other workers such as builders , carpenters and technicians were .
private sector is decriminalized after an uproar among opposition politicians and members of the government 's junion coalition partner , the greens , chancellor gehard schröder 's cabinet reduced the severity of the law .
barbara hendricks , a deputy finance minister , declared after the cabinet decision : " the private area has become decriminalized . "
people working in the part-time domestic services sector are now not required to register for so-called " mini-jobs . " the government re-introduced the " minijobs " - which allow workers to earn up to € 400 without having to pay taxes or social benefits - in an effort to streamline registration and encourage workers to come out of the illegal sector .

substitute carsten ramelow snatched victory from the jaws of a mediocre stalemate in croatia on wednesday night as germany won 2-1 in the team 's latest preparation match for the european championships this summer . it was business as usual for the german national soccer team on wednesday night .
despite an unconvincing performance against opposition which would normally have been brushed aside by a team of germany 's standing , rudi völler 's men labored to victory once more with a last minute 2-1 win over croatia in split . with their reputation as a football power waning after weak displays against lithuania , iceland and scotland in qualifying for the european championships in portugal , germany was looking to dispatch the opposition in style with the soccer showpiece looming ahead in june . the croatians , however , have proved to germany in the past that they are no pushovers , and it was they who started the better in this friendly warm-up game for euro 2004 . donning his countrymen 's jersey , bayern munich defender robert kovac almost put the home side ahead on 15 minutes when he directed a corner kick goalwards with a strong headed attempt but was thwarted by germany 's 20-year-old debutant philipp lahm who cleared the effort off the line much to the dismay of the croatian crowd .
stuttgart 's kuranyi proves elusive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kevin kuranyi .
the three-time world cup winners had to wait another quarter of an hour before they first really threatened stipe pletikosa in the croatian goal .
vfb stuttgart 's kevin kuranyi -lrb- photo -rrb- slipped through the dawdling defenders to meet a looping cross but sent his header wide of the far post .
in fact , it was croatia 's wobbly defence - important for euro 2004 group opponents england , france and switzerland - which led to their downfall .
after pegging the germans back for most of the first half , another kuranyi surge exposed croatia 's poor marking and with the croatian rearguard standing motionless , miroslav klose somehow forced his cross home with his knee on 34 minutes .
makeshift midfield charged with stabilization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's coach rudi völler .
germany missed world cup hero michael ballack , who was ruled out late with bronchitis , and the absense of the bayern munich playmaker was sorely felt as the second half opened with the germans in uninspiring form .
coach völler had made several forced changes in his team selection before the game , reshuffling his midfield around the returning liverpool midfielder dietmar hamann and the unsettled dortmunder torsten frings .
again it was croatia and kovac who provided the first real chance of the second period .
with the uncertain looking oliver kahn once more hesitant in goal , kovac whipped in a free kick which skipped off the turf , causing germany 's number one to spill the shot .
luckily for the german captain there were no waiting croatian attackers to tap the loose ball into the empty net .
kuranyi , proving to be germany 's most lively player , then missed his second glorious chance of the game when he poked an effort through pletikosa ' legs only to see the ball roll agonisingly wide of the far post .
chances go begging for croatia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn was floored again .
as the game ebbed and flowed , croatia once again found their rhythm and with 70 minutes on the clock , substitute nino bule should have equalized when it was germany 's defenders ' turn to be caught asleep .
with only kahn to beat , bule considered his options for too long before tamely passing the ball into the waiting goalkeeper 's arms .
the croatians should have been level minutes later when they somehow managed to miss guilt-edged chances from two huge goalmouth scrambles in the closing stages of the match .
but with four minutes remaining , mato neretljak succeeded where oliver kahn had failed by getting on the end of a looping corner and heading past the flapping keeper .
last minute hero bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carsten ramelow .
with another lackluster draw in the making , substitute carsten ramelow entered the picture .
the bayer leverkusen player saved the blushes of his team mates , and his captain especially , by volleying home the winner in the 90th minute to secure a flattering victory . germany 's next warm-up for the european championships comes on march 31 when it takes on belgium in cologne . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to face old foes in euro 2004 old scores and local rivalries are set to be settled in the opening stages of the european championships in portugal next summer as the soccer teams of germany and holland have been placed together in group d.

stuttgart 's kuranyi proves elusive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kevin kuranyi .
the three-time world cup winners had to wait another quarter of an hour before they first really threatened stipe pletikosa in the croatian goal .
vfb stuttgart 's kevin kuranyi -lrb- photo -rrb- slipped through the dawdling defenders to meet a looping cross but sent his header wide of the far post .
in fact , it was croatia 's wobbly defence - important for euro 2004 group opponents england , france and switzerland - which led to their downfall .
after pegging the germans back for most of the first half , another kuranyi surge exposed croatia 's poor marking and with the croatian rearguard standing motionless , miroslav klose somehow forced his cross home with his knee on 34 minutes .
makeshift midfield charged with stabilization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's coach rudi völler .
germany missed world cup hero michael ballack , who was ruled out late with bronchitis , and the absense of the bayern munich playmaker was sorely felt as the second half opened with the germans in uninspiring form .
coach völler had made several forced changes in his team selection before the game , reshuffling his midfield around the returning liverpool midfielder dietmar hamann and the unsettled dortmunder torsten frings .
again it was croatia and kovac who provided the first real chance of the second period .
with the uncertain looking oliver kahn once more hesitant in goal , kovac whipped in a free kick which skipped off the turf , causing germany 's number one to spill the shot .
luckily for the german captain there were no waiting croatian attackers to tap the loose ball into the empty net .
kuranyi , proving to be germany 's most lively player , then missed his second glorious chance of the game when he poked an effort through pletikosa ' legs only to see the ball roll agonisingly wide of the far post .
chances go begging for croatia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn was floored again .
as the game ebbed and flowed , croatia once again found their rhythm and with 70 minutes on the clock , substitute nino bule should have equalized when it was germany 's defenders ' turn to be caught asleep .
with only kahn to beat , bule considered his options for too long before tamely passing the ball into the waiting goalkeeper 's arms .
the croatians should have been level minutes later when they somehow managed to miss guilt-edged chances from two huge goalmouth scrambles in the closing stages of the match .
but with four minutes remaining , mato neretljak succeeded where oliver kahn had failed by getting on the end of a looping corner and heading past the flapping keeper .
last minute hero bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carsten ramelow .
with another lackluster draw in the making , substitute carsten ramelow entered the picture .
the bayer leverkusen player saved the blushes of his team mates , and his captain especially , by volleying home the winner in the 90th minute to secure a flattering victory . germany 's next warm-up for the european championships comes on march 31 when it takes on belgium in cologne . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to face old foes in euro 2004 old scores and local rivalries are set to be settled in the opening stages of the european championships in portugal next summer as the soccer teams of germany and holland have been placed together in group d.

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.02.2004 eu vows to combat anti-semitism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe has work to do , as long as " synagogues and kindergartens are threatened , " said the german foreign minister the european commission 's president called for member states to take a hard line against anti-semitism , after a day-long seminar with jewish and other european leaders in brussels . romano prodi said he would encourage eu governments to take a tougher stance against all manifestations of racism and intolerance by endorsing a draft u.n. resolution against anti-semitism .
he also said he would urge eu interior affairs and justice ministers to explore law enforcement measures and " pre-emptive acition in the field of education . "
" we want concrete results , " prodi told the gathering of jewish groups thursday .
the italian commission president comments came after months in which the eu came under heavy criticism for standing by amid a rising wave of anti-semitism in europe and the body 's perceived anti-israeli sentiment .
a " european disease " jewish leaders said the eu should monitor anti-jewish incidents more strictly , penalize the perpetrators of the violence more harshly and educate young europeans about the legacy of centuries of persecution on their continent .
though anti-semitism exists in many places in the world , it is also a distinctly " european disease , " nobel-prize winner and holocaust survivor eli wiesel told the gathering .
" the monster is here with us one more time , " said cobi benatoff , president of the european jewish congress . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the jewish community look at fire damages to a synagogue in marseille , france on april 1 , 2002 .
jewish european leaders criticized eu leaders of looking on indifferently as the number of attacks against against jews and desecration of jewish sites rose in recent years . youths from the large communities of arab immigrants in france , belgium and other countries are largely blamed for the attacks .
" the challenge of anti-semitism exists as long as schools , synagogues and kindergartens are threatened , " german foreign minister joschka fischer said .
anti-semitic not to be confused with anti-israeli fischer , however , joined other european officials in drawing a distinct line between criticism of jews and criticism of israel .
while praising israeli prime minister ariel sharon 's recent decision to pull out of the gaza strip , fischer said it should also be possible to criticize the israeli government without being labeled anti-semitic .
prodi also criticized statements made by people like the united states envoy to the eu that draw lines between the levels of anti-semitism today and in the 1930s .
" europe today is not the europe of the 1930s and 1940s and to say that would be quite wrong - we must not insult the memory of the shoah -lrb- hebrew for holocaust -rrb- by equating what is happening today ... with what happened then , " he said , according to reuters .
reports criticized the eu nevertheless has a lot of work to do , according to jewish leaders .
the new york-based world jewish congress called an eu poll last year in which israel topped a list of nations seen as threatening world peace as " dangerously inflammatory . "
the european jewish congress also criticized the eu 's european monitoring center on racism and xenophobia foir witholding a report last year that blamed the rise in anti-semitic attacks on right-wing extremists or young muslims " mostly of arab descent . "
the jewish group said the eu had suppressed the report because it linked arab immigrants to anti-semitic violence in europe .
the monitoring center , however , said it had withheld the report because it was of " poor quality and lacking in empirical evidence .

the leaders of britain , france and germany meet in berlin on wednesday to push for further european economic cooperation .
but others in the eu fear the trio are trying to run europe . a year after the men were at odds over the war in iraq , the leaders of europe 's big three have been working hard at rapprochement these days .
the most visible sign of that new spirit has been an agreement on a common european defense policy reached last december . " that 's an outstanding event that can not be overestimated , " german chancellor schröder told reporters at the time .
this common defense policy and the recent announcement to establish rapid response forces have laid the foundation for an eu " core group . " british premier tony blair might dispute the existence of such a trilateral eu directorate .
but fearing to be side-stepped in an expanded european union , blair has effectively joined germany and france as the bloc 's driving force .
" i strongly believe that britain should play a leading role in the center of europe and not stand aside , " he said . many of the union 's smaller member states are sceptical about the increased trilateral cooperation .
blair does n't think that 's a problem though : the british leader sees himself as the spokesman for new members , who are pro-british and pro-american , in his opinion .
" many states that are now entering the union share the british vision for europe , " he said . moving ahead after constitution talks fail failure to reach a compromise on a proposed eu constitution last december prompted schröder and french president jacques chirac to moot the possibility of turning the eu 's franco-german-led engine into a group of pioneers willing to push ahead with further unification . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro monument is illuminated in front of the european central bank in frankfurt .
" this means that these countries will move ahead , just as has already happened with the euro or the schengen agreement , " chirac said , referring to the abolishment of border controls between most eu countries . although belgium , hungary , the czech republic and greece have expressed interest in joining a leading group , italy , spain and poland oppose making distinctions within the bloc . " europe does n't need a directorate , that would only mess things up , " italian premier silvio berlusconi said on tuesday .
" that 's my opinion , which is shared by other european states except the three in question . " a europe of different speeds schröder , on the other hand , believes that a europe of different speeds will become inevitable should the negotiations over an eu constitution fail for good .
" germany is willing to enter what 's called closer cooperation with france , britain and other eu members , " the chancellor said .
" there 's no question about it . " schröder , who has worked closely with the conservative chirac , is glad to see blair , a fellow social democrat , come aboard .
and according to schröder , the only way to ensure an effective foreign and security policy for the union is to have britain in a leading group . driving or deciding europe 's future unification ? back in 1998 , when joschka fischer took on the job of german foreign minister , he still warned against making britain a part of the franco-german eu engine : britain had n't accepted the eu 's common currency and was opposed to closer cooperation , fischer explained at the time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu family is getting a lot bigger in may .
but now , the troika might push along the unwieldy union with 25 member states and guarantee desperately needed leadership .
that 's the optimistic view .

first , france and germany suspended the euro zone 's stability pact , together with britain they will now try to affix their seal on the union 's foreign and economic policy , they say . indeed , blair , chirac and schröder plan to write a critical letter to the european commission on wednesday , demanding significant changes to the bloc 's investment program , which is scheduled for adoption at a summit at the end of march . bernd riegert -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair and schröder deny plans for " triumvirate " with chirac german chancellor gerhard schröder and british prime minister tony blair met in berlin on thursday ahead of a three-way summit with france next week .

the leaders of britain , france and germany meet in berlin on wednesday to push for further european economic cooperation .
but others in the eu fear the trio are trying to run europe . a year after the men were at odds over the war in iraq , the leaders of europe 's big three have been working hard at rapprochement these days .
the most visible sign of that new spirit has been an agreement on a common european defense policy reached last december . " that 's an outstanding event that can not be overestimated , " german chancellor schröder told reporters at the time .
this common defense policy and the recent announcement to establish rapid response forces have laid the foundation for an eu " core group . " british premier tony blair might dispute the existence of such a trilateral eu directorate .
but fearing to be side-stepped in an expanded european union , blair has effectively joined germany and france as the bloc 's driving force .
" i strongly believe that britain should play a leading role in the center of europe and not stand aside , " he said . many of the union 's smaller member states are sceptical about the increased trilateral cooperation .
blair does n't think that 's a problem though : the british leader sees himself as the spokesman for new members , who are pro-british and pro-american , in his opinion .
" many states that are now entering the union share the british vision for europe , " he said . moving ahead after constitution talks fail failure to reach a compromise on a proposed eu constitution last december prompted schröder and french president jacques chirac to moot the possibility of turning the eu 's franco-german-led engine into a group of pioneers willing to push ahead with further unification . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro monument is illuminated in front of the european central bank in frankfurt .
" this means that these countries will move ahead , just as has already happened with the euro or the schengen agreement , " chirac said , referring to the abolishment of border controls between most eu countries . although belgium , hungary , the czech republic and greece have expressed interest in joining a leading group , italy , spain and poland oppose making distinctions within the bloc . " europe does n't need a directorate , that would only mess things up , " italian premier silvio berlusconi said on tuesday .
" that 's my opinion , which is shared by other european states except the three in question . " a europe of different speeds schröder , on the other hand , believes that a europe of different speeds will become inevitable should the negotiations over an eu constitution fail for good .
" germany is willing to enter what 's called closer cooperation with france , britain and other eu members , " the chancellor said .
" there 's no question about it . " schröder , who has worked closely with the conservative chirac , is glad to see blair , a fellow social democrat , come aboard .
and according to schröder , the only way to ensure an effective foreign and security policy for the union is to have britain in a leading group . driving or deciding europe 's future unification ? back in 1998 , when joschka fischer took on the job of german foreign minister , he still warned against making britain a part of the franco-german eu engine : britain had n't accepted the eu 's common currency and was opposed to closer cooperation , fischer explained at the time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu family is getting a lot bigger in may .

prosecutors at the international war crimes tribunal will wrap up their case against slobodan milosevic in the next few days .
the former serb leader plans a defense strategy that could extend the trial until 2006 . on most days , slobodan milosevic enters the court room in his customary blue suit .
with the light disinterested gaze of a 61-year-old man with nothing left to lose , he peers back and forth between witnesses testifying on the stand .
for the past two years , the former president of serbia and yugoslavia has stood in the dock of the international war crimes tribunal in the hague .
milosevic , whose case has been modified several times , is charged with 60 war crimes including genocide in bosnia-herzegovina and crimes against humanity in croatia and kosovo .
he is accused in the killings of tens of thousands and the displacement of thousands of people from their homes in the last decade during wars that ravaged the former yugoslavia .
if convicted , he could face a life sentence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.n. war crimes prosecutor carla del ponte .
chief prosecutor carla del ponte -lrb- photo -rrb- and her team are expected to wrap up their case against the ex-dictator in the next week .
the closing arguments will mark the end of the first part of the trial .
milosevic , who has chosen to defend himself , and the two attorneys and legal aide helping him can then prepare a defense strategy and a list of witnesses .
but first , milosevic has the option of requesting an audit of the prosecution 's case .
the three-judge panel then can shoot down arguments and charges for which there is insufficient evidence .
prosecutor 's tough case the process could be damaging for del ponte , who has already been criticized for being too headstrong and not allowing the judges to make their mark on the case .
the shakiest part is believed to be the genocide charge , a weakness even del ponte has conceded .
no one has been able to prove in court that milosevic himself ordered the slaughter of more than 7,000 bosnian muslims in srebrenica in 1995 .
philipp morillon , the former united nations commander in bosnia , who has testified about the massacre , has even partially defended milosevic , saying he had headed off the first possible attack on srebrenica ’ s muslims .
the war crimes charges stemming from croatia and bosnia could also prove problematic .
the prosecution has built the charges on the premise that milosevic was operating a “ criminal organization ” with the goal of building a “ great serbia ” that stretched into parts of croatia and bosnia .
but legal expert sluiter says prosecutors have failed to turn up written evidence .
del ponte has also had trouble finding cooperative witnesses to prove the case against milosevic .
should be enough for long prison term international law expert gören sluiter warns not to place too much blame on del ponte herself .
sluiter said the judges have also made mistakes by failing to set time limits for prosecutors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slobodan milosevic enters the courtroom .
" they have done that to a certain degree ... but giving the prosecutors two years to present the case is extremely long and does not force the prosecutor to be more selective , " sluiter told dw-world .
the prosecution team has managed to present some very effective witnesses , like former nato generals wesley clark and klaus naumann , who have provided would could be deeply incriminating evidence against milosevic .
the generals ' testimony could be especially useful in regard to the crimes against humanity charges in kosovo , sluiter said .
testimony combined with information out of police and army archives in belgrade should be enough to convict the former serb leader and put him behind bars for a long time .
trial could last until 2006 but first milosevic will have the opportunity to defend himself against these charges .
legal observers expect his defense to take as much time and include as many witnesses as del ponte ’ s prosecution .
after a first ruling in the case , an appeals process is anticipated , with no final decision expected before the end of 2006 .
whether milosevic is convicted or not , the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia will continue to play an important role in the truth and reconciliation process of the balkans , according to sluiter .
“ one should also not exaggerate the importance of the milosevic trial .
it comes at a time when the tribunal has already been functioning for a number of years and over those years they have dealt with all of these incidents , " he said .
" so i think as to the effects of the case and the responsibilities , i think the groundwork has already been done and even without the milosevic trial the is of significant importance for the history of the balkans . ” dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ten years on : the fight for justice in the balkans continues the u.n. tribunal for war crimes in the former yugoslavia marks its ten-year anniversary this week , but it 's business as usual in the hague as the trials of those accused of atrocities in the balkan wars continue .

prosecutors at the international war crimes tribunal will wrap up their case against slobodan milosevic in the next few days .
the former serb leader plans a defense strategy that could extend the trial until 2006 . on most days , slobodan milosevic enters the court room in his customary blue suit .
with the light disinterested gaze of a 61-year-old man with nothing left to lose , he peers back and forth between witnesses testifying on the stand .
for the past two years , the former president of serbia and yugoslavia has stood in the dock of the international war crimes tribunal in the hague .
milosevic , whose case has been modified several times , is charged with 60 war crimes including genocide in bosnia-herzegovina and crimes against humanity in croatia and kosovo .
he is accused in the killings of tens of thousands and the displacement of thousands of people from their homes in the last decade during wars that ravaged the former yugoslavia .
if convicted , he could face a life sentence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.n. war crimes prosecutor carla del ponte .
chief prosecutor carla del ponte -lrb- photo -rrb- and her team are expected to wrap up their case against the ex-dictator in the next week .
the closing arguments will mark the end of the first part of the trial .
milosevic , who has chosen to defend himself , and the two attorneys and legal aide helping him can then prepare a defense strategy and a list of witnesses .
but first , milosevic has the option of requesting an audit of the prosecution 's case .
the three-judge panel then can shoot down arguments and charges for which there is insufficient evidence .
prosecutor 's tough case the process could be damaging for del ponte , who has already been criticized for being too headstrong and not allowing the judges to make their mark on the case .
the shakiest part is believed to be the genocide charge , a weakness even del ponte has conceded .
no one has been able to prove in court that milosevic himself ordered the slaughter of more than 7,000 bosnian muslims in srebrenica in 1995 .
philipp morillon , the former united nations commander in bosnia , who has testified about the massacre , has even partially defended milosevic , saying he had headed off the first possible attack on srebrenica ’ s muslims .
the war crimes charges stemming from croatia and bosnia could also prove problematic .
the prosecution has built the charges on the premise that milosevic was operating a “ criminal organization ” with the goal of building a “ great serbia ” that stretched into parts of croatia and bosnia .
but legal expert sluiter says prosecutors have failed to turn up written evidence .
del ponte has also had trouble finding cooperative witnesses to prove the case against milosevic .
should be enough for long prison term international law expert gören sluiter warns not to place too much blame on del ponte herself .
sluiter said the judges have also made mistakes by failing to set time limits for prosecutors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slobodan milosevic enters the courtroom .
" they have done that to a certain degree ... but giving the prosecutors two years to present the case is extremely long and does not force the prosecutor to be more selective , " sluiter told dw-world .
the prosecution team has managed to present some very effective witnesses , like former nato generals wesley clark and klaus naumann , who have provided would could be deeply incriminating evidence against milosevic .
the generals ' testimony could be especially useful in regard to the crimes against humanity charges in kosovo , sluiter said .
testimony combined with information out of police and army archives in belgrade should be enough to convict the former serb leader and put him behind bars for a long time .
trial could last until 2006 but first milosevic will have the opportunity to defend himself against these charges .
legal observers expect his defense to take as much time and include as many witnesses as del ponte ’ s prosecution .
after a first ruling in the case , an appeals process is anticipated , with no final decision expected before the end of 2006 .
whether milosevic is convicted or not , the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia will continue to play an important role in the truth and reconciliation process of the balkans , according to sluiter .
“ one should also not exaggerate the importance of the milosevic trial .
it comes at a time when the tribunal has already been functioning for a number of years and over those years they have dealt with all of these incidents , " he said .
" so i think as to the effects of the case and the responsibilities , i think the groundwork has already been done and even without the milosevic trial the is of significant importance for the history of the balkans . ” dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ten years on : the fight for justice in the balkans continues the u.n. tribunal for war crimes in the former yugoslavia marks its ten-year anniversary this week , but it 's business as usual in the hague as the trials of those accused of atrocities in the balkan wars continue .

the leaders of britain , france and germany meet in berlin on wednesday to push for further european economic cooperation .
but others in the eu fear the trio are trying to run europe . a year after the men were at odds over the war in iraq , the leaders of europe 's big three have been working hard at rapprochement these days .
the most visible sign of that new spirit has been an agreement on a common european defense policy reached last december . " that 's an outstanding event that can not be overestimated , " german chancellor schröder told reporters at the time .
this common defense policy and the recent announcement to establish rapid response forces have laid the foundation for an eu " core group . " british premier tony blair might dispute the existence of such a trilateral eu directorate .
but fearing to be side-stepped in an expanded european union , blair has effectively joined germany and france as the bloc 's driving force .
" i strongly believe that britain should play a leading role in the center of europe and not stand aside , " he said . many of the union 's smaller member states are sceptical about the increased trilateral cooperation .
blair does n't think that 's a problem though : the british leader sees himself as the spokesman for new members , who are pro-british and pro-american , in his opinion .
" many states that are now entering the union share the british vision for europe , " he said . moving ahead after constitution talks fail failure to reach a compromise on a proposed eu constitution last december prompted schröder and french president jacques chirac to moot the possibility of turning the eu 's franco-german-led engine into a group of pioneers willing to push ahead with further unification . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro monument is illuminated in front of the european central bank in frankfurt .

" europe does n't need a directorate , that would only mess things up , " italian premier silvio berlusconi said on tuesday .

the leaders of britain , france and germany meet in berlin on wednesday to push for further european economic cooperation .
but others in the eu fear the trio are trying to run europe . a year after the men were at odds over the war in iraq , the leaders of europe 's big three have been working hard at rapprochement these days .
the most visible sign of that new spirit has been an agreement on a common european defense policy reached last december . " that 's an outstanding event that can not be overestimated , " german chancellor schröder told reporters at the time .
this common defense policy and the recent announcement to establish rapid response forces have laid the foundation for an eu " core group . " british premier tony blair might dispute the existence of such a trilateral eu directorate .
but fearing to be side-stepped in an expanded european union , blair has effectively joined germany and france as the bloc 's driving force .
" i strongly believe that britain should play a leading role in the center of europe and not stand aside , " he said . many of the union 's smaller member states are sceptical about the increased trilateral cooperation .
blair does n't think that 's a problem though : the british leader sees himself as the spokesman for new members , who are pro-british and pro-american , in his opinion .
" many states that are now entering the union share the british vision for europe , " he said . moving ahead after constitution talks fail failure to reach a compromise on a proposed eu constitution last december prompted schröder and french president jacques chirac to moot the possibility of turning the eu 's franco-german-led engine into a group of pioneers willing to push ahead with further unification . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro monument is illuminated in front of the european central bank in frankfurt .
" this means that these countries will move ahead , just as has already happened with the euro or the schengen agreement , " chirac said , referring to the abolishment of border controls between most eu countries . although belgium , hungary , the czech republic and greece have expressed interest in joining a leading group , italy , spain and poland oppose making distinctions within the bloc . " europe does n't need a directorate , that would only mess things up , " italian premier silvio berlusconi said on tuesday .
" that 's my opinion , which is shared by other european states except the three in question . " a europe of different speeds schröder , on the other hand , believes that a europe of different speeds will become inevitable should the negotiations over an eu constitution fail for good .
" germany is willing to enter what 's called closer cooperation with france , britain and other eu members , " the chancellor said .
" there 's no question about it . " schröder , who has worked closely with the conservative chirac , is glad to see blair , a fellow social democrat , come aboard .
and according to schröder , the only way to ensure an effective foreign and security policy for the union is to have britain in a leading group . driving or deciding europe 's future unification ? back in 1998 , when joschka fischer took on the job of german foreign minister , he still warned against making britain a part of the franco-german eu engine : britain had n't accepted the eu 's common currency and was opposed to closer cooperation , fischer explained at the time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu family is getting a lot bigger in may .

first , france and germany suspended the euro zone 's stability pact , together with britain they will now try to affix their seal on the union 's foreign and economic policy , they say . indeed , blair , chirac and schröder plan to write a critical letter to the european commission on wednesday , demanding significant changes to the bloc 's investment program , which is scheduled for adoption at a summit at the end of march . bernd riegert -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair and schröder deny plans for " triumvirate " with chirac german chancellor gerhard schröder and british prime minister tony blair met in berlin on thursday ahead of a three-way summit with france next week .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.02.2004 milosevic prosecution closes arguments this week großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no longer the face of serbia , milosevic has been in a dutch cell for more than two years .
prosecutors at the international war crimes tribunal will wrap up their case against slobodan milosevic in the next few days .
the former serb leader plans a defense strategy that could extend the trial until 2006 . on most days , slobodan milosevic enters the court room in his customary blue suit .
with the light disinterested gaze of a 61-year-old man with nothing left to lose , he peers back and forth between witnesses testifying on the stand .
for the past two years , the former president of serbia and yugoslavia has stood in the dock of the international war crimes tribunal in the hague .
milosevic , whose case has been modified several times , is charged with 60 war crimes including genocide in bosnia-herzegovina and crimes against humanity in croatia and kosovo .
he is accused in the killings of tens of thousands and the displacement of thousands of people from their homes in the last decade during wars that ravaged the former yugoslavia .
if convicted , he could face a life sentence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.n. war crimes prosecutor carla del ponte .
chief prosecutor carla del ponte -lrb- photo -rrb- and her team are expected to wrap up their case against the ex-dictator in the next week .
the closing arguments will mark the end of the first part of the trial .
milosevic , who has chosen to defend himself , and the two attorneys and legal aide helping him can then prepare a defense strategy and a list of witnesses .
but first , milosevic has the option of requesting an audit of the prosecution 's case .
the three-judge panel then can shoot down arguments and charges for which there is insufficient evidence .
prosecutor 's tough case the process could be damaging for del ponte , who has already been criticized for being too headstrong and not allowing the judges to make their mark on the case .
the shakiest part is believed to be the genocide charge , a weakness even del ponte has conceded .
no one has been able to prove in court that milosevic himself ordered the slaughter of more than 7,000 bosnian muslims in srebrenica in 1995 .
philipp morillon , the former united nations commander in bosnia , who has testified about the massacre , has even partially defended milosevic , saying he had headed off the first possible attack on srebrenica ’ s muslims .
the war crimes charges stemming from croatia and bosnia could also prove problematic .
the prosecution has built the charges on the premise that milosevic was operating a “ criminal organization ” with the goal of building a “ great serbia ” that stretched into parts of croatia and bosnia .
but legal expert sluiter says prosecutors have failed to turn up written evidence .
del ponte has also had trouble finding cooperative witnesses to prove the case against milosevic .
should be enough for long prison term international law expert gören sluiter warns not to place too much blame on del ponte herself .
sluiter said the judges have also made mistakes by failing to set time limits for prosecutors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slobodan milosevic enters the courtroom .
" they have done that to a certain degree ... but giving the prosecutors two years to present the case is extremely long and does not force the prosecutor to be more selective , " sluiter told dw-world .
the prosecution team has managed to present some very effective witnesses , like former nato generals wesley clark and klaus naumann , who have provided would could be deeply incriminating evidence against milosevic .
the generals ' testimony could be especially useful in regard to the crimes against humanity charges in kosovo , sluiter said .
testimony combined with information out of police and army archives in belgrade should be enough to convict the former serb leader and put him behind bars for a long time .
trial could last until 2006 but first milosevic will have the opportunity to defend himself against these charges .
legal observers expect his defense to take as much time and include as many witnesses as del ponte ’ s prosecution .
after a first ruling in the case , an appeals process is anticipated , with no final decision expected before the end of 2006 .
whether milosevic is convicted or not , the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia will continue to play an important role in the truth and reconciliation process of the balkans , according to sluiter .
“ one should also not exaggerate the importance of the milosevic trial .
it comes at a time when the tribunal has already been functioning for a number of years and over those years they have dealt with all of these incidents , " he said .

" our own people and europe as a whole know there is an economic world that is changing very rapidly , and what this means is , is that the response of government on the national and european level has to be quick and equally adaptable to changing circumstances , " said british prime minister tony blair . make europe investor-friendly , dynamic the three signed a letter which will be sent to current european union president bertie ahern of ireland .
in the letter , the three countries urged the european commission , which initiates policy in the eu , to play a stronger rule in urging economic and health reforms and making europe more investor-friendly . the three called for a new super commissioner responsible for economics to be added to the body as part of changes being discussed by the new european constitution .
the three said the eu should keep its goal of being the most competitive and dynamic economy on earth by 2010 . chancellor gerhard schröder said the three had similar goals on investing in research , universities and innovation .

blair pointed to the joint defense plan agreed on by the three countries last week and the efforts by german , french and british diplomats to curb iran 's nuclear ambitions as achievements that were good for all of europe .

the leaders of france , germany and great britain urged europe to adapt to the changing world economy and make the continent more investor-friendly . president jacques chirac , british prime minister tony blair and chancellor gerhard schröder spoke after a two-a-half hour meeting in berlin wednesday .
as a sign of both the cordiality and the importance of topics on the table , the discussions will continue throughout the evening over dinner . the focal point of the afternoon discussions were the need for the three nations and europe as a whole to adapt their national economies and social security systems in the face of globalization and aging populations . " our own people and europe as a whole know there is an economic world that is changing very rapidly , and what this means is , is that the response of government on the national and european level has to be quick and equally adaptable to changing circumstances , " said british prime minister tony blair . make europe investor-friendly , dynamic the three signed a letter which will be sent to current european union president bertie ahern of ireland .
in the letter , the three countries urged the european commission , which initiates policy in the eu , to play a stronger rule in urging economic and health reforms and making europe more investor-friendly . the three called for a new super commissioner responsible for economics to be added to the body as part of changes being discussed by the new european constitution .
the three said the eu should keep its goal of being the most competitive and dynamic economy on earth by 2010 . chancellor gerhard schröder said the three had similar goals on investing in research , universities and innovation .
the chancellor , whose country is one of many european countries experiencing a brain drain of good scientists to the u.s. , talked about investing in the " fields of the future . " similar problems , similar solutions " we saw that there was a large amount of similarity in the types of problems we had , " said schröder . schröder and his social democratic green party coalition are experiencing plumetting popularity rates as a result of economic reforms that seek to dismantle the country 's generous welfare system and rejig the labor market . chirac and blair are undergoing similar fights in their own countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- l . -rrb- and french president jacques chirac both france and germany have been violators of the european union 's economic growth and stability pact , which sets public debt limits in eu member states .
by refusing to trim public spending to keep their social systems afloat during sluggish economic growth , both governments ran afoul of eu monetary officials , who sought legal action . " we need to change the system , without destroying it , " said schröder .
" only if we change it , can we keep it and can we afford it . " " big three " meeting no cause for concern the three leaders brushed back criticism that they were aiming to create an eu triumvirate that would block smaller member states .
blair pointed to the joint defense plan agreed on by the three countries last week and the efforts by german , french and british diplomats to curb iran 's nuclear ambitions as achievements that were good for all of europe . " if these three countries , which comprise almost half of the population in europe … work on clear agreements , then that is a good thing for our three countries but also for europe and there should n't be any concerns about exclusivity , " blair said . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's budding ménage à trois the leaders of britain , france and germany meet in berlin on wednesday to push for further european economic cooperation .

substitute carsten ramelow snatched victory from the jaws of a mediocre stalemate in croatia on wednesday night as germany won 2-1 in the team 's latest preparation match for the european championships this summer . it was business as usual for the german national soccer team on wednesday night .
despite an unconvincing performance against opposition which would normally have been brushed aside by a team of germany 's standing , rudi völler 's men labored to victory once more with a last minute 2-1 win over croatia in split . with their reputation as a football power waning after weak displays against lithuania , iceland and scotland in qualifying for the european championships in portugal , germany was looking to dispatch the opposition in style with the soccer showpiece looming ahead in june . the croatians , however , have proved to germany in the past that they are no pushovers , and it was they who started the better in this friendly warm-up game for euro 2004 . donning his countrymen 's jersey , bayern munich defender robert kovac almost put the home side ahead on 15 minutes when he directed a corner kick goalwards with a strong headed attempt but was thwarted by germany 's 20-year-old debutant philipp lahm who cleared the effort off the line much to the dismay of the croatian crowd .
stuttgart 's kuranyi proves elusive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kevin kuranyi .
the three-time world cup winners had to wait another quarter of an hour before they first really threatened stipe pletikosa in the croatian goal .
vfb stuttgart 's kevin kuranyi -lrb- photo -rrb- slipped through the dawdling defenders to meet a looping cross but sent his header wide of the far post .
in fact , it was croatia 's wobbly defence - important for euro 2004 group opponents england , france and switzerland - which led to their downfall .
after pegging the germans back for most of the first half , another kuranyi surge exposed croatia 's poor marking and with the croatian rearguard standing motionless , miroslav klose somehow forced his cross home with his knee on 34 minutes .

germany missed world cup hero michael ballack , who was ruled out late with bronchitis , and the absense of the bayern munich playmaker was sorely felt as the second half opened with the germans in uninspiring form .
coach völler had made several forced changes in his team selection before the game , reshuffling his midfield around the returning liverpool midfielder dietmar hamann and the unsettled dortmunder torsten frings .
again it was croatia and kovac who provided the first real chance of the second period .
with the uncertain looking oliver kahn once more hesitant in goal , kovac whipped in a free kick which skipped off the turf , causing germany 's number one to spill the shot .
luckily for the german captain there were no waiting croatian attackers to tap the loose ball into the empty net .
kuranyi , proving to be germany 's most lively player , then missed his second glorious chance of the game when he poked an effort through pletikosa ' legs only to see the ball roll agonisingly wide of the far post .
chances go begging for croatia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn was floored again .
as the game ebbed and flowed , croatia once again found their rhythm and with 70 minutes on the clock , substitute nino bule should have equalized when it was germany 's defenders ' turn to be caught asleep .
with only kahn to beat , bule considered his options for too long before tamely passing the ball into the waiting goalkeeper 's arms .
the croatians should have been level minutes later when they somehow managed to miss guilt-edged chances from two huge goalmouth scrambles in the closing stages of the match .
but with four minutes remaining , mato neretljak succeeded where oliver kahn had failed by getting on the end of a looping corner and heading past the flapping keeper .

substitute carsten ramelow snatched victory from the jaws of a mediocre stalemate in croatia on wednesday night as germany won 2-1 in the team 's latest preparation match for the european championships this summer . it was business as usual for the german national soccer team on wednesday night .
despite an unconvincing performance against opposition which would normally have been brushed aside by a team of germany 's standing , rudi völler 's men labored to victory once more with a last minute 2-1 win over croatia in split . with their reputation as a football power waning after weak displays against lithuania , iceland and scotland in qualifying for the european championships in portugal , germany was looking to dispatch the opposition in style with the soccer showpiece looming ahead in june . the croatians , however , have proved to germany in the past that they are no pushovers , and it was they who started the better in this friendly warm-up game for euro 2004 . donning his countrymen 's jersey , bayern munich defender robert kovac almost put the home side ahead on 15 minutes when he directed a corner kick goalwards with a strong headed attempt but was thwarted by germany 's 20-year-old debutant philipp lahm who cleared the effort off the line much to the dismay of the croatian crowd .
stuttgart 's kuranyi proves elusive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kevin kuranyi .
the three-time world cup winners had to wait another quarter of an hour before they first really threatened stipe pletikosa in the croatian goal .
vfb stuttgart 's kevin kuranyi -lrb- photo -rrb- slipped through the dawdling defenders to meet a looping cross but sent his header wide of the far post .
in fact , it was croatia 's wobbly defence - important for euro 2004 group opponents england , france and switzerland - which led to their downfall .
after pegging the germans back for most of the first half , another kuranyi surge exposed croatia 's poor marking and with the croatian rearguard standing motionless , miroslav klose somehow forced his cross home with his knee on 34 minutes .
makeshift midfield charged with stabilization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's coach rudi völler .
germany missed world cup hero michael ballack , who was ruled out late with bronchitis , and the absense of the bayern munich playmaker was sorely felt as the second half opened with the germans in uninspiring form .
coach völler had made several forced changes in his team selection before the game , reshuffling his midfield around the returning liverpool midfielder dietmar hamann and the unsettled dortmunder torsten frings .
again it was croatia and kovac who provided the first real chance of the second period .
with the uncertain looking oliver kahn once more hesitant in goal , kovac whipped in a free kick which skipped off the turf , causing germany 's number one to spill the shot .

he also said he would urge eu interior affairs and justice ministers to explore law enforcement measures and " pre-emptive acition in the field of education . "
" we want concrete results , " prodi told the gathering of jewish groups thursday .
the italian commission president comments came after months in which the eu came under heavy criticism for standing by amid a rising wave of anti-semitism in europe and the body 's perceived anti-israeli sentiment .
a " european disease " jewish leaders said the eu should monitor anti-jewish incidents more strictly , penalize the perpetrators of the violence more harshly and educate young europeans about the legacy of centuries of persecution on their continent .
though anti-semitism exists in many places in the world , it is also a distinctly " european disease , " nobel-prize winner and holocaust survivor eli wiesel told the gathering .
" the monster is here with us one more time , " said cobi benatoff , president of the european jewish congress . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the jewish community look at fire damages to a synagogue in marseille , france on april 1 , 2002 .
jewish european leaders criticized eu leaders of looking on indifferently as the number of attacks against against jews and desecration of jewish sites rose in recent years . youths from the large communities of arab immigrants in france , belgium and other countries are largely blamed for the attacks .
" the challenge of anti-semitism exists as long as schools , synagogues and kindergartens are threatened , " german foreign minister joschka fischer said .
anti-semitic not to be confused with anti-israeli fischer , however , joined other european officials in drawing a distinct line between criticism of jews and criticism of israel .
while praising israeli prime minister ariel sharon 's recent decision to pull out of the gaza strip , fischer said it should also be possible to criticize the israeli government without being labeled anti-semitic .
prodi also criticized statements made by people like the united states envoy to the eu that draw lines between the levels of anti-semitism today and in the 1930s .
" europe today is not the europe of the 1930s and 1940s and to say that would be quite wrong - we must not insult the memory of the shoah -lrb- hebrew for holocaust -rrb- by equating what is happening today ... with what happened then , " he said , according to reuters .
reports criticized the eu nevertheless has a lot of work to do , according to jewish leaders .
the new york-based world jewish congress called an eu poll last year in which israel topped a list of nations seen as threatening world peace as " dangerously inflammatory . "
the european jewish congress also criticized the eu 's european monitoring center on racism and xenophobia foir witholding a report last year that blamed the rise in anti-semitic attacks on right-wing extremists or young muslims " mostly of arab descent . "
the jewish group said the eu had suppressed the report because it linked arab immigrants to anti-semitic violence in europe .
the monitoring center , however , said it had withheld the report because it was of " poor quality and lacking in empirical evidence .

he also said he would urge eu interior affairs and justice ministers to explore law enforcement measures and " pre-emptive acition in the field of education . "
" we want concrete results , " prodi told the gathering of jewish groups thursday .
the italian commission president comments came after months in which the eu came under heavy criticism for standing by amid a rising wave of anti-semitism in europe and the body 's perceived anti-israeli sentiment .
a " european disease " jewish leaders said the eu should monitor anti-jewish incidents more strictly , penalize the perpetrators of the violence more harshly and educate young europeans about the legacy of centuries of persecution on their continent .
though anti-semitism exists in many places in the world , it is also a distinctly " european disease , " nobel-prize winner and holocaust survivor eli wiesel told the gathering .

jewish european leaders criticized eu leaders of looking on indifferently as the number of attacks against against jews and desecration of jewish sites rose in recent years . youths from the large communities of arab immigrants in france , belgium and other countries are largely blamed for the attacks .
" the challenge of anti-semitism exists as long as schools , synagogues and kindergartens are threatened , " german foreign minister joschka fischer said .
anti-semitic not to be confused with anti-israeli fischer , however , joined other european officials in drawing a distinct line between criticism of jews and criticism of israel .
while praising israeli prime minister ariel sharon 's recent decision to pull out of the gaza strip , fischer said it should also be possible to criticize the israeli government without being labeled anti-semitic .
prodi also criticized statements made by people like the united states envoy to the eu that draw lines between the levels of anti-semitism today and in the 1930s .
" europe today is not the europe of the 1930s and 1940s and to say that would be quite wrong - we must not insult the memory of the shoah -lrb- hebrew for holocaust -rrb- by equating what is happening today ... with what happened then , " he said , according to reuters .
reports criticized the eu nevertheless has a lot of work to do , according to jewish leaders .
the new york-based world jewish congress called an eu poll last year in which israel topped a list of nations seen as threatening world peace as " dangerously inflammatory . "
the european jewish congress also criticized the eu 's european monitoring center on racism and xenophobia foir witholding a report last year that blamed the rise in anti-semitic attacks on right-wing extremists or young muslims " mostly of arab descent . "
the jewish group said the eu had suppressed the report because it linked arab immigrants to anti-semitic violence in europe .

german finance minister hans eichel created an uproar after proposing a law that would send the labor police after domestic staff working illegally .
he 's since backed off . if eichel had his way , people who employed a cleaning lady or babysitter in germany could possibly be made into outlaws . as part of a tough government initiative to tackle germany 's booming illegal jobs market , eichel wanted to target all illegal workers and their employers .
under his bill proposal , domestic help , from cleaners to part-time tutors would be subject to the same constraints and rules as construction workers , office staff and employees in the commercial sector .
that meant that they could face prosecution under german labor laws if they were not registered workers , much in the same way that other workers such as builders , carpenters and technicians were .

people working in the part-time domestic services sector are now not required to register for so-called " mini-jobs .

labor police to look elsewhere an initiative put forward by the finance ministry had mobilized a force of 2,000 customs officers to track down and investigate cleaning ladies and other domestic staff who were working in the so-called shadow economy . a new ministry task force composed of 7,000 officers has been set up to investigate illegal workers and their employers .
their search will now be limited to the restaurant , construction , gaming and tourism industry . the police trade union and metalworkers union ig metall has criticized the new rules , claiming that illegal is illegal and the private sector should be monitored and regulated just as any other .

the agency administering the files of the former east german secret police has uncovered a little-known chapter in the history of germany 's immigrant guest workers : some served as spies for the stasi . " kemal " had a good knowledge of german and even though he was n't a member of any political party , he was sympathetic to socialist ideals . in the spring of 1981 , he needed help .
his residency permit for west berlin was about to expire and he was on the verge of getting deported to turkey .
these circumstances made kemal an attractive candidate for the east german secret police , or stasi , which promptly took advantage of the situation . " they arranged a german wife for him and allowed her to move to west berlin .
as a guest worker with a german wife , he was then able to stay in west berlin , " birthler authority researcher georg herbstritt told deutsche welle . herbstritt said this was a typical method used by the stasi to recruit foreigners living in west germany , where they served as low-level spies for the east .
the birthler authority estimates that five percent of the stasi 's so-called " unofficial collaborators " during the 1980s were foreigners .
marriage bait in some cases , stasi officials would hook new recruits by threatening to bust them for infractions of east german laws during visits - like crossing the border back to west germany too late at night or for exchanging money on the black market or even if they had inadvertently taken a snapshot of a stasi building . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the old east german sign points the way in for visitors to the tränenpalast - " palace of tears " - in the early 1990s .
the former border crossing between east and west berlin is now a venue for concerts and comedy acts .
many of the turkish men were assigned as so-called " fly catchers " : they were supposed to inform the stasi about east german women who were trying to marry foreigners in order to leave east germany .
more than 6,000 west berlin turks made day trips to the other side of the berlin wall during the 1980s , and they were popular targets for east german women looking for a better life . despite its eagerness to work with foreigners , the stasi often held a prejudicial view of them .
in the 1970s , then east german state security minister erich mielke expressed his fear that foreigners coming in from west berlin included " many anti-social and criminal " types who could pose a threat to security during their visits there . officials feared airplane hijackings , attacks against embassies and even drug smuggling .
the tensions at the time between turkish and other foreign groups in west berlin fuelled those emotions .
because turks were - and still are - the largest minority group in germany , they made up the majority of the stasi 's foreign collaborators .
little known though there has been little public discussion over the foreigners working for the stasi , there have been some low-profile court cases .
but most of the accused got off lightly without anyone having to sit out a jail sentence , herbstritt said . that 's because few foreigners serving as top spies .
non-germans just did n't have the access .
nor did they have the opportunity to make a career in politics or the military .
they often came as simple laborers to germany and the stasi deployed them where they could be useful . but they have n't escaped the notice of history , with herbstritt now compiling research on this unplumbed aspect of germany 's cold war years . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stasi allegations dog leipzig olympic bid the stasi scandal which has threatened leipzig ’ s olympic bid has not abated despite the resignation of two leading members of the german committee .

eurocrats in brussels are fed up with the many myths peddled by the media about the european union .
a european commission website sets out to put the record straight . last year , british tabloid the daily mail informed its readers that the eu was planning to ban corgis .
" certain breeds of the queen 's favorite dog could be outlawed under a controversial eu convention being considered by ministers , " it revealed . the shock revelation which outraged animal lovers across the country and fuelled anti-european sentiment in fact had nothing to do with the eu .
the story originated with a committee of animal protection experts which drew up a european convention for the protection of pet animals designed to improve the welfare of household pets . whatever .
readers were all too willing to believe the eu was up to its usual nonsense . this sort of scare-mongering plays right into the hands of euroskeptics - as brussels is all too aware .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.02.2004 milosevic prosecution closes arguments this week großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no longer the face of serbia , milosevic has been in a dutch cell for more than two years .
prosecutors at the international war crimes tribunal will wrap up their case against slobodan milosevic in the next few days .
the former serb leader plans a defense strategy that could extend the trial until 2006 . on most days , slobodan milosevic enters the court room in his customary blue suit .
with the light disinterested gaze of a 61-year-old man with nothing left to lose , he peers back and forth between witnesses testifying on the stand .
for the past two years , the former president of serbia and yugoslavia has stood in the dock of the international war crimes tribunal in the hague .
milosevic , whose case has been modified several times , is charged with 60 war crimes including genocide in bosnia-herzegovina and crimes against humanity in croatia and kosovo .
he is accused in the killings of tens of thousands and the displacement of thousands of people from their homes in the last decade during wars that ravaged the former yugoslavia .
if convicted , he could face a life sentence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.n. war crimes prosecutor carla del ponte .
chief prosecutor carla del ponte -lrb- photo -rrb- and her team are expected to wrap up their case against the ex-dictator in the next week .
the closing arguments will mark the end of the first part of the trial .
milosevic , who has chosen to defend himself , and the two attorneys and legal aide helping him can then prepare a defense strategy and a list of witnesses .
but first , milosevic has the option of requesting an audit of the prosecution 's case .
the three-judge panel then can shoot down arguments and charges for which there is insufficient evidence .
prosecutor 's tough case the process could be damaging for del ponte , who has already been criticized for being too headstrong and not allowing the judges to make their mark on the case .
the shakiest part is believed to be the genocide charge , a weakness even del ponte has conceded .
no one has been able to prove in court that milosevic himself ordered the slaughter of more than 7,000 bosnian muslims in srebrenica in 1995 .
philipp morillon , the former united nations commander in bosnia , who has testified about the massacre , has even partially defended milosevic , saying he had headed off the first possible attack on srebrenica ’ s muslims .
the war crimes charges stemming from croatia and bosnia could also prove problematic .
the prosecution has built the charges on the premise that milosevic was operating a “ criminal organization ” with the goal of building a “ great serbia ” that stretched into parts of croatia and bosnia .
but legal expert sluiter says prosecutors have failed to turn up written evidence .
del ponte has also had trouble finding cooperative witnesses to prove the case against milosevic .
should be enough for long prison term international law expert gören sluiter warns not to place too much blame on del ponte herself .
sluiter said the judges have also made mistakes by failing to set time limits for prosecutors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slobodan milosevic enters the courtroom .
" they have done that to a certain degree ... but giving the prosecutors two years to present the case is extremely long and does not force the prosecutor to be more selective , " sluiter told dw-world .
the prosecution team has managed to present some very effective witnesses , like former nato generals wesley clark and klaus naumann , who have provided would could be deeply incriminating evidence against milosevic .
the generals ' testimony could be especially useful in regard to the crimes against humanity charges in kosovo , sluiter said .
testimony combined with information out of police and army archives in belgrade should be enough to convict the former serb leader and put him behind bars for a long time .
trial could last until 2006 but first milosevic will have the opportunity to defend himself against these charges .

prosecutors at the international war crimes tribunal will wrap up their case against slobodan milosevic in the next few days .
the former serb leader plans a defense strategy that could extend the trial until 2006 . on most days , slobodan milosevic enters the court room in his customary blue suit .
with the light disinterested gaze of a 61-year-old man with nothing left to lose , he peers back and forth between witnesses testifying on the stand .
for the past two years , the former president of serbia and yugoslavia has stood in the dock of the international war crimes tribunal in the hague .
milosevic , whose case has been modified several times , is charged with 60 war crimes including genocide in bosnia-herzegovina and crimes against humanity in croatia and kosovo .
he is accused in the killings of tens of thousands and the displacement of thousands of people from their homes in the last decade during wars that ravaged the former yugoslavia .
if convicted , he could face a life sentence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.n. war crimes prosecutor carla del ponte .
chief prosecutor carla del ponte -lrb- photo -rrb- and her team are expected to wrap up their case against the ex-dictator in the next week .
the closing arguments will mark the end of the first part of the trial .
milosevic , who has chosen to defend himself , and the two attorneys and legal aide helping him can then prepare a defense strategy and a list of witnesses .
but first , milosevic has the option of requesting an audit of the prosecution 's case .
the three-judge panel then can shoot down arguments and charges for which there is insufficient evidence .
prosecutor 's tough case the process could be damaging for del ponte , who has already been criticized for being too headstrong and not allowing the judges to make their mark on the case .
the shakiest part is believed to be the genocide charge , a weakness even del ponte has conceded .
no one has been able to prove in court that milosevic himself ordered the slaughter of more than 7,000 bosnian muslims in srebrenica in 1995 .
philipp morillon , the former united nations commander in bosnia , who has testified about the massacre , has even partially defended milosevic , saying he had headed off the first possible attack on srebrenica ’ s muslims .
the war crimes charges stemming from croatia and bosnia could also prove problematic .
the prosecution has built the charges on the premise that milosevic was operating a “ criminal organization ” with the goal of building a “ great serbia ” that stretched into parts of croatia and bosnia .
but legal expert sluiter says prosecutors have failed to turn up written evidence .
del ponte has also had trouble finding cooperative witnesses to prove the case against milosevic .
should be enough for long prison term international law expert gören sluiter warns not to place too much blame on del ponte herself .
sluiter said the judges have also made mistakes by failing to set time limits for prosecutors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slobodan milosevic enters the courtroom .
" they have done that to a certain degree ... but giving the prosecutors two years to present the case is extremely long and does not force the prosecutor to be more selective , " sluiter told dw-world .
the prosecution team has managed to present some very effective witnesses , like former nato generals wesley clark and klaus naumann , who have provided would could be deeply incriminating evidence against milosevic .
the generals ' testimony could be especially useful in regard to the crimes against humanity charges in kosovo , sluiter said .
testimony combined with information out of police and army archives in belgrade should be enough to convict the former serb leader and put him behind bars for a long time .
trial could last until 2006 but first milosevic will have the opportunity to defend himself against these charges .
legal observers expect his defense to take as much time and include as many witnesses as del ponte ’ s prosecution .

the leaders of britain , france and germany meet in berlin on wednesday to push for further european economic cooperation .
but others in the eu fear the trio are trying to run europe . a year after the men were at odds over the war in iraq , the leaders of europe 's big three have been working hard at rapprochement these days .
the most visible sign of that new spirit has been an agreement on a common european defense policy reached last december . " that 's an outstanding event that can not be overestimated , " german chancellor schröder told reporters at the time .
this common defense policy and the recent announcement to establish rapid response forces have laid the foundation for an eu " core group . " british premier tony blair might dispute the existence of such a trilateral eu directorate .
but fearing to be side-stepped in an expanded european union , blair has effectively joined germany and france as the bloc 's driving force .
" i strongly believe that britain should play a leading role in the center of europe and not stand aside , " he said . many of the union 's smaller member states are sceptical about the increased trilateral cooperation .
blair does n't think that 's a problem though : the british leader sees himself as the spokesman for new members , who are pro-british and pro-american , in his opinion .
" many states that are now entering the union share the british vision for europe , " he said . moving ahead after constitution talks fail failure to reach a compromise on a proposed eu constitution last december prompted schröder and french president jacques chirac to moot the possibility of turning the eu 's franco-german-led engine into a group of pioneers willing to push ahead with further unification . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro monument is illuminated in front of the european central bank in frankfurt .
" this means that these countries will move ahead , just as has already happened with the euro or the schengen agreement , " chirac said , referring to the abolishment of border controls between most eu countries . although belgium , hungary , the czech republic and greece have expressed interest in joining a leading group , italy , spain and poland oppose making distinctions within the bloc . " europe does n't need a directorate , that would only mess things up , " italian premier silvio berlusconi said on tuesday .
" that 's my opinion , which is shared by other european states except the three in question . " a europe of different speeds schröder , on the other hand , believes that a europe of different speeds will become inevitable should the negotiations over an eu constitution fail for good .
" germany is willing to enter what 's called closer cooperation with france , britain and other eu members , " the chancellor said .
" there 's no question about it . " schröder , who has worked closely with the conservative chirac , is glad to see blair , a fellow social democrat , come aboard .
and according to schröder , the only way to ensure an effective foreign and security policy for the union is to have britain in a leading group . driving or deciding europe 's future unification ? back in 1998 , when joschka fischer took on the job of german foreign minister , he still warned against making britain a part of the franco-german eu engine : britain had n't accepted the eu 's common currency and was opposed to closer cooperation , fischer explained at the time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu family is getting a lot bigger in may .
but now , the troika might push along the unwieldy union with 25 member states and guarantee desperately needed leadership .
that 's the optimistic view .
pessimists see things differently .
first , france and germany suspended the euro zone 's stability pact , together with britain they will now try to affix their seal on the union 's foreign and economic policy , they say . indeed , blair , chirac and schröder plan to write a critical letter to the european commission on wednesday , demanding significant changes to the bloc 's investment program , which is scheduled for adoption at a summit at the end of march . bernd riegert -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair and schröder deny plans for " triumvirate " with chirac german chancellor gerhard schröder and british prime minister tony blair met in berlin on thursday ahead of a three-way summit with france next week .

the leaders of britain , france and germany meet in berlin on wednesday to push for further european economic cooperation .
but others in the eu fear the trio are trying to run europe . a year after the men were at odds over the war in iraq , the leaders of europe 's big three have been working hard at rapprochement these days .
the most visible sign of that new spirit has been an agreement on a common european defense policy reached last december . " that 's an outstanding event that can not be overestimated , " german chancellor schröder told reporters at the time .
this common defense policy and the recent announcement to establish rapid response forces have laid the foundation for an eu " core group . " british premier tony blair might dispute the existence of such a trilateral eu directorate .
but fearing to be side-stepped in an expanded european union , blair has effectively joined germany and france as the bloc 's driving force .
" i strongly believe that britain should play a leading role in the center of europe and not stand aside , " he said . many of the union 's smaller member states are sceptical about the increased trilateral cooperation .
blair does n't think that 's a problem though : the british leader sees himself as the spokesman for new members , who are pro-british and pro-american , in his opinion .
" many states that are now entering the union share the british vision for europe , " he said . moving ahead after constitution talks fail failure to reach a compromise on a proposed eu constitution last december prompted schröder and french president jacques chirac to moot the possibility of turning the eu 's franco-german-led engine into a group of pioneers willing to push ahead with further unification . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro monument is illuminated in front of the european central bank in frankfurt .

eurocrats in brussels are fed up with the many myths peddled by the media about the european union .
a european commission website sets out to put the record straight . last year , british tabloid the daily mail informed its readers that the eu was planning to ban corgis .
" certain breeds of the queen 's favorite dog could be outlawed under a controversial eu convention being considered by ministers , " it revealed . the shock revelation which outraged animal lovers across the country and fuelled anti-european sentiment in fact had nothing to do with the eu .
the story originated with a committee of animal protection experts which drew up a european convention for the protection of pet animals designed to improve the welfare of household pets . whatever .
readers were all too willing to believe the eu was up to its usual nonsense . this sort of scare-mongering plays right into the hands of euroskeptics - as brussels is all too aware .
the european commission now features on its website a compilation of popular misconceptions ranging from the sublime to the ridiculous , giving the inside story , laying out the facts and debunking the myths . media-fuelled hostility a lot of europhiles feel the press coverage contributes to widespread bewilderment and hostility towards europe , feeding a popular attitude that the eu is a dangerous behemoth deliberately blinding its citizens with layers of impenetrable bureaucracy and ludicrous laws . admittedly , brussels is an easy target .
a tangle of competing institutions and different agendas , eu bodies are notorious for excessive red tape , corruption scandals and mystifying rules and regulations .
it all contributes to a culture of confusion that leaves the public willing to believe just about anything . according to michael mann from the european commission press office , the british media is a main offender , with the tabloids all trying to outdo one another with sensational stories . mann is now busy collecting myths and countering them with facts .
in his opinion , the problem is that the level of debate about europe is n't as high as it should be . a reflection of national reservations the misunderstandings and prejudices come in all shapes and sizes .
maintaining that eu officials are grossly overpaid is one thing - but the idea that male members of staff are reimbursed for the medical costs of viagra pills is slightly less well-founded . horror stories from brussels are part of the media 's daily diet , but reveal an astonishing gullibility on the part of many europeans .
on the euro-myth silly scale , old favorites such as greengrocers having to conform to rules covering size , length , color and texture of fruit and vegetables are less believable than proposals for a new european flag , but the sheer quantity of misapprehensions goes to show how little the public understands the workings of the european union .
viola eggert from the european commission 's berlin office attributes the problem to the commission 's zeal for regulations , saying many myths about the eu popular in germany " are based on over-regulation and the idea that the eu tells its citizens what they 're allowed to do , and has too big an influence on their lives . "
so although gullibility may be to blame for many of the myths , the volume of misinformation appears to reflect strong national reservations about the sort of things the european commission would like to do if left to its own devices .
anti-eu groups are all too willing to twist the facts about brussels ' law-making , but the eu would do well to conclude it should , in future , explain itself better .
after all , brussels does have one of the most extensive press corps in the world .
but as michael mann points out , brussels can only do so much - and the rest is up to national governments .
" they have to start serious discussions with the public about what europe is and why it 's a good thing , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links get the facts straight european commission press office webpage 9797 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

the agency administering the files of the former east german secret police has uncovered a little-known chapter in the history of germany 's immigrant guest workers : some served as spies for the stasi . " kemal " had a good knowledge of german and even though he was n't a member of any political party , he was sympathetic to socialist ideals . in the spring of 1981 , he needed help .
his residency permit for west berlin was about to expire and he was on the verge of getting deported to turkey .
these circumstances made kemal an attractive candidate for the east german secret police , or stasi , which promptly took advantage of the situation . " they arranged a german wife for him and allowed her to move to west berlin .
as a guest worker with a german wife , he was then able to stay in west berlin , " birthler authority researcher georg herbstritt told deutsche welle . herbstritt said this was a typical method used by the stasi to recruit foreigners living in west germany , where they served as low-level spies for the east .
the birthler authority estimates that five percent of the stasi 's so-called " unofficial collaborators " during the 1980s were foreigners .
marriage bait in some cases , stasi officials would hook new recruits by threatening to bust them for infractions of east german laws during visits - like crossing the border back to west germany too late at night or for exchanging money on the black market or even if they had inadvertently taken a snapshot of a stasi building . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the old east german sign points the way in for visitors to the tränenpalast - " palace of tears " - in the early 1990s .
the former border crossing between east and west berlin is now a venue for concerts and comedy acts .
many of the turkish men were assigned as so-called " fly catchers " : they were supposed to inform the stasi about east german women who were trying to marry foreigners in order to leave east germany .
more than 6,000 west berlin turks made day trips to the other side of the berlin wall during the 1980s , and they were popular targets for east german women looking for a better life . despite its eagerness to work with foreigners , the stasi often held a prejudicial view of them .
in the 1970s , then east german state security minister erich mielke expressed his fear that foreigners coming in from west berlin included " many anti-social and criminal " types who could pose a threat to security during their visits there . officials feared airplane hijackings , attacks against embassies and even drug smuggling .
the tensions at the time between turkish and other foreign groups in west berlin fuelled those emotions .
because turks were - and still are - the largest minority group in germany , they made up the majority of the stasi 's foreign collaborators .
little known though there has been little public discussion over the foreigners working for the stasi , there have been some low-profile court cases .

more than 6,000 west berlin turks made day trips to the other side of the berlin wall during the 1980s , and they were popular targets for east german women looking for a better life . despite its eagerness to work with foreigners , the stasi often held a prejudicial view of them .
in the 1970s , then east german state security minister erich mielke expressed his fear that foreigners coming in from west berlin included " many anti-social and criminal " types who could pose a threat to security during their visits there . officials feared airplane hijackings , attacks against embassies and even drug smuggling .

" certain breeds of the queen 's favorite dog could be outlawed under a controversial eu convention being considered by ministers , " it revealed . the shock revelation which outraged animal lovers across the country and fuelled anti-european sentiment in fact had nothing to do with the eu .

readers were all too willing to believe the eu was up to its usual nonsense . this sort of scare-mongering plays right into the hands of euroskeptics - as brussels is all too aware .
the european commission now features on its website a compilation of popular misconceptions ranging from the sublime to the ridiculous , giving the inside story , laying out the facts and debunking the myths . media-fuelled hostility a lot of europhiles feel the press coverage contributes to widespread bewilderment and hostility towards europe , feeding a popular attitude that the eu is a dangerous behemoth deliberately blinding its citizens with layers of impenetrable bureaucracy and ludicrous laws . admittedly , brussels is an easy target .
a tangle of competing institutions and different agendas , eu bodies are notorious for excessive red tape , corruption scandals and mystifying rules and regulations .
it all contributes to a culture of confusion that leaves the public willing to believe just about anything . according to michael mann from the european commission press office , the british media is a main offender , with the tabloids all trying to outdo one another with sensational stories . mann is now busy collecting myths and countering them with facts .
in his opinion , the problem is that the level of debate about europe is n't as high as it should be . a reflection of national reservations the misunderstandings and prejudices come in all shapes and sizes .
maintaining that eu officials are grossly overpaid is one thing - but the idea that male members of staff are reimbursed for the medical costs of viagra pills is slightly less well-founded . horror stories from brussels are part of the media 's daily diet , but reveal an astonishing gullibility on the part of many europeans .
on the euro-myth silly scale , old favorites such as greengrocers having to conform to rules covering size , length , color and texture of fruit and vegetables are less believable than proposals for a new european flag , but the sheer quantity of misapprehensions goes to show how little the public understands the workings of the european union .
viola eggert from the european commission 's berlin office attributes the problem to the commission 's zeal for regulations , saying many myths about the eu popular in germany " are based on over-regulation and the idea that the eu tells its citizens what they 're allowed to do , and has too big an influence on their lives .

a european commission website sets out to put the record straight . last year , british tabloid the daily mail informed its readers that the eu was planning to ban corgis .
" certain breeds of the queen 's favorite dog could be outlawed under a controversial eu convention being considered by ministers , " it revealed . the shock revelation which outraged animal lovers across the country and fuelled anti-european sentiment in fact had nothing to do with the eu .
the story originated with a committee of animal protection experts which drew up a european convention for the protection of pet animals designed to improve the welfare of household pets . whatever .
readers were all too willing to believe the eu was up to its usual nonsense . this sort of scare-mongering plays right into the hands of euroskeptics - as brussels is all too aware .
the european commission now features on its website a compilation of popular misconceptions ranging from the sublime to the ridiculous , giving the inside story , laying out the facts and debunking the myths . media-fuelled hostility a lot of europhiles feel the press coverage contributes to widespread bewilderment and hostility towards europe , feeding a popular attitude that the eu is a dangerous behemoth deliberately blinding its citizens with layers of impenetrable bureaucracy and ludicrous laws . admittedly , brussels is an easy target .
a tangle of competing institutions and different agendas , eu bodies are notorious for excessive red tape , corruption scandals and mystifying rules and regulations .

in his opinion , the problem is that the level of debate about europe is n't as high as it should be . a reflection of national reservations the misunderstandings and prejudices come in all shapes and sizes .
maintaining that eu officials are grossly overpaid is one thing - but the idea that male members of staff are reimbursed for the medical costs of viagra pills is slightly less well-founded . horror stories from brussels are part of the media 's daily diet , but reveal an astonishing gullibility on the part of many europeans .
on the euro-myth silly scale , old favorites such as greengrocers having to conform to rules covering size , length , color and texture of fruit and vegetables are less believable than proposals for a new european flag , but the sheer quantity of misapprehensions goes to show how little the public understands the workings of the european union .

prosecutors at the international war crimes tribunal will wrap up their case against slobodan milosevic in the next few days .
the former serb leader plans a defense strategy that could extend the trial until 2006 . on most days , slobodan milosevic enters the court room in his customary blue suit .
with the light disinterested gaze of a 61-year-old man with nothing left to lose , he peers back and forth between witnesses testifying on the stand .
for the past two years , the former president of serbia and yugoslavia has stood in the dock of the international war crimes tribunal in the hague .
milosevic , whose case has been modified several times , is charged with 60 war crimes including genocide in bosnia-herzegovina and crimes against humanity in croatia and kosovo .
he is accused in the killings of tens of thousands and the displacement of thousands of people from their homes in the last decade during wars that ravaged the former yugoslavia .
if convicted , he could face a life sentence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.n. war crimes prosecutor carla del ponte .
chief prosecutor carla del ponte -lrb- photo -rrb- and her team are expected to wrap up their case against the ex-dictator in the next week .
the closing arguments will mark the end of the first part of the trial .
milosevic , who has chosen to defend himself , and the two attorneys and legal aide helping him can then prepare a defense strategy and a list of witnesses .
but first , milosevic has the option of requesting an audit of the prosecution 's case .
the three-judge panel then can shoot down arguments and charges for which there is insufficient evidence .
prosecutor 's tough case the process could be damaging for del ponte , who has already been criticized for being too headstrong and not allowing the judges to make their mark on the case .
the shakiest part is believed to be the genocide charge , a weakness even del ponte has conceded .
no one has been able to prove in court that milosevic himself ordered the slaughter of more than 7,000 bosnian muslims in srebrenica in 1995 .
philipp morillon , the former united nations commander in bosnia , who has testified about the massacre , has even partially defended milosevic , saying he had headed off the first possible attack on srebrenica ’ s muslims .
the war crimes charges stemming from croatia and bosnia could also prove problematic .
the prosecution has built the charges on the premise that milosevic was operating a “ criminal organization ” with the goal of building a “ great serbia ” that stretched into parts of croatia and bosnia .
but legal expert sluiter says prosecutors have failed to turn up written evidence .
del ponte has also had trouble finding cooperative witnesses to prove the case against milosevic .
should be enough for long prison term international law expert gören sluiter warns not to place too much blame on del ponte herself .
sluiter said the judges have also made mistakes by failing to set time limits for prosecutors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slobodan milosevic enters the courtroom .
" they have done that to a certain degree ... but giving the prosecutors two years to present the case is extremely long and does not force the prosecutor to be more selective , " sluiter told dw-world .
the prosecution team has managed to present some very effective witnesses , like former nato generals wesley clark and klaus naumann , who have provided would could be deeply incriminating evidence against milosevic .
the generals ' testimony could be especially useful in regard to the crimes against humanity charges in kosovo , sluiter said .
testimony combined with information out of police and army archives in belgrade should be enough to convict the former serb leader and put him behind bars for a long time .
trial could last until 2006 but first milosevic will have the opportunity to defend himself against these charges .
legal observers expect his defense to take as much time and include as many witnesses as del ponte ’ s prosecution .
after a first ruling in the case , an appeals process is anticipated , with no final decision expected before the end of 2006 .
whether milosevic is convicted or not , the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia will continue to play an important role in the truth and reconciliation process of the balkans , according to sluiter .
“ one should also not exaggerate the importance of the milosevic trial .
it comes at a time when the tribunal has already been functioning for a number of years and over those years they have dealt with all of these incidents , " he said .
" so i think as to the effects of the case and the responsibilities , i think the groundwork has already been done and even without the milosevic trial the is of significant importance for the history of the balkans . ” dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ten years on : the fight for justice in the balkans continues the u.n. tribunal for war crimes in the former yugoslavia marks its ten-year anniversary this week , but it 's business as usual in the hague as the trials of those accused of atrocities in the balkan wars continue .

the war crimes charges stemming from croatia and bosnia could also prove problematic .
the prosecution has built the charges on the premise that milosevic was operating a “ criminal organization ” with the goal of building a “ great serbia ” that stretched into parts of croatia and bosnia .
but legal expert sluiter says prosecutors have failed to turn up written evidence .
del ponte has also had trouble finding cooperative witnesses to prove the case against milosevic .

" they have done that to a certain degree ... but giving the prosecutors two years to present the case is extremely long and does not force the prosecutor to be more selective , " sluiter told dw-world .
the prosecution team has managed to present some very effective witnesses , like former nato generals wesley clark and klaus naumann , who have provided would could be deeply incriminating evidence against milosevic .
the generals ' testimony could be especially useful in regard to the crimes against humanity charges in kosovo , sluiter said .
testimony combined with information out of police and army archives in belgrade should be enough to convict the former serb leader and put him behind bars for a long time .
trial could last until 2006 but first milosevic will have the opportunity to defend himself against these charges .
legal observers expect his defense to take as much time and include as many witnesses as del ponte ’ s prosecution .
after a first ruling in the case , an appeals process is anticipated , with no final decision expected before the end of 2006 .
whether milosevic is convicted or not , the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia will continue to play an important role in the truth and reconciliation process of the balkans , according to sluiter .
“ one should also not exaggerate the importance of the milosevic trial .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.02.2004 europe 's budding ménage à trois großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two 's company , but three is certainly not a crowd , tony .
the leaders of britain , france and germany meet in berlin on wednesday to push for further european economic cooperation .
but others in the eu fear the trio are trying to run europe . a year after the men were at odds over the war in iraq , the leaders of europe 's big three have been working hard at rapprochement these days .
the most visible sign of that new spirit has been an agreement on a common european defense policy reached last december . " that 's an outstanding event that can not be overestimated , " german chancellor schröder told reporters at the time .
this common defense policy and the recent announcement to establish rapid response forces have laid the foundation for an eu " core group . " british premier tony blair might dispute the existence of such a trilateral eu directorate .
but fearing to be side-stepped in an expanded european union , blair has effectively joined germany and france as the bloc 's driving force .
" i strongly believe that britain should play a leading role in the center of europe and not stand aside , " he said . many of the union 's smaller member states are sceptical about the increased trilateral cooperation .
blair does n't think that 's a problem though : the british leader sees himself as the spokesman for new members , who are pro-british and pro-american , in his opinion .
" many states that are now entering the union share the british vision for europe , " he said . moving ahead after constitution talks fail failure to reach a compromise on a proposed eu constitution last december prompted schröder and french president jacques chirac to moot the possibility of turning the eu 's franco-german-led engine into a group of pioneers willing to push ahead with further unification . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro monument is illuminated in front of the european central bank in frankfurt .
" this means that these countries will move ahead , just as has already happened with the euro or the schengen agreement , " chirac said , referring to the abolishment of border controls between most eu countries . although belgium , hungary , the czech republic and greece have expressed interest in joining a leading group , italy , spain and poland oppose making distinctions within the bloc . " europe does n't need a directorate , that would only mess things up , " italian premier silvio berlusconi said on tuesday .
" that 's my opinion , which is shared by other european states except the three in question . " a europe of different speeds schröder , on the other hand , believes that a europe of different speeds will become inevitable should the negotiations over an eu constitution fail for good .
" germany is willing to enter what 's called closer cooperation with france , britain and other eu members , " the chancellor said .
" there 's no question about it . " schröder , who has worked closely with the conservative chirac , is glad to see blair , a fellow social democrat , come aboard .
and according to schröder , the only way to ensure an effective foreign and security policy for the union is to have britain in a leading group . driving or deciding europe 's future unification ? back in 1998 , when joschka fischer took on the job of german foreign minister , he still warned against making britain a part of the franco-german eu engine : britain had n't accepted the eu 's common currency and was opposed to closer cooperation , fischer explained at the time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu family is getting a lot bigger in may .
but now , the troika might push along the unwieldy union with 25 member states and guarantee desperately needed leadership .
that 's the optimistic view .
pessimists see things differently .
first , france and germany suspended the euro zone 's stability pact , together with britain they will now try to affix their seal on the union 's foreign and economic policy , they say . indeed , blair , chirac and schröder plan to write a critical letter to the european commission on wednesday , demanding significant changes to the bloc 's investment program , which is scheduled for adoption at a summit at the end of march . bernd riegert -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair and schröder deny plans for " triumvirate " with chirac german chancellor gerhard schröder and british prime minister tony blair met in berlin on thursday ahead of a three-way summit with france next week .
they denied the formation of a leading " triumvirate " within the eu .

the agency administering the files of the former east german secret police has uncovered a little-known chapter in the history of germany 's immigrant guest workers : some served as spies for the stasi . " kemal " had a good knowledge of german and even though he was n't a member of any political party , he was sympathetic to socialist ideals . in the spring of 1981 , he needed help .
his residency permit for west berlin was about to expire and he was on the verge of getting deported to turkey .
these circumstances made kemal an attractive candidate for the east german secret police , or stasi , which promptly took advantage of the situation . " they arranged a german wife for him and allowed her to move to west berlin .
as a guest worker with a german wife , he was then able to stay in west berlin , " birthler authority researcher georg herbstritt told deutsche welle . herbstritt said this was a typical method used by the stasi to recruit foreigners living in west germany , where they served as low-level spies for the east .
the birthler authority estimates that five percent of the stasi 's so-called " unofficial collaborators " during the 1980s were foreigners .
marriage bait in some cases , stasi officials would hook new recruits by threatening to bust them for infractions of east german laws during visits - like crossing the border back to west germany too late at night or for exchanging money on the black market or even if they had inadvertently taken a snapshot of a stasi building . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the old east german sign points the way in for visitors to the tränenpalast - " palace of tears " - in the early 1990s .
the former border crossing between east and west berlin is now a venue for concerts and comedy acts .
many of the turkish men were assigned as so-called " fly catchers " : they were supposed to inform the stasi about east german women who were trying to marry foreigners in order to leave east germany .
more than 6,000 west berlin turks made day trips to the other side of the berlin wall during the 1980s , and they were popular targets for east german women looking for a better life . despite its eagerness to work with foreigners , the stasi often held a prejudicial view of them .
in the 1970s , then east german state security minister erich mielke expressed his fear that foreigners coming in from west berlin included " many anti-social and criminal " types who could pose a threat to security during their visits there . officials feared airplane hijackings , attacks against embassies and even drug smuggling .
the tensions at the time between turkish and other foreign groups in west berlin fuelled those emotions .
because turks were - and still are - the largest minority group in germany , they made up the majority of the stasi 's foreign collaborators .
little known though there has been little public discussion over the foreigners working for the stasi , there have been some low-profile court cases .
but most of the accused got off lightly without anyone having to sit out a jail sentence , herbstritt said . that 's because few foreigners serving as top spies .
non-germans just did n't have the access .
nor did they have the opportunity to make a career in politics or the military .
they often came as simple laborers to germany and the stasi deployed them where they could be useful . but they have n't escaped the notice of history , with herbstritt now compiling research on this unplumbed aspect of germany 's cold war years . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stasi allegations dog leipzig olympic bid the stasi scandal which has threatened leipzig ’ s olympic bid has not abated despite the resignation of two leading members of the german committee .

the leaders of britain , france and germany meet in berlin on wednesday to push for further european economic cooperation .
but others in the eu fear the trio are trying to run europe . a year after the men were at odds over the war in iraq , the leaders of europe 's big three have been working hard at rapprochement these days .
the most visible sign of that new spirit has been an agreement on a common european defense policy reached last december . " that 's an outstanding event that can not be overestimated , " german chancellor schröder told reporters at the time .
this common defense policy and the recent announcement to establish rapid response forces have laid the foundation for an eu " core group . " british premier tony blair might dispute the existence of such a trilateral eu directorate .
but fearing to be side-stepped in an expanded european union , blair has effectively joined germany and france as the bloc 's driving force .
" i strongly believe that britain should play a leading role in the center of europe and not stand aside , " he said . many of the union 's smaller member states are sceptical about the increased trilateral cooperation .
blair does n't think that 's a problem though : the british leader sees himself as the spokesman for new members , who are pro-british and pro-american , in his opinion .
" many states that are now entering the union share the british vision for europe , " he said . moving ahead after constitution talks fail failure to reach a compromise on a proposed eu constitution last december prompted schröder and french president jacques chirac to moot the possibility of turning the eu 's franco-german-led engine into a group of pioneers willing to push ahead with further unification . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro monument is illuminated in front of the european central bank in frankfurt .
" this means that these countries will move ahead , just as has already happened with the euro or the schengen agreement , " chirac said , referring to the abolishment of border controls between most eu countries . although belgium , hungary , the czech republic and greece have expressed interest in joining a leading group , italy , spain and poland oppose making distinctions within the bloc . " europe does n't need a directorate , that would only mess things up , " italian premier silvio berlusconi said on tuesday .
" that 's my opinion , which is shared by other european states except the three in question . " a europe of different speeds schröder , on the other hand , believes that a europe of different speeds will become inevitable should the negotiations over an eu constitution fail for good .
" germany is willing to enter what 's called closer cooperation with france , britain and other eu members , " the chancellor said .
" there 's no question about it . " schröder , who has worked closely with the conservative chirac , is glad to see blair , a fellow social democrat , come aboard .
and according to schröder , the only way to ensure an effective foreign and security policy for the union is to have britain in a leading group . driving or deciding europe 's future unification ? back in 1998 , when joschka fischer took on the job of german foreign minister , he still warned against making britain a part of the franco-german eu engine : britain had n't accepted the eu 's common currency and was opposed to closer cooperation , fischer explained at the time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu family is getting a lot bigger in may .
but now , the troika might push along the unwieldy union with 25 member states and guarantee desperately needed leadership .
that 's the optimistic view .
pessimists see things differently .
first , france and germany suspended the euro zone 's stability pact , together with britain they will now try to affix their seal on the union 's foreign and economic policy , they say . indeed , blair , chirac and schröder plan to write a critical letter to the european commission on wednesday , demanding significant changes to the bloc 's investment program , which is scheduled for adoption at a summit at the end of march . bernd riegert -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair and schröder deny plans for " triumvirate " with chirac german chancellor gerhard schröder and british prime minister tony blair met in berlin on thursday ahead of a three-way summit with france next week .

" many states that are now entering the union share the british vision for europe , " he said . moving ahead after constitution talks fail failure to reach a compromise on a proposed eu constitution last december prompted schröder and french president jacques chirac to moot the possibility of turning the eu 's franco-german-led engine into a group of pioneers willing to push ahead with further unification . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro monument is illuminated in front of the european central bank in frankfurt .
" this means that these countries will move ahead , just as has already happened with the euro or the schengen agreement , " chirac said , referring to the abolishment of border controls between most eu countries . although belgium , hungary , the czech republic and greece have expressed interest in joining a leading group , italy , spain and poland oppose making distinctions within the bloc . " europe does n't need a directorate , that would only mess things up , " italian premier silvio berlusconi said on tuesday .
" that 's my opinion , which is shared by other european states except the three in question . " a europe of different speeds schröder , on the other hand , believes that a europe of different speeds will become inevitable should the negotiations over an eu constitution fail for good .
" germany is willing to enter what 's called closer cooperation with france , britain and other eu members , " the chancellor said .
" there 's no question about it . " schröder , who has worked closely with the conservative chirac , is glad to see blair , a fellow social democrat , come aboard .
and according to schröder , the only way to ensure an effective foreign and security policy for the union is to have britain in a leading group . driving or deciding europe 's future unification ? back in 1998 , when joschka fischer took on the job of german foreign minister , he still warned against making britain a part of the franco-german eu engine : britain had n't accepted the eu 's common currency and was opposed to closer cooperation , fischer explained at the time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu family is getting a lot bigger in may .
but now , the troika might push along the unwieldy union with 25 member states and guarantee desperately needed leadership .
that 's the optimistic view .
pessimists see things differently .
first , france and germany suspended the euro zone 's stability pact , together with britain they will now try to affix their seal on the union 's foreign and economic policy , they say . indeed , blair , chirac and schröder plan to write a critical letter to the european commission on wednesday , demanding significant changes to the bloc 's investment program , which is scheduled for adoption at a summit at the end of march . bernd riegert -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair and schröder deny plans for " triumvirate " with chirac german chancellor gerhard schröder and british prime minister tony blair met in berlin on thursday ahead of a three-way summit with france next week .

eurocrats in brussels are fed up with the many myths peddled by the media about the european union .
a european commission website sets out to put the record straight . last year , british tabloid the daily mail informed its readers that the eu was planning to ban corgis .
" certain breeds of the queen 's favorite dog could be outlawed under a controversial eu convention being considered by ministers , " it revealed . the shock revelation which outraged animal lovers across the country and fuelled anti-european sentiment in fact had nothing to do with the eu .
the story originated with a committee of animal protection experts which drew up a european convention for the protection of pet animals designed to improve the welfare of household pets . whatever .
readers were all too willing to believe the eu was up to its usual nonsense . this sort of scare-mongering plays right into the hands of euroskeptics - as brussels is all too aware .
the european commission now features on its website a compilation of popular misconceptions ranging from the sublime to the ridiculous , giving the inside story , laying out the facts and debunking the myths . media-fuelled hostility a lot of europhiles feel the press coverage contributes to widespread bewilderment and hostility towards europe , feeding a popular attitude that the eu is a dangerous behemoth deliberately blinding its citizens with layers of impenetrable bureaucracy and ludicrous laws . admittedly , brussels is an easy target .
a tangle of competing institutions and different agendas , eu bodies are notorious for excessive red tape , corruption scandals and mystifying rules and regulations .
it all contributes to a culture of confusion that leaves the public willing to believe just about anything . according to michael mann from the european commission press office , the british media is a main offender , with the tabloids all trying to outdo one another with sensational stories . mann is now busy collecting myths and countering them with facts .
in his opinion , the problem is that the level of debate about europe is n't as high as it should be . a reflection of national reservations the misunderstandings and prejudices come in all shapes and sizes .
maintaining that eu officials are grossly overpaid is one thing - but the idea that male members of staff are reimbursed for the medical costs of viagra pills is slightly less well-founded . horror stories from brussels are part of the media 's daily diet , but reveal an astonishing gullibility on the part of many europeans .
on the euro-myth silly scale , old favorites such as greengrocers having to conform to rules covering size , length , color and texture of fruit and vegetables are less believable than proposals for a new european flag , but the sheer quantity of misapprehensions goes to show how little the public understands the workings of the european union .
viola eggert from the european commission 's berlin office attributes the problem to the commission 's zeal for regulations , saying many myths about the eu popular in germany " are based on over-regulation and the idea that the eu tells its citizens what they 're allowed to do , and has too big an influence on their lives . "
so although gullibility may be to blame for many of the myths , the volume of misinformation appears to reflect strong national reservations about the sort of things the european commission would like to do if left to its own devices .
anti-eu groups are all too willing to twist the facts about brussels ' law-making , but the eu would do well to conclude it should , in future , explain itself better .
after all , brussels does have one of the most extensive press corps in the world .
but as michael mann points out , brussels can only do so much - and the rest is up to national governments .
" they have to start serious discussions with the public about what europe is and why it 's a good thing , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links get the facts straight european commission press office webpage 9800 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.02.2004 eu vows to combat anti-semitism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe has work to do , as long as " synagogues and kindergartens are threatened , " said the german foreign minister the european commission 's president called for member states to take a hard line against anti-semitism , after a day-long seminar with jewish and other european leaders in brussels . romano prodi said he would encourage eu governments to take a tougher stance against all manifestations of racism and intolerance by endorsing a draft u.n. resolution against anti-semitism .
he also said he would urge eu interior affairs and justice ministers to explore law enforcement measures and " pre-emptive acition in the field of education . "
" we want concrete results , " prodi told the gathering of jewish groups thursday .
the italian commission president comments came after months in which the eu came under heavy criticism for standing by amid a rising wave of anti-semitism in europe and the body 's perceived anti-israeli sentiment .
a " european disease " jewish leaders said the eu should monitor anti-jewish incidents more strictly , penalize the perpetrators of the violence more harshly and educate young europeans about the legacy of centuries of persecution on their continent .
though anti-semitism exists in many places in the world , it is also a distinctly " european disease , " nobel-prize winner and holocaust survivor eli wiesel told the gathering .
" the monster is here with us one more time , " said cobi benatoff , president of the european jewish congress . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the jewish community look at fire damages to a synagogue in marseille , france on april 1 , 2002 .
jewish european leaders criticized eu leaders of looking on indifferently as the number of attacks against against jews and desecration of jewish sites rose in recent years . youths from the large communities of arab immigrants in france , belgium and other countries are largely blamed for the attacks .
" the challenge of anti-semitism exists as long as schools , synagogues and kindergartens are threatened , " german foreign minister joschka fischer said .
anti-semitic not to be confused with anti-israeli fischer , however , joined other european officials in drawing a distinct line between criticism of jews and criticism of israel .
while praising israeli prime minister ariel sharon 's recent decision to pull out of the gaza strip , fischer said it should also be possible to criticize the israeli government without being labeled anti-semitic .
prodi also criticized statements made by people like the united states envoy to the eu that draw lines between the levels of anti-semitism today and in the 1930s .
" europe today is not the europe of the 1930s and 1940s and to say that would be quite wrong - we must not insult the memory of the shoah -lrb- hebrew for holocaust -rrb- by equating what is happening today ... with what happened then , " he said , according to reuters .
reports criticized the eu nevertheless has a lot of work to do , according to jewish leaders .
the new york-based world jewish congress called an eu poll last year in which israel topped a list of nations seen as threatening world peace as " dangerously inflammatory . "
the european jewish congress also criticized the eu 's european monitoring center on racism and xenophobia foir witholding a report last year that blamed the rise in anti-semitic attacks on right-wing extremists or young muslims " mostly of arab descent . "
the jewish group said the eu had suppressed the report because it linked arab immigrants to anti-semitic violence in europe .
the monitoring center , however , said it had withheld the report because it was of " poor quality and lacking in empirical evidence .

substitute carsten ramelow snatched victory from the jaws of a mediocre stalemate in croatia on wednesday night as germany won 2-1 in the team 's latest preparation match for the european championships this summer . it was business as usual for the german national soccer team on wednesday night .
despite an unconvincing performance against opposition which would normally have been brushed aside by a team of germany 's standing , rudi völler 's men labored to victory once more with a last minute 2-1 win over croatia in split . with their reputation as a football power waning after weak displays against lithuania , iceland and scotland in qualifying for the european championships in portugal , germany was looking to dispatch the opposition in style with the soccer showpiece looming ahead in june . the croatians , however , have proved to germany in the past that they are no pushovers , and it was they who started the better in this friendly warm-up game for euro 2004 . donning his countrymen 's jersey , bayern munich defender robert kovac almost put the home side ahead on 15 minutes when he directed a corner kick goalwards with a strong headed attempt but was thwarted by germany 's 20-year-old debutant philipp lahm who cleared the effort off the line much to the dismay of the croatian crowd .
stuttgart 's kuranyi proves elusive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kevin kuranyi .
the three-time world cup winners had to wait another quarter of an hour before they first really threatened stipe pletikosa in the croatian goal .
vfb stuttgart 's kevin kuranyi -lrb- photo -rrb- slipped through the dawdling defenders to meet a looping cross but sent his header wide of the far post .
in fact , it was croatia 's wobbly defence - important for euro 2004 group opponents england , france and switzerland - which led to their downfall .
after pegging the germans back for most of the first half , another kuranyi surge exposed croatia 's poor marking and with the croatian rearguard standing motionless , miroslav klose somehow forced his cross home with his knee on 34 minutes .
makeshift midfield charged with stabilization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's coach rudi völler .
germany missed world cup hero michael ballack , who was ruled out late with bronchitis , and the absense of the bayern munich playmaker was sorely felt as the second half opened with the germans in uninspiring form .
coach völler had made several forced changes in his team selection before the game , reshuffling his midfield around the returning liverpool midfielder dietmar hamann and the unsettled dortmunder torsten frings .
again it was croatia and kovac who provided the first real chance of the second period .
with the uncertain looking oliver kahn once more hesitant in goal , kovac whipped in a free kick which skipped off the turf , causing germany 's number one to spill the shot .
luckily for the german captain there were no waiting croatian attackers to tap the loose ball into the empty net .
kuranyi , proving to be germany 's most lively player , then missed his second glorious chance of the game when he poked an effort through pletikosa ' legs only to see the ball roll agonisingly wide of the far post .
chances go begging for croatia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn was floored again .
as the game ebbed and flowed , croatia once again found their rhythm and with 70 minutes on the clock , substitute nino bule should have equalized when it was germany 's defenders ' turn to be caught asleep .
with only kahn to beat , bule considered his options for too long before tamely passing the ball into the waiting goalkeeper 's arms .
the croatians should have been level minutes later when they somehow managed to miss guilt-edged chances from two huge goalmouth scrambles in the closing stages of the match .
but with four minutes remaining , mato neretljak succeeded where oliver kahn had failed by getting on the end of a looping corner and heading past the flapping keeper .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.02.2004 eu vows to combat anti-semitism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe has work to do , as long as " synagogues and kindergartens are threatened , " said the german foreign minister the european commission 's president called for member states to take a hard line against anti-semitism , after a day-long seminar with jewish and other european leaders in brussels . romano prodi said he would encourage eu governments to take a tougher stance against all manifestations of racism and intolerance by endorsing a draft u.n. resolution against anti-semitism .
he also said he would urge eu interior affairs and justice ministers to explore law enforcement measures and " pre-emptive acition in the field of education . "
" we want concrete results , " prodi told the gathering of jewish groups thursday .
the italian commission president comments came after months in which the eu came under heavy criticism for standing by amid a rising wave of anti-semitism in europe and the body 's perceived anti-israeli sentiment .
a " european disease " jewish leaders said the eu should monitor anti-jewish incidents more strictly , penalize the perpetrators of the violence more harshly and educate young europeans about the legacy of centuries of persecution on their continent .
though anti-semitism exists in many places in the world , it is also a distinctly " european disease , " nobel-prize winner and holocaust survivor eli wiesel told the gathering .
" the monster is here with us one more time , " said cobi benatoff , president of the european jewish congress . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the jewish community look at fire damages to a synagogue in marseille , france on april 1 , 2002 .
jewish european leaders criticized eu leaders of looking on indifferently as the number of attacks against against jews and desecration of jewish sites rose in recent years . youths from the large communities of arab immigrants in france , belgium and other countries are largely blamed for the attacks .
" the challenge of anti-semitism exists as long as schools , synagogues and kindergartens are threatened , " german foreign minister joschka fischer said .
anti-semitic not to be confused with anti-israeli fischer , however , joined other european officials in drawing a distinct line between criticism of jews and criticism of israel .
while praising israeli prime minister ariel sharon 's recent decision to pull out of the gaza strip , fischer said it should also be possible to criticize the israeli government without being labeled anti-semitic .
prodi also criticized statements made by people like the united states envoy to the eu that draw lines between the levels of anti-semitism today and in the 1930s .
" europe today is not the europe of the 1930s and 1940s and to say that would be quite wrong - we must not insult the memory of the shoah -lrb- hebrew for holocaust -rrb- by equating what is happening today ... with what happened then , " he said , according to reuters .
reports criticized the eu nevertheless has a lot of work to do , according to jewish leaders .
the new york-based world jewish congress called an eu poll last year in which israel topped a list of nations seen as threatening world peace as " dangerously inflammatory . "
the european jewish congress also criticized the eu 's european monitoring center on racism and xenophobia foir witholding a report last year that blamed the rise in anti-semitic attacks on right-wing extremists or young muslims " mostly of arab descent . "
the jewish group said the eu had suppressed the report because it linked arab immigrants to anti-semitic violence in europe .
the monitoring center , however , said it had withheld the report because it was of " poor quality and lacking in empirical evidence .

the leaders of france , germany and great britain urged europe to adapt to the changing world economy and make the continent more investor-friendly . president jacques chirac , british prime minister tony blair and chancellor gerhard schröder spoke after a two-a-half hour meeting in berlin wednesday .
as a sign of both the cordiality and the importance of topics on the table , the discussions will continue throughout the evening over dinner . the focal point of the afternoon discussions were the need for the three nations and europe as a whole to adapt their national economies and social security systems in the face of globalization and aging populations . " our own people and europe as a whole know there is an economic world that is changing very rapidly , and what this means is , is that the response of government on the national and european level has to be quick and equally adaptable to changing circumstances , " said british prime minister tony blair . make europe investor-friendly , dynamic the three signed a letter which will be sent to current european union president bertie ahern of ireland .
in the letter , the three countries urged the european commission , which initiates policy in the eu , to play a stronger rule in urging economic and health reforms and making europe more investor-friendly . the three called for a new super commissioner responsible for economics to be added to the body as part of changes being discussed by the new european constitution .
the three said the eu should keep its goal of being the most competitive and dynamic economy on earth by 2010 . chancellor gerhard schröder said the three had similar goals on investing in research , universities and innovation .
the chancellor , whose country is one of many european countries experiencing a brain drain of good scientists to the u.s. , talked about investing in the " fields of the future .

the leaders of france , germany and great britain urged europe to adapt to the changing world economy and make the continent more investor-friendly . president jacques chirac , british prime minister tony blair and chancellor gerhard schröder spoke after a two-a-half hour meeting in berlin wednesday .
as a sign of both the cordiality and the importance of topics on the table , the discussions will continue throughout the evening over dinner . the focal point of the afternoon discussions were the need for the three nations and europe as a whole to adapt their national economies and social security systems in the face of globalization and aging populations . " our own people and europe as a whole know there is an economic world that is changing very rapidly , and what this means is , is that the response of government on the national and european level has to be quick and equally adaptable to changing circumstances , " said british prime minister tony blair . make europe investor-friendly , dynamic the three signed a letter which will be sent to current european union president bertie ahern of ireland .
in the letter , the three countries urged the european commission , which initiates policy in the eu , to play a stronger rule in urging economic and health reforms and making europe more investor-friendly . the three called for a new super commissioner responsible for economics to be added to the body as part of changes being discussed by the new european constitution .
the three said the eu should keep its goal of being the most competitive and dynamic economy on earth by 2010 . chancellor gerhard schröder said the three had similar goals on investing in research , universities and innovation .
the chancellor , whose country is one of many european countries experiencing a brain drain of good scientists to the u.s. , talked about investing in the " fields of the future . " similar problems , similar solutions " we saw that there was a large amount of similarity in the types of problems we had , " said schröder . schröder and his social democratic green party coalition are experiencing plumetting popularity rates as a result of economic reforms that seek to dismantle the country 's generous welfare system and rejig the labor market . chirac and blair are undergoing similar fights in their own countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- l . -rrb- and french president jacques chirac both france and germany have been violators of the european union 's economic growth and stability pact , which sets public debt limits in eu member states .
by refusing to trim public spending to keep their social systems afloat during sluggish economic growth , both governments ran afoul of eu monetary officials , who sought legal action . " we need to change the system , without destroying it , " said schröder .
" only if we change it , can we keep it and can we afford it . " " big three " meeting no cause for concern the three leaders brushed back criticism that they were aiming to create an eu triumvirate that would block smaller member states .
blair pointed to the joint defense plan agreed on by the three countries last week and the efforts by german , french and british diplomats to curb iran 's nuclear ambitions as achievements that were good for all of europe . " if these three countries , which comprise almost half of the population in europe … work on clear agreements , then that is a good thing for our three countries but also for europe and there should n't be any concerns about exclusivity , " blair said . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's budding ménage à trois the leaders of britain , france and germany meet in berlin on wednesday to push for further european economic cooperation .

he also said he would urge eu interior affairs and justice ministers to explore law enforcement measures and " pre-emptive acition in the field of education . "
" we want concrete results , " prodi told the gathering of jewish groups thursday .
the italian commission president comments came after months in which the eu came under heavy criticism for standing by amid a rising wave of anti-semitism in europe and the body 's perceived anti-israeli sentiment .
a " european disease " jewish leaders said the eu should monitor anti-jewish incidents more strictly , penalize the perpetrators of the violence more harshly and educate young europeans about the legacy of centuries of persecution on their continent .
though anti-semitism exists in many places in the world , it is also a distinctly " european disease , " nobel-prize winner and holocaust survivor eli wiesel told the gathering .

jewish european leaders criticized eu leaders of looking on indifferently as the number of attacks against against jews and desecration of jewish sites rose in recent years . youths from the large communities of arab immigrants in france , belgium and other countries are largely blamed for the attacks .
" the challenge of anti-semitism exists as long as schools , synagogues and kindergartens are threatened , " german foreign minister joschka fischer said .
anti-semitic not to be confused with anti-israeli fischer , however , joined other european officials in drawing a distinct line between criticism of jews and criticism of israel .
while praising israeli prime minister ariel sharon 's recent decision to pull out of the gaza strip , fischer said it should also be possible to criticize the israeli government without being labeled anti-semitic .
prodi also criticized statements made by people like the united states envoy to the eu that draw lines between the levels of anti-semitism today and in the 1930s .
" europe today is not the europe of the 1930s and 1940s and to say that would be quite wrong - we must not insult the memory of the shoah -lrb- hebrew for holocaust -rrb- by equating what is happening today ... with what happened then , " he said , according to reuters .
reports criticized the eu nevertheless has a lot of work to do , according to jewish leaders .
the new york-based world jewish congress called an eu poll last year in which israel topped a list of nations seen as threatening world peace as " dangerously inflammatory . "
the european jewish congress also criticized the eu 's european monitoring center on racism and xenophobia foir witholding a report last year that blamed the rise in anti-semitic attacks on right-wing extremists or young muslims " mostly of arab descent . "
the jewish group said the eu had suppressed the report because it linked arab immigrants to anti-semitic violence in europe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.02.2004 eu vows to combat anti-semitism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe has work to do , as long as " synagogues and kindergartens are threatened , " said the german foreign minister the european commission 's president called for member states to take a hard line against anti-semitism , after a day-long seminar with jewish and other european leaders in brussels . romano prodi said he would encourage eu governments to take a tougher stance against all manifestations of racism and intolerance by endorsing a draft u.n. resolution against anti-semitism .
he also said he would urge eu interior affairs and justice ministers to explore law enforcement measures and " pre-emptive acition in the field of education . "
" we want concrete results , " prodi told the gathering of jewish groups thursday .
the italian commission president comments came after months in which the eu came under heavy criticism for standing by amid a rising wave of anti-semitism in europe and the body 's perceived anti-israeli sentiment .
a " european disease " jewish leaders said the eu should monitor anti-jewish incidents more strictly , penalize the perpetrators of the violence more harshly and educate young europeans about the legacy of centuries of persecution on their continent .
though anti-semitism exists in many places in the world , it is also a distinctly " european disease , " nobel-prize winner and holocaust survivor eli wiesel told the gathering .
" the monster is here with us one more time , " said cobi benatoff , president of the european jewish congress . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the jewish community look at fire damages to a synagogue in marseille , france on april 1 , 2002 .
jewish european leaders criticized eu leaders of looking on indifferently as the number of attacks against against jews and desecration of jewish sites rose in recent years . youths from the large communities of arab immigrants in france , belgium and other countries are largely blamed for the attacks .
" the challenge of anti-semitism exists as long as schools , synagogues and kindergartens are threatened , " german foreign minister joschka fischer said .
anti-semitic not to be confused with anti-israeli fischer , however , joined other european officials in drawing a distinct line between criticism of jews and criticism of israel .
while praising israeli prime minister ariel sharon 's recent decision to pull out of the gaza strip , fischer said it should also be possible to criticize the israeli government without being labeled anti-semitic .
prodi also criticized statements made by people like the united states envoy to the eu that draw lines between the levels of anti-semitism today and in the 1930s .
" europe today is not the europe of the 1930s and 1940s and to say that would be quite wrong - we must not insult the memory of the shoah -lrb- hebrew for holocaust -rrb- by equating what is happening today ... with what happened then , " he said , according to reuters .
reports criticized the eu nevertheless has a lot of work to do , according to jewish leaders .
the new york-based world jewish congress called an eu poll last year in which israel topped a list of nations seen as threatening world peace as " dangerously inflammatory . "
the european jewish congress also criticized the eu 's european monitoring center on racism and xenophobia foir witholding a report last year that blamed the rise in anti-semitic attacks on right-wing extremists or young muslims " mostly of arab descent . "
the jewish group said the eu had suppressed the report because it linked arab immigrants to anti-semitic violence in europe .
the monitoring center , however , said it had withheld the report because it was of " poor quality and lacking in empirical evidence .

german finance minister hans eichel created an uproar after proposing a law that would send the labor police after domestic staff working illegally .
he 's since backed off . if eichel had his way , people who employed a cleaning lady or babysitter in germany could possibly be made into outlaws . as part of a tough government initiative to tackle germany 's booming illegal jobs market , eichel wanted to target all illegal workers and their employers .
under his bill proposal , domestic help , from cleaners to part-time tutors would be subject to the same constraints and rules as construction workers , office staff and employees in the commercial sector .
that meant that they could face prosecution under german labor laws if they were not registered workers , much in the same way that other workers such as builders , carpenters and technicians were .
private sector is decriminalized after an uproar among opposition politicians and members of the government 's junion coalition partner , the greens , chancellor gehard schröder 's cabinet reduced the severity of the law .
barbara hendricks , a deputy finance minister , declared after the cabinet decision : " the private area has become decriminalized . "
people working in the part-time domestic services sector are now not required to register for so-called " mini-jobs . " the government re-introduced the " minijobs " - which allow workers to earn up to € 400 without having to pay taxes or social benefits - in an effort to streamline registration and encourage workers to come out of the illegal sector .
labor police to look elsewhere an initiative put forward by the finance ministry had mobilized a force of 2,000 customs officers to track down and investigate cleaning ladies and other domestic staff who were working in the so-called shadow economy . a new ministry task force composed of 7,000 officers has been set up to investigate illegal workers and their employers .
their search will now be limited to the restaurant , construction , gaming and tourism industry . the police trade union and metalworkers union ig metall has criticized the new rules , claiming that illegal is illegal and the private sector should be monitored and regulated just as any other .
the government 's reversal came after the increasing clamor over the " cleaning lady debate " from many members of the public who felt it was unfair to treat domestic help in the same way as other areas of employment and include it in labor law categories along with drug dealers and prostitutes who evade taxation and social security levies . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de labor market reforms spelled out germany 's parliament votes on october 17 on labor market reforms that critics say will lead to painful cuts for people in and out of work .

german finance minister hans eichel created an uproar after proposing a law that would send the labor police after domestic staff working illegally .
he 's since backed off . if eichel had his way , people who employed a cleaning lady or babysitter in germany could possibly be made into outlaws . as part of a tough government initiative to tackle germany 's booming illegal jobs market , eichel wanted to target all illegal workers and their employers .
under his bill proposal , domestic help , from cleaners to part-time tutors would be subject to the same constraints and rules as construction workers , office staff and employees in the commercial sector .
that meant that they could face prosecution under german labor laws if they were not registered workers , much in the same way that other workers such as builders , carpenters and technicians were .
private sector is decriminalized after an uproar among opposition politicians and members of the government 's junion coalition partner , the greens , chancellor gehard schröder 's cabinet reduced the severity of the law .
barbara hendricks , a deputy finance minister , declared after the cabinet decision : " the private area has become decriminalized . "
people working in the part-time domestic services sector are now not required to register for so-called " mini-jobs . " the government re-introduced the " minijobs " - which allow workers to earn up to € 400 without having to pay taxes or social benefits - in an effort to streamline registration and encourage workers to come out of the illegal sector .
labor police to look elsewhere an initiative put forward by the finance ministry had mobilized a force of 2,000 customs officers to track down and investigate cleaning ladies and other domestic staff who were working in the so-called shadow economy . a new ministry task force composed of 7,000 officers has been set up to investigate illegal workers and their employers .
their search will now be limited to the restaurant , construction , gaming and tourism industry . the police trade union and metalworkers union ig metall has criticized the new rules , claiming that illegal is illegal and the private sector should be monitored and regulated just as any other .
the government 's reversal came after the increasing clamor over the " cleaning lady debate " from many members of the public who felt it was unfair to treat domestic help in the same way as other areas of employment and include it in labor law categories along with drug dealers and prostitutes who evade taxation and social security levies . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de labor market reforms spelled out germany 's parliament votes on october 17 on labor market reforms that critics say will lead to painful cuts for people in and out of work .

in the 1970s , then east german state security minister erich mielke expressed his fear that foreigners coming in from west berlin included " many anti-social and criminal " types who could pose a threat to security during their visits there . officials feared airplane hijackings , attacks against embassies and even drug smuggling .
the tensions at the time between turkish and other foreign groups in west berlin fuelled those emotions .

substitute carsten ramelow snatched victory from the jaws of a mediocre stalemate in croatia on wednesday night as germany won 2-1 in the team 's latest preparation match for the european championships this summer . it was business as usual for the german national soccer team on wednesday night .
despite an unconvincing performance against opposition which would normally have been brushed aside by a team of germany 's standing , rudi völler 's men labored to victory once more with a last minute 2-1 win over croatia in split . with their reputation as a football power waning after weak displays against lithuania , iceland and scotland in qualifying for the european championships in portugal , germany was looking to dispatch the opposition in style with the soccer showpiece looming ahead in june . the croatians , however , have proved to germany in the past that they are no pushovers , and it was they who started the better in this friendly warm-up game for euro 2004 . donning his countrymen 's jersey , bayern munich defender robert kovac almost put the home side ahead on 15 minutes when he directed a corner kick goalwards with a strong headed attempt but was thwarted by germany 's 20-year-old debutant philipp lahm who cleared the effort off the line much to the dismay of the croatian crowd .
stuttgart 's kuranyi proves elusive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kevin kuranyi .
the three-time world cup winners had to wait another quarter of an hour before they first really threatened stipe pletikosa in the croatian goal .
vfb stuttgart 's kevin kuranyi -lrb- photo -rrb- slipped through the dawdling defenders to meet a looping cross but sent his header wide of the far post .
in fact , it was croatia 's wobbly defence - important for euro 2004 group opponents england , france and switzerland - which led to their downfall .
after pegging the germans back for most of the first half , another kuranyi surge exposed croatia 's poor marking and with the croatian rearguard standing motionless , miroslav klose somehow forced his cross home with his knee on 34 minutes .
makeshift midfield charged with stabilization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's coach rudi völler .
germany missed world cup hero michael ballack , who was ruled out late with bronchitis , and the absense of the bayern munich playmaker was sorely felt as the second half opened with the germans in uninspiring form .
coach völler had made several forced changes in his team selection before the game , reshuffling his midfield around the returning liverpool midfielder dietmar hamann and the unsettled dortmunder torsten frings .
again it was croatia and kovac who provided the first real chance of the second period .
with the uncertain looking oliver kahn once more hesitant in goal , kovac whipped in a free kick which skipped off the turf , causing germany 's number one to spill the shot .
luckily for the german captain there were no waiting croatian attackers to tap the loose ball into the empty net .
kuranyi , proving to be germany 's most lively player , then missed his second glorious chance of the game when he poked an effort through pletikosa ' legs only to see the ball roll agonisingly wide of the far post .
chances go begging for croatia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn was floored again .
as the game ebbed and flowed , croatia once again found their rhythm and with 70 minutes on the clock , substitute nino bule should have equalized when it was germany 's defenders ' turn to be caught asleep .
with only kahn to beat , bule considered his options for too long before tamely passing the ball into the waiting goalkeeper 's arms .
the croatians should have been level minutes later when they somehow managed to miss guilt-edged chances from two huge goalmouth scrambles in the closing stages of the match .
but with four minutes remaining , mato neretljak succeeded where oliver kahn had failed by getting on the end of a looping corner and heading past the flapping keeper .
last minute hero bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carsten ramelow .
with another lackluster draw in the making , substitute carsten ramelow entered the picture .
the bayer leverkusen player saved the blushes of his team mates , and his captain especially , by volleying home the winner in the 90th minute to secure a flattering victory . germany 's next warm-up for the european championships comes on march 31 when it takes on belgium in cologne . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : germany to face old foes in euro 2004 old scores and local rivalries are set to be settled in the opening stages of the european championships in portugal next summer as the soccer teams of germany and holland have been placed together in group d.

by tim weber bbc news online business editor china is rapidly grabbing high-tech market share " china is amazing " , says microsoft boss bill gates .
" it is capitalism , but at an unprecedented speed . "
" amazing " is an understatement .
this is an economy on speed .
chinese exports have surged more than 50 % to $ 325bn -lrb- £ 171bn -rrb- in the five years to 2002 .
and they are accelerating , currently growing 20 % year-on-year .

how to make money in china make no mistake : the world 's business leaders are transfixed by china .
if your business is n't making money in china , it probably would n't make money anywhere else carlos ghosn president , nissan motor company a few weeks ago , during debates at the world economic forum in davos , china seemed to be the solution to every problem - and the cause of all potential trouble .
after all , business history is littered with failed western investments in china .

" with companies that do n't make a profit in china , if you look at the case studies , there is always a flaw from the outset , " says dinesh paliwal , group executive vice-president at swiss-swedish engineering group abb .
microprocessors are a case in point , argues ulrich schumacher , chief executive of german microchip giant infineon .
chip factories built in china during the past 10 years did not make any money , he says , because they produced the wrong chips at the wrong time .
backward rural areas have huge potential for economic growth infineon , in contrast , moved in only recently and is making plenty of profit .
as a result china will get 30 % of the german firm 's $ 1.2bn investment total over the next three years .
the sentiment is echoed by carlos ghosn , president of car maker nissan : " if your business is n't making money in china , it probably would n't make money anywhere else . "
" if you are focused , you can be very profitable " , he says , and adds that for nissan , china is the world 's second-most profitable car market after the us .

its middle class is growing rapidly , domestic consumption is booming and the growth of its manufacturing sector is nothing if not spectacular .
" we set up our factories in china to export , but it is all consumed in the country itself , " reports abb 's dinesh paliwal .
with inflation low , labour cheap and plentiful , urbanisation driving demand , and a savings rate of 30 % providing easy capital , china is a manufacturer 's dream .

all this is worrying news for high-tech workers in industrialised countries , who hoped their skills would give them a competitive advantage in the globalised economy .

this has created stability , but also acted as an export subsidy , creating huge trade imbalances .

some chinese manufacturers , depending on cheap imports of components and raw materials , agree .

by tim weber bbc news online business editor china is rapidly grabbing high-tech market share " china is amazing " , says microsoft boss bill gates .
" it is capitalism , but at an unprecedented speed . "
" amazing " is an understatement .
this is an economy on speed .
chinese exports have surged more than 50 % to $ 325bn -lrb- £ 171bn -rrb- in the five years to 2002 .
and they are accelerating , currently growing 20 % year-on-year .
the economy , meanwhile , is expanding at a blistering 9 % .
no wonder foreign investors want to join the gold rush .
china 's export miracle 1982 : $ 22.32bn 1992 : $ 84.92bn 1998 : $ 207.24bn 2001 : $ 266.15bn 2002 : $ 325.56bn source : world bank just during the past few days , korea 's ini steel company launched a $ 500m steel project in the dalian development zone ; france 's saint gobain invested another $ 70m in one of its existing glass production lines ; germany 's siemens opened its 40th office in china , to develop high-end software applications in nanjing , and warned that it could shift thousands of jobs from europe and america to china ; while finnish paper giant stora enso invested $ 1.6bn in a pulp-paper project in south china .
but is china really a capitalist goldmine - or a minefield , where firms are beholden to corruption or arbitrary acts of a communist bureaucracy ?
and what about the biggest short-term worry of all : will china soon end its currency 's decade-old peg to the us dollar , wreaking havoc on carefully laid-out business plans ?
how to make money in china make no mistake : the world 's business leaders are transfixed by china .
if your business is n't making money in china , it probably would n't make money anywhere else carlos ghosn president , nissan motor company a few weeks ago , during debates at the world economic forum in davos , china seemed to be the solution to every problem - and the cause of all potential trouble .
after all , business history is littered with failed western investments in china .
so what went wrong ?
blame poor management or timing , say those that have succeeded in china .
" with companies that do n't make a profit in china , if you look at the case studies , there is always a flaw from the outset , " says dinesh paliwal , group executive vice-president at swiss-swedish engineering group abb .
microprocessors are a case in point , argues ulrich schumacher , chief executive of german microchip giant infineon .
chip factories built in china during the past 10 years did not make any money , he says , because they produced the wrong chips at the wrong time .
backward rural areas have huge potential for economic growth infineon , in contrast , moved in only recently and is making plenty of profit .
as a result china will get 30 % of the german firm 's $ 1.2bn investment total over the next three years .
the sentiment is echoed by carlos ghosn , president of car maker nissan : " if your business is n't making money in china , it probably would n't make money anywhere else . "
" if you are focused , you can be very profitable " , he says , and adds that for nissan , china is the world 's second-most profitable car market after the us .

monkey business there are other long-term worries , like the stability of china 's banking system , and whether the country can generate enough energy to sustain its economic boom today , though , the biggest headache for investors is china 's currency .
for decades , the yuan has been pegged at a low rate to the us dollar .
this has created stability , but also acted as an export subsidy , creating huge trade imbalances .
washington is urging beijing to float the yuan .
some chinese manufacturers , depending on cheap imports of components and raw materials , agree .
already " we see a massive inflow of foreign currency into china in anticipation of a floating exchange rate policy , " says professor fu jun of beijing university , who is considered to be close to the chinese leadership .
but the yuan is unlikely to suffer a dramatic devaluation .
china will probably switch its peg from the us dollar peg to a basket of currencies , says professor fu .
experts like victor chu predict that investors now have a " window of nine months " .
" if you want to go into china , you should do so now , " he argues .
in the chinese calendar , 2004 is the year of the monkey .
investing in china now would be " good monkey business " , says victor chu .

just two weeks after australia and the us signed a landmark trade agreement and proclaimed themselves the firmest of friends , there is a groundswell of anger at the treatment of an " aussie icon " .
the ire focuses on deckers outdoor , a californian company which bought small australian footwear firm ugg holdings in 1995 .
no one much minded that americans were producing ugg 's comfortable but dowdy sheepskin boots ; they did n't even gripe when deckers shifted production to cheaper china .
getting heavy but now ugg boots , thanks to the unguessable alchemy of high fashion , have become a celebrity must-have , and things have turned nasty .
aggrieved australian footwear makers complain that deckers is going to aggressive lengths to safeguard its ugg trademark , which it acquired for two dozen countries when it bought the firm .
we have no intention of putting anyone out of business .
everybody should be able to sell sheepskin boots if they want to ; what we do n't want is confused customers tom fitzsimons , deckers ' patent attorney tony mortel , whose family have been making sheepskin boots since 1958 , is one of dozens of companies banned from selling on the internet .
" if it 's got a u and a g in it , they 're after it , " he snorts .
according to some reports , the firm even leaned on the publishers of the macquarie dictionary , standard-setters for australian english , to reflect deckers ' trademark in its definition of ugg .
mr mortel claims to have lost some 300,000 australian dollars -lrb- £ 126,000 ; us $ 238,000 -rrb- as a result of the embargo , and says the australian sheepskin trade is out of pocket to the tune of a $ 20m .
" we 're being railroaded out of our own market share , " he says .
different versions hazy history is partly to blame .
the official deckers line on the ugg boot is that it was more or less invented by brian smith , an australian surfer , in the 1970s .
mr smith had the good sense to trademark the term ugg , as well as variations such as ug , ugh and so on , and passed those legitimate rights on to deckers .
i am convinced that we will get this trademark cancelled tony mortel , sheepskin boot maker er , not quite , say deckers ' opponents .
no one is absolutely straight on how the boots were invented - surfers , farmers and world war i pilots are all possible culprits - but all agree there has been a tradition of making boots and calling them uggs since the first half of the 20th century .
they were so familiar a feature of australian life , the argument goes , that no one thought to trademark the name .
" ' ugg ' is a generic term like ' trainers ' or ' sneakers ' , " says sharryn jackson , a member of the australian parliament who has taken up the case of bootmakers in her constituency .
" it defies belief that an australian icon would be trademarked in the us . "
protecting our good name deckers insists it is doing nothing wrong .
" -lsb- deckers -rsb- has invested a lot of money and time in the brand , and in order to protect the brand we will try to stop unethical dealers who try to confuse the public as to a product 's origins , " says tom fitzsimons , a trademark lawyer at us law firm greer , burns and crain , who represents the company .
" there has also been a lot of investment in marketing so that people recognise ugg as a brand .
" we have no intention of putting anyone out of business .
everybody should be able to sell sheepskin boots if they want to ; what we do n't want is confused customers . "
the existence of trademarks dating back to the 1970s in every corner of the globe is a sign , the company insists , that ugg is by no means a generic term .
kicking up a fuss nonetheless , a campaign is slowly building .
other mps have raised the issue , and ms jackson says she is trying to put together a lobby group of businesses to force the federal government to take note .
mr mortel , meanwhile , has formed the australian sheepskin association , whose campaign - under the rallying cry " save our aussie icon " - hopes to attract 50,000 supporters .
mr mortel has already failed to win an appeal before the tribunal of icann , the body that rules on internet domain names .
but he is pressing on with action aimed at deckers ' original trademark rights .
" i am convinced that we will get this trademark cancelled , " he insists .
bye-bye , vegemite the case , if it emerges , promises fireworks .
cross-border copyright and trademark disputes are among the most treacherous avenues of international law .
in this case , there is the added complication that the trademark under dispute is - like portakabin , for example , or hoover - far better known as a word than as a brand .
what might appear a parochial little spat is about pretty big money - sales of ugg boots have trebled in the past couple of years and aussie pride adds spice to the mix .
everyone involved in the case insists that chauvinism is not the issue , but australians are becoming increasingly touchy about corporate colonisation .
after a wave of investment in the past few years , iconic australian brands such as vegemite , violet cumble , aeroplane jelly and kangaroo matches are now in foreign hands .
at the same time , a host of local firms are polishing their aussie credentials in an attempt to cash in on the patriotic market .

sales of ugg boots have at least trebled in the past couple of years , tony mortel reckons ; thanks to the patronage of kylie minogue , gwyneth paltrow and others , prices in the fanciest european markets can top 300 euros a pair .

by emma griffiths bbc news online , london the shop and museum occupies a listed 18th century corner house printer benjamin pollock has been linked to toy theatres in london since 1876 , but the museum named after him could finally close within months , barring a last-minute windfall .
tucked behind goodge street tube station , central london , is one of the city 's quaintest and quirkiest museums .
spread over two floors , six small rooms and several winding staircases , the walls of pollock 's toy museum are covered with an estimated 20,000 exhibits dating back more than a century .
rocking horses , hornby train sets , " penny dreadfuls " , french tin soldiers , muffin the mule , spinning cones and russian folk toys are crammed on to all available wall space .
in the ground-floor shop , the walls are stacked with jars of novelties and trays of marbles , puppets and puzzles .
with its creaky floorboards and information sheets taped to boards on string , it is a far cry from london 's larger , more hi-tech museums .
if you love art , folly , or the bright eyes of children , speed to pollock 's author and essayist robert louis stevenson pollock 's in pictures " people do phone up and say : ' is it interactive ? ' , " says manageress gabrielle warden , with a smile .
" it 's quirky .
the children are unable to touch the toys because they are old and would n't last five minutes .
they are all behind glass but they are visible from the ground up . "
despite this , word of mouth has spread and the museum pulls a steady stream of visitors - more adults than children - from all over the world .
last year it had 27,500 people through its doors .
" we came to london four years ago , and when we went back to the states someone asked if we had gone to the toy museum , " said us tourist susan higgins , who was visiting with her family from charlotte , north carolina .
" this time they said we had to go . "
pollock 's has been selling victorian theatre prints and toy theatres since 1876 .
benjamin pollock 's small shop in hoxton , east london , did a brisk trade in them for 60 years until 1940 .
mrs warden has worked on and off at pollock 's since she was 17 author robert louis stevenson sung the shop 's praises in his essay a penny plain and twopence coloured , writing : " if you love art , folly , or the bright eyes of children , speed to pollock 's , or to clarke 's of garrick street . "
when marguerite fawdry stumbled upon the remaining stock in 1956 , she bought it all up and opened up in monmouth street , moving to scala street 13 years later .
these days pollock 's , an educational charitable trust , is run on a shoestring .
the painted facade , which won it a brighter london award in 1973 , is flaking , the museum can not afford to advertise and staff have known for six years that its future was uncertain .
a plan to move to new premises in greenwich a year ago fell through when pollock 's did not attract enough funding .
as big london museums are now given government money to allow free entry , some visitors balk at the idea of paying the £ 3 adult entry fee .
but government or lottery funding brings its own conditions and pollock 's wants to retain its independence .
" we have kept it going through thick and thin by reducing wages , it 's a labour of love , " said mrs warden , who has worked on and off at pollock 's for decades .
" places like this have character , everything 's becoming ' identikit ' in every city , the same shops , everything - it 's all to do with money , the costs of renting or buying are astronomic . "
' teetering on brink of closure ' its lease is up at the end of march , and unless it can find £ 250,000 to buy the freehold and upgrade the building , it could be curtains for the toy theatre in scala street .
helen wilkinson , policy officer at the museums association , said pollock 's was one of many independent museums under threat across the uk .
she said many suffered along with the rest of the tourism industry after 11 september 2001 and have yet to feel the benefits of additional government investment .
" the financial situation for a lot of them is fairly hand to mouth , they often are permanently teetering on the brink of closure , " she said .
" kilmartin house in scotland , which is one of the more innovative independent museums , has been ' about to close ' for the last three or four years .
its situation is fairly fragile .
" i think generally the future is n't that rosy for independent museums . "
if it can not raise the money to buy the freehold , pollock 's will have to pack up its wax dolls , magic lanterns and stingray models and will look around for another site .
but , despite the fact there is barely room to swivel a pushchair , staff hope they can find a way to stay in their creaky corner house .

the painted facade , which won it a brighter london award in 1973 , is flaking , the museum can not afford to advertise and staff have known for six years that its future was uncertain .
a plan to move to new premises in greenwich a year ago fell through when pollock 's did not attract enough funding .
as big london museums are now given government money to allow free entry , some visitors balk at the idea of paying the £ 3 adult entry fee .
but government or lottery funding brings its own conditions and pollock 's wants to retain its independence .
" we have kept it going through thick and thin by reducing wages , it 's a labour of love , " said mrs warden , who has worked on and off at pollock 's for decades .
" places like this have character , everything 's becoming ' identikit ' in every city , the same shops , everything - it 's all to do with money , the costs of renting or buying are astronomic . "
' teetering on brink of closure ' its lease is up at the end of march , and unless it can find £ 250,000 to buy the freehold and upgrade the building , it could be curtains for the toy theatre in scala street .
helen wilkinson , policy officer at the museums association , said pollock 's was one of many independent museums under threat across the uk .
she said many suffered along with the rest of the tourism industry after 11 september 2001 and have yet to feel the benefits of additional government investment .
" the financial situation for a lot of them is fairly hand to mouth , they often are permanently teetering on the brink of closure , " she said .
" kilmartin house in scotland , which is one of the more innovative independent museums , has been ' about to close ' for the last three or four years .
its situation is fairly fragile .
" i think generally the future is n't that rosy for independent museums . "
if it can not raise the money to buy the freehold , pollock 's will have to pack up its wax dolls , magic lanterns and stingray models and will look around for another site .
but , despite the fact there is barely room to swivel a pushchair , staff hope they can find a way to stay in their creaky corner house .

people who work with the immigrants say they are in hiding because they believe they will be killed if they are sent back to the countries they have fled .
the welsh refugee conference will meet in cardiff on thursday to discuss the problem .
one asylum seeker , in his 30s and from the democratic republic of congo , has spent the past four weeks on the streets of swansea .
there are many asylum seekers that we do n't know about volunteer sylvie hofman " i sleep in the cabin of the telephone kiosk and it is very , very cold , " he said .
" the refugee official gave me two blankets .
" no food , no tea , i sleep out . "
a volunteer worker told bbc wales she believed there were as many as 200 asylum seekers sleeping on the streets of south wales .
" in swansea at the moment there are about 20 people , mostly from west africa but there are many that we do n't know about , " said sylvie hofman , welsh refugee council swansea .
those in hiding , it is claimed , fear torture and death if they return home and hope they will be forgotten by the immigration authorities .
if they want to kill me they will have to kill me here in the uk asylum seeker ms hofman says the asylum seekers are encouraged to register with the police at regular intervals .
" if you do n't go and sign you become a suspect then the police will start looking for you under the anti terrorism act .
" but if you do go and sign on you can also be picked up so its a double-edged thing .
" however , it is better to go and sign on and not to be looked for . "
the asylum seeker in swansea , who did not want to be identified , has been in britain for two years and left a wife and three children in dr congo .
he says will be killed if he returns to the country .
" if they want to kill me they will have to kill me here in the uk and then send my corpse to the congo .
" there is no way i can go alive to the congo .
" i do not want to face again what i had to face . "

the house , near pwllheli , north wales , needs to be knocked down so improvement works on the a497 - the main road through the area - can go ahead .
but proposals for a new farm-style home for the lesser horseshoe bats - complete with rendered walls and stone and pitched slate roof - have been put on hold .
gwynedd councillors have said they are worried about paying for a bat home when young people in the area can not afford housing .
we will be seen as providing a home for bats at the expense of homes for local young people councillor richard parry hughes the plan was deferred so officials can look at converting an existing building instead .
as an endangered species , bats are protected under wildlife and countryside act 1981 .
they are protected from disturbance , injury , destruction , or sale their roosting sites must either be safeguarded or alternative provisions made .
planning manager for gwynedd council , gruff morris said : " cemlyn has to be demolished as part of the road scheme , and the aim is to build a top-class alternative building , which will have everything except air conditioning ! "
the proposed new home measured 6.2m metres high , 10.6m length and 5.2m in width .
it would be purpose built for bats and have openings at the base of the walls to allow water to flow under the building during times of flood .
disused building councillors were told that it would be of high quality finish , and would resemble an old farm building .
however some councillors voiced their objections to the scheme and claimed there was no need for a new building .
" there are plenty of other disused farm buildings close by that could be adapted for the purpose , " said councillor richard parry hughes .
" i am concerned that we will be seen as providing a brand new home for bats , yet when we come to consider new homes for local families , we often refuse permission .
" we will be seen as providing a home for bats at the expense of homes for local young people . "
the application has now been deferred to enable the officers to discuss an alternative building .
