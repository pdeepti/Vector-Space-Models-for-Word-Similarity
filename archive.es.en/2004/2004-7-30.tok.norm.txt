once it starts flying , it will deliver food , water and fuel to the astronauts . named after french author jules verne , the originator of modern science fiction , europe 's first " automated transfer vehicle , " is scheduled to launch aboard an ariane 5 rocket in september 2005 .
the introduction of the spacecraft , which will ferry supplies including food , parts , fuel , water and even mail to the international space station will help take the burden off the space shuttle fleet , which currently transports the bulk of payloads and astronauts .
" we ’ re particularly excited about the atv , because it will help close the gaps if the space shuttle is not flying , " said sigmar wittig , chairman of the executive board of the german aerospace center , which is funding about 41 percent of europe 's contribution to the iss .
" we recently had to reduce the number of astronauts on the iss to two because the shuttle was grounded and there was no way to provide three with enough supplies .
separating the transport of humans and goods is the way to go in the future . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the automated transfer vehicle will use a laser tracking system to dock with the international space station .
after the launch of the jules verne , one atv will be launched by esa about every year , carrying 7.5 tons of cargo from the kourou launch site in french guyana .
the cylindrical vessel weighs 20 tons and measures 10.3 meters long -lrb- 33.79 feet -rrb- and 4.5 meters in diameter . after a journey of up to five days , it will dock with the space station 's russian service module using a precision laser tracking system that looks like a scene straight out of " star wars . "
the atv holds tanks that can carry 840 kilograms of water , 860 kilograms of refuelling propellant for the iss ' propulsion system and 100 kilograms of oxygen .
the spacecraft also has thrusters that will be used to boost the space station 's altitude every 10 to 45 days .
residual atmosphere causes the station to sink from its normal altitude of 400 kilometers , and up until now the us space shuttles have been used to propel the iss back to its correct position .
galactic parcel post and trash can in one once docked with the russian service module on the iss , astronauts can access the atv during a six-month period .
after all the supplies have been unloaded , the atv is then filled with up to 6.5 tons of station waste , which will be destroyed as the cargo vessel burns up and disintegrates in earth 's atmosphere .
bildunterschrift : the pressurized automated transfer vehicle will be docked with the space station for up to six months at a time and will be completely accessible to astronauts on board the iss .
though jules verne 's voyage to space will only be one-way , his successors will become a routine part of life on the space station .
" the atv can play a major role from the moment onwards when the shuttle is phased out , " said jörg feustel-büechl , referring to us plans to junk the shuttle program in the near future . " the atv is by far the biggest resupply vehicle .
presently we are relying very much on the russian ' progress ' vehicle , which can transport two to three tons to the station . "

german spelling is once again at the center of political debate , despite the fact that an across-the-board reform went into effect six years ago . " i would rather decline two drinks than one german verb , " mark twain famously wrote in his essay the awful german language .
but germans do n't need an american to tell them that their language is difficult - they know it themselves .
and they 're working on it .
several years ago , amid much controversy , germany -lrb- and switzerland and austria -rrb- decided to tackle the problem .
in 1998 , after decades of failed attempts , a committee pushed through a raft of changes known as the rechtschreibreform -lrb- spelling reform . -rrb-
the new rules were first applied in a transition phase , but are slated to become mandatory on august 1 , 2005 .
the changes aim to iron out some of the quirks in the language , and include various spelling changes such as using " ss " instead of the " ß " character .
they also thin out the hundreds of complex rules regarding the use of commas .
' unnecessary as gout ' but what started out as a simple effort to make life easier for the masses seems to have turned into a political hot potato .
the premiers of five german states - all of them members of the conservative opposition - have gone on record in recent weeks saying they want the government to reconsider the reforms .
common complaints : the new rules are confusing , and people are n't putting them into practice .
along with the politicians , several well known german writers , including nobel prize winner günther grass and poet and essayist hans magnus enzensberger have come out against the reform .
swiss author adolf muschg told the bild-zeitung newspaper : " the spelling reform must be stopped immediately .
it is as unnecessary as gout , has brought no improvement , and instead made people more uncertain . "
the german government has stuck to its guns , however , saying the reforms will go through as planned .
thomas steg , deputy spokesman for the government , told the dpa press agency that it would be " nonsense " to revisit the issue now .
after years of debate , " now the decisions that have been made should be put into effect consistently , " he said , and added : " the reaction of certain of the -lrb- state -rrb- premiers seems strange to me . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's leading dictionary marked all spelling changes in red in its 1996 edition .
for the most part , publishers , schools , and civil servants have long since adapted to the new system .
some 90 percent of new books are published using the reformed spelling rules .
felizitas liemersdorf , the principal of an elementary school in cologne , said it would be " nonsense " for the reforms to be rescinded now .
she admitted that the reforms were problematic from the get-go , saying they were " neither logical nor far reaching enough . "
however , like educators throughout the country , liemersdorf had no choice other than make sure the new rules were being applied in the classroom .
high cost of change " the first problem is , they were n't mandatory for everyone .
just take a look at our good old faz ! " she said , referring to the leading german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , which continues to publish under the old style .
but nonetheless , to go back to the old ways after six years would be " absurd , " liemersdorf said .
" can you imagine the cost ?
there would be a huge outcry .
we already replaced books - readers , worksheets , dictionaries , reference books . all the new books for classrooms are in the new style . "
too many critics to ignore to date , just one member of the federal government - culture minister christina weiss - has spoken out in favor of reviewing the reform issue .
in a conversation with the faz , weiss said it makes sense to give the rules another look before they become final .
she called the new rules " confusing and nonsensical , " and noted that " there are too many critics to just ignore them . "
" until the transition phase is over , on july 31 , 2005 , we still have the chance to think about the new rules .
i see a chance to clarify problematic issues , " weiss told the faz - the same newspaper that refuses to adopt the new spelling .
weiss suggests throwing the issue in the lap of the kmk , or kultusministerkonferenz - the group in charge of education policy on issues that go beyond state .
and indeed , because a conservative committee member has requested it , the issue will stand on the agenda when the group next meets , in october .
debate a ' senseless waste ' ?
noting that the group just voted unanimously in favor of the reforms in june , kmk president doris ahnen told the ddp news agency she finds it " somewhat strange " that one of her colleagues requested bringing the topic back to life .
moreover , she said , she does n't believe anything will change , even after another debate .
" most of the ministers in the committee are still in favor of the reforms , and are in favor of making them mandatory next august , " she stressed .
a representative of the german journalists ' association -lrb- djv -rrb- told news agencies that his group is in favor of keeping the reform .
rescinding it at this point would be " a senseless waste of money , " djv chairman michael konken said .
konken said the whole debate should go back to where it came from : the " sommerloch " - the big summer news hole that german politicians know is always good for press in the slow season . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de coming to terms with germany 's new spelling reform five years after germany 's controversial spelling reforms were introduced , many germans are still confused by the new spelling rules , while others simply refuse to use them .

german spelling is once again at the center of political debate , despite the fact that an across-the-board reform went into effect six years ago . " i would rather decline two drinks than one german verb , " mark twain famously wrote in his essay the awful german language .
but germans do n't need an american to tell them that their language is difficult - they know it themselves .
and they 're working on it .
several years ago , amid much controversy , germany -lrb- and switzerland and austria -rrb- decided to tackle the problem .
in 1998 , after decades of failed attempts , a committee pushed through a raft of changes known as the rechtschreibreform -lrb- spelling reform . -rrb-
the new rules were first applied in a transition phase , but are slated to become mandatory on august 1 , 2005 .
the changes aim to iron out some of the quirks in the language , and include various spelling changes such as using " ss " instead of the " ß " character .
they also thin out the hundreds of complex rules regarding the use of commas .
' unnecessary as gout ' but what started out as a simple effort to make life easier for the masses seems to have turned into a political hot potato .
the premiers of five german states - all of them members of the conservative opposition - have gone on record in recent weeks saying they want the government to reconsider the reforms .
common complaints : the new rules are confusing , and people are n't putting them into practice .
along with the politicians , several well known german writers , including nobel prize winner günther grass and poet and essayist hans magnus enzensberger have come out against the reform .
swiss author adolf muschg told the bild-zeitung newspaper : " the spelling reform must be stopped immediately .
it is as unnecessary as gout , has brought no improvement , and instead made people more uncertain . "
the german government has stuck to its guns , however , saying the reforms will go through as planned .
thomas steg , deputy spokesman for the government , told the dpa press agency that it would be " nonsense " to revisit the issue now .
after years of debate , " now the decisions that have been made should be put into effect consistently , " he said , and added : " the reaction of certain of the -lrb- state -rrb- premiers seems strange to me . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's leading dictionary marked all spelling changes in red in its 1996 edition .
for the most part , publishers , schools , and civil servants have long since adapted to the new system .
some 90 percent of new books are published using the reformed spelling rules .
felizitas liemersdorf , the principal of an elementary school in cologne , said it would be " nonsense " for the reforms to be rescinded now .
she admitted that the reforms were problematic from the get-go , saying they were " neither logical nor far reaching enough . "
however , like educators throughout the country , liemersdorf had no choice other than make sure the new rules were being applied in the classroom .
high cost of change " the first problem is , they were n't mandatory for everyone .
just take a look at our good old faz ! " she said , referring to the leading german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , which continues to publish under the old style .
but nonetheless , to go back to the old ways after six years would be " absurd , " liemersdorf said .
" can you imagine the cost ?
there would be a huge outcry .
we already replaced books - readers , worksheets , dictionaries , reference books . all the new books for classrooms are in the new style . "
too many critics to ignore to date , just one member of the federal government - culture minister christina weiss - has spoken out in favor of reviewing the reform issue .
in a conversation with the faz , weiss said it makes sense to give the rules another look before they become final .
she called the new rules " confusing and nonsensical , " and noted that " there are too many critics to just ignore them . "
" until the transition phase is over , on july 31 , 2005 , we still have the chance to think about the new rules .
i see a chance to clarify problematic issues , " weiss told the faz - the same newspaper that refuses to adopt the new spelling .
weiss suggests throwing the issue in the lap of the kmk , or kultusministerkonferenz - the group in charge of education policy on issues that go beyond state .
and indeed , because a conservative committee member has requested it , the issue will stand on the agenda when the group next meets , in october .
debate a ' senseless waste ' ?
noting that the group just voted unanimously in favor of the reforms in june , kmk president doris ahnen told the ddp news agency she finds it " somewhat strange " that one of her colleagues requested bringing the topic back to life .
moreover , she said , she does n't believe anything will change , even after another debate .
" most of the ministers in the committee are still in favor of the reforms , and are in favor of making them mandatory next august , " she stressed .
a representative of the german journalists ' association -lrb- djv -rrb- told news agencies that his group is in favor of keeping the reform .
rescinding it at this point would be " a senseless waste of money , " djv chairman michael konken said .

columbus laboratory and electrical test models in the integration hall in bremen , germany .
columbus was originally scheduled to be launched this year , but the delay has given the project 's scientists and engineers more time to conduct testing and to make the research laboratory more flexible to accommodate future experiments .
afterall , unlike an airplane , engineers do n't have the luxury of doing test-flights on columbus - it has to work from day one .
the 4.5-meter -lrb- 14.76 feet -rrb- cylindrical module , which weighs about 450 tons and has a floor space of 75 cubic meters , is packed with scientific experiments covering the fields of biology , biotechnology , human physiology , material science and fluid science .

in rough terms , we will have 100 times more capability to do experiments than we ever had before , " said jörg feustel-büechl , esa 's director of manned spaceflight .
columbus can fit up to three astronauts working in the unit 's zero-gravity conditions .
astronauts as zero-gravity guinea pigs among the primary goals of columbus is to study the effects of long-term space travel on the human body .
in order to send astronauts to the moon or mars for long periods , scientists and medical experts must first learns ways to counter the aging effects of space travel as well as prolonged exposure to increased radiation from the sun .
the studies could also aid medical researchers treating illnesses on terra firma .
" we will study how the body behaves , " feustel-büechl said .
" the body ages more quickly in space and bone density diminishes , and that 's an important phenomenon for studying the effects of osteoporosis .
you also have a different distribution of the fluids of the blood and water in the body .
you can study cardiovascular effects or the effects on the brains or eyes . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european physiology modules -lrb- epm -rrb- will be used to test the long-term health effects of space travel on astronauts .
feustel-büechl said that many health phenomena that occur on earth are accelerated in space , which will help scientists to study them more easily and quickly than they could on our own planet .
the same " biolab " facility used to study humans can also be used for experiments on cells , tissue cultures , microorganisms , small plants and invertebrates .
benefits for business the esa scientist said the laboratory would also be important for studying material science .
in space , there is no convection , and astronauts in the columbus module can " isolate physical phenomena in a much better way , understanding better , for example , how fluids behave with gases , how combustion works and how melting fluids behave - not just for the textbooks , but also for practical applications in various disciplines and industries . "
in other words , the lessons learned in space could help companies back on earth create new manufacturing techniques .
in addition to the research facilities inside columbus , the module also has four outdoor platforms for experiments .
" these will allow our astronaut scientists to look to the sky for astronomical observations or to look down to earth for observation experiments , " said feustel-büechl .
" we can also conduct experiments with technology that needs to be exposed to space conditions . "

the 4.5-meter -lrb- 14.76 feet -rrb- cylindrical module , which weighs about 450 tons and has a floor space of 75 cubic meters , is packed with scientific experiments covering the fields of biology , biotechnology , human physiology , material science and fluid science .

in rough terms , we will have 100 times more capability to do experiments than we ever had before , " said jörg feustel-büechl , esa 's director of manned spaceflight .
columbus can fit up to three astronauts working in the unit 's zero-gravity conditions .
astronauts as zero-gravity guinea pigs among the primary goals of columbus is to study the effects of long-term space travel on the human body .
in order to send astronauts to the moon or mars for long periods , scientists and medical experts must first learns ways to counter the aging effects of space travel as well as prolonged exposure to increased radiation from the sun .
the studies could also aid medical researchers treating illnesses on terra firma .
" we will study how the body behaves , " feustel-büechl said .
" the body ages more quickly in space and bone density diminishes , and that 's an important phenomenon for studying the effects of osteoporosis .
you also have a different distribution of the fluids of the blood and water in the body .
you can study cardiovascular effects or the effects on the brains or eyes . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european physiology modules -lrb- epm -rrb- will be used to test the long-term health effects of space travel on astronauts .
feustel-büechl said that many health phenomena that occur on earth are accelerated in space , which will help scientists to study them more easily and quickly than they could on our own planet .
the same " biolab " facility used to study humans can also be used for experiments on cells , tissue cultures , microorganisms , small plants and invertebrates .

in space , there is no convection , and astronauts in the columbus module can " isolate physical phenomena in a much better way , understanding better , for example , how fluids behave with gases , how combustion works and how melting fluids behave - not just for the textbooks , but also for practical applications in various disciplines and industries . "
in other words , the lessons learned in space could help companies back on earth create new manufacturing techniques .
in addition to the research facilities inside columbus , the module also has four outdoor platforms for experiments .
" these will allow our astronaut scientists to look to the sky for astronomical observations or to look down to earth for observation experiments , " said feustel-büechl .
" we can also conduct experiments with technology that needs to be exposed to space conditions . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 30.07.2004 barroso starts tough job of building commission großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose manuel barroso is building his political legos in brussels just days after his appointment as the eu 's top politician , commission president jose manuel barroso has begun assembling his team .
but unlike other governments , he does n't have the luxury of picking his own . as outgoing european commission president romano prodi whiles his summer days away along the shores of greece , his succesor is spending the summer assembling his new team , which is to be confirmed by the european parliament in september and will begin its term on nov .
1 .
but the former portuguese prime minister , elected by parliament earlier this month , has major limitations in how he can structure his commission .
under eu procedures barrosa can determine what portfolio any given commissioner will receive , but national capitals determine who will represent their countries on the commission .
only five out of the current 20 commissioners will remain in the european executive office come november .
they include viviane reding of luxembourg , margot wallström of sweden , france 's jaques barrot and possibly joaquin almunia of spain - both of whom have only served in brussels for the past few months - as well as germany 's günter verheugen .
super-commissioner verheugen ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter verheugen observers believe that because of verheugen 's -lrb- photo -rrb- experience as commissioner for enlargement , he will , by default , become a sort of " super-commissioner . "
compared to the other candidates , he 's one of the few among the commissioners nominated by the member states who carries considerable political clout .
nevertheless , barroso has rejected the proposals to create a super-commissioner label or any other tiered system of commissioners .
but german chancellor gerhard schröder has expressed his desire for verheugen to take over the commission 's economics portfolio as well as responsibility for implementation of the so-called lisbon agenda , which seeks to make the eu the most industrially , technologically and economically dynamic group of nations in the world by 2010 .
so far the effort has produced meager results .

indeed , most of the large member states are pushing for a more powerful economics portfolio .
currently the competencies are divided among four different commissioners who manage competition policy , the internal market , trade and industrial policy .
due to domestic policy concerns , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi has recalled mario monti , who has had a highly successful stint as competition commissioner , and is instead sending rocco buttiglione . the experienced politician is a member of the italian coalition government 's junior partner , the democratic union of the center , which has lately been on a confrontation course with berlusconi .
france 's jacques barrot is also jockeying for an economics-related commission post at the behest of his mentor , president jacques chirac .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter mandelson has been forced to resign from tony blair 's cabinet in two separate incidences .
now he 's going to represent britain in brussels .
meanwhile , tony blair is sending his scandal-plagued two-time cabinet member peter mandelson -lrb- photo -rrb- to brussels to represent the united kingdom on the commission .
mandelson is considered a close confidante of blair , and he has been selected with the hope that he can increase euroskeptical brits ' interest in brussels in time for the country 's planned referendum on the eu constitution .
the big unknowns the biggest wildcards on the new commission are the ten commissioners from the new eu member states .
they 've already been shadowing the commission since earlier this year without a portfolio , but they have n't made much of a dent in public .
nonetheless , observers in brussels believe poland 's danuta hübner will likely be given one of the more important commission posts .
expanding the commission out of the current 19 commission departments , barroso will now be responsible for creating 24 so that all of the commissioners of the member states will have authority over at least one policy area .
but only 12 of those 24 positions will likely carry much weight - meaning that the smaller member states will likely be given less meaningful competencies in the eu executive , which will hold office through 2009 .
as part of their accession negotiations , the smaller states came to an agreement that the commission should be comprised of one commissioner from each member state , despite that fact that the body , at least in theory , represents eu treaties in an independent , supranational manner without representing the interests of individual countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian foreign minister benita ferrero-waldner one of barroso 's stated goals is to have at least eight women on his team .
if austria decides to send its current foreign minister , benita ferrero-waldner -lrb- photo -rrb- , to brussels , he may come close to that goal .
ferrero-walder recently lost the presidential election and with her on the commission , the number of woman would climb to seven .
opportunity in weakness the relatively weak profile of most of the future eu commissioners could actually represent an opportunity for barroso , who himself was n't even the first choice for the post he now holds .
it 's possible he could excell as a stronger president than those seen on recent commissions .
his predecessor , prodi , gave his commissioners a long leash and considerable room to develop their political independence .
but this also came at a cost , since most viewed prodi as a weak commission president .
barroso plans to complete his jigsaw puzzle of people and competencies by the end of august , when brussels ' core of eurocrats returns from summer vacation . between now and then , he 'll be working the speed dial button to national capitals and he 'll be holding interviews with the commissioners to determine who gets what position .

but the former portuguese prime minister , elected by parliament earlier this month , has major limitations in how he can structure his commission .
under eu procedures barrosa can determine what portfolio any given commissioner will receive , but national capitals determine who will represent their countries on the commission .
only five out of the current 20 commissioners will remain in the european executive office come november .
they include viviane reding of luxembourg , margot wallström of sweden , france 's jaques barrot and possibly joaquin almunia of spain - both of whom have only served in brussels for the past few months - as well as germany 's günter verheugen .
super-commissioner verheugen ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter verheugen observers believe that because of verheugen 's -lrb- photo -rrb- experience as commissioner for enlargement , he will , by default , become a sort of " super-commissioner . "
compared to the other candidates , he 's one of the few among the commissioners nominated by the member states who carries considerable political clout .
nevertheless , barroso has rejected the proposals to create a super-commissioner label or any other tiered system of commissioners .
but german chancellor gerhard schröder has expressed his desire for verheugen to take over the commission 's economics portfolio as well as responsibility for implementation of the so-called lisbon agenda , which seeks to make the eu the most industrially , technologically and economically dynamic group of nations in the world by 2010 .
so far the effort has produced meager results .
under schröder 's vision , verheugen would breathe new life into the lisbon plan and coordinate his activities with the other commissioners .

under eu procedures barrosa can determine what portfolio any given commissioner will receive , but national capitals determine who will represent their countries on the commission .

super-commissioner verheugen ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter verheugen observers believe that because of verheugen 's -lrb- photo -rrb- experience as commissioner for enlargement , he will , by default , become a sort of " super-commissioner . "
compared to the other candidates , he 's one of the few among the commissioners nominated by the member states who carries considerable political clout .
nevertheless , barroso has rejected the proposals to create a super-commissioner label or any other tiered system of commissioners .
but german chancellor gerhard schröder has expressed his desire for verheugen to take over the commission 's economics portfolio as well as responsibility for implementation of the so-called lisbon agenda , which seeks to make the eu the most industrially , technologically and economically dynamic group of nations in the world by 2010 .
so far the effort has produced meager results .
under schröder 's vision , verheugen would breathe new life into the lisbon plan and coordinate his activities with the other commissioners .
indeed , most of the large member states are pushing for a more powerful economics portfolio .
currently the competencies are divided among four different commissioners who manage competition policy , the internal market , trade and industrial policy .
due to domestic policy concerns , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi has recalled mario monti , who has had a highly successful stint as competition commissioner , and is instead sending rocco buttiglione . the experienced politician is a member of the italian coalition government 's junior partner , the democratic union of the center , which has lately been on a confrontation course with berlusconi .
france 's jacques barrot is also jockeying for an economics-related commission post at the behest of his mentor , president jacques chirac .

now he 's going to represent britain in brussels .
meanwhile , tony blair is sending his scandal-plagued two-time cabinet member peter mandelson -lrb- photo -rrb- to brussels to represent the united kingdom on the commission .
mandelson is considered a close confidante of blair , and he has been selected with the hope that he can increase euroskeptical brits ' interest in brussels in time for the country 's planned referendum on the eu constitution .
the big unknowns the biggest wildcards on the new commission are the ten commissioners from the new eu member states .
they 've already been shadowing the commission since earlier this year without a portfolio , but they have n't made much of a dent in public .
nonetheless , observers in brussels believe poland 's danuta hübner will likely be given one of the more important commission posts .
expanding the commission out of the current 19 commission departments , barroso will now be responsible for creating 24 so that all of the commissioners of the member states will have authority over at least one policy area .
but only 12 of those 24 positions will likely carry much weight - meaning that the smaller member states will likely be given less meaningful competencies in the eu executive , which will hold office through 2009 .
as part of their accession negotiations , the smaller states came to an agreement that the commission should be comprised of one commissioner from each member state , despite that fact that the body , at least in theory , represents eu treaties in an independent , supranational manner without representing the interests of individual countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian foreign minister benita ferrero-waldner one of barroso 's stated goals is to have at least eight women on his team .
if austria decides to send its current foreign minister , benita ferrero-waldner -lrb- photo -rrb- , to brussels , he may come close to that goal .
ferrero-walder recently lost the presidential election and with her on the commission , the number of woman would climb to seven .

but it reinforced language on reducing the scope of export credits , which are paid by the united states to its farmers , without calling for their outright elimination . text aimed to placate all members on the sensitive topic of bringing down protective barriers on industrial products ranging from microchips to toys , a key demand by industrialized countries , the text remained largely unchanged .
but wto chief negotiator shotaro oshima added a paragraph in the preamble emphasizing that its provisions still required additional negotiations . that moved in the direction of developing countries , which have refused to give in on market access .
greater access to developing countries ' industrial markets has been a key demand of wealthy countries such as the us and eu in return for reducing support for farmers , which poor countries blame for pricing them out of world markets . five big players agree on farming the world 's poorest countries were also given more leeway with provisions on special treatment .
the united states , european union , australia , brazil and india on thursday struck an agreement on the thorny issue of farming , although it is not clear how much this influenced the revised compromise . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wto general director supachai panitchpakdi , right .
" i welcome the agreement among five key members on the agriculture text , " wto director-general supachai panitchpakdi said in a statement conveyed by a spokesman .
" it is an important input into our negotiations and gives momentum to our efforts at completing negotiations .
but i must caution that no agricultural framework deal is possible without the consensus of all wto member governments . " however , the move annoyed many other countries , while insufficient time has been given to other hot topics such as reducing tariffs on non-farm products .
stalled doha talks are " make or break " for wto " it would be a shame , if for lack of time we do not close a deal that was within reach , at least as far as agriculture goes , " said one diplomat from a developed country in an interview with reuters .
failure to approve the framework this weekend will likely wreck a year-end goal to complete the stalled doha round of trade negotiations as us presidential elections and a shake-up at the european commission loom .
" if this meeting succeeds , it means doha is back on track and it will probably survive all the political changes that are taking place in washington and in brussels , " simon cox of the economist told cnn .
" if it fails , then people will really start to wonder whether the wto system will work . "
the deadline for approval could be postponed until saturday , according to trade sources . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu prepares for wto agriculture talks the eu is going to the wto talks in geneva on tuesday with a common position , despite resistance from france .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 30.07.2004 opinion : can kerry bring the us and europe back together ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is kerry just talk ?
us presidential candidate john kerry officially accepted the democratic nomination on thursday , promising to restore america 's international reputation , and re-bind the fraying ties to europe . for four days the us democrats in boston have been working their hardest to sell john kerry as the man that america wants , needs and can have .
and they - both the candidate himself and the party elite - have done so with the conspicuous absence of pointed anti-bush rhetoric , even though the drive to oust the president from office is the strongest glue to have united the party in a long time . come the elections on november 2 , it will be the undecided voters in the key states and from the political center , who will decide , and now is the time to win them over with a positive message .

germany 's beer drinkers may be seen as world experts , sampling fine hops and acquiring knowledge of the best brews , but a new survey has shown that many just want to get sloshed . they may have the reputation as the beer connoisseurs of europe , if not the world , but a new study sheds a different light on the drinking habits of the hop-loving germans . contrary to the image of the german beer garden full of locals heartily savoring and comparing the qualities of the brews on tap , it has been reveled that a surprising percentage of germany 's drinkers set out on a mission to get drunk . the survey , released this week by independent market research company mintel , shows that almost one in five german adults , or 17 percent , believe the point of drinking is to get plastered .

germany 's beer drinkers may be seen as world experts , sampling fine hops and acquiring knowledge of the best brews , but a new survey has shown that many just want to get sloshed . they may have the reputation as the beer connoisseurs of europe , if not the world , but a new study sheds a different light on the drinking habits of the hop-loving germans . contrary to the image of the german beer garden full of locals heartily savoring and comparing the qualities of the brews on tap , it has been reveled that a surprising percentage of germany 's drinkers set out on a mission to get drunk . the survey , released this week by independent market research company mintel , shows that almost one in five german adults , or 17 percent , believe the point of drinking is to get plastered .
the germans even put the sport-drinking brits to shame , according to the figures .
only eight percent of britons drink to become stupefied , a statistic that could be challenged by a walk down any city center street in the uk on a friday night . " drinking can be more of a low-key social event in britain than some may have believed , " said michelle strutton , consumer analyst at mintel in an interview with news agency ap .
" although germans may not go drinking as often as the british , when they do drink , many do want to get drunk . "
the average german adult drank 255 pints of the liquid throat charmer last year , 35 more pints than his british counterpart , the survey found .
britain has the highest percentage of beer drinkers in europe , with 61 percent of adults - including 82 percent of men .
mintel 's survey of 35,000 consumers covered france , italy , spain , germany and britain .
new markets spain , the third-largest consumer , was the fastest-growing market for beer , but italy was likely to overtake it .
beer consumption in spain grew by 17 percent since 1998 .
fance 's consumption was down 13 percent since 1998 , though sales of premium beers were holding their own .
in the united states , annual consumption per person in 2002 was around 175 pints , according to industry figures . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de crying in your beer german beer day on april 23 celebrates germany 's famous reinheitsgebot , or beer purity law , which was established in 1516 .
unfortunately the country 's proud brewing tradition has n't helped the industry compete globally .
-lrb- april 23 , 2004 -rrb- german superiority succumbs to czech hospitality once renowned as the world 's most prolific nation of beer drinkers , germany has slipped from its pedestal .
the reason could be that more and more germans are crossing the border to sample the barley water of prague .

germany 's beer drinkers may be seen as world experts , sampling fine hops and acquiring knowledge of the best brews , but a new survey has shown that many just want to get sloshed . they may have the reputation as the beer connoisseurs of europe , if not the world , but a new study sheds a different light on the drinking habits of the hop-loving germans . contrary to the image of the german beer garden full of locals heartily savoring and comparing the qualities of the brews on tap , it has been reveled that a surprising percentage of germany 's drinkers set out on a mission to get drunk . the survey , released this week by independent market research company mintel , shows that almost one in five german adults , or 17 percent , believe the point of drinking is to get plastered .
the germans even put the sport-drinking brits to shame , according to the figures .
only eight percent of britons drink to become stupefied , a statistic that could be challenged by a walk down any city center street in the uk on a friday night . " drinking can be more of a low-key social event in britain than some may have believed , " said michelle strutton , consumer analyst at mintel in an interview with news agency ap .
" although germans may not go drinking as often as the british , when they do drink , many do want to get drunk . "
the average german adult drank 255 pints of the liquid throat charmer last year , 35 more pints than his british counterpart , the survey found .
britain has the highest percentage of beer drinkers in europe , with 61 percent of adults - including 82 percent of men .
mintel 's survey of 35,000 consumers covered france , italy , spain , germany and britain .
new markets spain , the third-largest consumer , was the fastest-growing market for beer , but italy was likely to overtake it .
beer consumption in spain grew by 17 percent since 1998 .
fance 's consumption was down 13 percent since 1998 , though sales of premium beers were holding their own .
in the united states , annual consumption per person in 2002 was around 175 pints , according to industry figures . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de crying in your beer german beer day on april 23 celebrates germany 's famous reinheitsgebot , or beer purity law , which was established in 1516 .
unfortunately the country 's proud brewing tradition has n't helped the industry compete globally .

the reason could be that more and more germans are crossing the border to sample the barley water of prague .

us presidential candidate john kerry officially accepted the democratic nomination on thursday , promising to restore america 's international reputation , and re-bind the fraying ties to europe . for four days the us democrats in boston have been working their hardest to sell john kerry as the man that america wants , needs and can have .
and they - both the candidate himself and the party elite - have done so with the conspicuous absence of pointed anti-bush rhetoric , even though the drive to oust the president from office is the strongest glue to have united the party in a long time . come the elections on november 2 , it will be the undecided voters in the key states and from the political center , who will decide , and now is the time to win them over with a positive message .
with this in mind , the democrats in boston presented themselves as guardians of the the old american ideals , as a regenerative strength which would both close the divide on home ground and win back america 's tarred international reputation . they did everything they could to present john kerry as an experienced politician , a high- principled soul , and a man who knows how to protect america effectively .
the latter is crucial to the american electorate , which lives in fear of suffering an historic defeat in the fight against terrorism . vietnam hero kerry 's supporters and fellow democrats doused him in glory , touting him as hero of the vietnam war , a selfless savior and a courageous leader .
the praise was designed to serve as a contrast to the alleged slacker , george w bush , whose service in the military home reserves is inadequately documented . this overemphasis of the presidential candidate as commander-in-chief , who as supreme commander of the us forces , would unquestionably rise to the challenge , takes its relevance from september 11th , a defining moment in america 's recent history . simultaneously , kerry reflects the desperate efforts on the part of the democrats , to compensate for the gaps in president bush 's and the republicans ' policies on national security .
some of these verbal attempts were so brash , that they left a nasty taste among some european observers , as did the overall circus and show character of the whole event . vague policies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : candidate for vice-president john edwards the party conference also served to dash any premature hopes that as president , john kerry would return america to a " gentle power " , silencing its military might in favor of strengthened diplomacy and international understanding - even if kerry did make a point of stressing that he would help lead america back to a more international image .
but over and above this , many of kerry 's policies remained vague .
how is he planning to dry up the quagmire of iraq , how is he planning to get north korea and iran to give up on their nuclear policies ? the old standard-bearer of the democratic party 's leftwing , senator ted kennedy , cut to the chase , when he said that the only thing the democrats fear is another four years of george w bush in the white house .
as far as the democrats are concerned , a second term under the current president has to be avoided at all costs , and laying down the line on foreign policy issues wo n't help the cause . so instead , kerry and his running mate john edwards sold themselves as the social conscience of the nation , and their followers came flocking .
but whether this act will be powerful enough to prevent bush from laying down his cap for another four years , is highly questionable .
when in doubt , voters will be more easily swayed back to the devil they know than convinced into supporting his diluted double . daniel scheschkewitz -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us voters in germany get rallying call the us presidential election in november is expected to be one of the closest contests in the country 's history .

the latter is crucial to the american electorate , which lives in fear of suffering an historic defeat in the fight against terrorism . vietnam hero kerry 's supporters and fellow democrats doused him in glory , touting him as hero of the vietnam war , a selfless savior and a courageous leader .
the praise was designed to serve as a contrast to the alleged slacker , george w bush , whose service in the military home reserves is inadequately documented . this overemphasis of the presidential candidate as commander-in-chief , who as supreme commander of the us forces , would unquestionably rise to the challenge , takes its relevance from september 11th , a defining moment in america 's recent history . simultaneously , kerry reflects the desperate efforts on the part of the democrats , to compensate for the gaps in president bush 's and the republicans ' policies on national security .
some of these verbal attempts were so brash , that they left a nasty taste among some european observers , as did the overall circus and show character of the whole event . vague policies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : candidate for vice-president john edwards the party conference also served to dash any premature hopes that as president , john kerry would return america to a " gentle power " , silencing its military might in favor of strengthened diplomacy and international understanding - even if kerry did make a point of stressing that he would help lead america back to a more international image .
but over and above this , many of kerry 's policies remained vague .
how is he planning to dry up the quagmire of iraq , how is he planning to get north korea and iran to give up on their nuclear policies ? the old standard-bearer of the democratic party 's leftwing , senator ted kennedy , cut to the chase , when he said that the only thing the democrats fear is another four years of george w bush in the white house .
as far as the democrats are concerned , a second term under the current president has to be avoided at all costs , and laying down the line on foreign policy issues wo n't help the cause . so instead , kerry and his running mate john edwards sold themselves as the social conscience of the nation , and their followers came flocking .
but whether this act will be powerful enough to prevent bush from laying down his cap for another four years , is highly questionable .
when in doubt , voters will be more easily swayed back to the devil they know than convinced into supporting his diluted double . daniel scheschkewitz -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us voters in germany get rallying call the us presidential election in november is expected to be one of the closest contests in the country 's history .
every vote will count which is why organizations overseas are rallying voters abroad to participate .

the findings could aid preparations for the first manned mars voyage . after space shuttle flights resume in 2005 , one of the early payloads will be the european space agency 's columbus research module . the cylindrical module , which looks like an outsized soda can , is coming together in a large assembly hall at eads space transportation , a subsidiary of airbus maker eads , in the northern german city of bremen .

columbus was originally scheduled to be launched this year , but the delay has given the project 's scientists and engineers more time to conduct testing and to make the research laboratory more flexible to accommodate future experiments .
afterall , unlike an airplane , engineers do n't have the luxury of doing test-flights on columbus - it has to work from day one .
the 4.5-meter -lrb- 14.76 feet -rrb- cylindrical module , which weighs about 450 tons and has a floor space of 75 cubic meters , is packed with scientific experiments covering the fields of biology , biotechnology , human physiology , material science and fluid science .

in rough terms , we will have 100 times more capability to do experiments than we ever had before , " said jörg feustel-büechl , esa 's director of manned spaceflight .
columbus can fit up to three astronauts working in the unit 's zero-gravity conditions .
astronauts as zero-gravity guinea pigs among the primary goals of columbus is to study the effects of long-term space travel on the human body .
in order to send astronauts to the moon or mars for long periods , scientists and medical experts must first learns ways to counter the aging effects of space travel as well as prolonged exposure to increased radiation from the sun .
the studies could also aid medical researchers treating illnesses on terra firma .
" we will study how the body behaves , " feustel-büechl said .
" the body ages more quickly in space and bone density diminishes , and that 's an important phenomenon for studying the effects of osteoporosis .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european physiology modules -lrb- epm -rrb- will be used to test the long-term health effects of space travel on astronauts .
feustel-büechl said that many health phenomena that occur on earth are accelerated in space , which will help scientists to study them more easily and quickly than they could on our own planet .
the same " biolab " facility used to study humans can also be used for experiments on cells , tissue cultures , microorganisms , small plants and invertebrates .
benefits for business the esa scientist said the laboratory would also be important for studying material science .
in space , there is no convection , and astronauts in the columbus module can " isolate physical phenomena in a much better way , understanding better , for example , how fluids behave with gases , how combustion works and how melting fluids behave - not just for the textbooks , but also for practical applications in various disciplines and industries . "
in other words , the lessons learned in space could help companies back on earth create new manufacturing techniques .
in addition to the research facilities inside columbus , the module also has four outdoor platforms for experiments .
" these will allow our astronaut scientists to look to the sky for astronomical observations or to look down to earth for observation experiments , " said feustel-büechl .

columbus laboratory and electrical test models in the integration hall in bremen , germany .
columbus was originally scheduled to be launched this year , but the delay has given the project 's scientists and engineers more time to conduct testing and to make the research laboratory more flexible to accommodate future experiments .
afterall , unlike an airplane , engineers do n't have the luxury of doing test-flights on columbus - it has to work from day one .
the 4.5-meter -lrb- 14.76 feet -rrb- cylindrical module , which weighs about 450 tons and has a floor space of 75 cubic meters , is packed with scientific experiments covering the fields of biology , biotechnology , human physiology , material science and fluid science .

in rough terms , we will have 100 times more capability to do experiments than we ever had before , " said jörg feustel-büechl , esa 's director of manned spaceflight .
columbus can fit up to three astronauts working in the unit 's zero-gravity conditions .
astronauts as zero-gravity guinea pigs among the primary goals of columbus is to study the effects of long-term space travel on the human body .
in order to send astronauts to the moon or mars for long periods , scientists and medical experts must first learns ways to counter the aging effects of space travel as well as prolonged exposure to increased radiation from the sun .
the studies could also aid medical researchers treating illnesses on terra firma .
" we will study how the body behaves , " feustel-büechl said .
" the body ages more quickly in space and bone density diminishes , and that 's an important phenomenon for studying the effects of osteoporosis .
you also have a different distribution of the fluids of the blood and water in the body .
you can study cardiovascular effects or the effects on the brains or eyes . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european physiology modules -lrb- epm -rrb- will be used to test the long-term health effects of space travel on astronauts .
feustel-büechl said that many health phenomena that occur on earth are accelerated in space , which will help scientists to study them more easily and quickly than they could on our own planet .
the same " biolab " facility used to study humans can also be used for experiments on cells , tissue cultures , microorganisms , small plants and invertebrates .

in space , there is no convection , and astronauts in the columbus module can " isolate physical phenomena in a much better way , understanding better , for example , how fluids behave with gases , how combustion works and how melting fluids behave - not just for the textbooks , but also for practical applications in various disciplines and industries . "
in other words , the lessons learned in space could help companies back on earth create new manufacturing techniques .
in addition to the research facilities inside columbus , the module also has four outdoor platforms for experiments .
" these will allow our astronaut scientists to look to the sky for astronomical observations or to look down to earth for observation experiments , " said feustel-büechl .
" we can also conduct experiments with technology that needs to be exposed to space conditions . "

germany 's beer drinkers may be seen as world experts , sampling fine hops and acquiring knowledge of the best brews , but a new survey has shown that many just want to get sloshed . they may have the reputation as the beer connoisseurs of europe , if not the world , but a new study sheds a different light on the drinking habits of the hop-loving germans . contrary to the image of the german beer garden full of locals heartily savoring and comparing the qualities of the brews on tap , it has been reveled that a surprising percentage of germany 's drinkers set out on a mission to get drunk . the survey , released this week by independent market research company mintel , shows that almost one in five german adults , or 17 percent , believe the point of drinking is to get plastered .
the germans even put the sport-drinking brits to shame , according to the figures .
only eight percent of britons drink to become stupefied , a statistic that could be challenged by a walk down any city center street in the uk on a friday night . " drinking can be more of a low-key social event in britain than some may have believed , " said michelle strutton , consumer analyst at mintel in an interview with news agency ap .
" although germans may not go drinking as often as the british , when they do drink , many do want to get drunk . "
the average german adult drank 255 pints of the liquid throat charmer last year , 35 more pints than his british counterpart , the survey found .
britain has the highest percentage of beer drinkers in europe , with 61 percent of adults - including 82 percent of men .
mintel 's survey of 35,000 consumers covered france , italy , spain , germany and britain .
new markets spain , the third-largest consumer , was the fastest-growing market for beer , but italy was likely to overtake it .
beer consumption in spain grew by 17 percent since 1998 .
fance 's consumption was down 13 percent since 1998 , though sales of premium beers were holding their own .
in the united states , annual consumption per person in 2002 was around 175 pints , according to industry figures . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de crying in your beer german beer day on april 23 celebrates germany 's famous reinheitsgebot , or beer purity law , which was established in 1516 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 30.07.2004 barroso starts tough job of building commission großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose manuel barroso is building his political legos in brussels just days after his appointment as the eu 's top politician , commission president jose manuel barroso has begun assembling his team .
but unlike other governments , he does n't have the luxury of picking his own . as outgoing european commission president romano prodi whiles his summer days away along the shores of greece , his succesor is spending the summer assembling his new team , which is to be confirmed by the european parliament in september and will begin its term on nov .
1 .
but the former portuguese prime minister , elected by parliament earlier this month , has major limitations in how he can structure his commission .
under eu procedures barrosa can determine what portfolio any given commissioner will receive , but national capitals determine who will represent their countries on the commission .
only five out of the current 20 commissioners will remain in the european executive office come november .
they include viviane reding of luxembourg , margot wallström of sweden , france 's jaques barrot and possibly joaquin almunia of spain - both of whom have only served in brussels for the past few months - as well as germany 's günter verheugen .
super-commissioner verheugen ?

but unlike other governments , he does n't have the luxury of picking his own . as outgoing european commission president romano prodi whiles his summer days away along the shores of greece , his succesor is spending the summer assembling his new team , which is to be confirmed by the european parliament in september and will begin its term on nov .
1 .
but the former portuguese prime minister , elected by parliament earlier this month , has major limitations in how he can structure his commission .
under eu procedures barrosa can determine what portfolio any given commissioner will receive , but national capitals determine who will represent their countries on the commission .
only five out of the current 20 commissioners will remain in the european executive office come november .
they include viviane reding of luxembourg , margot wallström of sweden , france 's jaques barrot and possibly joaquin almunia of spain - both of whom have only served in brussels for the past few months - as well as germany 's günter verheugen .
super-commissioner verheugen ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter verheugen observers believe that because of verheugen 's -lrb- photo -rrb- experience as commissioner for enlargement , he will , by default , become a sort of " super-commissioner . "
compared to the other candidates , he 's one of the few among the commissioners nominated by the member states who carries considerable political clout .
nevertheless , barroso has rejected the proposals to create a super-commissioner label or any other tiered system of commissioners .
but german chancellor gerhard schröder has expressed his desire for verheugen to take over the commission 's economics portfolio as well as responsibility for implementation of the so-called lisbon agenda , which seeks to make the eu the most industrially , technologically and economically dynamic group of nations in the world by 2010 .
so far the effort has produced meager results .
under schröder 's vision , verheugen would breathe new life into the lisbon plan and coordinate his activities with the other commissioners .
indeed , most of the large member states are pushing for a more powerful economics portfolio .
currently the competencies are divided among four different commissioners who manage competition policy , the internal market , trade and industrial policy .
due to domestic policy concerns , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi has recalled mario monti , who has had a highly successful stint as competition commissioner , and is instead sending rocco buttiglione . the experienced politician is a member of the italian coalition government 's junior partner , the democratic union of the center , which has lately been on a confrontation course with berlusconi .
france 's jacques barrot is also jockeying for an economics-related commission post at the behest of his mentor , president jacques chirac .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter mandelson has been forced to resign from tony blair 's cabinet in two separate incidences .
now he 's going to represent britain in brussels .
meanwhile , tony blair is sending his scandal-plagued two-time cabinet member peter mandelson -lrb- photo -rrb- to brussels to represent the united kingdom on the commission .
mandelson is considered a close confidante of blair , and he has been selected with the hope that he can increase euroskeptical brits ' interest in brussels in time for the country 's planned referendum on the eu constitution .
the big unknowns the biggest wildcards on the new commission are the ten commissioners from the new eu member states .
they 've already been shadowing the commission since earlier this year without a portfolio , but they have n't made much of a dent in public .
nonetheless , observers in brussels believe poland 's danuta hübner will likely be given one of the more important commission posts .
expanding the commission out of the current 19 commission departments , barroso will now be responsible for creating 24 so that all of the commissioners of the member states will have authority over at least one policy area .
but only 12 of those 24 positions will likely carry much weight - meaning that the smaller member states will likely be given less meaningful competencies in the eu executive , which will hold office through 2009 .
as part of their accession negotiations , the smaller states came to an agreement that the commission should be comprised of one commissioner from each member state , despite that fact that the body , at least in theory , represents eu treaties in an independent , supranational manner without representing the interests of individual countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian foreign minister benita ferrero-waldner one of barroso 's stated goals is to have at least eight women on his team .
if austria decides to send its current foreign minister , benita ferrero-waldner -lrb- photo -rrb- , to brussels , he may come close to that goal .
ferrero-walder recently lost the presidential election and with her on the commission , the number of woman would climb to seven .
opportunity in weakness the relatively weak profile of most of the future eu commissioners could actually represent an opportunity for barroso , who himself was n't even the first choice for the post he now holds .
it 's possible he could excell as a stronger president than those seen on recent commissions .
his predecessor , prodi , gave his commissioners a long leash and considerable room to develop their political independence .
but this also came at a cost , since most viewed prodi as a weak commission president .
barroso plans to complete his jigsaw puzzle of people and competencies by the end of august , when brussels ' core of eurocrats returns from summer vacation . between now and then , he 'll be working the speed dial button to national capitals and he 'll be holding interviews with the commissioners to determine who gets what position .
in the worst-case scenario , barroso has said , he will take advantage of his ability to reject or fire candidates with insufficient experience - a right that was first cemented in the recently ratified treaty of nice . bernd riegert , brussels -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu parliament confirms barroso the european parliament has confirmed jose barroso as the next president of the european commission on thursday .

german spelling is once again at the center of political debate , despite the fact that an across-the-board reform went into effect six years ago . " i would rather decline two drinks than one german verb , " mark twain famously wrote in his essay the awful german language .
but germans do n't need an american to tell them that their language is difficult - they know it themselves .
and they 're working on it .
several years ago , amid much controversy , germany -lrb- and switzerland and austria -rrb- decided to tackle the problem .
in 1998 , after decades of failed attempts , a committee pushed through a raft of changes known as the rechtschreibreform -lrb- spelling reform . -rrb-
the new rules were first applied in a transition phase , but are slated to become mandatory on august 1 , 2005 .
the changes aim to iron out some of the quirks in the language , and include various spelling changes such as using " ss " instead of the " ß " character .
they also thin out the hundreds of complex rules regarding the use of commas .
' unnecessary as gout ' but what started out as a simple effort to make life easier for the masses seems to have turned into a political hot potato .
the premiers of five german states - all of them members of the conservative opposition - have gone on record in recent weeks saying they want the government to reconsider the reforms .
common complaints : the new rules are confusing , and people are n't putting them into practice .
along with the politicians , several well known german writers , including nobel prize winner günther grass and poet and essayist hans magnus enzensberger have come out against the reform .
swiss author adolf muschg told the bild-zeitung newspaper : " the spelling reform must be stopped immediately .
it is as unnecessary as gout , has brought no improvement , and instead made people more uncertain . "
the german government has stuck to its guns , however , saying the reforms will go through as planned .
thomas steg , deputy spokesman for the government , told the dpa press agency that it would be " nonsense " to revisit the issue now .
after years of debate , " now the decisions that have been made should be put into effect consistently , " he said , and added : " the reaction of certain of the -lrb- state -rrb- premiers seems strange to me . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's leading dictionary marked all spelling changes in red in its 1996 edition .
for the most part , publishers , schools , and civil servants have long since adapted to the new system .
some 90 percent of new books are published using the reformed spelling rules .
felizitas liemersdorf , the principal of an elementary school in cologne , said it would be " nonsense " for the reforms to be rescinded now .
she admitted that the reforms were problematic from the get-go , saying they were " neither logical nor far reaching enough . "
however , like educators throughout the country , liemersdorf had no choice other than make sure the new rules were being applied in the classroom .
high cost of change " the first problem is , they were n't mandatory for everyone .
just take a look at our good old faz ! " she said , referring to the leading german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , which continues to publish under the old style .
but nonetheless , to go back to the old ways after six years would be " absurd , " liemersdorf said .
" can you imagine the cost ?
there would be a huge outcry .
we already replaced books - readers , worksheets , dictionaries , reference books . all the new books for classrooms are in the new style . "
too many critics to ignore to date , just one member of the federal government - culture minister christina weiss - has spoken out in favor of reviewing the reform issue .
in a conversation with the faz , weiss said it makes sense to give the rules another look before they become final .
she called the new rules " confusing and nonsensical , " and noted that " there are too many critics to just ignore them . "
" until the transition phase is over , on july 31 , 2005 , we still have the chance to think about the new rules .
i see a chance to clarify problematic issues , " weiss told the faz - the same newspaper that refuses to adopt the new spelling .
weiss suggests throwing the issue in the lap of the kmk , or kultusministerkonferenz - the group in charge of education policy on issues that go beyond state .
and indeed , because a conservative committee member has requested it , the issue will stand on the agenda when the group next meets , in october .
debate a ' senseless waste ' ?
noting that the group just voted unanimously in favor of the reforms in june , kmk president doris ahnen told the ddp news agency she finds it " somewhat strange " that one of her colleagues requested bringing the topic back to life .
moreover , she said , she does n't believe anything will change , even after another debate .
" most of the ministers in the committee are still in favor of the reforms , and are in favor of making them mandatory next august , " she stressed .
a representative of the german journalists ' association -lrb- djv -rrb- told news agencies that his group is in favor of keeping the reform .
rescinding it at this point would be " a senseless waste of money , " djv chairman michael konken said .
konken said the whole debate should go back to where it came from : the " sommerloch " - the big summer news hole that german politicians know is always good for press in the slow season . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de coming to terms with germany 's new spelling reform five years after germany 's controversial spelling reforms were introduced , many germans are still confused by the new spelling rules , while others simply refuse to use them .

german spelling is once again at the center of political debate , despite the fact that an across-the-board reform went into effect six years ago . " i would rather decline two drinks than one german verb , " mark twain famously wrote in his essay the awful german language .
but germans do n't need an american to tell them that their language is difficult - they know it themselves .
and they 're working on it .
several years ago , amid much controversy , germany -lrb- and switzerland and austria -rrb- decided to tackle the problem .
in 1998 , after decades of failed attempts , a committee pushed through a raft of changes known as the rechtschreibreform -lrb- spelling reform . -rrb-
the new rules were first applied in a transition phase , but are slated to become mandatory on august 1 , 2005 .
the changes aim to iron out some of the quirks in the language , and include various spelling changes such as using " ss " instead of the " ß " character .
they also thin out the hundreds of complex rules regarding the use of commas .
' unnecessary as gout ' but what started out as a simple effort to make life easier for the masses seems to have turned into a political hot potato .
the premiers of five german states - all of them members of the conservative opposition - have gone on record in recent weeks saying they want the government to reconsider the reforms .
common complaints : the new rules are confusing , and people are n't putting them into practice .
along with the politicians , several well known german writers , including nobel prize winner günther grass and poet and essayist hans magnus enzensberger have come out against the reform .
swiss author adolf muschg told the bild-zeitung newspaper : " the spelling reform must be stopped immediately .
it is as unnecessary as gout , has brought no improvement , and instead made people more uncertain . "
the german government has stuck to its guns , however , saying the reforms will go through as planned .
thomas steg , deputy spokesman for the government , told the dpa press agency that it would be " nonsense " to revisit the issue now .
after years of debate , " now the decisions that have been made should be put into effect consistently , " he said , and added : " the reaction of certain of the -lrb- state -rrb- premiers seems strange to me . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's leading dictionary marked all spelling changes in red in its 1996 edition .
for the most part , publishers , schools , and civil servants have long since adapted to the new system .
some 90 percent of new books are published using the reformed spelling rules .
felizitas liemersdorf , the principal of an elementary school in cologne , said it would be " nonsense " for the reforms to be rescinded now .
she admitted that the reforms were problematic from the get-go , saying they were " neither logical nor far reaching enough . "
however , like educators throughout the country , liemersdorf had no choice other than make sure the new rules were being applied in the classroom .
high cost of change " the first problem is , they were n't mandatory for everyone .
just take a look at our good old faz ! " she said , referring to the leading german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , which continues to publish under the old style .
but nonetheless , to go back to the old ways after six years would be " absurd , " liemersdorf said .
" can you imagine the cost ?
there would be a huge outcry .
we already replaced books - readers , worksheets , dictionaries , reference books . all the new books for classrooms are in the new style . "
too many critics to ignore to date , just one member of the federal government - culture minister christina weiss - has spoken out in favor of reviewing the reform issue .
in a conversation with the faz , weiss said it makes sense to give the rules another look before they become final .
she called the new rules " confusing and nonsensical , " and noted that " there are too many critics to just ignore them . "
" until the transition phase is over , on july 31 , 2005 , we still have the chance to think about the new rules .
i see a chance to clarify problematic issues , " weiss told the faz - the same newspaper that refuses to adopt the new spelling .
weiss suggests throwing the issue in the lap of the kmk , or kultusministerkonferenz - the group in charge of education policy on issues that go beyond state .
and indeed , because a conservative committee member has requested it , the issue will stand on the agenda when the group next meets , in october .
debate a ' senseless waste ' ?
noting that the group just voted unanimously in favor of the reforms in june , kmk president doris ahnen told the ddp news agency she finds it " somewhat strange " that one of her colleagues requested bringing the topic back to life .
moreover , she said , she does n't believe anything will change , even after another debate .
" most of the ministers in the committee are still in favor of the reforms , and are in favor of making them mandatory next august , " she stressed .
a representative of the german journalists ' association -lrb- djv -rrb- told news agencies that his group is in favor of keeping the reform .
rescinding it at this point would be " a senseless waste of money , " djv chairman michael konken said .
konken said the whole debate should go back to where it came from : the " sommerloch " - the big summer news hole that german politicians know is always good for press in the slow season . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de coming to terms with germany 's new spelling reform five years after germany 's controversial spelling reforms were introduced , many germans are still confused by the new spelling rules , while others simply refuse to use them .

once it starts flying , it will deliver food , water and fuel to the astronauts . named after french author jules verne , the originator of modern science fiction , europe 's first " automated transfer vehicle , " is scheduled to launch aboard an ariane 5 rocket in september 2005 .
the introduction of the spacecraft , which will ferry supplies including food , parts , fuel , water and even mail to the international space station will help take the burden off the space shuttle fleet , which currently transports the bulk of payloads and astronauts .
" we ’ re particularly excited about the atv , because it will help close the gaps if the space shuttle is not flying , " said sigmar wittig , chairman of the executive board of the german aerospace center , which is funding about 41 percent of europe 's contribution to the iss .

the cylindrical vessel weighs 20 tons and measures 10.3 meters long -lrb- 33.79 feet -rrb- and 4.5 meters in diameter . after a journey of up to five days , it will dock with the space station 's russian service module using a precision laser tracking system that looks like a scene straight out of " star wars . "
the atv holds tanks that can carry 840 kilograms of water , 860 kilograms of refuelling propellant for the iss ' propulsion system and 100 kilograms of oxygen .
the spacecraft also has thrusters that will be used to boost the space station 's altitude every 10 to 45 days .

germany 's beer drinkers may be seen as world experts , sampling fine hops and acquiring knowledge of the best brews , but a new survey has shown that many just want to get sloshed . they may have the reputation as the beer connoisseurs of europe , if not the world , but a new study sheds a different light on the drinking habits of the hop-loving germans . contrary to the image of the german beer garden full of locals heartily savoring and comparing the qualities of the brews on tap , it has been reveled that a surprising percentage of germany 's drinkers set out on a mission to get drunk . the survey , released this week by independent market research company mintel , shows that almost one in five german adults , or 17 percent , believe the point of drinking is to get plastered .
the germans even put the sport-drinking brits to shame , according to the figures .
only eight percent of britons drink to become stupefied , a statistic that could be challenged by a walk down any city center street in the uk on a friday night . " drinking can be more of a low-key social event in britain than some may have believed , " said michelle strutton , consumer analyst at mintel in an interview with news agency ap .
" although germans may not go drinking as often as the british , when they do drink , many do want to get drunk . "
the average german adult drank 255 pints of the liquid throat charmer last year , 35 more pints than his british counterpart , the survey found .
britain has the highest percentage of beer drinkers in europe , with 61 percent of adults - including 82 percent of men .
mintel 's survey of 35,000 consumers covered france , italy , spain , germany and britain .
new markets spain , the third-largest consumer , was the fastest-growing market for beer , but italy was likely to overtake it .
beer consumption in spain grew by 17 percent since 1998 .
fance 's consumption was down 13 percent since 1998 , though sales of premium beers were holding their own .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 30.07.2004 german spelling debate reignites großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new rules : simpler , or simply more confusing ?
german spelling is once again at the center of political debate , despite the fact that an across-the-board reform went into effect six years ago . " i would rather decline two drinks than one german verb , " mark twain famously wrote in his essay the awful german language .
but germans do n't need an american to tell them that their language is difficult - they know it themselves .
and they 're working on it .
several years ago , amid much controversy , germany -lrb- and switzerland and austria -rrb- decided to tackle the problem .
in 1998 , after decades of failed attempts , a committee pushed through a raft of changes known as the rechtschreibreform -lrb- spelling reform . -rrb-
the new rules were first applied in a transition phase , but are slated to become mandatory on august 1 , 2005 .
the changes aim to iron out some of the quirks in the language , and include various spelling changes such as using " ss " instead of the " ß " character .
they also thin out the hundreds of complex rules regarding the use of commas .
' unnecessary as gout ' but what started out as a simple effort to make life easier for the masses seems to have turned into a political hot potato .
the premiers of five german states - all of them members of the conservative opposition - have gone on record in recent weeks saying they want the government to reconsider the reforms .
common complaints : the new rules are confusing , and people are n't putting them into practice .
along with the politicians , several well known german writers , including nobel prize winner günther grass and poet and essayist hans magnus enzensberger have come out against the reform .
swiss author adolf muschg told the bild-zeitung newspaper : " the spelling reform must be stopped immediately .
it is as unnecessary as gout , has brought no improvement , and instead made people more uncertain . "
the german government has stuck to its guns , however , saying the reforms will go through as planned .
thomas steg , deputy spokesman for the government , told the dpa press agency that it would be " nonsense " to revisit the issue now .
after years of debate , " now the decisions that have been made should be put into effect consistently , " he said , and added : " the reaction of certain of the -lrb- state -rrb- premiers seems strange to me . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's leading dictionary marked all spelling changes in red in its 1996 edition .
for the most part , publishers , schools , and civil servants have long since adapted to the new system .
some 90 percent of new books are published using the reformed spelling rules .
felizitas liemersdorf , the principal of an elementary school in cologne , said it would be " nonsense " for the reforms to be rescinded now .
she admitted that the reforms were problematic from the get-go , saying they were " neither logical nor far reaching enough . "
however , like educators throughout the country , liemersdorf had no choice other than make sure the new rules were being applied in the classroom .
high cost of change " the first problem is , they were n't mandatory for everyone .
just take a look at our good old faz ! " she said , referring to the leading german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , which continues to publish under the old style .
but nonetheless , to go back to the old ways after six years would be " absurd , " liemersdorf said .
" can you imagine the cost ?
there would be a huge outcry .
we already replaced books - readers , worksheets , dictionaries , reference books . all the new books for classrooms are in the new style . "
too many critics to ignore to date , just one member of the federal government - culture minister christina weiss - has spoken out in favor of reviewing the reform issue .
in a conversation with the faz , weiss said it makes sense to give the rules another look before they become final .
she called the new rules " confusing and nonsensical , " and noted that " there are too many critics to just ignore them . "
" until the transition phase is over , on july 31 , 2005 , we still have the chance to think about the new rules .
i see a chance to clarify problematic issues , " weiss told the faz - the same newspaper that refuses to adopt the new spelling .
weiss suggests throwing the issue in the lap of the kmk , or kultusministerkonferenz - the group in charge of education policy on issues that go beyond state .
and indeed , because a conservative committee member has requested it , the issue will stand on the agenda when the group next meets , in october .
debate a ' senseless waste ' ?
noting that the group just voted unanimously in favor of the reforms in june , kmk president doris ahnen told the ddp news agency she finds it " somewhat strange " that one of her colleagues requested bringing the topic back to life .
moreover , she said , she does n't believe anything will change , even after another debate .
" most of the ministers in the committee are still in favor of the reforms , and are in favor of making them mandatory next august , " she stressed .
a representative of the german journalists ' association -lrb- djv -rrb- told news agencies that his group is in favor of keeping the reform .
rescinding it at this point would be " a senseless waste of money , " djv chairman michael konken said .
konken said the whole debate should go back to where it came from : the " sommerloch " - the big summer news hole that german politicians know is always good for press in the slow season . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de coming to terms with germany 's new spelling reform five years after germany 's controversial spelling reforms were introduced , many germans are still confused by the new spelling rules , while others simply refuse to use them .

german spelling is once again at the center of political debate , despite the fact that an across-the-board reform went into effect six years ago . " i would rather decline two drinks than one german verb , " mark twain famously wrote in his essay the awful german language .
but germans do n't need an american to tell them that their language is difficult - they know it themselves .
and they 're working on it .
several years ago , amid much controversy , germany -lrb- and switzerland and austria -rrb- decided to tackle the problem .
in 1998 , after decades of failed attempts , a committee pushed through a raft of changes known as the rechtschreibreform -lrb- spelling reform . -rrb-
the new rules were first applied in a transition phase , but are slated to become mandatory on august 1 , 2005 .
the changes aim to iron out some of the quirks in the language , and include various spelling changes such as using " ss " instead of the " ß " character .
they also thin out the hundreds of complex rules regarding the use of commas .
' unnecessary as gout ' but what started out as a simple effort to make life easier for the masses seems to have turned into a political hot potato .
the premiers of five german states - all of them members of the conservative opposition - have gone on record in recent weeks saying they want the government to reconsider the reforms .
common complaints : the new rules are confusing , and people are n't putting them into practice .
along with the politicians , several well known german writers , including nobel prize winner günther grass and poet and essayist hans magnus enzensberger have come out against the reform .
swiss author adolf muschg told the bild-zeitung newspaper : " the spelling reform must be stopped immediately .
it is as unnecessary as gout , has brought no improvement , and instead made people more uncertain . "
the german government has stuck to its guns , however , saying the reforms will go through as planned .
thomas steg , deputy spokesman for the government , told the dpa press agency that it would be " nonsense " to revisit the issue now .
after years of debate , " now the decisions that have been made should be put into effect consistently , " he said , and added : " the reaction of certain of the -lrb- state -rrb- premiers seems strange to me . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's leading dictionary marked all spelling changes in red in its 1996 edition .
for the most part , publishers , schools , and civil servants have long since adapted to the new system .
some 90 percent of new books are published using the reformed spelling rules .
felizitas liemersdorf , the principal of an elementary school in cologne , said it would be " nonsense " for the reforms to be rescinded now .
she admitted that the reforms were problematic from the get-go , saying they were " neither logical nor far reaching enough . "
however , like educators throughout the country , liemersdorf had no choice other than make sure the new rules were being applied in the classroom .
high cost of change " the first problem is , they were n't mandatory for everyone .
just take a look at our good old faz ! " she said , referring to the leading german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , which continues to publish under the old style .
but nonetheless , to go back to the old ways after six years would be " absurd , " liemersdorf said .
" can you imagine the cost ?
there would be a huge outcry .
we already replaced books - readers , worksheets , dictionaries , reference books . all the new books for classrooms are in the new style . "
too many critics to ignore to date , just one member of the federal government - culture minister christina weiss - has spoken out in favor of reviewing the reform issue .
in a conversation with the faz , weiss said it makes sense to give the rules another look before they become final .
she called the new rules " confusing and nonsensical , " and noted that " there are too many critics to just ignore them . "
" until the transition phase is over , on july 31 , 2005 , we still have the chance to think about the new rules .
i see a chance to clarify problematic issues , " weiss told the faz - the same newspaper that refuses to adopt the new spelling .
weiss suggests throwing the issue in the lap of the kmk , or kultusministerkonferenz - the group in charge of education policy on issues that go beyond state .
and indeed , because a conservative committee member has requested it , the issue will stand on the agenda when the group next meets , in october .
debate a ' senseless waste ' ?
noting that the group just voted unanimously in favor of the reforms in june , kmk president doris ahnen told the ddp news agency she finds it " somewhat strange " that one of her colleagues requested bringing the topic back to life .
moreover , she said , she does n't believe anything will change , even after another debate .
" most of the ministers in the committee are still in favor of the reforms , and are in favor of making them mandatory next august , " she stressed .
a representative of the german journalists ' association -lrb- djv -rrb- told news agencies that his group is in favor of keeping the reform .
rescinding it at this point would be " a senseless waste of money , " djv chairman michael konken said .
konken said the whole debate should go back to where it came from : the " sommerloch " - the big summer news hole that german politicians know is always good for press in the slow season . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de coming to terms with germany 's new spelling reform five years after germany 's controversial spelling reforms were introduced , many germans are still confused by the new spelling rules , while others simply refuse to use them .
-lrb- august 2 , 2003 -rrb- feedback should politicians dictate spelling , or is language a " living entity " that should develop on its own ?

the introduction of the spacecraft , which will ferry supplies including food , parts , fuel , water and even mail to the international space station will help take the burden off the space shuttle fleet , which currently transports the bulk of payloads and astronauts .
" we ’ re particularly excited about the atv , because it will help close the gaps if the space shuttle is not flying , " said sigmar wittig , chairman of the executive board of the german aerospace center , which is funding about 41 percent of europe 's contribution to the iss .

the 4.5-meter -lrb- 14.76 feet -rrb- cylindrical module , which weighs about 450 tons and has a floor space of 75 cubic meters , is packed with scientific experiments covering the fields of biology , biotechnology , human physiology , material science and fluid science .

in rough terms , we will have 100 times more capability to do experiments than we ever had before , " said jörg feustel-büechl , esa 's director of manned spaceflight .
columbus can fit up to three astronauts working in the unit 's zero-gravity conditions .
astronauts as zero-gravity guinea pigs among the primary goals of columbus is to study the effects of long-term space travel on the human body .
in order to send astronauts to the moon or mars for long periods , scientists and medical experts must first learns ways to counter the aging effects of space travel as well as prolonged exposure to increased radiation from the sun .
the studies could also aid medical researchers treating illnesses on terra firma .
" we will study how the body behaves , " feustel-büechl said .
" the body ages more quickly in space and bone density diminishes , and that 's an important phenomenon for studying the effects of osteoporosis .

in space , there is no convection , and astronauts in the columbus module can " isolate physical phenomena in a much better way , understanding better , for example , how fluids behave with gases , how combustion works and how melting fluids behave - not just for the textbooks , but also for practical applications in various disciplines and industries . "
in other words , the lessons learned in space could help companies back on earth create new manufacturing techniques .
in addition to the research facilities inside columbus , the module also has four outdoor platforms for experiments .

columbus laboratory and electrical test models in the integration hall in bremen , germany .
columbus was originally scheduled to be launched this year , but the delay has given the project 's scientists and engineers more time to conduct testing and to make the research laboratory more flexible to accommodate future experiments .
afterall , unlike an airplane , engineers do n't have the luxury of doing test-flights on columbus - it has to work from day one .
the 4.5-meter -lrb- 14.76 feet -rrb- cylindrical module , which weighs about 450 tons and has a floor space of 75 cubic meters , is packed with scientific experiments covering the fields of biology , biotechnology , human physiology , material science and fluid science .

in rough terms , we will have 100 times more capability to do experiments than we ever had before , " said jörg feustel-büechl , esa 's director of manned spaceflight .
columbus can fit up to three astronauts working in the unit 's zero-gravity conditions .
astronauts as zero-gravity guinea pigs among the primary goals of columbus is to study the effects of long-term space travel on the human body .
in order to send astronauts to the moon or mars for long periods , scientists and medical experts must first learns ways to counter the aging effects of space travel as well as prolonged exposure to increased radiation from the sun .
the studies could also aid medical researchers treating illnesses on terra firma .
" we will study how the body behaves , " feustel-büechl said .
" the body ages more quickly in space and bone density diminishes , and that 's an important phenomenon for studying the effects of osteoporosis .
you also have a different distribution of the fluids of the blood and water in the body .
you can study cardiovascular effects or the effects on the brains or eyes . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european physiology modules -lrb- epm -rrb- will be used to test the long-term health effects of space travel on astronauts .
feustel-büechl said that many health phenomena that occur on earth are accelerated in space , which will help scientists to study them more easily and quickly than they could on our own planet .
the same " biolab " facility used to study humans can also be used for experiments on cells , tissue cultures , microorganisms , small plants and invertebrates .
benefits for business the esa scientist said the laboratory would also be important for studying material science .
in space , there is no convection , and astronauts in the columbus module can " isolate physical phenomena in a much better way , understanding better , for example , how fluids behave with gases , how combustion works and how melting fluids behave - not just for the textbooks , but also for practical applications in various disciplines and industries . "
in other words , the lessons learned in space could help companies back on earth create new manufacturing techniques .
in addition to the research facilities inside columbus , the module also has four outdoor platforms for experiments .
" these will allow our astronaut scientists to look to the sky for astronomical observations or to look down to earth for observation experiments , " said feustel-büechl .
" we can also conduct experiments with technology that needs to be exposed to space conditions . "

super-commissioner verheugen ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter verheugen observers believe that because of verheugen 's -lrb- photo -rrb- experience as commissioner for enlargement , he will , by default , become a sort of " super-commissioner . "
compared to the other candidates , he 's one of the few among the commissioners nominated by the member states who carries considerable political clout .
nevertheless , barroso has rejected the proposals to create a super-commissioner label or any other tiered system of commissioners .
but german chancellor gerhard schröder has expressed his desire for verheugen to take over the commission 's economics portfolio as well as responsibility for implementation of the so-called lisbon agenda , which seeks to make the eu the most industrially , technologically and economically dynamic group of nations in the world by 2010 .
so far the effort has produced meager results .
under schröder 's vision , verheugen would breathe new life into the lisbon plan and coordinate his activities with the other commissioners .
indeed , most of the large member states are pushing for a more powerful economics portfolio .
currently the competencies are divided among four different commissioners who manage competition policy , the internal market , trade and industrial policy .
due to domestic policy concerns , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi has recalled mario monti , who has had a highly successful stint as competition commissioner , and is instead sending rocco buttiglione . the experienced politician is a member of the italian coalition government 's junior partner , the democratic union of the center , which has lately been on a confrontation course with berlusconi .
france 's jacques barrot is also jockeying for an economics-related commission post at the behest of his mentor , president jacques chirac .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter mandelson has been forced to resign from tony blair 's cabinet in two separate incidences .
now he 's going to represent britain in brussels .
meanwhile , tony blair is sending his scandal-plagued two-time cabinet member peter mandelson -lrb- photo -rrb- to brussels to represent the united kingdom on the commission .
mandelson is considered a close confidante of blair , and he has been selected with the hope that he can increase euroskeptical brits ' interest in brussels in time for the country 's planned referendum on the eu constitution .
the big unknowns the biggest wildcards on the new commission are the ten commissioners from the new eu member states .
they 've already been shadowing the commission since earlier this year without a portfolio , but they have n't made much of a dent in public .
nonetheless , observers in brussels believe poland 's danuta hübner will likely be given one of the more important commission posts .
expanding the commission out of the current 19 commission departments , barroso will now be responsible for creating 24 so that all of the commissioners of the member states will have authority over at least one policy area .
but only 12 of those 24 positions will likely carry much weight - meaning that the smaller member states will likely be given less meaningful competencies in the eu executive , which will hold office through 2009 .
as part of their accession negotiations , the smaller states came to an agreement that the commission should be comprised of one commissioner from each member state , despite that fact that the body , at least in theory , represents eu treaties in an independent , supranational manner without representing the interests of individual countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian foreign minister benita ferrero-waldner one of barroso 's stated goals is to have at least eight women on his team .
if austria decides to send its current foreign minister , benita ferrero-waldner -lrb- photo -rrb- , to brussels , he may come close to that goal .
ferrero-walder recently lost the presidential election and with her on the commission , the number of woman would climb to seven .
opportunity in weakness the relatively weak profile of most of the future eu commissioners could actually represent an opportunity for barroso , who himself was n't even the first choice for the post he now holds .
it 's possible he could excell as a stronger president than those seen on recent commissions .
his predecessor , prodi , gave his commissioners a long leash and considerable room to develop their political independence .
but this also came at a cost , since most viewed prodi as a weak commission president .
barroso plans to complete his jigsaw puzzle of people and competencies by the end of august , when brussels ' core of eurocrats returns from summer vacation . between now and then , he 'll be working the speed dial button to national capitals and he 'll be holding interviews with the commissioners to determine who gets what position .

ferrero-walder recently lost the presidential election and with her on the commission , the number of woman would climb to seven .
opportunity in weakness the relatively weak profile of most of the future eu commissioners could actually represent an opportunity for barroso , who himself was n't even the first choice for the post he now holds .
it 's possible he could excell as a stronger president than those seen on recent commissions .
his predecessor , prodi , gave his commissioners a long leash and considerable room to develop their political independence .
but this also came at a cost , since most viewed prodi as a weak commission president .
barroso plans to complete his jigsaw puzzle of people and competencies by the end of august , when brussels ' core of eurocrats returns from summer vacation . between now and then , he 'll be working the speed dial button to national capitals and he 'll be holding interviews with the commissioners to determine who gets what position .
in the worst-case scenario , barroso has said , he will take advantage of his ability to reject or fire candidates with insufficient experience - a right that was first cemented in the recently ratified treaty of nice . bernd riegert , brussels -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu parliament confirms barroso the european parliament has confirmed jose barroso as the next president of the european commission on thursday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 30.07.2004 barroso starts tough job of building commission großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose manuel barroso is building his political legos in brussels just days after his appointment as the eu 's top politician , commission president jose manuel barroso has begun assembling his team .
but unlike other governments , he does n't have the luxury of picking his own . as outgoing european commission president romano prodi whiles his summer days away along the shores of greece , his succesor is spending the summer assembling his new team , which is to be confirmed by the european parliament in september and will begin its term on nov .
1 .
but the former portuguese prime minister , elected by parliament earlier this month , has major limitations in how he can structure his commission .
under eu procedures barrosa can determine what portfolio any given commissioner will receive , but national capitals determine who will represent their countries on the commission .
only five out of the current 20 commissioners will remain in the european executive office come november .
they include viviane reding of luxembourg , margot wallström of sweden , france 's jaques barrot and possibly joaquin almunia of spain - both of whom have only served in brussels for the past few months - as well as germany 's günter verheugen .
super-commissioner verheugen ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter verheugen observers believe that because of verheugen 's -lrb- photo -rrb- experience as commissioner for enlargement , he will , by default , become a sort of " super-commissioner . "
compared to the other candidates , he 's one of the few among the commissioners nominated by the member states who carries considerable political clout .
nevertheless , barroso has rejected the proposals to create a super-commissioner label or any other tiered system of commissioners .
but german chancellor gerhard schröder has expressed his desire for verheugen to take over the commission 's economics portfolio as well as responsibility for implementation of the so-called lisbon agenda , which seeks to make the eu the most industrially , technologically and economically dynamic group of nations in the world by 2010 .
so far the effort has produced meager results .
under schröder 's vision , verheugen would breathe new life into the lisbon plan and coordinate his activities with the other commissioners .
indeed , most of the large member states are pushing for a more powerful economics portfolio .
currently the competencies are divided among four different commissioners who manage competition policy , the internal market , trade and industrial policy .
due to domestic policy concerns , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi has recalled mario monti , who has had a highly successful stint as competition commissioner , and is instead sending rocco buttiglione . the experienced politician is a member of the italian coalition government 's junior partner , the democratic union of the center , which has lately been on a confrontation course with berlusconi .
france 's jacques barrot is also jockeying for an economics-related commission post at the behest of his mentor , president jacques chirac .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter mandelson has been forced to resign from tony blair 's cabinet in two separate incidences .
now he 's going to represent britain in brussels .
meanwhile , tony blair is sending his scandal-plagued two-time cabinet member peter mandelson -lrb- photo -rrb- to brussels to represent the united kingdom on the commission .
mandelson is considered a close confidante of blair , and he has been selected with the hope that he can increase euroskeptical brits ' interest in brussels in time for the country 's planned referendum on the eu constitution .
the big unknowns the biggest wildcards on the new commission are the ten commissioners from the new eu member states .
they 've already been shadowing the commission since earlier this year without a portfolio , but they have n't made much of a dent in public .
nonetheless , observers in brussels believe poland 's danuta hübner will likely be given one of the more important commission posts .
expanding the commission out of the current 19 commission departments , barroso will now be responsible for creating 24 so that all of the commissioners of the member states will have authority over at least one policy area .
but only 12 of those 24 positions will likely carry much weight - meaning that the smaller member states will likely be given less meaningful competencies in the eu executive , which will hold office through 2009 .
as part of their accession negotiations , the smaller states came to an agreement that the commission should be comprised of one commissioner from each member state , despite that fact that the body , at least in theory , represents eu treaties in an independent , supranational manner without representing the interests of individual countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian foreign minister benita ferrero-waldner one of barroso 's stated goals is to have at least eight women on his team .
if austria decides to send its current foreign minister , benita ferrero-waldner -lrb- photo -rrb- , to brussels , he may come close to that goal .

but wto chief negotiator shotaro oshima added a paragraph in the preamble emphasizing that its provisions still required additional negotiations . that moved in the direction of developing countries , which have refused to give in on market access .
greater access to developing countries ' industrial markets has been a key demand of wealthy countries such as the us and eu in return for reducing support for farmers , which poor countries blame for pricing them out of world markets . five big players agree on farming the world 's poorest countries were also given more leeway with provisions on special treatment .
the united states , european union , australia , brazil and india on thursday struck an agreement on the thorny issue of farming , although it is not clear how much this influenced the revised compromise . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wto general director supachai panitchpakdi , right .
" i welcome the agreement among five key members on the agriculture text , " wto director-general supachai panitchpakdi said in a statement conveyed by a spokesman .
" it is an important input into our negotiations and gives momentum to our efforts at completing negotiations .
but i must caution that no agricultural framework deal is possible without the consensus of all wto member governments . " however , the move annoyed many other countries , while insufficient time has been given to other hot topics such as reducing tariffs on non-farm products .
stalled doha talks are " make or break " for wto " it would be a shame , if for lack of time we do not close a deal that was within reach , at least as far as agriculture goes , " said one diplomat from a developed country in an interview with reuters .
failure to approve the framework this weekend will likely wreck a year-end goal to complete the stalled doha round of trade negotiations as us presidential elections and a shake-up at the european commission loom .
" if this meeting succeeds , it means doha is back on track and it will probably survive all the political changes that are taking place in washington and in brussels , " simon cox of the economist told cnn .
" if it fails , then people will really start to wonder whether the wto system will work . "

us presidential candidate john kerry officially accepted the democratic nomination on thursday , promising to restore america 's international reputation , and re-bind the fraying ties to europe . for four days the us democrats in boston have been working their hardest to sell john kerry as the man that america wants , needs and can have .
and they - both the candidate himself and the party elite - have done so with the conspicuous absence of pointed anti-bush rhetoric , even though the drive to oust the president from office is the strongest glue to have united the party in a long time . come the elections on november 2 , it will be the undecided voters in the key states and from the political center , who will decide , and now is the time to win them over with a positive message .
with this in mind , the democrats in boston presented themselves as guardians of the the old american ideals , as a regenerative strength which would both close the divide on home ground and win back america 's tarred international reputation . they did everything they could to present john kerry as an experienced politician , a high- principled soul , and a man who knows how to protect america effectively .
the latter is crucial to the american electorate , which lives in fear of suffering an historic defeat in the fight against terrorism . vietnam hero kerry 's supporters and fellow democrats doused him in glory , touting him as hero of the vietnam war , a selfless savior and a courageous leader .
the praise was designed to serve as a contrast to the alleged slacker , george w bush , whose service in the military home reserves is inadequately documented . this overemphasis of the presidential candidate as commander-in-chief , who as supreme commander of the us forces , would unquestionably rise to the challenge , takes its relevance from september 11th , a defining moment in america 's recent history . simultaneously , kerry reflects the desperate efforts on the part of the democrats , to compensate for the gaps in president bush 's and the republicans ' policies on national security .
some of these verbal attempts were so brash , that they left a nasty taste among some european observers , as did the overall circus and show character of the whole event . vague policies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : candidate for vice-president john edwards the party conference also served to dash any premature hopes that as president , john kerry would return america to a " gentle power " , silencing its military might in favor of strengthened diplomacy and international understanding - even if kerry did make a point of stressing that he would help lead america back to a more international image .
but over and above this , many of kerry 's policies remained vague .
how is he planning to dry up the quagmire of iraq , how is he planning to get north korea and iran to give up on their nuclear policies ? the old standard-bearer of the democratic party 's leftwing , senator ted kennedy , cut to the chase , when he said that the only thing the democrats fear is another four years of george w bush in the white house .
as far as the democrats are concerned , a second term under the current president has to be avoided at all costs , and laying down the line on foreign policy issues wo n't help the cause . so instead , kerry and his running mate john edwards sold themselves as the social conscience of the nation , and their followers came flocking .
but whether this act will be powerful enough to prevent bush from laying down his cap for another four years , is highly questionable .
when in doubt , voters will be more easily swayed back to the devil they know than convinced into supporting his diluted double . daniel scheschkewitz -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us voters in germany get rallying call the us presidential election in november is expected to be one of the closest contests in the country 's history .

but it reinforced language on reducing the scope of export credits , which are paid by the united states to its farmers , without calling for their outright elimination . text aimed to placate all members on the sensitive topic of bringing down protective barriers on industrial products ranging from microchips to toys , a key demand by industrialized countries , the text remained largely unchanged .
but wto chief negotiator shotaro oshima added a paragraph in the preamble emphasizing that its provisions still required additional negotiations . that moved in the direction of developing countries , which have refused to give in on market access .
greater access to developing countries ' industrial markets has been a key demand of wealthy countries such as the us and eu in return for reducing support for farmers , which poor countries blame for pricing them out of world markets . five big players agree on farming the world 's poorest countries were also given more leeway with provisions on special treatment .
the united states , european union , australia , brazil and india on thursday struck an agreement on the thorny issue of farming , although it is not clear how much this influenced the revised compromise . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wto general director supachai panitchpakdi , right .
" i welcome the agreement among five key members on the agriculture text , " wto director-general supachai panitchpakdi said in a statement conveyed by a spokesman .
" it is an important input into our negotiations and gives momentum to our efforts at completing negotiations .
but i must caution that no agricultural framework deal is possible without the consensus of all wto member governments . " however , the move annoyed many other countries , while insufficient time has been given to other hot topics such as reducing tariffs on non-farm products .
stalled doha talks are " make or break " for wto " it would be a shame , if for lack of time we do not close a deal that was within reach , at least as far as agriculture goes , " said one diplomat from a developed country in an interview with reuters .
failure to approve the framework this weekend will likely wreck a year-end goal to complete the stalled doha round of trade negotiations as us presidential elections and a shake-up at the european commission loom .
" if this meeting succeeds , it means doha is back on track and it will probably survive all the political changes that are taking place in washington and in brussels , " simon cox of the economist told cnn .
" if it fails , then people will really start to wonder whether the wto system will work . "
the deadline for approval could be postponed until saturday , according to trade sources . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu prepares for wto agriculture talks the eu is going to the wto talks in geneva on tuesday with a common position , despite resistance from france .

us presidential candidate john kerry officially accepted the democratic nomination on thursday , promising to restore america 's international reputation , and re-bind the fraying ties to europe . for four days the us democrats in boston have been working their hardest to sell john kerry as the man that america wants , needs and can have .
and they - both the candidate himself and the party elite - have done so with the conspicuous absence of pointed anti-bush rhetoric , even though the drive to oust the president from office is the strongest glue to have united the party in a long time . come the elections on november 2 , it will be the undecided voters in the key states and from the political center , who will decide , and now is the time to win them over with a positive message .
with this in mind , the democrats in boston presented themselves as guardians of the the old american ideals , as a regenerative strength which would both close the divide on home ground and win back america 's tarred international reputation . they did everything they could to present john kerry as an experienced politician , a high- principled soul , and a man who knows how to protect america effectively .
the latter is crucial to the american electorate , which lives in fear of suffering an historic defeat in the fight against terrorism . vietnam hero kerry 's supporters and fellow democrats doused him in glory , touting him as hero of the vietnam war , a selfless savior and a courageous leader .
the praise was designed to serve as a contrast to the alleged slacker , george w bush , whose service in the military home reserves is inadequately documented . this overemphasis of the presidential candidate as commander-in-chief , who as supreme commander of the us forces , would unquestionably rise to the challenge , takes its relevance from september 11th , a defining moment in america 's recent history . simultaneously , kerry reflects the desperate efforts on the part of the democrats , to compensate for the gaps in president bush 's and the republicans ' policies on national security .
some of these verbal attempts were so brash , that they left a nasty taste among some european observers , as did the overall circus and show character of the whole event . vague policies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : candidate for vice-president john edwards the party conference also served to dash any premature hopes that as president , john kerry would return america to a " gentle power " , silencing its military might in favor of strengthened diplomacy and international understanding - even if kerry did make a point of stressing that he would help lead america back to a more international image .
but over and above this , many of kerry 's policies remained vague .
how is he planning to dry up the quagmire of iraq , how is he planning to get north korea and iran to give up on their nuclear policies ? the old standard-bearer of the democratic party 's leftwing , senator ted kennedy , cut to the chase , when he said that the only thing the democrats fear is another four years of george w bush in the white house .
as far as the democrats are concerned , a second term under the current president has to be avoided at all costs , and laying down the line on foreign policy issues wo n't help the cause . so instead , kerry and his running mate john edwards sold themselves as the social conscience of the nation , and their followers came flocking .
but whether this act will be powerful enough to prevent bush from laying down his cap for another four years , is highly questionable .

germany 's beer drinkers may be seen as world experts , sampling fine hops and acquiring knowledge of the best brews , but a new survey has shown that many just want to get sloshed . they may have the reputation as the beer connoisseurs of europe , if not the world , but a new study sheds a different light on the drinking habits of the hop-loving germans . contrary to the image of the german beer garden full of locals heartily savoring and comparing the qualities of the brews on tap , it has been reveled that a surprising percentage of germany 's drinkers set out on a mission to get drunk . the survey , released this week by independent market research company mintel , shows that almost one in five german adults , or 17 percent , believe the point of drinking is to get plastered .

" drinking can be more of a low-key social event in britain than some may have believed , " said michelle strutton , consumer analyst at mintel in an interview with news agency ap .
" although germans may not go drinking as often as the british , when they do drink , many do want to get drunk . "
the average german adult drank 255 pints of the liquid throat charmer last year , 35 more pints than his british counterpart , the survey found .
britain has the highest percentage of beer drinkers in europe , with 61 percent of adults - including 82 percent of men .
mintel 's survey of 35,000 consumers covered france , italy , spain , germany and britain .
new markets spain , the third-largest consumer , was the fastest-growing market for beer , but italy was likely to overtake it .
beer consumption in spain grew by 17 percent since 1998 .

but unlike other governments , he does n't have the luxury of picking his own . as outgoing european commission president romano prodi whiles his summer days away along the shores of greece , his succesor is spending the summer assembling his new team , which is to be confirmed by the european parliament in september and will begin its term on nov .
1 .
but the former portuguese prime minister , elected by parliament earlier this month , has major limitations in how he can structure his commission .
under eu procedures barrosa can determine what portfolio any given commissioner will receive , but national capitals determine who will represent their countries on the commission .
only five out of the current 20 commissioners will remain in the european executive office come november .
they include viviane reding of luxembourg , margot wallström of sweden , france 's jaques barrot and possibly joaquin almunia of spain - both of whom have only served in brussels for the past few months - as well as germany 's günter verheugen .
super-commissioner verheugen ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter verheugen observers believe that because of verheugen 's -lrb- photo -rrb- experience as commissioner for enlargement , he will , by default , become a sort of " super-commissioner . "
compared to the other candidates , he 's one of the few among the commissioners nominated by the member states who carries considerable political clout .
nevertheless , barroso has rejected the proposals to create a super-commissioner label or any other tiered system of commissioners .
but german chancellor gerhard schröder has expressed his desire for verheugen to take over the commission 's economics portfolio as well as responsibility for implementation of the so-called lisbon agenda , which seeks to make the eu the most industrially , technologically and economically dynamic group of nations in the world by 2010 .
so far the effort has produced meager results .
under schröder 's vision , verheugen would breathe new life into the lisbon plan and coordinate his activities with the other commissioners .
indeed , most of the large member states are pushing for a more powerful economics portfolio .
currently the competencies are divided among four different commissioners who manage competition policy , the internal market , trade and industrial policy .
due to domestic policy concerns , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi has recalled mario monti , who has had a highly successful stint as competition commissioner , and is instead sending rocco buttiglione . the experienced politician is a member of the italian coalition government 's junior partner , the democratic union of the center , which has lately been on a confrontation course with berlusconi .
france 's jacques barrot is also jockeying for an economics-related commission post at the behest of his mentor , president jacques chirac .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter mandelson has been forced to resign from tony blair 's cabinet in two separate incidences .
now he 's going to represent britain in brussels .
meanwhile , tony blair is sending his scandal-plagued two-time cabinet member peter mandelson -lrb- photo -rrb- to brussels to represent the united kingdom on the commission .
mandelson is considered a close confidante of blair , and he has been selected with the hope that he can increase euroskeptical brits ' interest in brussels in time for the country 's planned referendum on the eu constitution .
the big unknowns the biggest wildcards on the new commission are the ten commissioners from the new eu member states .
they 've already been shadowing the commission since earlier this year without a portfolio , but they have n't made much of a dent in public .
nonetheless , observers in brussels believe poland 's danuta hübner will likely be given one of the more important commission posts .
expanding the commission out of the current 19 commission departments , barroso will now be responsible for creating 24 so that all of the commissioners of the member states will have authority over at least one policy area .
but only 12 of those 24 positions will likely carry much weight - meaning that the smaller member states will likely be given less meaningful competencies in the eu executive , which will hold office through 2009 .
as part of their accession negotiations , the smaller states came to an agreement that the commission should be comprised of one commissioner from each member state , despite that fact that the body , at least in theory , represents eu treaties in an independent , supranational manner without representing the interests of individual countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian foreign minister benita ferrero-waldner one of barroso 's stated goals is to have at least eight women on his team .
if austria decides to send its current foreign minister , benita ferrero-waldner -lrb- photo -rrb- , to brussels , he may come close to that goal .
ferrero-walder recently lost the presidential election and with her on the commission , the number of woman would climb to seven .
opportunity in weakness the relatively weak profile of most of the future eu commissioners could actually represent an opportunity for barroso , who himself was n't even the first choice for the post he now holds .
it 's possible he could excell as a stronger president than those seen on recent commissions .
his predecessor , prodi , gave his commissioners a long leash and considerable room to develop their political independence .
but this also came at a cost , since most viewed prodi as a weak commission president .
barroso plans to complete his jigsaw puzzle of people and competencies by the end of august , when brussels ' core of eurocrats returns from summer vacation . between now and then , he 'll be working the speed dial button to national capitals and he 'll be holding interviews with the commissioners to determine who gets what position .
in the worst-case scenario , barroso has said , he will take advantage of his ability to reject or fire candidates with insufficient experience - a right that was first cemented in the recently ratified treaty of nice . bernd riegert , brussels -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu parliament confirms barroso the european parliament has confirmed jose barroso as the next president of the european commission on thursday .

but german chancellor gerhard schröder has expressed his desire for verheugen to take over the commission 's economics portfolio as well as responsibility for implementation of the so-called lisbon agenda , which seeks to make the eu the most industrially , technologically and economically dynamic group of nations in the world by 2010 .
so far the effort has produced meager results .
under schröder 's vision , verheugen would breathe new life into the lisbon plan and coordinate his activities with the other commissioners .
indeed , most of the large member states are pushing for a more powerful economics portfolio .
currently the competencies are divided among four different commissioners who manage competition policy , the internal market , trade and industrial policy .
due to domestic policy concerns , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi has recalled mario monti , who has had a highly successful stint as competition commissioner , and is instead sending rocco buttiglione . the experienced politician is a member of the italian coalition government 's junior partner , the democratic union of the center , which has lately been on a confrontation course with berlusconi .
france 's jacques barrot is also jockeying for an economics-related commission post at the behest of his mentor , president jacques chirac .

the big unknowns the biggest wildcards on the new commission are the ten commissioners from the new eu member states .
they 've already been shadowing the commission since earlier this year without a portfolio , but they have n't made much of a dent in public .
nonetheless , observers in brussels believe poland 's danuta hübner will likely be given one of the more important commission posts .
expanding the commission out of the current 19 commission departments , barroso will now be responsible for creating 24 so that all of the commissioners of the member states will have authority over at least one policy area .
but only 12 of those 24 positions will likely carry much weight - meaning that the smaller member states will likely be given less meaningful competencies in the eu executive , which will hold office through 2009 .

his predecessor , prodi , gave his commissioners a long leash and considerable room to develop their political independence .
but this also came at a cost , since most viewed prodi as a weak commission president .
barroso plans to complete his jigsaw puzzle of people and competencies by the end of august , when brussels ' core of eurocrats returns from summer vacation . between now and then , he 'll be working the speed dial button to national capitals and he 'll be holding interviews with the commissioners to determine who gets what position .
in the worst-case scenario , barroso has said , he will take advantage of his ability to reject or fire candidates with insufficient experience - a right that was first cemented in the recently ratified treaty of nice . bernd riegert , brussels -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu parliament confirms barroso the european parliament has confirmed jose barroso as the next president of the european commission on thursday .

afterall , unlike an airplane , engineers do n't have the luxury of doing test-flights on columbus - it has to work from day one .
the 4.5-meter -lrb- 14.76 feet -rrb- cylindrical module , which weighs about 450 tons and has a floor space of 75 cubic meters , is packed with scientific experiments covering the fields of biology , biotechnology , human physiology , material science and fluid science .

columbus can fit up to three astronauts working in the unit 's zero-gravity conditions .
astronauts as zero-gravity guinea pigs among the primary goals of columbus is to study the effects of long-term space travel on the human body .
in order to send astronauts to the moon or mars for long periods , scientists and medical experts must first learns ways to counter the aging effects of space travel as well as prolonged exposure to increased radiation from the sun .
the studies could also aid medical researchers treating illnesses on terra firma .
" we will study how the body behaves , " feustel-büechl said .
" the body ages more quickly in space and bone density diminishes , and that 's an important phenomenon for studying the effects of osteoporosis .

"
in other words , the lessons learned in space could help companies back on earth create new manufacturing techniques .
in addition to the research facilities inside columbus , the module also has four outdoor platforms for experiments .

the findings could aid preparations for the first manned mars voyage . after space shuttle flights resume in 2005 , one of the early payloads will be the european space agency 's columbus research module . the cylindrical module , which looks like an outsized soda can , is coming together in a large assembly hall at eads space transportation , a subsidiary of airbus maker eads , in the northern german city of bremen .

columbus laboratory and electrical test models in the integration hall in bremen , germany .
columbus was originally scheduled to be launched this year , but the delay has given the project 's scientists and engineers more time to conduct testing and to make the research laboratory more flexible to accommodate future experiments .
afterall , unlike an airplane , engineers do n't have the luxury of doing test-flights on columbus - it has to work from day one .
the 4.5-meter -lrb- 14.76 feet -rrb- cylindrical module , which weighs about 450 tons and has a floor space of 75 cubic meters , is packed with scientific experiments covering the fields of biology , biotechnology , human physiology , material science and fluid science .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a full-sized model of the columbus laboratory is open to visitors at eads space transportation in bremen esa gained some earlier experience in orbit with spacelab , which flew on 22 missions in the cargo bay of the space shuttle between 1983 and 1998 , but columbus marks the first time europe will have an experiment facility all its own , available 24 hours a day , 365 days a year in space .
in rough terms , we will have 100 times more capability to do experiments than we ever had before , " said jörg feustel-büechl , esa 's director of manned spaceflight .
columbus can fit up to three astronauts working in the unit 's zero-gravity conditions .
astronauts as zero-gravity guinea pigs among the primary goals of columbus is to study the effects of long-term space travel on the human body .
in order to send astronauts to the moon or mars for long periods , scientists and medical experts must first learns ways to counter the aging effects of space travel as well as prolonged exposure to increased radiation from the sun .
the studies could also aid medical researchers treating illnesses on terra firma .
" we will study how the body behaves , " feustel-büechl said .
" the body ages more quickly in space and bone density diminishes , and that 's an important phenomenon for studying the effects of osteoporosis .
you also have a different distribution of the fluids of the blood and water in the body .
you can study cardiovascular effects or the effects on the brains or eyes . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european physiology modules -lrb- epm -rrb- will be used to test the long-term health effects of space travel on astronauts .
feustel-büechl said that many health phenomena that occur on earth are accelerated in space , which will help scientists to study them more easily and quickly than they could on our own planet .
the same " biolab " facility used to study humans can also be used for experiments on cells , tissue cultures , microorganisms , small plants and invertebrates .
benefits for business the esa scientist said the laboratory would also be important for studying material science .
in space , there is no convection , and astronauts in the columbus module can " isolate physical phenomena in a much better way , understanding better , for example , how fluids behave with gases , how combustion works and how melting fluids behave - not just for the textbooks , but also for practical applications in various disciplines and industries . "
in other words , the lessons learned in space could help companies back on earth create new manufacturing techniques .
in addition to the research facilities inside columbus , the module also has four outdoor platforms for experiments .
" these will allow our astronaut scientists to look to the sky for astronomical observations or to look down to earth for observation experiments , " said feustel-büechl .
" we can also conduct experiments with technology that needs to be exposed to space conditions . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 30.07.2004 german spelling debate reignites großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new rules : simpler , or simply more confusing ?
german spelling is once again at the center of political debate , despite the fact that an across-the-board reform went into effect six years ago . " i would rather decline two drinks than one german verb , " mark twain famously wrote in his essay the awful german language .
but germans do n't need an american to tell them that their language is difficult - they know it themselves .
and they 're working on it .
several years ago , amid much controversy , germany -lrb- and switzerland and austria -rrb- decided to tackle the problem .
in 1998 , after decades of failed attempts , a committee pushed through a raft of changes known as the rechtschreibreform -lrb- spelling reform . -rrb-
the new rules were first applied in a transition phase , but are slated to become mandatory on august 1 , 2005 .
the changes aim to iron out some of the quirks in the language , and include various spelling changes such as using " ss " instead of the " ß " character .
they also thin out the hundreds of complex rules regarding the use of commas .
' unnecessary as gout ' but what started out as a simple effort to make life easier for the masses seems to have turned into a political hot potato .
the premiers of five german states - all of them members of the conservative opposition - have gone on record in recent weeks saying they want the government to reconsider the reforms .
common complaints : the new rules are confusing , and people are n't putting them into practice .
along with the politicians , several well known german writers , including nobel prize winner günther grass and poet and essayist hans magnus enzensberger have come out against the reform .
swiss author adolf muschg told the bild-zeitung newspaper : " the spelling reform must be stopped immediately .
it is as unnecessary as gout , has brought no improvement , and instead made people more uncertain . "
the german government has stuck to its guns , however , saying the reforms will go through as planned .
thomas steg , deputy spokesman for the government , told the dpa press agency that it would be " nonsense " to revisit the issue now .
after years of debate , " now the decisions that have been made should be put into effect consistently , " he said , and added : " the reaction of certain of the -lrb- state -rrb- premiers seems strange to me . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's leading dictionary marked all spelling changes in red in its 1996 edition .
for the most part , publishers , schools , and civil servants have long since adapted to the new system .
some 90 percent of new books are published using the reformed spelling rules .
felizitas liemersdorf , the principal of an elementary school in cologne , said it would be " nonsense " for the reforms to be rescinded now .
she admitted that the reforms were problematic from the get-go , saying they were " neither logical nor far reaching enough . "
however , like educators throughout the country , liemersdorf had no choice other than make sure the new rules were being applied in the classroom .
high cost of change " the first problem is , they were n't mandatory for everyone .
just take a look at our good old faz ! " she said , referring to the leading german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , which continues to publish under the old style .
but nonetheless , to go back to the old ways after six years would be " absurd , " liemersdorf said .
" can you imagine the cost ?
there would be a huge outcry .
we already replaced books - readers , worksheets , dictionaries , reference books . all the new books for classrooms are in the new style . "
too many critics to ignore to date , just one member of the federal government - culture minister christina weiss - has spoken out in favor of reviewing the reform issue .
in a conversation with the faz , weiss said it makes sense to give the rules another look before they become final .
she called the new rules " confusing and nonsensical , " and noted that " there are too many critics to just ignore them . "
" until the transition phase is over , on july 31 , 2005 , we still have the chance to think about the new rules .
i see a chance to clarify problematic issues , " weiss told the faz - the same newspaper that refuses to adopt the new spelling .
weiss suggests throwing the issue in the lap of the kmk , or kultusministerkonferenz - the group in charge of education policy on issues that go beyond state .
and indeed , because a conservative committee member has requested it , the issue will stand on the agenda when the group next meets , in october .
debate a ' senseless waste ' ?
noting that the group just voted unanimously in favor of the reforms in june , kmk president doris ahnen told the ddp news agency she finds it " somewhat strange " that one of her colleagues requested bringing the topic back to life .
moreover , she said , she does n't believe anything will change , even after another debate .
" most of the ministers in the committee are still in favor of the reforms , and are in favor of making them mandatory next august , " she stressed .
a representative of the german journalists ' association -lrb- djv -rrb- told news agencies that his group is in favor of keeping the reform .
rescinding it at this point would be " a senseless waste of money , " djv chairman michael konken said .
konken said the whole debate should go back to where it came from : the " sommerloch " - the big summer news hole that german politicians know is always good for press in the slow season . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de coming to terms with germany 's new spelling reform five years after germany 's controversial spelling reforms were introduced , many germans are still confused by the new spelling rules , while others simply refuse to use them .

german spelling is once again at the center of political debate , despite the fact that an across-the-board reform went into effect six years ago . " i would rather decline two drinks than one german verb , " mark twain famously wrote in his essay the awful german language .
but germans do n't need an american to tell them that their language is difficult - they know it themselves .
and they 're working on it .
several years ago , amid much controversy , germany -lrb- and switzerland and austria -rrb- decided to tackle the problem .
in 1998 , after decades of failed attempts , a committee pushed through a raft of changes known as the rechtschreibreform -lrb- spelling reform . -rrb-
the new rules were first applied in a transition phase , but are slated to become mandatory on august 1 , 2005 .
the changes aim to iron out some of the quirks in the language , and include various spelling changes such as using " ss " instead of the " ß " character .
they also thin out the hundreds of complex rules regarding the use of commas .
' unnecessary as gout ' but what started out as a simple effort to make life easier for the masses seems to have turned into a political hot potato .
the premiers of five german states - all of them members of the conservative opposition - have gone on record in recent weeks saying they want the government to reconsider the reforms .
common complaints : the new rules are confusing , and people are n't putting them into practice .
along with the politicians , several well known german writers , including nobel prize winner günther grass and poet and essayist hans magnus enzensberger have come out against the reform .
swiss author adolf muschg told the bild-zeitung newspaper : " the spelling reform must be stopped immediately .
it is as unnecessary as gout , has brought no improvement , and instead made people more uncertain . "
the german government has stuck to its guns , however , saying the reforms will go through as planned .
thomas steg , deputy spokesman for the government , told the dpa press agency that it would be " nonsense " to revisit the issue now .
after years of debate , " now the decisions that have been made should be put into effect consistently , " he said , and added : " the reaction of certain of the -lrb- state -rrb- premiers seems strange to me . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's leading dictionary marked all spelling changes in red in its 1996 edition .
for the most part , publishers , schools , and civil servants have long since adapted to the new system .
some 90 percent of new books are published using the reformed spelling rules .
felizitas liemersdorf , the principal of an elementary school in cologne , said it would be " nonsense " for the reforms to be rescinded now .
she admitted that the reforms were problematic from the get-go , saying they were " neither logical nor far reaching enough . "
however , like educators throughout the country , liemersdorf had no choice other than make sure the new rules were being applied in the classroom .

us presidential candidate john kerry officially accepted the democratic nomination on thursday , promising to restore america 's international reputation , and re-bind the fraying ties to europe . for four days the us democrats in boston have been working their hardest to sell john kerry as the man that america wants , needs and can have .
and they - both the candidate himself and the party elite - have done so with the conspicuous absence of pointed anti-bush rhetoric , even though the drive to oust the president from office is the strongest glue to have united the party in a long time . come the elections on november 2 , it will be the undecided voters in the key states and from the political center , who will decide , and now is the time to win them over with a positive message .
with this in mind , the democrats in boston presented themselves as guardians of the the old american ideals , as a regenerative strength which would both close the divide on home ground and win back america 's tarred international reputation . they did everything they could to present john kerry as an experienced politician , a high- principled soul , and a man who knows how to protect america effectively .
the latter is crucial to the american electorate , which lives in fear of suffering an historic defeat in the fight against terrorism . vietnam hero kerry 's supporters and fellow democrats doused him in glory , touting him as hero of the vietnam war , a selfless savior and a courageous leader .
the praise was designed to serve as a contrast to the alleged slacker , george w bush , whose service in the military home reserves is inadequately documented . this overemphasis of the presidential candidate as commander-in-chief , who as supreme commander of the us forces , would unquestionably rise to the challenge , takes its relevance from september 11th , a defining moment in america 's recent history . simultaneously , kerry reflects the desperate efforts on the part of the democrats , to compensate for the gaps in president bush 's and the republicans ' policies on national security .
some of these verbal attempts were so brash , that they left a nasty taste among some european observers , as did the overall circus and show character of the whole event . vague policies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : candidate for vice-president john edwards the party conference also served to dash any premature hopes that as president , john kerry would return america to a " gentle power " , silencing its military might in favor of strengthened diplomacy and international understanding - even if kerry did make a point of stressing that he would help lead america back to a more international image .
but over and above this , many of kerry 's policies remained vague .
how is he planning to dry up the quagmire of iraq , how is he planning to get north korea and iran to give up on their nuclear policies ? the old standard-bearer of the democratic party 's leftwing , senator ted kennedy , cut to the chase , when he said that the only thing the democrats fear is another four years of george w bush in the white house .
as far as the democrats are concerned , a second term under the current president has to be avoided at all costs , and laying down the line on foreign policy issues wo n't help the cause . so instead , kerry and his running mate john edwards sold themselves as the social conscience of the nation , and their followers came flocking .
but whether this act will be powerful enough to prevent bush from laying down his cap for another four years , is highly questionable .

us presidential candidate john kerry officially accepted the democratic nomination on thursday , promising to restore america 's international reputation , and re-bind the fraying ties to europe . for four days the us democrats in boston have been working their hardest to sell john kerry as the man that america wants , needs and can have .
and they - both the candidate himself and the party elite - have done so with the conspicuous absence of pointed anti-bush rhetoric , even though the drive to oust the president from office is the strongest glue to have united the party in a long time . come the elections on november 2 , it will be the undecided voters in the key states and from the political center , who will decide , and now is the time to win them over with a positive message .
with this in mind , the democrats in boston presented themselves as guardians of the the old american ideals , as a regenerative strength which would both close the divide on home ground and win back america 's tarred international reputation . they did everything they could to present john kerry as an experienced politician , a high- principled soul , and a man who knows how to protect america effectively .
the latter is crucial to the american electorate , which lives in fear of suffering an historic defeat in the fight against terrorism . vietnam hero kerry 's supporters and fellow democrats doused him in glory , touting him as hero of the vietnam war , a selfless savior and a courageous leader .
the praise was designed to serve as a contrast to the alleged slacker , george w bush , whose service in the military home reserves is inadequately documented . this overemphasis of the presidential candidate as commander-in-chief , who as supreme commander of the us forces , would unquestionably rise to the challenge , takes its relevance from september 11th , a defining moment in america 's recent history . simultaneously , kerry reflects the desperate efforts on the part of the democrats , to compensate for the gaps in president bush 's and the republicans ' policies on national security .
some of these verbal attempts were so brash , that they left a nasty taste among some european observers , as did the overall circus and show character of the whole event . vague policies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : candidate for vice-president john edwards the party conference also served to dash any premature hopes that as president , john kerry would return america to a " gentle power " , silencing its military might in favor of strengthened diplomacy and international understanding - even if kerry did make a point of stressing that he would help lead america back to a more international image .
but over and above this , many of kerry 's policies remained vague .
how is he planning to dry up the quagmire of iraq , how is he planning to get north korea and iran to give up on their nuclear policies ? the old standard-bearer of the democratic party 's leftwing , senator ted kennedy , cut to the chase , when he said that the only thing the democrats fear is another four years of george w bush in the white house .

germany 's beer drinkers may be seen as world experts , sampling fine hops and acquiring knowledge of the best brews , but a new survey has shown that many just want to get sloshed . they may have the reputation as the beer connoisseurs of europe , if not the world , but a new study sheds a different light on the drinking habits of the hop-loving germans . contrary to the image of the german beer garden full of locals heartily savoring and comparing the qualities of the brews on tap , it has been reveled that a surprising percentage of germany 's drinkers set out on a mission to get drunk . the survey , released this week by independent market research company mintel , shows that almost one in five german adults , or 17 percent , believe the point of drinking is to get plastered .

" although germans may not go drinking as often as the british , when they do drink , many do want to get drunk . "

germany 's beer drinkers may be seen as world experts , sampling fine hops and acquiring knowledge of the best brews , but a new survey has shown that many just want to get sloshed . they may have the reputation as the beer connoisseurs of europe , if not the world , but a new study sheds a different light on the drinking habits of the hop-loving germans . contrary to the image of the german beer garden full of locals heartily savoring and comparing the qualities of the brews on tap , it has been reveled that a surprising percentage of germany 's drinkers set out on a mission to get drunk . the survey , released this week by independent market research company mintel , shows that almost one in five german adults , or 17 percent , believe the point of drinking is to get plastered .
the germans even put the sport-drinking brits to shame , according to the figures .
only eight percent of britons drink to become stupefied , a statistic that could be challenged by a walk down any city center street in the uk on a friday night . " drinking can be more of a low-key social event in britain than some may have believed , " said michelle strutton , consumer analyst at mintel in an interview with news agency ap .
" although germans may not go drinking as often as the british , when they do drink , many do want to get drunk . "
the average german adult drank 255 pints of the liquid throat charmer last year , 35 more pints than his british counterpart , the survey found .
britain has the highest percentage of beer drinkers in europe , with 61 percent of adults - including 82 percent of men .
mintel 's survey of 35,000 consumers covered france , italy , spain , germany and britain .
new markets spain , the third-largest consumer , was the fastest-growing market for beer , but italy was likely to overtake it .
beer consumption in spain grew by 17 percent since 1998 .
fance 's consumption was down 13 percent since 1998 , though sales of premium beers were holding their own .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 30.07.2004 german spelling debate reignites großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new rules : simpler , or simply more confusing ?
german spelling is once again at the center of political debate , despite the fact that an across-the-board reform went into effect six years ago . " i would rather decline two drinks than one german verb , " mark twain famously wrote in his essay the awful german language .
but germans do n't need an american to tell them that their language is difficult - they know it themselves .
and they 're working on it .
several years ago , amid much controversy , germany -lrb- and switzerland and austria -rrb- decided to tackle the problem .
in 1998 , after decades of failed attempts , a committee pushed through a raft of changes known as the rechtschreibreform -lrb- spelling reform . -rrb-
the new rules were first applied in a transition phase , but are slated to become mandatory on august 1 , 2005 .
the changes aim to iron out some of the quirks in the language , and include various spelling changes such as using " ss " instead of the " ß " character .
they also thin out the hundreds of complex rules regarding the use of commas .
' unnecessary as gout ' but what started out as a simple effort to make life easier for the masses seems to have turned into a political hot potato .
the premiers of five german states - all of them members of the conservative opposition - have gone on record in recent weeks saying they want the government to reconsider the reforms .
common complaints : the new rules are confusing , and people are n't putting them into practice .
along with the politicians , several well known german writers , including nobel prize winner günther grass and poet and essayist hans magnus enzensberger have come out against the reform .
swiss author adolf muschg told the bild-zeitung newspaper : " the spelling reform must be stopped immediately .
it is as unnecessary as gout , has brought no improvement , and instead made people more uncertain . "
the german government has stuck to its guns , however , saying the reforms will go through as planned .
thomas steg , deputy spokesman for the government , told the dpa press agency that it would be " nonsense " to revisit the issue now .
after years of debate , " now the decisions that have been made should be put into effect consistently , " he said , and added : " the reaction of certain of the -lrb- state -rrb- premiers seems strange to me . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's leading dictionary marked all spelling changes in red in its 1996 edition .
for the most part , publishers , schools , and civil servants have long since adapted to the new system .
some 90 percent of new books are published using the reformed spelling rules .
felizitas liemersdorf , the principal of an elementary school in cologne , said it would be " nonsense " for the reforms to be rescinded now .
she admitted that the reforms were problematic from the get-go , saying they were " neither logical nor far reaching enough . "
however , like educators throughout the country , liemersdorf had no choice other than make sure the new rules were being applied in the classroom .
high cost of change " the first problem is , they were n't mandatory for everyone .
just take a look at our good old faz ! " she said , referring to the leading german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , which continues to publish under the old style .
but nonetheless , to go back to the old ways after six years would be " absurd , " liemersdorf said .
" can you imagine the cost ?
there would be a huge outcry .
we already replaced books - readers , worksheets , dictionaries , reference books . all the new books for classrooms are in the new style . "
too many critics to ignore to date , just one member of the federal government - culture minister christina weiss - has spoken out in favor of reviewing the reform issue .
in a conversation with the faz , weiss said it makes sense to give the rules another look before they become final .
she called the new rules " confusing and nonsensical , " and noted that " there are too many critics to just ignore them . "
" until the transition phase is over , on july 31 , 2005 , we still have the chance to think about the new rules .
i see a chance to clarify problematic issues , " weiss told the faz - the same newspaper that refuses to adopt the new spelling .
weiss suggests throwing the issue in the lap of the kmk , or kultusministerkonferenz - the group in charge of education policy on issues that go beyond state .
and indeed , because a conservative committee member has requested it , the issue will stand on the agenda when the group next meets , in october .
debate a ' senseless waste ' ?
noting that the group just voted unanimously in favor of the reforms in june , kmk president doris ahnen told the ddp news agency she finds it " somewhat strange " that one of her colleagues requested bringing the topic back to life .
moreover , she said , she does n't believe anything will change , even after another debate .
" most of the ministers in the committee are still in favor of the reforms , and are in favor of making them mandatory next august , " she stressed .
a representative of the german journalists ' association -lrb- djv -rrb- told news agencies that his group is in favor of keeping the reform .
rescinding it at this point would be " a senseless waste of money , " djv chairman michael konken said .
konken said the whole debate should go back to where it came from : the " sommerloch " - the big summer news hole that german politicians know is always good for press in the slow season . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de coming to terms with germany 's new spelling reform five years after germany 's controversial spelling reforms were introduced , many germans are still confused by the new spelling rules , while others simply refuse to use them .
-lrb- august 2 , 2003 -rrb- feedback should politicians dictate spelling , or is language a " living entity " that should develop on its own ?

once it starts flying , it will deliver food , water and fuel to the astronauts . named after french author jules verne , the originator of modern science fiction , europe 's first " automated transfer vehicle , " is scheduled to launch aboard an ariane 5 rocket in september 2005 .
the introduction of the spacecraft , which will ferry supplies including food , parts , fuel , water and even mail to the international space station will help take the burden off the space shuttle fleet , which currently transports the bulk of payloads and astronauts .
" we ’ re particularly excited about the atv , because it will help close the gaps if the space shuttle is not flying , " said sigmar wittig , chairman of the executive board of the german aerospace center , which is funding about 41 percent of europe 's contribution to the iss .
" we recently had to reduce the number of astronauts on the iss to two because the shuttle was grounded and there was no way to provide three with enough supplies .
separating the transport of humans and goods is the way to go in the future . "

once it starts flying , it will deliver food , water and fuel to the astronauts . named after french author jules verne , the originator of modern science fiction , europe 's first " automated transfer vehicle , " is scheduled to launch aboard an ariane 5 rocket in september 2005 .
the introduction of the spacecraft , which will ferry supplies including food , parts , fuel , water and even mail to the international space station will help take the burden off the space shuttle fleet , which currently transports the bulk of payloads and astronauts .
" we ’ re particularly excited about the atv , because it will help close the gaps if the space shuttle is not flying , " said sigmar wittig , chairman of the executive board of the german aerospace center , which is funding about 41 percent of europe 's contribution to the iss .
" we recently had to reduce the number of astronauts on the iss to two because the shuttle was grounded and there was no way to provide three with enough supplies .
separating the transport of humans and goods is the way to go in the future . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 30.07.2004 german spelling debate reignites großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new rules : simpler , or simply more confusing ?
german spelling is once again at the center of political debate , despite the fact that an across-the-board reform went into effect six years ago . " i would rather decline two drinks than one german verb , " mark twain famously wrote in his essay the awful german language .
but germans do n't need an american to tell them that their language is difficult - they know it themselves .
and they 're working on it .
several years ago , amid much controversy , germany -lrb- and switzerland and austria -rrb- decided to tackle the problem .
in 1998 , after decades of failed attempts , a committee pushed through a raft of changes known as the rechtschreibreform -lrb- spelling reform . -rrb-
the new rules were first applied in a transition phase , but are slated to become mandatory on august 1 , 2005 .
the changes aim to iron out some of the quirks in the language , and include various spelling changes such as using " ss " instead of the " ß " character .
they also thin out the hundreds of complex rules regarding the use of commas .
' unnecessary as gout ' but what started out as a simple effort to make life easier for the masses seems to have turned into a political hot potato .
the premiers of five german states - all of them members of the conservative opposition - have gone on record in recent weeks saying they want the government to reconsider the reforms .
common complaints : the new rules are confusing , and people are n't putting them into practice .
along with the politicians , several well known german writers , including nobel prize winner günther grass and poet and essayist hans magnus enzensberger have come out against the reform .
swiss author adolf muschg told the bild-zeitung newspaper : " the spelling reform must be stopped immediately .
it is as unnecessary as gout , has brought no improvement , and instead made people more uncertain . "
the german government has stuck to its guns , however , saying the reforms will go through as planned .
thomas steg , deputy spokesman for the government , told the dpa press agency that it would be " nonsense " to revisit the issue now .
after years of debate , " now the decisions that have been made should be put into effect consistently , " he said , and added : " the reaction of certain of the -lrb- state -rrb- premiers seems strange to me . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's leading dictionary marked all spelling changes in red in its 1996 edition .
for the most part , publishers , schools , and civil servants have long since adapted to the new system .
some 90 percent of new books are published using the reformed spelling rules .
felizitas liemersdorf , the principal of an elementary school in cologne , said it would be " nonsense " for the reforms to be rescinded now .
she admitted that the reforms were problematic from the get-go , saying they were " neither logical nor far reaching enough . "
however , like educators throughout the country , liemersdorf had no choice other than make sure the new rules were being applied in the classroom .
high cost of change " the first problem is , they were n't mandatory for everyone .
just take a look at our good old faz ! " she said , referring to the leading german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , which continues to publish under the old style .
but nonetheless , to go back to the old ways after six years would be " absurd , " liemersdorf said .
" can you imagine the cost ?
there would be a huge outcry .
we already replaced books - readers , worksheets , dictionaries , reference books . all the new books for classrooms are in the new style . "
too many critics to ignore to date , just one member of the federal government - culture minister christina weiss - has spoken out in favor of reviewing the reform issue .
in a conversation with the faz , weiss said it makes sense to give the rules another look before they become final .
she called the new rules " confusing and nonsensical , " and noted that " there are too many critics to just ignore them . "
" until the transition phase is over , on july 31 , 2005 , we still have the chance to think about the new rules .
i see a chance to clarify problematic issues , " weiss told the faz - the same newspaper that refuses to adopt the new spelling .
weiss suggests throwing the issue in the lap of the kmk , or kultusministerkonferenz - the group in charge of education policy on issues that go beyond state .
and indeed , because a conservative committee member has requested it , the issue will stand on the agenda when the group next meets , in october .
debate a ' senseless waste ' ?
noting that the group just voted unanimously in favor of the reforms in june , kmk president doris ahnen told the ddp news agency she finds it " somewhat strange " that one of her colleagues requested bringing the topic back to life .
moreover , she said , she does n't believe anything will change , even after another debate .
" most of the ministers in the committee are still in favor of the reforms , and are in favor of making them mandatory next august , " she stressed .
a representative of the german journalists ' association -lrb- djv -rrb- told news agencies that his group is in favor of keeping the reform .
rescinding it at this point would be " a senseless waste of money , " djv chairman michael konken said .
konken said the whole debate should go back to where it came from : the " sommerloch " - the big summer news hole that german politicians know is always good for press in the slow season . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de coming to terms with germany 's new spelling reform five years after germany 's controversial spelling reforms were introduced , many germans are still confused by the new spelling rules , while others simply refuse to use them .
-lrb- august 2 , 2003 -rrb- feedback should politicians dictate spelling , or is language a " living entity " that should develop on its own ?

us presidential candidate john kerry officially accepted the democratic nomination on thursday , promising to restore america 's international reputation , and re-bind the fraying ties to europe . for four days the us democrats in boston have been working their hardest to sell john kerry as the man that america wants , needs and can have .
and they - both the candidate himself and the party elite - have done so with the conspicuous absence of pointed anti-bush rhetoric , even though the drive to oust the president from office is the strongest glue to have united the party in a long time . come the elections on november 2 , it will be the undecided voters in the key states and from the political center , who will decide , and now is the time to win them over with a positive message .
with this in mind , the democrats in boston presented themselves as guardians of the the old american ideals , as a regenerative strength which would both close the divide on home ground and win back america 's tarred international reputation . they did everything they could to present john kerry as an experienced politician , a high- principled soul , and a man who knows how to protect america effectively .
the latter is crucial to the american electorate , which lives in fear of suffering an historic defeat in the fight against terrorism . vietnam hero kerry 's supporters and fellow democrats doused him in glory , touting him as hero of the vietnam war , a selfless savior and a courageous leader .
the praise was designed to serve as a contrast to the alleged slacker , george w bush , whose service in the military home reserves is inadequately documented . this overemphasis of the presidential candidate as commander-in-chief , who as supreme commander of the us forces , would unquestionably rise to the challenge , takes its relevance from september 11th , a defining moment in america 's recent history . simultaneously , kerry reflects the desperate efforts on the part of the democrats , to compensate for the gaps in president bush 's and the republicans ' policies on national security .
some of these verbal attempts were so brash , that they left a nasty taste among some european observers , as did the overall circus and show character of the whole event . vague policies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : candidate for vice-president john edwards the party conference also served to dash any premature hopes that as president , john kerry would return america to a " gentle power " , silencing its military might in favor of strengthened diplomacy and international understanding - even if kerry did make a point of stressing that he would help lead america back to a more international image .
but over and above this , many of kerry 's policies remained vague .
how is he planning to dry up the quagmire of iraq , how is he planning to get north korea and iran to give up on their nuclear policies ? the old standard-bearer of the democratic party 's leftwing , senator ted kennedy , cut to the chase , when he said that the only thing the democrats fear is another four years of george w bush in the white house .
as far as the democrats are concerned , a second term under the current president has to be avoided at all costs , and laying down the line on foreign policy issues wo n't help the cause . so instead , kerry and his running mate john edwards sold themselves as the social conscience of the nation , and their followers came flocking .
but whether this act will be powerful enough to prevent bush from laying down his cap for another four years , is highly questionable .
when in doubt , voters will be more easily swayed back to the devil they know than convinced into supporting his diluted double . daniel scheschkewitz -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us voters in germany get rallying call the us presidential election in november is expected to be one of the closest contests in the country 's history .

once it starts flying , it will deliver food , water and fuel to the astronauts . named after french author jules verne , the originator of modern science fiction , europe 's first " automated transfer vehicle , " is scheduled to launch aboard an ariane 5 rocket in september 2005 .
the introduction of the spacecraft , which will ferry supplies including food , parts , fuel , water and even mail to the international space station will help take the burden off the space shuttle fleet , which currently transports the bulk of payloads and astronauts .
" we ’ re particularly excited about the atv , because it will help close the gaps if the space shuttle is not flying , " said sigmar wittig , chairman of the executive board of the german aerospace center , which is funding about 41 percent of europe 's contribution to the iss .
" we recently had to reduce the number of astronauts on the iss to two because the shuttle was grounded and there was no way to provide three with enough supplies .
separating the transport of humans and goods is the way to go in the future . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the automated transfer vehicle will use a laser tracking system to dock with the international space station .
after the launch of the jules verne , one atv will be launched by esa about every year , carrying 7.5 tons of cargo from the kourou launch site in french guyana .
the cylindrical vessel weighs 20 tons and measures 10.3 meters long -lrb- 33.79 feet -rrb- and 4.5 meters in diameter . after a journey of up to five days , it will dock with the space station 's russian service module using a precision laser tracking system that looks like a scene straight out of " star wars . "
the atv holds tanks that can carry 840 kilograms of water , 860 kilograms of refuelling propellant for the iss ' propulsion system and 100 kilograms of oxygen .
the spacecraft also has thrusters that will be used to boost the space station 's altitude every 10 to 45 days .
residual atmosphere causes the station to sink from its normal altitude of 400 kilometers , and up until now the us space shuttles have been used to propel the iss back to its correct position .
galactic parcel post and trash can in one once docked with the russian service module on the iss , astronauts can access the atv during a six-month period .
after all the supplies have been unloaded , the atv is then filled with up to 6.5 tons of station waste , which will be destroyed as the cargo vessel burns up and disintegrates in earth 's atmosphere .
bildunterschrift : the pressurized automated transfer vehicle will be docked with the space station for up to six months at a time and will be completely accessible to astronauts on board the iss .
though jules verne 's voyage to space will only be one-way , his successors will become a routine part of life on the space station .
" the atv can play a major role from the moment onwards when the shuttle is phased out , " said jörg feustel-büechl , referring to us plans to junk the shuttle program in the near future . " the atv is by far the biggest resupply vehicle .
presently we are relying very much on the russian ' progress ' vehicle , which can transport two to three tons to the station . "
like the columbus research module , eads space transportation is also the prime contractor for atv , but most of the development work has been undertaken at the company 's french headquarters in les mureaux near paris . daryl lindsey send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the final frontier : europe in space from commercial satellite launches to the international space station to the vision of the aurora manned moon and mars missions , europe is rapidly expanding its presence in space like never before .

the findings could aid preparations for the first manned mars voyage . after space shuttle flights resume in 2005 , one of the early payloads will be the european space agency 's columbus research module . the cylindrical module , which looks like an outsized soda can , is coming together in a large assembly hall at eads space transportation , a subsidiary of airbus maker eads , in the northern german city of bremen .

columbus was originally scheduled to be launched this year , but the delay has given the project 's scientists and engineers more time to conduct testing and to make the research laboratory more flexible to accommodate future experiments .
afterall , unlike an airplane , engineers do n't have the luxury of doing test-flights on columbus - it has to work from day one .
the 4.5-meter -lrb- 14.76 feet -rrb- cylindrical module , which weighs about 450 tons and has a floor space of 75 cubic meters , is packed with scientific experiments covering the fields of biology , biotechnology , human physiology , material science and fluid science .

in rough terms , we will have 100 times more capability to do experiments than we ever had before , " said jörg feustel-büechl , esa 's director of manned spaceflight .
columbus can fit up to three astronauts working in the unit 's zero-gravity conditions .
astronauts as zero-gravity guinea pigs among the primary goals of columbus is to study the effects of long-term space travel on the human body .
in order to send astronauts to the moon or mars for long periods , scientists and medical experts must first learns ways to counter the aging effects of space travel as well as prolonged exposure to increased radiation from the sun .
the studies could also aid medical researchers treating illnesses on terra firma .
" we will study how the body behaves , " feustel-büechl said .
" the body ages more quickly in space and bone density diminishes , and that 's an important phenomenon for studying the effects of osteoporosis .
you also have a different distribution of the fluids of the blood and water in the body .
you can study cardiovascular effects or the effects on the brains or eyes . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european physiology modules -lrb- epm -rrb- will be used to test the long-term health effects of space travel on astronauts .
feustel-büechl said that many health phenomena that occur on earth are accelerated in space , which will help scientists to study them more easily and quickly than they could on our own planet .
the same " biolab " facility used to study humans can also be used for experiments on cells , tissue cultures , microorganisms , small plants and invertebrates .
benefits for business the esa scientist said the laboratory would also be important for studying material science .
in space , there is no convection , and astronauts in the columbus module can " isolate physical phenomena in a much better way , understanding better , for example , how fluids behave with gases , how combustion works and how melting fluids behave - not just for the textbooks , but also for practical applications in various disciplines and industries . "
in other words , the lessons learned in space could help companies back on earth create new manufacturing techniques .
in addition to the research facilities inside columbus , the module also has four outdoor platforms for experiments .
" these will allow our astronaut scientists to look to the sky for astronomical observations or to look down to earth for observation experiments , " said feustel-büechl .
" we can also conduct experiments with technology that needs to be exposed to space conditions . "

us presidential candidate john kerry officially accepted the democratic nomination on thursday , promising to restore america 's international reputation , and re-bind the fraying ties to europe . for four days the us democrats in boston have been working their hardest to sell john kerry as the man that america wants , needs and can have .
and they - both the candidate himself and the party elite - have done so with the conspicuous absence of pointed anti-bush rhetoric , even though the drive to oust the president from office is the strongest glue to have united the party in a long time . come the elections on november 2 , it will be the undecided voters in the key states and from the political center , who will decide , and now is the time to win them over with a positive message .
with this in mind , the democrats in boston presented themselves as guardians of the the old american ideals , as a regenerative strength which would both close the divide on home ground and win back america 's tarred international reputation . they did everything they could to present john kerry as an experienced politician , a high- principled soul , and a man who knows how to protect america effectively .
the latter is crucial to the american electorate , which lives in fear of suffering an historic defeat in the fight against terrorism . vietnam hero kerry 's supporters and fellow democrats doused him in glory , touting him as hero of the vietnam war , a selfless savior and a courageous leader .
the praise was designed to serve as a contrast to the alleged slacker , george w bush , whose service in the military home reserves is inadequately documented . this overemphasis of the presidential candidate as commander-in-chief , who as supreme commander of the us forces , would unquestionably rise to the challenge , takes its relevance from september 11th , a defining moment in america 's recent history . simultaneously , kerry reflects the desperate efforts on the part of the democrats , to compensate for the gaps in president bush 's and the republicans ' policies on national security .

us presidential candidate john kerry officially accepted the democratic nomination on thursday , promising to restore america 's international reputation , and re-bind the fraying ties to europe . for four days the us democrats in boston have been working their hardest to sell john kerry as the man that america wants , needs and can have .
and they - both the candidate himself and the party elite - have done so with the conspicuous absence of pointed anti-bush rhetoric , even though the drive to oust the president from office is the strongest glue to have united the party in a long time . come the elections on november 2 , it will be the undecided voters in the key states and from the political center , who will decide , and now is the time to win them over with a positive message .
with this in mind , the democrats in boston presented themselves as guardians of the the old american ideals , as a regenerative strength which would both close the divide on home ground and win back america 's tarred international reputation . they did everything they could to present john kerry as an experienced politician , a high- principled soul , and a man who knows how to protect america effectively .
the latter is crucial to the american electorate , which lives in fear of suffering an historic defeat in the fight against terrorism . vietnam hero kerry 's supporters and fellow democrats doused him in glory , touting him as hero of the vietnam war , a selfless savior and a courageous leader .
the praise was designed to serve as a contrast to the alleged slacker , george w bush , whose service in the military home reserves is inadequately documented . this overemphasis of the presidential candidate as commander-in-chief , who as supreme commander of the us forces , would unquestionably rise to the challenge , takes its relevance from september 11th , a defining moment in america 's recent history . simultaneously , kerry reflects the desperate efforts on the part of the democrats , to compensate for the gaps in president bush 's and the republicans ' policies on national security .
some of these verbal attempts were so brash , that they left a nasty taste among some european observers , as did the overall circus and show character of the whole event . vague policies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : candidate for vice-president john edwards the party conference also served to dash any premature hopes that as president , john kerry would return america to a " gentle power " , silencing its military might in favor of strengthened diplomacy and international understanding - even if kerry did make a point of stressing that he would help lead america back to a more international image .
but over and above this , many of kerry 's policies remained vague .
how is he planning to dry up the quagmire of iraq , how is he planning to get north korea and iran to give up on their nuclear policies ? the old standard-bearer of the democratic party 's leftwing , senator ted kennedy , cut to the chase , when he said that the only thing the democrats fear is another four years of george w bush in the white house .
as far as the democrats are concerned , a second term under the current president has to be avoided at all costs , and laying down the line on foreign policy issues wo n't help the cause . so instead , kerry and his running mate john edwards sold themselves as the social conscience of the nation , and their followers came flocking .
but whether this act will be powerful enough to prevent bush from laying down his cap for another four years , is highly questionable .
when in doubt , voters will be more easily swayed back to the devil they know than convinced into supporting his diluted double . daniel scheschkewitz -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us voters in germany get rallying call the us presidential election in november is expected to be one of the closest contests in the country 's history .

german spelling is once again at the center of political debate , despite the fact that an across-the-board reform went into effect six years ago . " i would rather decline two drinks than one german verb , " mark twain famously wrote in his essay the awful german language .
but germans do n't need an american to tell them that their language is difficult - they know it themselves .
and they 're working on it .
several years ago , amid much controversy , germany -lrb- and switzerland and austria -rrb- decided to tackle the problem .
in 1998 , after decades of failed attempts , a committee pushed through a raft of changes known as the rechtschreibreform -lrb- spelling reform . -rrb-
the new rules were first applied in a transition phase , but are slated to become mandatory on august 1 , 2005 .
the changes aim to iron out some of the quirks in the language , and include various spelling changes such as using " ss " instead of the " ß " character .
they also thin out the hundreds of complex rules regarding the use of commas .
' unnecessary as gout ' but what started out as a simple effort to make life easier for the masses seems to have turned into a political hot potato .
the premiers of five german states - all of them members of the conservative opposition - have gone on record in recent weeks saying they want the government to reconsider the reforms .
common complaints : the new rules are confusing , and people are n't putting them into practice .
along with the politicians , several well known german writers , including nobel prize winner günther grass and poet and essayist hans magnus enzensberger have come out against the reform .
swiss author adolf muschg told the bild-zeitung newspaper : " the spelling reform must be stopped immediately .
it is as unnecessary as gout , has brought no improvement , and instead made people more uncertain . "
the german government has stuck to its guns , however , saying the reforms will go through as planned .
thomas steg , deputy spokesman for the government , told the dpa press agency that it would be " nonsense " to revisit the issue now .
after years of debate , " now the decisions that have been made should be put into effect consistently , " he said , and added : " the reaction of certain of the -lrb- state -rrb- premiers seems strange to me . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's leading dictionary marked all spelling changes in red in its 1996 edition .
for the most part , publishers , schools , and civil servants have long since adapted to the new system .
some 90 percent of new books are published using the reformed spelling rules .
felizitas liemersdorf , the principal of an elementary school in cologne , said it would be " nonsense " for the reforms to be rescinded now .
she admitted that the reforms were problematic from the get-go , saying they were " neither logical nor far reaching enough . "
however , like educators throughout the country , liemersdorf had no choice other than make sure the new rules were being applied in the classroom .

" can you imagine the cost ?
there would be a huge outcry .
we already replaced books - readers , worksheets , dictionaries , reference books . all the new books for classrooms are in the new style . "
too many critics to ignore to date , just one member of the federal government - culture minister christina weiss - has spoken out in favor of reviewing the reform issue .
in a conversation with the faz , weiss said it makes sense to give the rules another look before they become final .
she called the new rules " confusing and nonsensical , " and noted that " there are too many critics to just ignore them . "
" until the transition phase is over , on july 31 , 2005 , we still have the chance to think about the new rules .

weiss suggests throwing the issue in the lap of the kmk , or kultusministerkonferenz - the group in charge of education policy on issues that go beyond state .
and indeed , because a conservative committee member has requested it , the issue will stand on the agenda when the group next meets , in october .

noting that the group just voted unanimously in favor of the reforms in june , kmk president doris ahnen told the ddp news agency she finds it " somewhat strange " that one of her colleagues requested bringing the topic back to life .

the findings could aid preparations for the first manned mars voyage . after space shuttle flights resume in 2005 , one of the early payloads will be the european space agency 's columbus research module . the cylindrical module , which looks like an outsized soda can , is coming together in a large assembly hall at eads space transportation , a subsidiary of airbus maker eads , in the northern german city of bremen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eads space transportation .
columbus laboratory and electrical test models in the integration hall in bremen , germany .
columbus was originally scheduled to be launched this year , but the delay has given the project 's scientists and engineers more time to conduct testing and to make the research laboratory more flexible to accommodate future experiments .
afterall , unlike an airplane , engineers do n't have the luxury of doing test-flights on columbus - it has to work from day one .
the 4.5-meter -lrb- 14.76 feet -rrb- cylindrical module , which weighs about 450 tons and has a floor space of 75 cubic meters , is packed with scientific experiments covering the fields of biology , biotechnology , human physiology , material science and fluid science .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a full-sized model of the columbus laboratory is open to visitors at eads space transportation in bremen esa gained some earlier experience in orbit with spacelab , which flew on 22 missions in the cargo bay of the space shuttle between 1983 and 1998 , but columbus marks the first time europe will have an experiment facility all its own , available 24 hours a day , 365 days a year in space .
in rough terms , we will have 100 times more capability to do experiments than we ever had before , " said jörg feustel-büechl , esa 's director of manned spaceflight .
columbus can fit up to three astronauts working in the unit 's zero-gravity conditions .
astronauts as zero-gravity guinea pigs among the primary goals of columbus is to study the effects of long-term space travel on the human body .
in order to send astronauts to the moon or mars for long periods , scientists and medical experts must first learns ways to counter the aging effects of space travel as well as prolonged exposure to increased radiation from the sun .
the studies could also aid medical researchers treating illnesses on terra firma .
" we will study how the body behaves , " feustel-büechl said .
" the body ages more quickly in space and bone density diminishes , and that 's an important phenomenon for studying the effects of osteoporosis .
you also have a different distribution of the fluids of the blood and water in the body .
you can study cardiovascular effects or the effects on the brains or eyes . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european physiology modules -lrb- epm -rrb- will be used to test the long-term health effects of space travel on astronauts .
feustel-büechl said that many health phenomena that occur on earth are accelerated in space , which will help scientists to study them more easily and quickly than they could on our own planet .
the same " biolab " facility used to study humans can also be used for experiments on cells , tissue cultures , microorganisms , small plants and invertebrates .
benefits for business the esa scientist said the laboratory would also be important for studying material science .
in space , there is no convection , and astronauts in the columbus module can " isolate physical phenomena in a much better way , understanding better , for example , how fluids behave with gases , how combustion works and how melting fluids behave - not just for the textbooks , but also for practical applications in various disciplines and industries . "
in other words , the lessons learned in space could help companies back on earth create new manufacturing techniques .
in addition to the research facilities inside columbus , the module also has four outdoor platforms for experiments .
" these will allow our astronaut scientists to look to the sky for astronomical observations or to look down to earth for observation experiments , " said feustel-büechl .
" we can also conduct experiments with technology that needs to be exposed to space conditions . "
an industrial tower of babel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a custom built airbus a300-600st beluga was used to carry the columbus ' shell from alenia spazial in turin , italy , to eads space transportation in bremen .
the building of the complex research laboratory has been a major european cooperative effort .
eads space transportation is the prime contractor on the columbus module , but the work has been shared by all of the iss ' european partners .
italian engineers at alenia spazial in turin , italy , designed and built the module structure and parts also came from partners in holland , belgium , france , denmark and other european countries - with several hundred workers involved in the project .
günther brandt , head of space station elements at eads space transportation , was in charge of the gargantuan task of organizing the dozens of contractors working on the columbus - a tower of babel of languages and engineering styles .
" the biggest challenge is to get all these companies in various countries under one umbrella and get them working towards one system , " he explained .
with different cultures and tongues , it can be difficult to find harmony .
" it 's often not easy to get this all straightened out and in line so that one product comes out of this , " he said .

once it starts flying , it will deliver food , water and fuel to the astronauts . named after french author jules verne , the originator of modern science fiction , europe 's first " automated transfer vehicle , " is scheduled to launch aboard an ariane 5 rocket in september 2005 .
the introduction of the spacecraft , which will ferry supplies including food , parts , fuel , water and even mail to the international space station will help take the burden off the space shuttle fleet , which currently transports the bulk of payloads and astronauts .
" we ’ re particularly excited about the atv , because it will help close the gaps if the space shuttle is not flying , " said sigmar wittig , chairman of the executive board of the german aerospace center , which is funding about 41 percent of europe 's contribution to the iss .
" we recently had to reduce the number of astronauts on the iss to two because the shuttle was grounded and there was no way to provide three with enough supplies .
separating the transport of humans and goods is the way to go in the future . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the automated transfer vehicle will use a laser tracking system to dock with the international space station .
after the launch of the jules verne , one atv will be launched by esa about every year , carrying 7.5 tons of cargo from the kourou launch site in french guyana .
the cylindrical vessel weighs 20 tons and measures 10.3 meters long -lrb- 33.79 feet -rrb- and 4.5 meters in diameter . after a journey of up to five days , it will dock with the space station 's russian service module using a precision laser tracking system that looks like a scene straight out of " star wars . "
the atv holds tanks that can carry 840 kilograms of water , 860 kilograms of refuelling propellant for the iss ' propulsion system and 100 kilograms of oxygen .
the spacecraft also has thrusters that will be used to boost the space station 's altitude every 10 to 45 days .

the findings could aid preparations for the first manned mars voyage . after space shuttle flights resume in 2005 , one of the early payloads will be the european space agency 's columbus research module . the cylindrical module , which looks like an outsized soda can , is coming together in a large assembly hall at eads space transportation , a subsidiary of airbus maker eads , in the northern german city of bremen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eads space transportation .
columbus laboratory and electrical test models in the integration hall in bremen , germany .
columbus was originally scheduled to be launched this year , but the delay has given the project 's scientists and engineers more time to conduct testing and to make the research laboratory more flexible to accommodate future experiments .
afterall , unlike an airplane , engineers do n't have the luxury of doing test-flights on columbus - it has to work from day one .
the 4.5-meter -lrb- 14.76 feet -rrb- cylindrical module , which weighs about 450 tons and has a floor space of 75 cubic meters , is packed with scientific experiments covering the fields of biology , biotechnology , human physiology , material science and fluid science .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a full-sized model of the columbus laboratory is open to visitors at eads space transportation in bremen esa gained some earlier experience in orbit with spacelab , which flew on 22 missions in the cargo bay of the space shuttle between 1983 and 1998 , but columbus marks the first time europe will have an experiment facility all its own , available 24 hours a day , 365 days a year in space .
in rough terms , we will have 100 times more capability to do experiments than we ever had before , " said jörg feustel-büechl , esa 's director of manned spaceflight .
columbus can fit up to three astronauts working in the unit 's zero-gravity conditions .
astronauts as zero-gravity guinea pigs among the primary goals of columbus is to study the effects of long-term space travel on the human body .
in order to send astronauts to the moon or mars for long periods , scientists and medical experts must first learns ways to counter the aging effects of space travel as well as prolonged exposure to increased radiation from the sun .
the studies could also aid medical researchers treating illnesses on terra firma .
" we will study how the body behaves , " feustel-büechl said .
" the body ages more quickly in space and bone density diminishes , and that 's an important phenomenon for studying the effects of osteoporosis .
you also have a different distribution of the fluids of the blood and water in the body .
you can study cardiovascular effects or the effects on the brains or eyes . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european physiology modules -lrb- epm -rrb- will be used to test the long-term health effects of space travel on astronauts .
feustel-büechl said that many health phenomena that occur on earth are accelerated in space , which will help scientists to study them more easily and quickly than they could on our own planet .
the same " biolab " facility used to study humans can also be used for experiments on cells , tissue cultures , microorganisms , small plants and invertebrates .
benefits for business the esa scientist said the laboratory would also be important for studying material science .
in space , there is no convection , and astronauts in the columbus module can " isolate physical phenomena in a much better way , understanding better , for example , how fluids behave with gases , how combustion works and how melting fluids behave - not just for the textbooks , but also for practical applications in various disciplines and industries . "
in other words , the lessons learned in space could help companies back on earth create new manufacturing techniques .
in addition to the research facilities inside columbus , the module also has four outdoor platforms for experiments .
" these will allow our astronaut scientists to look to the sky for astronomical observations or to look down to earth for observation experiments , " said feustel-büechl .
" we can also conduct experiments with technology that needs to be exposed to space conditions . "
an industrial tower of babel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a custom built airbus a300-600st beluga was used to carry the columbus ' shell from alenia spazial in turin , italy , to eads space transportation in bremen .
the building of the complex research laboratory has been a major european cooperative effort .
eads space transportation is the prime contractor on the columbus module , but the work has been shared by all of the iss ' european partners .
italian engineers at alenia spazial in turin , italy , designed and built the module structure and parts also came from partners in holland , belgium , france , denmark and other european countries - with several hundred workers involved in the project .
günther brandt , head of space station elements at eads space transportation , was in charge of the gargantuan task of organizing the dozens of contractors working on the columbus - a tower of babel of languages and engineering styles .
" the biggest challenge is to get all these companies in various countries under one umbrella and get them working towards one system , " he explained .
with different cultures and tongues , it can be difficult to find harmony .
" it 's often not easy to get this all straightened out and in line so that one product comes out of this , " he said .
but when columbus finally reaches the iss after more than 15 years of planning in 2006 , the scientists assume nothing will be lost in translation . daryl lindsey send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the final frontier : europe in space from commercial satellite launches to the international space station to the vision of the aurora manned moon and mars missions , europe is rapidly expanding its presence in space like never before .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 30.07.2004 german spelling debate reignites großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new rules : simpler , or simply more confusing ?
german spelling is once again at the center of political debate , despite the fact that an across-the-board reform went into effect six years ago . " i would rather decline two drinks than one german verb , " mark twain famously wrote in his essay the awful german language .
but germans do n't need an american to tell them that their language is difficult - they know it themselves .
and they 're working on it .
several years ago , amid much controversy , germany -lrb- and switzerland and austria -rrb- decided to tackle the problem .
in 1998 , after decades of failed attempts , a committee pushed through a raft of changes known as the rechtschreibreform -lrb- spelling reform . -rrb-
the new rules were first applied in a transition phase , but are slated to become mandatory on august 1 , 2005 .
the changes aim to iron out some of the quirks in the language , and include various spelling changes such as using " ss " instead of the " ß " character .
they also thin out the hundreds of complex rules regarding the use of commas .
' unnecessary as gout ' but what started out as a simple effort to make life easier for the masses seems to have turned into a political hot potato .
the premiers of five german states - all of them members of the conservative opposition - have gone on record in recent weeks saying they want the government to reconsider the reforms .
common complaints : the new rules are confusing , and people are n't putting them into practice .
along with the politicians , several well known german writers , including nobel prize winner günther grass and poet and essayist hans magnus enzensberger have come out against the reform .
swiss author adolf muschg told the bild-zeitung newspaper : " the spelling reform must be stopped immediately .
it is as unnecessary as gout , has brought no improvement , and instead made people more uncertain . "
the german government has stuck to its guns , however , saying the reforms will go through as planned .
thomas steg , deputy spokesman for the government , told the dpa press agency that it would be " nonsense " to revisit the issue now .
after years of debate , " now the decisions that have been made should be put into effect consistently , " he said , and added : " the reaction of certain of the -lrb- state -rrb- premiers seems strange to me . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's leading dictionary marked all spelling changes in red in its 1996 edition .
for the most part , publishers , schools , and civil servants have long since adapted to the new system .
some 90 percent of new books are published using the reformed spelling rules .
felizitas liemersdorf , the principal of an elementary school in cologne , said it would be " nonsense " for the reforms to be rescinded now .
she admitted that the reforms were problematic from the get-go , saying they were " neither logical nor far reaching enough . "
however , like educators throughout the country , liemersdorf had no choice other than make sure the new rules were being applied in the classroom .
high cost of change " the first problem is , they were n't mandatory for everyone .
just take a look at our good old faz ! " she said , referring to the leading german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , which continues to publish under the old style .
but nonetheless , to go back to the old ways after six years would be " absurd , " liemersdorf said .
" can you imagine the cost ?
there would be a huge outcry .
we already replaced books - readers , worksheets , dictionaries , reference books . all the new books for classrooms are in the new style . "
too many critics to ignore to date , just one member of the federal government - culture minister christina weiss - has spoken out in favor of reviewing the reform issue .
in a conversation with the faz , weiss said it makes sense to give the rules another look before they become final .
she called the new rules " confusing and nonsensical , " and noted that " there are too many critics to just ignore them . "
" until the transition phase is over , on july 31 , 2005 , we still have the chance to think about the new rules .
i see a chance to clarify problematic issues , " weiss told the faz - the same newspaper that refuses to adopt the new spelling .
weiss suggests throwing the issue in the lap of the kmk , or kultusministerkonferenz - the group in charge of education policy on issues that go beyond state .
and indeed , because a conservative committee member has requested it , the issue will stand on the agenda when the group next meets , in october .
debate a ' senseless waste ' ?
noting that the group just voted unanimously in favor of the reforms in june , kmk president doris ahnen told the ddp news agency she finds it " somewhat strange " that one of her colleagues requested bringing the topic back to life .
moreover , she said , she does n't believe anything will change , even after another debate .
" most of the ministers in the committee are still in favor of the reforms , and are in favor of making them mandatory next august , " she stressed .
a representative of the german journalists ' association -lrb- djv -rrb- told news agencies that his group is in favor of keeping the reform .
rescinding it at this point would be " a senseless waste of money , " djv chairman michael konken said .
konken said the whole debate should go back to where it came from : the " sommerloch " - the big summer news hole that german politicians know is always good for press in the slow season . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de coming to terms with germany 's new spelling reform five years after germany 's controversial spelling reforms were introduced , many germans are still confused by the new spelling rules , while others simply refuse to use them .

the introduction of the spacecraft , which will ferry supplies including food , parts , fuel , water and even mail to the international space station will help take the burden off the space shuttle fleet , which currently transports the bulk of payloads and astronauts .
" we ’ re particularly excited about the atv , because it will help close the gaps if the space shuttle is not flying , " said sigmar wittig , chairman of the executive board of the german aerospace center , which is funding about 41 percent of europe 's contribution to the iss .
" we recently had to reduce the number of astronauts on the iss to two because the shuttle was grounded and there was no way to provide three with enough supplies .

the cylindrical vessel weighs 20 tons and measures 10.3 meters long -lrb- 33.79 feet -rrb- and 4.5 meters in diameter . after a journey of up to five days , it will dock with the space station 's russian service module using a precision laser tracking system that looks like a scene straight out of " star wars .

the atv holds tanks that can carry 840 kilograms of water , 860 kilograms of refuelling propellant for the iss ' propulsion system and 100 kilograms of oxygen .
the spacecraft also has thrusters that will be used to boost the space station 's altitude every 10 to 45 days .

" we ’ re particularly excited about the atv , because it will help close the gaps if the space shuttle is not flying , " said sigmar wittig , chairman of the executive board of the german aerospace center , which is funding about 41 percent of europe 's contribution to the iss .
" we recently had to reduce the number of astronauts on the iss to two because the shuttle was grounded and there was no way to provide three with enough supplies .
separating the transport of humans and goods is the way to go in the future . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the automated transfer vehicle will use a laser tracking system to dock with the international space station .
after the launch of the jules verne , one atv will be launched by esa about every year , carrying 7.5 tons of cargo from the kourou launch site in french guyana .
the cylindrical vessel weighs 20 tons and measures 10.3 meters long -lrb- 33.79 feet -rrb- and 4.5 meters in diameter . after a journey of up to five days , it will dock with the space station 's russian service module using a precision laser tracking system that looks like a scene straight out of " star wars . "
the atv holds tanks that can carry 840 kilograms of water , 860 kilograms of refuelling propellant for the iss ' propulsion system and 100 kilograms of oxygen .
the spacecraft also has thrusters that will be used to boost the space station 's altitude every 10 to 45 days .
residual atmosphere causes the station to sink from its normal altitude of 400 kilometers , and up until now the us space shuttles have been used to propel the iss back to its correct position .
galactic parcel post and trash can in one once docked with the russian service module on the iss , astronauts can access the atv during a six-month period .
after all the supplies have been unloaded , the atv is then filled with up to 6.5 tons of station waste , which will be destroyed as the cargo vessel burns up and disintegrates in earth 's atmosphere .
bildunterschrift : the pressurized automated transfer vehicle will be docked with the space station for up to six months at a time and will be completely accessible to astronauts on board the iss .
though jules verne 's voyage to space will only be one-way , his successors will become a routine part of life on the space station .
" the atv can play a major role from the moment onwards when the shuttle is phased out , " said jörg feustel-büechl , referring to us plans to junk the shuttle program in the near future . " the atv is by far the biggest resupply vehicle .
presently we are relying very much on the russian ' progress ' vehicle , which can transport two to three tons to the station . "
like the columbus research module , eads space transportation is also the prime contractor for atv , but most of the development work has been undertaken at the company 's french headquarters in les mureaux near paris . daryl lindsey send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the final frontier : europe in space from commercial satellite launches to the international space station to the vision of the aurora manned moon and mars missions , europe is rapidly expanding its presence in space like never before .

but unlike other governments , he does n't have the luxury of picking his own . as outgoing european commission president romano prodi whiles his summer days away along the shores of greece , his succesor is spending the summer assembling his new team , which is to be confirmed by the european parliament in september and will begin its term on nov .
1 .
but the former portuguese prime minister , elected by parliament earlier this month , has major limitations in how he can structure his commission .
under eu procedures barrosa can determine what portfolio any given commissioner will receive , but national capitals determine who will represent their countries on the commission .
only five out of the current 20 commissioners will remain in the european executive office come november .
they include viviane reding of luxembourg , margot wallström of sweden , france 's jaques barrot and possibly joaquin almunia of spain - both of whom have only served in brussels for the past few months - as well as germany 's günter verheugen .
super-commissioner verheugen ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter verheugen observers believe that because of verheugen 's -lrb- photo -rrb- experience as commissioner for enlargement , he will , by default , become a sort of " super-commissioner . "
compared to the other candidates , he 's one of the few among the commissioners nominated by the member states who carries considerable political clout .
nevertheless , barroso has rejected the proposals to create a super-commissioner label or any other tiered system of commissioners .
but german chancellor gerhard schröder has expressed his desire for verheugen to take over the commission 's economics portfolio as well as responsibility for implementation of the so-called lisbon agenda , which seeks to make the eu the most industrially , technologically and economically dynamic group of nations in the world by 2010 .
so far the effort has produced meager results .
under schröder 's vision , verheugen would breathe new life into the lisbon plan and coordinate his activities with the other commissioners .
indeed , most of the large member states are pushing for a more powerful economics portfolio .
currently the competencies are divided among four different commissioners who manage competition policy , the internal market , trade and industrial policy .
due to domestic policy concerns , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi has recalled mario monti , who has had a highly successful stint as competition commissioner , and is instead sending rocco buttiglione . the experienced politician is a member of the italian coalition government 's junior partner , the democratic union of the center , which has lately been on a confrontation course with berlusconi .
france 's jacques barrot is also jockeying for an economics-related commission post at the behest of his mentor , president jacques chirac .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter mandelson has been forced to resign from tony blair 's cabinet in two separate incidences .
now he 's going to represent britain in brussels .
meanwhile , tony blair is sending his scandal-plagued two-time cabinet member peter mandelson -lrb- photo -rrb- to brussels to represent the united kingdom on the commission .
mandelson is considered a close confidante of blair , and he has been selected with the hope that he can increase euroskeptical brits ' interest in brussels in time for the country 's planned referendum on the eu constitution .
the big unknowns the biggest wildcards on the new commission are the ten commissioners from the new eu member states .
they 've already been shadowing the commission since earlier this year without a portfolio , but they have n't made much of a dent in public .
nonetheless , observers in brussels believe poland 's danuta hübner will likely be given one of the more important commission posts .
expanding the commission out of the current 19 commission departments , barroso will now be responsible for creating 24 so that all of the commissioners of the member states will have authority over at least one policy area .
but only 12 of those 24 positions will likely carry much weight - meaning that the smaller member states will likely be given less meaningful competencies in the eu executive , which will hold office through 2009 .
as part of their accession negotiations , the smaller states came to an agreement that the commission should be comprised of one commissioner from each member state , despite that fact that the body , at least in theory , represents eu treaties in an independent , supranational manner without representing the interests of individual countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian foreign minister benita ferrero-waldner one of barroso 's stated goals is to have at least eight women on his team .
if austria decides to send its current foreign minister , benita ferrero-waldner -lrb- photo -rrb- , to brussels , he may come close to that goal .
ferrero-walder recently lost the presidential election and with her on the commission , the number of woman would climb to seven .
opportunity in weakness the relatively weak profile of most of the future eu commissioners could actually represent an opportunity for barroso , who himself was n't even the first choice for the post he now holds .
it 's possible he could excell as a stronger president than those seen on recent commissions .
his predecessor , prodi , gave his commissioners a long leash and considerable room to develop their political independence .
but this also came at a cost , since most viewed prodi as a weak commission president .
barroso plans to complete his jigsaw puzzle of people and competencies by the end of august , when brussels ' core of eurocrats returns from summer vacation . between now and then , he 'll be working the speed dial button to national capitals and he 'll be holding interviews with the commissioners to determine who gets what position .
in the worst-case scenario , barroso has said , he will take advantage of his ability to reject or fire candidates with insufficient experience - a right that was first cemented in the recently ratified treaty of nice . bernd riegert , brussels -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu parliament confirms barroso the european parliament has confirmed jose barroso as the next president of the european commission on thursday .

but the former portuguese prime minister , elected by parliament earlier this month , has major limitations in how he can structure his commission .
under eu procedures barrosa can determine what portfolio any given commissioner will receive , but national capitals determine who will represent their countries on the commission .
only five out of the current 20 commissioners will remain in the european executive office come november .
they include viviane reding of luxembourg , margot wallström of sweden , france 's jaques barrot and possibly joaquin almunia of spain - both of whom have only served in brussels for the past few months - as well as germany 's günter verheugen .
super-commissioner verheugen ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter verheugen observers believe that because of verheugen 's -lrb- photo -rrb- experience as commissioner for enlargement , he will , by default , become a sort of " super-commissioner . "
compared to the other candidates , he 's one of the few among the commissioners nominated by the member states who carries considerable political clout .
nevertheless , barroso has rejected the proposals to create a super-commissioner label or any other tiered system of commissioners .
but german chancellor gerhard schröder has expressed his desire for verheugen to take over the commission 's economics portfolio as well as responsibility for implementation of the so-called lisbon agenda , which seeks to make the eu the most industrially , technologically and economically dynamic group of nations in the world by 2010 .
so far the effort has produced meager results .
under schröder 's vision , verheugen would breathe new life into the lisbon plan and coordinate his activities with the other commissioners .
indeed , most of the large member states are pushing for a more powerful economics portfolio .
currently the competencies are divided among four different commissioners who manage competition policy , the internal market , trade and industrial policy .
due to domestic policy concerns , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi has recalled mario monti , who has had a highly successful stint as competition commissioner , and is instead sending rocco buttiglione . the experienced politician is a member of the italian coalition government 's junior partner , the democratic union of the center , which has lately been on a confrontation course with berlusconi .
france 's jacques barrot is also jockeying for an economics-related commission post at the behest of his mentor , president jacques chirac .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter mandelson has been forced to resign from tony blair 's cabinet in two separate incidences .
now he 's going to represent britain in brussels .
meanwhile , tony blair is sending his scandal-plagued two-time cabinet member peter mandelson -lrb- photo -rrb- to brussels to represent the united kingdom on the commission .
mandelson is considered a close confidante of blair , and he has been selected with the hope that he can increase euroskeptical brits ' interest in brussels in time for the country 's planned referendum on the eu constitution .
the big unknowns the biggest wildcards on the new commission are the ten commissioners from the new eu member states .
they 've already been shadowing the commission since earlier this year without a portfolio , but they have n't made much of a dent in public .
nonetheless , observers in brussels believe poland 's danuta hübner will likely be given one of the more important commission posts .
expanding the commission out of the current 19 commission departments , barroso will now be responsible for creating 24 so that all of the commissioners of the member states will have authority over at least one policy area .
but only 12 of those 24 positions will likely carry much weight - meaning that the smaller member states will likely be given less meaningful competencies in the eu executive , which will hold office through 2009 .
as part of their accession negotiations , the smaller states came to an agreement that the commission should be comprised of one commissioner from each member state , despite that fact that the body , at least in theory , represents eu treaties in an independent , supranational manner without representing the interests of individual countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian foreign minister benita ferrero-waldner one of barroso 's stated goals is to have at least eight women on his team .
if austria decides to send its current foreign minister , benita ferrero-waldner -lrb- photo -rrb- , to brussels , he may come close to that goal .
ferrero-walder recently lost the presidential election and with her on the commission , the number of woman would climb to seven .
opportunity in weakness the relatively weak profile of most of the future eu commissioners could actually represent an opportunity for barroso , who himself was n't even the first choice for the post he now holds .
it 's possible he could excell as a stronger president than those seen on recent commissions .
his predecessor , prodi , gave his commissioners a long leash and considerable room to develop their political independence .
but this also came at a cost , since most viewed prodi as a weak commission president .
barroso plans to complete his jigsaw puzzle of people and competencies by the end of august , when brussels ' core of eurocrats returns from summer vacation . between now and then , he 'll be working the speed dial button to national capitals and he 'll be holding interviews with the commissioners to determine who gets what position .

but it reinforced language on reducing the scope of export credits , which are paid by the united states to its farmers , without calling for their outright elimination . text aimed to placate all members on the sensitive topic of bringing down protective barriers on industrial products ranging from microchips to toys , a key demand by industrialized countries , the text remained largely unchanged .
but wto chief negotiator shotaro oshima added a paragraph in the preamble emphasizing that its provisions still required additional negotiations . that moved in the direction of developing countries , which have refused to give in on market access .
greater access to developing countries ' industrial markets has been a key demand of wealthy countries such as the us and eu in return for reducing support for farmers , which poor countries blame for pricing them out of world markets . five big players agree on farming the world 's poorest countries were also given more leeway with provisions on special treatment .
the united states , european union , australia , brazil and india on thursday struck an agreement on the thorny issue of farming , although it is not clear how much this influenced the revised compromise . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wto general director supachai panitchpakdi , right .
" i welcome the agreement among five key members on the agriculture text , " wto director-general supachai panitchpakdi said in a statement conveyed by a spokesman .
" it is an important input into our negotiations and gives momentum to our efforts at completing negotiations .
but i must caution that no agricultural framework deal is possible without the consensus of all wto member governments . " however , the move annoyed many other countries , while insufficient time has been given to other hot topics such as reducing tariffs on non-farm products .
stalled doha talks are " make or break " for wto " it would be a shame , if for lack of time we do not close a deal that was within reach , at least as far as agriculture goes , " said one diplomat from a developed country in an interview with reuters .
failure to approve the framework this weekend will likely wreck a year-end goal to complete the stalled doha round of trade negotiations as us presidential elections and a shake-up at the european commission loom .
" if this meeting succeeds , it means doha is back on track and it will probably survive all the political changes that are taking place in washington and in brussels , " simon cox of the economist told cnn .
" if it fails , then people will really start to wonder whether the wto system will work . "
the deadline for approval could be postponed until saturday , according to trade sources . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu prepares for wto agriculture talks the eu is going to the wto talks in geneva on tuesday with a common position , despite resistance from france .

but it reinforced language on reducing the scope of export credits , which are paid by the united states to its farmers , without calling for their outright elimination . text aimed to placate all members on the sensitive topic of bringing down protective barriers on industrial products ranging from microchips to toys , a key demand by industrialized countries , the text remained largely unchanged .
but wto chief negotiator shotaro oshima added a paragraph in the preamble emphasizing that its provisions still required additional negotiations . that moved in the direction of developing countries , which have refused to give in on market access .
greater access to developing countries ' industrial markets has been a key demand of wealthy countries such as the us and eu in return for reducing support for farmers , which poor countries blame for pricing them out of world markets . five big players agree on farming the world 's poorest countries were also given more leeway with provisions on special treatment .
the united states , european union , australia , brazil and india on thursday struck an agreement on the thorny issue of farming , although it is not clear how much this influenced the revised compromise . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wto general director supachai panitchpakdi , right .
" i welcome the agreement among five key members on the agriculture text , " wto director-general supachai panitchpakdi said in a statement conveyed by a spokesman .
" it is an important input into our negotiations and gives momentum to our efforts at completing negotiations .
but i must caution that no agricultural framework deal is possible without the consensus of all wto member governments . " however , the move annoyed many other countries , while insufficient time has been given to other hot topics such as reducing tariffs on non-farm products .
stalled doha talks are " make or break " for wto " it would be a shame , if for lack of time we do not close a deal that was within reach , at least as far as agriculture goes , " said one diplomat from a developed country in an interview with reuters .
failure to approve the framework this weekend will likely wreck a year-end goal to complete the stalled doha round of trade negotiations as us presidential elections and a shake-up at the european commission loom .
" if this meeting succeeds , it means doha is back on track and it will probably survive all the political changes that are taking place in washington and in brussels , " simon cox of the economist told cnn .
" if it fails , then people will really start to wonder whether the wto system will work . "
the deadline for approval could be postponed until saturday , according to trade sources . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu prepares for wto agriculture talks the eu is going to the wto talks in geneva on tuesday with a common position , despite resistance from france .

germany 's beer drinkers may be seen as world experts , sampling fine hops and acquiring knowledge of the best brews , but a new survey has shown that many just want to get sloshed . they may have the reputation as the beer connoisseurs of europe , if not the world , but a new study sheds a different light on the drinking habits of the hop-loving germans . contrary to the image of the german beer garden full of locals heartily savoring and comparing the qualities of the brews on tap , it has been reveled that a surprising percentage of germany 's drinkers set out on a mission to get drunk . the survey , released this week by independent market research company mintel , shows that almost one in five german adults , or 17 percent , believe the point of drinking is to get plastered .

" although germans may not go drinking as often as the british , when they do drink , many do want to get drunk . "
the average german adult drank 255 pints of the liquid throat charmer last year , 35 more pints than his british counterpart , the survey found .

once it starts flying , it will deliver food , water and fuel to the astronauts . named after french author jules verne , the originator of modern science fiction , europe 's first " automated transfer vehicle , " is scheduled to launch aboard an ariane 5 rocket in september 2005 .
the introduction of the spacecraft , which will ferry supplies including food , parts , fuel , water and even mail to the international space station will help take the burden off the space shuttle fleet , which currently transports the bulk of payloads and astronauts .
" we ’ re particularly excited about the atv , because it will help close the gaps if the space shuttle is not flying , " said sigmar wittig , chairman of the executive board of the german aerospace center , which is funding about 41 percent of europe 's contribution to the iss .
" we recently had to reduce the number of astronauts on the iss to two because the shuttle was grounded and there was no way to provide three with enough supplies .
separating the transport of humans and goods is the way to go in the future . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the automated transfer vehicle will use a laser tracking system to dock with the international space station .
after the launch of the jules verne , one atv will be launched by esa about every year , carrying 7.5 tons of cargo from the kourou launch site in french guyana .
the cylindrical vessel weighs 20 tons and measures 10.3 meters long -lrb- 33.79 feet -rrb- and 4.5 meters in diameter . after a journey of up to five days , it will dock with the space station 's russian service module using a precision laser tracking system that looks like a scene straight out of " star wars . "
the atv holds tanks that can carry 840 kilograms of water , 860 kilograms of refuelling propellant for the iss ' propulsion system and 100 kilograms of oxygen .
the spacecraft also has thrusters that will be used to boost the space station 's altitude every 10 to 45 days .
residual atmosphere causes the station to sink from its normal altitude of 400 kilometers , and up until now the us space shuttles have been used to propel the iss back to its correct position .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 30.07.2004 -pipe- 10:00 utc roma mep urges commission to act for her people the first ever roma member of the european parliament has urged the european commission to start a concerted effort to improve living conditions for her people .
livia jaroka , the 29-year old hungarian mep from roma origin , said that brussels has been " very good at pressuring the new eu member states " to address the roma issue , but that it had " failed to take concrete action itself . "
jaroka was elected last june as the first and only mep of roma origin for the centre-right hungarian party fidesz .
roma , or gypsies , often face poverty , discrimination , unemployment , bad housing and poor access to health care .
eu membership has only very partly resolved these problems , jaroka said .

the figures come after a month in which the number of people out of work dropped for the first time all year .
reacting on the new figures , experts said the drop was not the turning point many government politicians hoped it would have been .
economist holger schäfer told the associated press that overall jobless figures would decline only slightly this year to 4.35 million .
others have countered that prediction , saying the numbers would increase in the coming months . more briefs 29.07.2004 -pipe- siemens posts healthy quarterly results 29.07.2004 -pipe- employer 's federation chief calls for more reforms 29.07.2004 -pipe- morgan stanley deal fuels tui takeover rumors 28.07.2004 -pipe- germany plans more competition for utilities 28.07.2004 -pipe- thyssenkrupp to shed a thousand jobs 28.07.2004 -pipe- german beer sales up 27.07.2004 -pipe- continued shortfall in german apprenticeships expected 27.07.2004 -pipe- vw reshapes mini-car strategy to boost sales radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

once it starts flying , it will deliver food , water and fuel to the astronauts . named after french author jules verne , the originator of modern science fiction , europe 's first " automated transfer vehicle , " is scheduled to launch aboard an ariane 5 rocket in september 2005 .
the introduction of the spacecraft , which will ferry supplies including food , parts , fuel , water and even mail to the international space station will help take the burden off the space shuttle fleet , which currently transports the bulk of payloads and astronauts .
" we ’ re particularly excited about the atv , because it will help close the gaps if the space shuttle is not flying , " said sigmar wittig , chairman of the executive board of the german aerospace center , which is funding about 41 percent of europe 's contribution to the iss .
" we recently had to reduce the number of astronauts on the iss to two because the shuttle was grounded and there was no way to provide three with enough supplies .
separating the transport of humans and goods is the way to go in the future . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the automated transfer vehicle will use a laser tracking system to dock with the international space station .
after the launch of the jules verne , one atv will be launched by esa about every year , carrying 7.5 tons of cargo from the kourou launch site in french guyana .
the cylindrical vessel weighs 20 tons and measures 10.3 meters long -lrb- 33.79 feet -rrb- and 4.5 meters in diameter . after a journey of up to five days , it will dock with the space station 's russian service module using a precision laser tracking system that looks like a scene straight out of " star wars . "
the atv holds tanks that can carry 840 kilograms of water , 860 kilograms of refuelling propellant for the iss ' propulsion system and 100 kilograms of oxygen .
the spacecraft also has thrusters that will be used to boost the space station 's altitude every 10 to 45 days .
residual atmosphere causes the station to sink from its normal altitude of 400 kilometers , and up until now the us space shuttles have been used to propel the iss back to its correct position .
galactic parcel post and trash can in one once docked with the russian service module on the iss , astronauts can access the atv during a six-month period .
after all the supplies have been unloaded , the atv is then filled with up to 6.5 tons of station waste , which will be destroyed as the cargo vessel burns up and disintegrates in earth 's atmosphere .
bildunterschrift : the pressurized automated transfer vehicle will be docked with the space station for up to six months at a time and will be completely accessible to astronauts on board the iss .
though jules verne 's voyage to space will only be one-way , his successors will become a routine part of life on the space station .
" the atv can play a major role from the moment onwards when the shuttle is phased out , " said jörg feustel-büechl , referring to us plans to junk the shuttle program in the near future . " the atv is by far the biggest resupply vehicle .
presently we are relying very much on the russian ' progress ' vehicle , which can transport two to three tons to the station . "
like the columbus research module , eads space transportation is also the prime contractor for atv , but most of the development work has been undertaken at the company 's french headquarters in les mureaux near paris . daryl lindsey send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the final frontier : europe in space from commercial satellite launches to the international space station to the vision of the aurora manned moon and mars missions , europe is rapidly expanding its presence in space like never before .

once it starts flying , it will deliver food , water and fuel to the astronauts . named after french author jules verne , the originator of modern science fiction , europe 's first " automated transfer vehicle , " is scheduled to launch aboard an ariane 5 rocket in september 2005 .
the introduction of the spacecraft , which will ferry supplies including food , parts , fuel , water and even mail to the international space station will help take the burden off the space shuttle fleet , which currently transports the bulk of payloads and astronauts .
" we ’ re particularly excited about the atv , because it will help close the gaps if the space shuttle is not flying , " said sigmar wittig , chairman of the executive board of the german aerospace center , which is funding about 41 percent of europe 's contribution to the iss .
" we recently had to reduce the number of astronauts on the iss to two because the shuttle was grounded and there was no way to provide three with enough supplies .
separating the transport of humans and goods is the way to go in the future . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the automated transfer vehicle will use a laser tracking system to dock with the international space station .
after the launch of the jules verne , one atv will be launched by esa about every year , carrying 7.5 tons of cargo from the kourou launch site in french guyana .
the cylindrical vessel weighs 20 tons and measures 10.3 meters long -lrb- 33.79 feet -rrb- and 4.5 meters in diameter . after a journey of up to five days , it will dock with the space station 's russian service module using a precision laser tracking system that looks like a scene straight out of " star wars . "
the atv holds tanks that can carry 840 kilograms of water , 860 kilograms of refuelling propellant for the iss ' propulsion system and 100 kilograms of oxygen .
the spacecraft also has thrusters that will be used to boost the space station 's altitude every 10 to 45 days .
residual atmosphere causes the station to sink from its normal altitude of 400 kilometers , and up until now the us space shuttles have been used to propel the iss back to its correct position .
galactic parcel post and trash can in one once docked with the russian service module on the iss , astronauts can access the atv during a six-month period .
after all the supplies have been unloaded , the atv is then filled with up to 6.5 tons of station waste , which will be destroyed as the cargo vessel burns up and disintegrates in earth 's atmosphere .
bildunterschrift : the pressurized automated transfer vehicle will be docked with the space station for up to six months at a time and will be completely accessible to astronauts on board the iss .
though jules verne 's voyage to space will only be one-way , his successors will become a routine part of life on the space station .
" the atv can play a major role from the moment onwards when the shuttle is phased out , " said jörg feustel-büechl , referring to us plans to junk the shuttle program in the near future . " the atv is by far the biggest resupply vehicle .
presently we are relying very much on the russian ' progress ' vehicle , which can transport two to three tons to the station . "
like the columbus research module , eads space transportation is also the prime contractor for atv , but most of the development work has been undertaken at the company 's french headquarters in les mureaux near paris . daryl lindsey send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the final frontier : europe in space from commercial satellite launches to the international space station to the vision of the aurora manned moon and mars missions , europe is rapidly expanding its presence in space like never before .

but unlike other governments , he does n't have the luxury of picking his own . as outgoing european commission president romano prodi whiles his summer days away along the shores of greece , his succesor is spending the summer assembling his new team , which is to be confirmed by the european parliament in september and will begin its term on nov .
1 .
but the former portuguese prime minister , elected by parliament earlier this month , has major limitations in how he can structure his commission .
under eu procedures barrosa can determine what portfolio any given commissioner will receive , but national capitals determine who will represent their countries on the commission .
only five out of the current 20 commissioners will remain in the european executive office come november .
they include viviane reding of luxembourg , margot wallström of sweden , france 's jaques barrot and possibly joaquin almunia of spain - both of whom have only served in brussels for the past few months - as well as germany 's günter verheugen .
super-commissioner verheugen ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter verheugen observers believe that because of verheugen 's -lrb- photo -rrb- experience as commissioner for enlargement , he will , by default , become a sort of " super-commissioner . "
compared to the other candidates , he 's one of the few among the commissioners nominated by the member states who carries considerable political clout .
nevertheless , barroso has rejected the proposals to create a super-commissioner label or any other tiered system of commissioners .
but german chancellor gerhard schröder has expressed his desire for verheugen to take over the commission 's economics portfolio as well as responsibility for implementation of the so-called lisbon agenda , which seeks to make the eu the most industrially , technologically and economically dynamic group of nations in the world by 2010 .
so far the effort has produced meager results .
under schröder 's vision , verheugen would breathe new life into the lisbon plan and coordinate his activities with the other commissioners .
indeed , most of the large member states are pushing for a more powerful economics portfolio .
currently the competencies are divided among four different commissioners who manage competition policy , the internal market , trade and industrial policy .
due to domestic policy concerns , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi has recalled mario monti , who has had a highly successful stint as competition commissioner , and is instead sending rocco buttiglione . the experienced politician is a member of the italian coalition government 's junior partner , the democratic union of the center , which has lately been on a confrontation course with berlusconi .
france 's jacques barrot is also jockeying for an economics-related commission post at the behest of his mentor , president jacques chirac .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter mandelson has been forced to resign from tony blair 's cabinet in two separate incidences .
now he 's going to represent britain in brussels .
meanwhile , tony blair is sending his scandal-plagued two-time cabinet member peter mandelson -lrb- photo -rrb- to brussels to represent the united kingdom on the commission .
mandelson is considered a close confidante of blair , and he has been selected with the hope that he can increase euroskeptical brits ' interest in brussels in time for the country 's planned referendum on the eu constitution .
the big unknowns the biggest wildcards on the new commission are the ten commissioners from the new eu member states .
they 've already been shadowing the commission since earlier this year without a portfolio , but they have n't made much of a dent in public .
nonetheless , observers in brussels believe poland 's danuta hübner will likely be given one of the more important commission posts .
expanding the commission out of the current 19 commission departments , barroso will now be responsible for creating 24 so that all of the commissioners of the member states will have authority over at least one policy area .
but only 12 of those 24 positions will likely carry much weight - meaning that the smaller member states will likely be given less meaningful competencies in the eu executive , which will hold office through 2009 .
as part of their accession negotiations , the smaller states came to an agreement that the commission should be comprised of one commissioner from each member state , despite that fact that the body , at least in theory , represents eu treaties in an independent , supranational manner without representing the interests of individual countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian foreign minister benita ferrero-waldner one of barroso 's stated goals is to have at least eight women on his team .
if austria decides to send its current foreign minister , benita ferrero-waldner -lrb- photo -rrb- , to brussels , he may come close to that goal .
ferrero-walder recently lost the presidential election and with her on the commission , the number of woman would climb to seven .
opportunity in weakness the relatively weak profile of most of the future eu commissioners could actually represent an opportunity for barroso , who himself was n't even the first choice for the post he now holds .
it 's possible he could excell as a stronger president than those seen on recent commissions .
his predecessor , prodi , gave his commissioners a long leash and considerable room to develop their political independence .
but this also came at a cost , since most viewed prodi as a weak commission president .
barroso plans to complete his jigsaw puzzle of people and competencies by the end of august , when brussels ' core of eurocrats returns from summer vacation . between now and then , he 'll be working the speed dial button to national capitals and he 'll be holding interviews with the commissioners to determine who gets what position .
in the worst-case scenario , barroso has said , he will take advantage of his ability to reject or fire candidates with insufficient experience - a right that was first cemented in the recently ratified treaty of nice . bernd riegert , brussels -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu parliament confirms barroso the european parliament has confirmed jose barroso as the next president of the european commission on thursday .

1 .
but the former portuguese prime minister , elected by parliament earlier this month , has major limitations in how he can structure his commission .
under eu procedures barrosa can determine what portfolio any given commissioner will receive , but national capitals determine who will represent their countries on the commission .
only five out of the current 20 commissioners will remain in the european executive office come november .
they include viviane reding of luxembourg , margot wallström of sweden , france 's jaques barrot and possibly joaquin almunia of spain - both of whom have only served in brussels for the past few months - as well as germany 's günter verheugen .
super-commissioner verheugen ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter verheugen observers believe that because of verheugen 's -lrb- photo -rrb- experience as commissioner for enlargement , he will , by default , become a sort of " super-commissioner . "
compared to the other candidates , he 's one of the few among the commissioners nominated by the member states who carries considerable political clout .
nevertheless , barroso has rejected the proposals to create a super-commissioner label or any other tiered system of commissioners .
but german chancellor gerhard schröder has expressed his desire for verheugen to take over the commission 's economics portfolio as well as responsibility for implementation of the so-called lisbon agenda , which seeks to make the eu the most industrially , technologically and economically dynamic group of nations in the world by 2010 .
so far the effort has produced meager results .
under schröder 's vision , verheugen would breathe new life into the lisbon plan and coordinate his activities with the other commissioners .
indeed , most of the large member states are pushing for a more powerful economics portfolio .
currently the competencies are divided among four different commissioners who manage competition policy , the internal market , trade and industrial policy .
due to domestic policy concerns , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi has recalled mario monti , who has had a highly successful stint as competition commissioner , and is instead sending rocco buttiglione . the experienced politician is a member of the italian coalition government 's junior partner , the democratic union of the center , which has lately been on a confrontation course with berlusconi .
france 's jacques barrot is also jockeying for an economics-related commission post at the behest of his mentor , president jacques chirac .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter mandelson has been forced to resign from tony blair 's cabinet in two separate incidences .
now he 's going to represent britain in brussels .
meanwhile , tony blair is sending his scandal-plagued two-time cabinet member peter mandelson -lrb- photo -rrb- to brussels to represent the united kingdom on the commission .
mandelson is considered a close confidante of blair , and he has been selected with the hope that he can increase euroskeptical brits ' interest in brussels in time for the country 's planned referendum on the eu constitution .
the big unknowns the biggest wildcards on the new commission are the ten commissioners from the new eu member states .
they 've already been shadowing the commission since earlier this year without a portfolio , but they have n't made much of a dent in public .

super-commissioner verheugen ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter verheugen observers believe that because of verheugen 's -lrb- photo -rrb- experience as commissioner for enlargement , he will , by default , become a sort of " super-commissioner . "
compared to the other candidates , he 's one of the few among the commissioners nominated by the member states who carries considerable political clout .
nevertheless , barroso has rejected the proposals to create a super-commissioner label or any other tiered system of commissioners .
but german chancellor gerhard schröder has expressed his desire for verheugen to take over the commission 's economics portfolio as well as responsibility for implementation of the so-called lisbon agenda , which seeks to make the eu the most industrially , technologically and economically dynamic group of nations in the world by 2010 .
so far the effort has produced meager results .
under schröder 's vision , verheugen would breathe new life into the lisbon plan and coordinate his activities with the other commissioners .
indeed , most of the large member states are pushing for a more powerful economics portfolio .
currently the competencies are divided among four different commissioners who manage competition policy , the internal market , trade and industrial policy .
due to domestic policy concerns , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi has recalled mario monti , who has had a highly successful stint as competition commissioner , and is instead sending rocco buttiglione . the experienced politician is a member of the italian coalition government 's junior partner , the democratic union of the center , which has lately been on a confrontation course with berlusconi .
france 's jacques barrot is also jockeying for an economics-related commission post at the behest of his mentor , president jacques chirac .

meanwhile , tony blair is sending his scandal-plagued two-time cabinet member peter mandelson -lrb- photo -rrb- to brussels to represent the united kingdom on the commission .
mandelson is considered a close confidante of blair , and he has been selected with the hope that he can increase euroskeptical brits ' interest in brussels in time for the country 's planned referendum on the eu constitution .
the big unknowns the biggest wildcards on the new commission are the ten commissioners from the new eu member states .
they 've already been shadowing the commission since earlier this year without a portfolio , but they have n't made much of a dent in public .
nonetheless , observers in brussels believe poland 's danuta hübner will likely be given one of the more important commission posts .
expanding the commission out of the current 19 commission departments , barroso will now be responsible for creating 24 so that all of the commissioners of the member states will have authority over at least one policy area .
but only 12 of those 24 positions will likely carry much weight - meaning that the smaller member states will likely be given less meaningful competencies in the eu executive , which will hold office through 2009 .
as part of their accession negotiations , the smaller states came to an agreement that the commission should be comprised of one commissioner from each member state , despite that fact that the body , at least in theory , represents eu treaties in an independent , supranational manner without representing the interests of individual countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian foreign minister benita ferrero-waldner one of barroso 's stated goals is to have at least eight women on his team .
if austria decides to send its current foreign minister , benita ferrero-waldner -lrb- photo -rrb- , to brussels , he may come close to that goal .
ferrero-walder recently lost the presidential election and with her on the commission , the number of woman would climb to seven .
opportunity in weakness the relatively weak profile of most of the future eu commissioners could actually represent an opportunity for barroso , who himself was n't even the first choice for the post he now holds .
it 's possible he could excell as a stronger president than those seen on recent commissions .

the findings could aid preparations for the first manned mars voyage . after space shuttle flights resume in 2005 , one of the early payloads will be the european space agency 's columbus research module . the cylindrical module , which looks like an outsized soda can , is coming together in a large assembly hall at eads space transportation , a subsidiary of airbus maker eads , in the northern german city of bremen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eads space transportation .
columbus laboratory and electrical test models in the integration hall in bremen , germany .
columbus was originally scheduled to be launched this year , but the delay has given the project 's scientists and engineers more time to conduct testing and to make the research laboratory more flexible to accommodate future experiments .
afterall , unlike an airplane , engineers do n't have the luxury of doing test-flights on columbus - it has to work from day one .
the 4.5-meter -lrb- 14.76 feet -rrb- cylindrical module , which weighs about 450 tons and has a floor space of 75 cubic meters , is packed with scientific experiments covering the fields of biology , biotechnology , human physiology , material science and fluid science .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a full-sized model of the columbus laboratory is open to visitors at eads space transportation in bremen esa gained some earlier experience in orbit with spacelab , which flew on 22 missions in the cargo bay of the space shuttle between 1983 and 1998 , but columbus marks the first time europe will have an experiment facility all its own , available 24 hours a day , 365 days a year in space .
in rough terms , we will have 100 times more capability to do experiments than we ever had before , " said jörg feustel-büechl , esa 's director of manned spaceflight .
columbus can fit up to three astronauts working in the unit 's zero-gravity conditions .
astronauts as zero-gravity guinea pigs among the primary goals of columbus is to study the effects of long-term space travel on the human body .
in order to send astronauts to the moon or mars for long periods , scientists and medical experts must first learns ways to counter the aging effects of space travel as well as prolonged exposure to increased radiation from the sun .
the studies could also aid medical researchers treating illnesses on terra firma .
" we will study how the body behaves , " feustel-büechl said .
" the body ages more quickly in space and bone density diminishes , and that 's an important phenomenon for studying the effects of osteoporosis .
you also have a different distribution of the fluids of the blood and water in the body .
you can study cardiovascular effects or the effects on the brains or eyes . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european physiology modules -lrb- epm -rrb- will be used to test the long-term health effects of space travel on astronauts .
feustel-büechl said that many health phenomena that occur on earth are accelerated in space , which will help scientists to study them more easily and quickly than they could on our own planet .
the same " biolab " facility used to study humans can also be used for experiments on cells , tissue cultures , microorganisms , small plants and invertebrates .
benefits for business the esa scientist said the laboratory would also be important for studying material science .
in space , there is no convection , and astronauts in the columbus module can " isolate physical phenomena in a much better way , understanding better , for example , how fluids behave with gases , how combustion works and how melting fluids behave - not just for the textbooks , but also for practical applications in various disciplines and industries . "
in other words , the lessons learned in space could help companies back on earth create new manufacturing techniques .
in addition to the research facilities inside columbus , the module also has four outdoor platforms for experiments .
" these will allow our astronaut scientists to look to the sky for astronomical observations or to look down to earth for observation experiments , " said feustel-büechl .
" we can also conduct experiments with technology that needs to be exposed to space conditions . "
an industrial tower of babel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a custom built airbus a300-600st beluga was used to carry the columbus ' shell from alenia spazial in turin , italy , to eads space transportation in bremen .
the building of the complex research laboratory has been a major european cooperative effort .
eads space transportation is the prime contractor on the columbus module , but the work has been shared by all of the iss ' european partners .
italian engineers at alenia spazial in turin , italy , designed and built the module structure and parts also came from partners in holland , belgium , france , denmark and other european countries - with several hundred workers involved in the project .
günther brandt , head of space station elements at eads space transportation , was in charge of the gargantuan task of organizing the dozens of contractors working on the columbus - a tower of babel of languages and engineering styles .
" the biggest challenge is to get all these companies in various countries under one umbrella and get them working towards one system , " he explained .
with different cultures and tongues , it can be difficult to find harmony .
" it 's often not easy to get this all straightened out and in line so that one product comes out of this , " he said .
but when columbus finally reaches the iss after more than 15 years of planning in 2006 , the scientists assume nothing will be lost in translation . daryl lindsey send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the final frontier : europe in space from commercial satellite launches to the international space station to the vision of the aurora manned moon and mars missions , europe is rapidly expanding its presence in space like never before .

the 4.5-meter -lrb- 14.76 feet -rrb- cylindrical module , which weighs about 450 tons and has a floor space of 75 cubic meters , is packed with scientific experiments covering the fields of biology , biotechnology , human physiology , material science and fluid science .

in rough terms , we will have 100 times more capability to do experiments than we ever had before , " said jörg feustel-büechl , esa 's director of manned spaceflight .
columbus can fit up to three astronauts working in the unit 's zero-gravity conditions .
astronauts as zero-gravity guinea pigs among the primary goals of columbus is to study the effects of long-term space travel on the human body .
in order to send astronauts to the moon or mars for long periods , scientists and medical experts must first learns ways to counter the aging effects of space travel as well as prolonged exposure to increased radiation from the sun .
the studies could also aid medical researchers treating illnesses on terra firma .
" we will study how the body behaves , " feustel-büechl said .
" the body ages more quickly in space and bone density diminishes , and that 's an important phenomenon for studying the effects of osteoporosis .
you also have a different distribution of the fluids of the blood and water in the body .
you can study cardiovascular effects or the effects on the brains or eyes . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european physiology modules -lrb- epm -rrb- will be used to test the long-term health effects of space travel on astronauts .
feustel-büechl said that many health phenomena that occur on earth are accelerated in space , which will help scientists to study them more easily and quickly than they could on our own planet .
the same " biolab " facility used to study humans can also be used for experiments on cells , tissue cultures , microorganisms , small plants and invertebrates .
benefits for business the esa scientist said the laboratory would also be important for studying material science .
in space , there is no convection , and astronauts in the columbus module can " isolate physical phenomena in a much better way , understanding better , for example , how fluids behave with gases , how combustion works and how melting fluids behave - not just for the textbooks , but also for practical applications in various disciplines and industries . "
in other words , the lessons learned in space could help companies back on earth create new manufacturing techniques .
in addition to the research facilities inside columbus , the module also has four outdoor platforms for experiments .
" these will allow our astronaut scientists to look to the sky for astronomical observations or to look down to earth for observation experiments , " said feustel-büechl .
" we can also conduct experiments with technology that needs to be exposed to space conditions . "

astronauts as zero-gravity guinea pigs among the primary goals of columbus is to study the effects of long-term space travel on the human body .
in order to send astronauts to the moon or mars for long periods , scientists and medical experts must first learns ways to counter the aging effects of space travel as well as prolonged exposure to increased radiation from the sun .
the studies could also aid medical researchers treating illnesses on terra firma .
" we will study how the body behaves , " feustel-büechl said .
" the body ages more quickly in space and bone density diminishes , and that 's an important phenomenon for studying the effects of osteoporosis .

feustel-büechl said that many health phenomena that occur on earth are accelerated in space , which will help scientists to study them more easily and quickly than they could on our own planet .
the same " biolab " facility used to study humans can also be used for experiments on cells , tissue cultures , microorganisms , small plants and invertebrates .

in other words , the lessons learned in space could help companies back on earth create new manufacturing techniques .
in addition to the research facilities inside columbus , the module also has four outdoor platforms for experiments .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 30.07.2004 europe 's long road ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the face of european foreign policy : javier solana europe aspires to playing a key role in world affairs .
economically , there is no doubt that it is already there .
politically , especially on foreign and security policy issues , the eu still has a ways to go . while european officials plot out how to better unify 25 member states into a single bloc with common foreign policy and security goals , individual governments balk at handing over too much political clout to brussels bureaucrats .
it is a constant tug-of-war with national capitals skittish about relinquishing sovereignty on such sensitive issues and committed eurocrats complaining about not having enough support from member states .
the situation is exasperated every time a prominent foreign minister begins to tackle an issue outside the eu organization .
germany 's joschka fischer , france 's michel barnier and britain 's jack straw are just three of the many foreign ministers in the freshly expanded european union and , as is often the case in such a large institution , they do n't always see eye-to-eye on an issue .
last year 's dispute over support for a us-led invasion of iraq nearly split the eu and was just one such example of where national interests could not be reconciled within the bloc .
five years ago , brussels foresaw many of the problems that would arise as the bloc grew and it created a quasi eu foreign minister , whose official title is the high representative for common foreign and security policy .
in germany , he is referred to by the german acronym for the post : gasp .
balancing act bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana and german foreign minister joschka fischer mr. gasp , as he is sometimes sarcastically called by the press , is the spaniard , javier solana , who has held the job since its inception .
he enjoys the respect of many national foreign ministers and is often sent to crisis regions as the eu 's official negotiator .
the task of the high representative is an extremely difficult balancing act to give the european union a common voice in world affairs .
solana has worked to give it the direction he feels the eu needs to move forward in foreign policy goals .
" i think i know well how the european union works , " he said .
" and i would like to make it more efficient in the foreign and security policy . "
although as solana said , these are not issues that belong to the traditional core areas of the eu , they have become very important for shaping the future of the bloc .
primarily economic interests it was n't until 1970 that the european union even agreed to more cooperation on political issues .
at the time the member states , which were known as the european economic community , primarily focused on economic , financial and trade interests .
there were no common foreign policy goals , no foreign policy instruments and there was no vision of a european identity within the international community .
indicative of the situation , former us secretary of state henry kissinger in 1973 coined the phrase : " if i want to talk to europe , who do i call ? "
some 20 years later , at their watershed summit in maastricht , eu leaders - at least on paper - finally agreed to work toward achieving a common foreign and security policy .
but no instruments for doing so were created until 1999 when javier solana became mr. gasp .
real time action " one of the most important things the european union has to do is act in real time , " solana said recently about the feasibility of 25 member states working together .
" if you have a crisis , a political problem in the world , and you do not deal with it rapidly , you waste time , money and perhaps even human lives . "
but despite all solana 's efforts otherwise , national interests in europe still tend to take priority over a common eu policy , as the conflict in iraq showed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations secretary general kofi annan -lrb- left -rrb- and solana are champions of multilateralism .
solana is realistic and knows that the eu is not a single country and may never act as one .
he understands that the rules and instruments of a single state can not simply be duplicated on the eu level .
nonetheless , he remains optimistic about the chances of forging a single european policy for foreign affairs , even when the public perception of mr. gasp is less than that of his colleagues in berlin , paris and london .
progressing by meters and kilometers solana also knows that things take time in the eu .
" the european union is an organization that sometimes advances by meters and sometimes by kilometers , " he said .
with the new eu constitution , the spaniard sees the bloc jumping ahead by several kilometers .
" the eu is not a country , it remains an organization , a complex institution in which 25 states can have a common foreign and security policy . "
if adopted , europe 's first constitution will establish a real eu foreign minister position , which .
javier solana is expected to fill .
but the proof is in the praxis .
it remains to be seen if brussels can bundle together the various contravening interests under a common denominator , or whether national interests and national politicians will continue to dictate europe 's future road . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu 's solana chides washington over unilateralism eu foreign policy chief javier solana in hungary this week said the united states and the european union needed to work together to make the world safer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 30.07.2004 opinion : can kerry bring the us and europe back together ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is kerry just talk ?
us presidential candidate john kerry officially accepted the democratic nomination on thursday , promising to restore america 's international reputation , and re-bind the fraying ties to europe . for four days the us democrats in boston have been working their hardest to sell john kerry as the man that america wants , needs and can have .
and they - both the candidate himself and the party elite - have done so with the conspicuous absence of pointed anti-bush rhetoric , even though the drive to oust the president from office is the strongest glue to have united the party in a long time . come the elections on november 2 , it will be the undecided voters in the key states and from the political center , who will decide , and now is the time to win them over with a positive message .
with this in mind , the democrats in boston presented themselves as guardians of the the old american ideals , as a regenerative strength which would both close the divide on home ground and win back america 's tarred international reputation . they did everything they could to present john kerry as an experienced politician , a high- principled soul , and a man who knows how to protect america effectively .
the latter is crucial to the american electorate , which lives in fear of suffering an historic defeat in the fight against terrorism . vietnam hero kerry 's supporters and fellow democrats doused him in glory , touting him as hero of the vietnam war , a selfless savior and a courageous leader .
the praise was designed to serve as a contrast to the alleged slacker , george w bush , whose service in the military home reserves is inadequately documented . this overemphasis of the presidential candidate as commander-in-chief , who as supreme commander of the us forces , would unquestionably rise to the challenge , takes its relevance from september 11th , a defining moment in america 's recent history . simultaneously , kerry reflects the desperate efforts on the part of the democrats , to compensate for the gaps in president bush 's and the republicans ' policies on national security .
some of these verbal attempts were so brash , that they left a nasty taste among some european observers , as did the overall circus and show character of the whole event . vague policies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : candidate for vice-president john edwards the party conference also served to dash any premature hopes that as president , john kerry would return america to a " gentle power " , silencing its military might in favor of strengthened diplomacy and international understanding - even if kerry did make a point of stressing that he would help lead america back to a more international image .
but over and above this , many of kerry 's policies remained vague .
how is he planning to dry up the quagmire of iraq , how is he planning to get north korea and iran to give up on their nuclear policies ? the old standard-bearer of the democratic party 's leftwing , senator ted kennedy , cut to the chase , when he said that the only thing the democrats fear is another four years of george w bush in the white house .
as far as the democrats are concerned , a second term under the current president has to be avoided at all costs , and laying down the line on foreign policy issues wo n't help the cause . so instead , kerry and his running mate john edwards sold themselves as the social conscience of the nation , and their followers came flocking .
but whether this act will be powerful enough to prevent bush from laying down his cap for another four years , is highly questionable .
when in doubt , voters will be more easily swayed back to the devil they know than convinced into supporting his diluted double . daniel scheschkewitz -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us voters in germany get rallying call the us presidential election in november is expected to be one of the closest contests in the country 's history .

us presidential candidate john kerry officially accepted the democratic nomination on thursday , promising to restore america 's international reputation , and re-bind the fraying ties to europe . for four days the us democrats in boston have been working their hardest to sell john kerry as the man that america wants , needs and can have .
and they - both the candidate himself and the party elite - have done so with the conspicuous absence of pointed anti-bush rhetoric , even though the drive to oust the president from office is the strongest glue to have united the party in a long time . come the elections on november 2 , it will be the undecided voters in the key states and from the political center , who will decide , and now is the time to win them over with a positive message .
with this in mind , the democrats in boston presented themselves as guardians of the the old american ideals , as a regenerative strength which would both close the divide on home ground and win back america 's tarred international reputation . they did everything they could to present john kerry as an experienced politician , a high- principled soul , and a man who knows how to protect america effectively .
the latter is crucial to the american electorate , which lives in fear of suffering an historic defeat in the fight against terrorism . vietnam hero kerry 's supporters and fellow democrats doused him in glory , touting him as hero of the vietnam war , a selfless savior and a courageous leader .
the praise was designed to serve as a contrast to the alleged slacker , george w bush , whose service in the military home reserves is inadequately documented . this overemphasis of the presidential candidate as commander-in-chief , who as supreme commander of the us forces , would unquestionably rise to the challenge , takes its relevance from september 11th , a defining moment in america 's recent history . simultaneously , kerry reflects the desperate efforts on the part of the democrats , to compensate for the gaps in president bush 's and the republicans ' policies on national security .
some of these verbal attempts were so brash , that they left a nasty taste among some european observers , as did the overall circus and show character of the whole event . vague policies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : candidate for vice-president john edwards the party conference also served to dash any premature hopes that as president , john kerry would return america to a " gentle power " , silencing its military might in favor of strengthened diplomacy and international understanding - even if kerry did make a point of stressing that he would help lead america back to a more international image .
but over and above this , many of kerry 's policies remained vague .
how is he planning to dry up the quagmire of iraq , how is he planning to get north korea and iran to give up on their nuclear policies ? the old standard-bearer of the democratic party 's leftwing , senator ted kennedy , cut to the chase , when he said that the only thing the democrats fear is another four years of george w bush in the white house .
as far as the democrats are concerned , a second term under the current president has to be avoided at all costs , and laying down the line on foreign policy issues wo n't help the cause . so instead , kerry and his running mate john edwards sold themselves as the social conscience of the nation , and their followers came flocking .
but whether this act will be powerful enough to prevent bush from laying down his cap for another four years , is highly questionable .

us presidential candidate john kerry officially accepted the democratic nomination on thursday , promising to restore america 's international reputation , and re-bind the fraying ties to europe . for four days the us democrats in boston have been working their hardest to sell john kerry as the man that america wants , needs and can have .
and they - both the candidate himself and the party elite - have done so with the conspicuous absence of pointed anti-bush rhetoric , even though the drive to oust the president from office is the strongest glue to have united the party in a long time . come the elections on november 2 , it will be the undecided voters in the key states and from the political center , who will decide , and now is the time to win them over with a positive message .
with this in mind , the democrats in boston presented themselves as guardians of the the old american ideals , as a regenerative strength which would both close the divide on home ground and win back america 's tarred international reputation . they did everything they could to present john kerry as an experienced politician , a high- principled soul , and a man who knows how to protect america effectively .
the latter is crucial to the american electorate , which lives in fear of suffering an historic defeat in the fight against terrorism . vietnam hero kerry 's supporters and fellow democrats doused him in glory , touting him as hero of the vietnam war , a selfless savior and a courageous leader .
the praise was designed to serve as a contrast to the alleged slacker , george w bush , whose service in the military home reserves is inadequately documented . this overemphasis of the presidential candidate as commander-in-chief , who as supreme commander of the us forces , would unquestionably rise to the challenge , takes its relevance from september 11th , a defining moment in america 's recent history . simultaneously , kerry reflects the desperate efforts on the part of the democrats , to compensate for the gaps in president bush 's and the republicans ' policies on national security .
some of these verbal attempts were so brash , that they left a nasty taste among some european observers , as did the overall circus and show character of the whole event . vague policies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : candidate for vice-president john edwards the party conference also served to dash any premature hopes that as president , john kerry would return america to a " gentle power " , silencing its military might in favor of strengthened diplomacy and international understanding - even if kerry did make a point of stressing that he would help lead america back to a more international image .
but over and above this , many of kerry 's policies remained vague .
how is he planning to dry up the quagmire of iraq , how is he planning to get north korea and iran to give up on their nuclear policies ? the old standard-bearer of the democratic party 's leftwing , senator ted kennedy , cut to the chase , when he said that the only thing the democrats fear is another four years of george w bush in the white house .
as far as the democrats are concerned , a second term under the current president has to be avoided at all costs , and laying down the line on foreign policy issues wo n't help the cause . so instead , kerry and his running mate john edwards sold themselves as the social conscience of the nation , and their followers came flocking .
but whether this act will be powerful enough to prevent bush from laying down his cap for another four years , is highly questionable .
when in doubt , voters will be more easily swayed back to the devil they know than convinced into supporting his diluted double . daniel scheschkewitz -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us voters in germany get rallying call the us presidential election in november is expected to be one of the closest contests in the country 's history .

economically , there is no doubt that it is already there .
politically , especially on foreign and security policy issues , the eu still has a ways to go . while european officials plot out how to better unify 25 member states into a single bloc with common foreign policy and security goals , individual governments balk at handing over too much political clout to brussels bureaucrats .
it is a constant tug-of-war with national capitals skittish about relinquishing sovereignty on such sensitive issues and committed eurocrats complaining about not having enough support from member states .
the situation is exasperated every time a prominent foreign minister begins to tackle an issue outside the eu organization .
germany 's joschka fischer , france 's michel barnier and britain 's jack straw are just three of the many foreign ministers in the freshly expanded european union and , as is often the case in such a large institution , they do n't always see eye-to-eye on an issue .
last year 's dispute over support for a us-led invasion of iraq nearly split the eu and was just one such example of where national interests could not be reconciled within the bloc .
five years ago , brussels foresaw many of the problems that would arise as the bloc grew and it created a quasi eu foreign minister , whose official title is the high representative for common foreign and security policy .
in germany , he is referred to by the german acronym for the post : gasp .
balancing act bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana and german foreign minister joschka fischer mr. gasp , as he is sometimes sarcastically called by the press , is the spaniard , javier solana , who has held the job since its inception .
he enjoys the respect of many national foreign ministers and is often sent to crisis regions as the eu 's official negotiator .
the task of the high representative is an extremely difficult balancing act to give the european union a common voice in world affairs .
solana has worked to give it the direction he feels the eu needs to move forward in foreign policy goals .
" i think i know well how the european union works , " he said .
" and i would like to make it more efficient in the foreign and security policy . "
although as solana said , these are not issues that belong to the traditional core areas of the eu , they have become very important for shaping the future of the bloc .
primarily economic interests it was n't until 1970 that the european union even agreed to more cooperation on political issues .
at the time the member states , which were known as the european economic community , primarily focused on economic , financial and trade interests .
there were no common foreign policy goals , no foreign policy instruments and there was no vision of a european identity within the international community .
indicative of the situation , former us secretary of state henry kissinger in 1973 coined the phrase : " if i want to talk to europe , who do i call ? "
some 20 years later , at their watershed summit in maastricht , eu leaders - at least on paper - finally agreed to work toward achieving a common foreign and security policy .
but no instruments for doing so were created until 1999 when javier solana became mr. gasp .
real time action " one of the most important things the european union has to do is act in real time , " solana said recently about the feasibility of 25 member states working together .
" if you have a crisis , a political problem in the world , and you do not deal with it rapidly , you waste time , money and perhaps even human lives . "
but despite all solana 's efforts otherwise , national interests in europe still tend to take priority over a common eu policy , as the conflict in iraq showed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations secretary general kofi annan -lrb- left -rrb- and solana are champions of multilateralism .
solana is realistic and knows that the eu is not a single country and may never act as one .
he understands that the rules and instruments of a single state can not simply be duplicated on the eu level .
nonetheless , he remains optimistic about the chances of forging a single european policy for foreign affairs , even when the public perception of mr. gasp is less than that of his colleagues in berlin , paris and london .
progressing by meters and kilometers solana also knows that things take time in the eu .
" the european union is an organization that sometimes advances by meters and sometimes by kilometers , " he said .
with the new eu constitution , the spaniard sees the bloc jumping ahead by several kilometers .
" the eu is not a country , it remains an organization , a complex institution in which 25 states can have a common foreign and security policy . "
if adopted , europe 's first constitution will establish a real eu foreign minister position , which .
javier solana is expected to fill .
but the proof is in the praxis .
it remains to be seen if brussels can bundle together the various contravening interests under a common denominator , or whether national interests and national politicians will continue to dictate europe 's future road . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu 's solana chides washington over unilateralism eu foreign policy chief javier solana in hungary this week said the united states and the european union needed to work together to make the world safer .

german spelling is once again at the center of political debate , despite the fact that an across-the-board reform went into effect six years ago . " i would rather decline two drinks than one german verb , " mark twain famously wrote in his essay the awful german language .
but germans do n't need an american to tell them that their language is difficult - they know it themselves .
and they 're working on it .
several years ago , amid much controversy , germany -lrb- and switzerland and austria -rrb- decided to tackle the problem .
in 1998 , after decades of failed attempts , a committee pushed through a raft of changes known as the rechtschreibreform -lrb- spelling reform . -rrb-
the new rules were first applied in a transition phase , but are slated to become mandatory on august 1 , 2005 .
the changes aim to iron out some of the quirks in the language , and include various spelling changes such as using " ss " instead of the " ß " character .
they also thin out the hundreds of complex rules regarding the use of commas .
' unnecessary as gout ' but what started out as a simple effort to make life easier for the masses seems to have turned into a political hot potato .
the premiers of five german states - all of them members of the conservative opposition - have gone on record in recent weeks saying they want the government to reconsider the reforms .
common complaints : the new rules are confusing , and people are n't putting them into practice .
along with the politicians , several well known german writers , including nobel prize winner günther grass and poet and essayist hans magnus enzensberger have come out against the reform .
swiss author adolf muschg told the bild-zeitung newspaper : " the spelling reform must be stopped immediately .
it is as unnecessary as gout , has brought no improvement , and instead made people more uncertain . "
the german government has stuck to its guns , however , saying the reforms will go through as planned .
thomas steg , deputy spokesman for the government , told the dpa press agency that it would be " nonsense " to revisit the issue now .
after years of debate , " now the decisions that have been made should be put into effect consistently , " he said , and added : " the reaction of certain of the -lrb- state -rrb- premiers seems strange to me . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's leading dictionary marked all spelling changes in red in its 1996 edition .
for the most part , publishers , schools , and civil servants have long since adapted to the new system .
some 90 percent of new books are published using the reformed spelling rules .
felizitas liemersdorf , the principal of an elementary school in cologne , said it would be " nonsense " for the reforms to be rescinded now .
she admitted that the reforms were problematic from the get-go , saying they were " neither logical nor far reaching enough . "
however , like educators throughout the country , liemersdorf had no choice other than make sure the new rules were being applied in the classroom .
high cost of change " the first problem is , they were n't mandatory for everyone .
just take a look at our good old faz ! " she said , referring to the leading german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , which continues to publish under the old style .
but nonetheless , to go back to the old ways after six years would be " absurd , " liemersdorf said .
" can you imagine the cost ?
there would be a huge outcry .
we already replaced books - readers , worksheets , dictionaries , reference books . all the new books for classrooms are in the new style . "
too many critics to ignore to date , just one member of the federal government - culture minister christina weiss - has spoken out in favor of reviewing the reform issue .
in a conversation with the faz , weiss said it makes sense to give the rules another look before they become final .
she called the new rules " confusing and nonsensical , " and noted that " there are too many critics to just ignore them . "
" until the transition phase is over , on july 31 , 2005 , we still have the chance to think about the new rules .
i see a chance to clarify problematic issues , " weiss told the faz - the same newspaper that refuses to adopt the new spelling .
weiss suggests throwing the issue in the lap of the kmk , or kultusministerkonferenz - the group in charge of education policy on issues that go beyond state .
and indeed , because a conservative committee member has requested it , the issue will stand on the agenda when the group next meets , in october .
debate a ' senseless waste ' ?
noting that the group just voted unanimously in favor of the reforms in june , kmk president doris ahnen told the ddp news agency she finds it " somewhat strange " that one of her colleagues requested bringing the topic back to life .
moreover , she said , she does n't believe anything will change , even after another debate .
" most of the ministers in the committee are still in favor of the reforms , and are in favor of making them mandatory next august , " she stressed .
a representative of the german journalists ' association -lrb- djv -rrb- told news agencies that his group is in favor of keeping the reform .
rescinding it at this point would be " a senseless waste of money , " djv chairman michael konken said .
konken said the whole debate should go back to where it came from : the " sommerloch " - the big summer news hole that german politicians know is always good for press in the slow season . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de coming to terms with germany 's new spelling reform five years after germany 's controversial spelling reforms were introduced , many germans are still confused by the new spelling rules , while others simply refuse to use them .
-lrb- august 2 , 2003 -rrb- feedback should politicians dictate spelling , or is language a " living entity " that should develop on its own ?

german spelling is once again at the center of political debate , despite the fact that an across-the-board reform went into effect six years ago . " i would rather decline two drinks than one german verb , " mark twain famously wrote in his essay the awful german language .
but germans do n't need an american to tell them that their language is difficult - they know it themselves .
and they 're working on it .
several years ago , amid much controversy , germany -lrb- and switzerland and austria -rrb- decided to tackle the problem .
in 1998 , after decades of failed attempts , a committee pushed through a raft of changes known as the rechtschreibreform -lrb- spelling reform . -rrb-
the new rules were first applied in a transition phase , but are slated to become mandatory on august 1 , 2005 .
the changes aim to iron out some of the quirks in the language , and include various spelling changes such as using " ss " instead of the " ß " character .
they also thin out the hundreds of complex rules regarding the use of commas .
' unnecessary as gout ' but what started out as a simple effort to make life easier for the masses seems to have turned into a political hot potato .
the premiers of five german states - all of them members of the conservative opposition - have gone on record in recent weeks saying they want the government to reconsider the reforms .
common complaints : the new rules are confusing , and people are n't putting them into practice .
along with the politicians , several well known german writers , including nobel prize winner günther grass and poet and essayist hans magnus enzensberger have come out against the reform .
swiss author adolf muschg told the bild-zeitung newspaper : " the spelling reform must be stopped immediately .
it is as unnecessary as gout , has brought no improvement , and instead made people more uncertain . "
the german government has stuck to its guns , however , saying the reforms will go through as planned .
thomas steg , deputy spokesman for the government , told the dpa press agency that it would be " nonsense " to revisit the issue now .
after years of debate , " now the decisions that have been made should be put into effect consistently , " he said , and added : " the reaction of certain of the -lrb- state -rrb- premiers seems strange to me . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's leading dictionary marked all spelling changes in red in its 1996 edition .
for the most part , publishers , schools , and civil servants have long since adapted to the new system .
some 90 percent of new books are published using the reformed spelling rules .
felizitas liemersdorf , the principal of an elementary school in cologne , said it would be " nonsense " for the reforms to be rescinded now .
she admitted that the reforms were problematic from the get-go , saying they were " neither logical nor far reaching enough . "
however , like educators throughout the country , liemersdorf had no choice other than make sure the new rules were being applied in the classroom .
high cost of change " the first problem is , they were n't mandatory for everyone .
just take a look at our good old faz ! " she said , referring to the leading german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , which continues to publish under the old style .
but nonetheless , to go back to the old ways after six years would be " absurd , " liemersdorf said .
" can you imagine the cost ?
there would be a huge outcry .
we already replaced books - readers , worksheets , dictionaries , reference books . all the new books for classrooms are in the new style . "
too many critics to ignore to date , just one member of the federal government - culture minister christina weiss - has spoken out in favor of reviewing the reform issue .
in a conversation with the faz , weiss said it makes sense to give the rules another look before they become final .
she called the new rules " confusing and nonsensical , " and noted that " there are too many critics to just ignore them . "
" until the transition phase is over , on july 31 , 2005 , we still have the chance to think about the new rules .
i see a chance to clarify problematic issues , " weiss told the faz - the same newspaper that refuses to adopt the new spelling .
weiss suggests throwing the issue in the lap of the kmk , or kultusministerkonferenz - the group in charge of education policy on issues that go beyond state .
and indeed , because a conservative committee member has requested it , the issue will stand on the agenda when the group next meets , in october .
debate a ' senseless waste ' ?
noting that the group just voted unanimously in favor of the reforms in june , kmk president doris ahnen told the ddp news agency she finds it " somewhat strange " that one of her colleagues requested bringing the topic back to life .
moreover , she said , she does n't believe anything will change , even after another debate .
" most of the ministers in the committee are still in favor of the reforms , and are in favor of making them mandatory next august , " she stressed .
a representative of the german journalists ' association -lrb- djv -rrb- told news agencies that his group is in favor of keeping the reform .
rescinding it at this point would be " a senseless waste of money , " djv chairman michael konken said .
konken said the whole debate should go back to where it came from : the " sommerloch " - the big summer news hole that german politicians know is always good for press in the slow season . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de coming to terms with germany 's new spelling reform five years after germany 's controversial spelling reforms were introduced , many germans are still confused by the new spelling rules , while others simply refuse to use them .
-lrb- august 2 , 2003 -rrb- feedback should politicians dictate spelling , or is language a " living entity " that should develop on its own ?

but nonetheless , to go back to the old ways after six years would be " absurd , " liemersdorf said .
" can you imagine the cost ?
there would be a huge outcry .
we already replaced books - readers , worksheets , dictionaries , reference books . all the new books for classrooms are in the new style . "
too many critics to ignore to date , just one member of the federal government - culture minister christina weiss - has spoken out in favor of reviewing the reform issue .
in a conversation with the faz , weiss said it makes sense to give the rules another look before they become final .
she called the new rules " confusing and nonsensical , " and noted that " there are too many critics to just ignore them . "
" until the transition phase is over , on july 31 , 2005 , we still have the chance to think about the new rules .
i see a chance to clarify problematic issues , " weiss told the faz - the same newspaper that refuses to adopt the new spelling .
weiss suggests throwing the issue in the lap of the kmk , or kultusministerkonferenz - the group in charge of education policy on issues that go beyond state .
and indeed , because a conservative committee member has requested it , the issue will stand on the agenda when the group next meets , in october .
debate a ' senseless waste ' ?
noting that the group just voted unanimously in favor of the reforms in june , kmk president doris ahnen told the ddp news agency she finds it " somewhat strange " that one of her colleagues requested bringing the topic back to life .
moreover , she said , she does n't believe anything will change , even after another debate .
" most of the ministers in the committee are still in favor of the reforms , and are in favor of making them mandatory next august , " she stressed .
a representative of the german journalists ' association -lrb- djv -rrb- told news agencies that his group is in favor of keeping the reform .
rescinding it at this point would be " a senseless waste of money , " djv chairman michael konken said .
konken said the whole debate should go back to where it came from : the " sommerloch " - the big summer news hole that german politicians know is always good for press in the slow season . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de coming to terms with germany 's new spelling reform five years after germany 's controversial spelling reforms were introduced , many germans are still confused by the new spelling rules , while others simply refuse to use them .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 30.07.2004 europe 's long road ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the face of european foreign policy : javier solana europe aspires to playing a key role in world affairs .
economically , there is no doubt that it is already there .
politically , especially on foreign and security policy issues , the eu still has a ways to go . while european officials plot out how to better unify 25 member states into a single bloc with common foreign policy and security goals , individual governments balk at handing over too much political clout to brussels bureaucrats .
it is a constant tug-of-war with national capitals skittish about relinquishing sovereignty on such sensitive issues and committed eurocrats complaining about not having enough support from member states .
the situation is exasperated every time a prominent foreign minister begins to tackle an issue outside the eu organization .
germany 's joschka fischer , france 's michel barnier and britain 's jack straw are just three of the many foreign ministers in the freshly expanded european union and , as is often the case in such a large institution , they do n't always see eye-to-eye on an issue .
last year 's dispute over support for a us-led invasion of iraq nearly split the eu and was just one such example of where national interests could not be reconciled within the bloc .
five years ago , brussels foresaw many of the problems that would arise as the bloc grew and it created a quasi eu foreign minister , whose official title is the high representative for common foreign and security policy .
in germany , he is referred to by the german acronym for the post : gasp .
balancing act bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana and german foreign minister joschka fischer mr. gasp , as he is sometimes sarcastically called by the press , is the spaniard , javier solana , who has held the job since its inception .
he enjoys the respect of many national foreign ministers and is often sent to crisis regions as the eu 's official negotiator .
the task of the high representative is an extremely difficult balancing act to give the european union a common voice in world affairs .
solana has worked to give it the direction he feels the eu needs to move forward in foreign policy goals .
" i think i know well how the european union works , " he said .
" and i would like to make it more efficient in the foreign and security policy . "
although as solana said , these are not issues that belong to the traditional core areas of the eu , they have become very important for shaping the future of the bloc .
primarily economic interests it was n't until 1970 that the european union even agreed to more cooperation on political issues .
at the time the member states , which were known as the european economic community , primarily focused on economic , financial and trade interests .
there were no common foreign policy goals , no foreign policy instruments and there was no vision of a european identity within the international community .
indicative of the situation , former us secretary of state henry kissinger in 1973 coined the phrase : " if i want to talk to europe , who do i call ? "
some 20 years later , at their watershed summit in maastricht , eu leaders - at least on paper - finally agreed to work toward achieving a common foreign and security policy .
but no instruments for doing so were created until 1999 when javier solana became mr. gasp .
real time action " one of the most important things the european union has to do is act in real time , " solana said recently about the feasibility of 25 member states working together .
" if you have a crisis , a political problem in the world , and you do not deal with it rapidly , you waste time , money and perhaps even human lives . "
but despite all solana 's efforts otherwise , national interests in europe still tend to take priority over a common eu policy , as the conflict in iraq showed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations secretary general kofi annan -lrb- left -rrb- and solana are champions of multilateralism .
solana is realistic and knows that the eu is not a single country and may never act as one .
he understands that the rules and instruments of a single state can not simply be duplicated on the eu level .
nonetheless , he remains optimistic about the chances of forging a single european policy for foreign affairs , even when the public perception of mr. gasp is less than that of his colleagues in berlin , paris and london .
progressing by meters and kilometers solana also knows that things take time in the eu .
" the european union is an organization that sometimes advances by meters and sometimes by kilometers , " he said .
with the new eu constitution , the spaniard sees the bloc jumping ahead by several kilometers .
" the eu is not a country , it remains an organization , a complex institution in which 25 states can have a common foreign and security policy . "
if adopted , europe 's first constitution will establish a real eu foreign minister position , which .
javier solana is expected to fill .
but the proof is in the praxis .
it remains to be seen if brussels can bundle together the various contravening interests under a common denominator , or whether national interests and national politicians will continue to dictate europe 's future road . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu 's solana chides washington over unilateralism eu foreign policy chief javier solana in hungary this week said the united states and the european union needed to work together to make the world safer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 30.07.2004 wto issues new plan as time runs out großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hard bargaining in geneva could decide the future of global trade in a bid to make a breakthrough in deadlocked talks on global trade , world trade organization negotiators put forward a compromise plan as the deadline for agreement nears . the world trade organization released a new compromise text on friday in an attempt to overcome resistance to a deal in global trade talks , notably on agriculture . the new draft framework was handed over to the 147 member states with a deadline of midnight on friday looming after days of negotiations and overnight bartering at wto headquarters in geneva , european diplomats are reported as saying . the revised compromise setting out the way ahead for the deadlocked talks on bringing down trade barriers in new areas , reinforced provisions to open up global export competition for farm products , according to a copy of the new text . it maintained the thrust of eliminating export subsidies , which would affect principally wealthy european countries , japan , and south korea .
but it reinforced language on reducing the scope of export credits , which are paid by the united states to its farmers , without calling for their outright elimination . text aimed to placate all members on the sensitive topic of bringing down protective barriers on industrial products ranging from microchips to toys , a key demand by industrialized countries , the text remained largely unchanged .
but wto chief negotiator shotaro oshima added a paragraph in the preamble emphasizing that its provisions still required additional negotiations . that moved in the direction of developing countries , which have refused to give in on market access .
greater access to developing countries ' industrial markets has been a key demand of wealthy countries such as the us and eu in return for reducing support for farmers , which poor countries blame for pricing them out of world markets . five big players agree on farming the world 's poorest countries were also given more leeway with provisions on special treatment .
the united states , european union , australia , brazil and india on thursday struck an agreement on the thorny issue of farming , although it is not clear how much this influenced the revised compromise . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wto general director supachai panitchpakdi , right .
" i welcome the agreement among five key members on the agriculture text , " wto director-general supachai panitchpakdi said in a statement conveyed by a spokesman .
" it is an important input into our negotiations and gives momentum to our efforts at completing negotiations .
but i must caution that no agricultural framework deal is possible without the consensus of all wto member governments . " however , the move annoyed many other countries , while insufficient time has been given to other hot topics such as reducing tariffs on non-farm products .
stalled doha talks are " make or break " for wto " it would be a shame , if for lack of time we do not close a deal that was within reach , at least as far as agriculture goes , " said one diplomat from a developed country in an interview with reuters .
failure to approve the framework this weekend will likely wreck a year-end goal to complete the stalled doha round of trade negotiations as us presidential elections and a shake-up at the european commission loom .

greater access to developing countries ' industrial markets has been a key demand of wealthy countries such as the us and eu in return for reducing support for farmers , which poor countries blame for pricing them out of world markets . five big players agree on farming the world 's poorest countries were also given more leeway with provisions on special treatment .

but it reinforced language on reducing the scope of export credits , which are paid by the united states to its farmers , without calling for their outright elimination . text aimed to placate all members on the sensitive topic of bringing down protective barriers on industrial products ranging from microchips to toys , a key demand by industrialized countries , the text remained largely unchanged .
but wto chief negotiator shotaro oshima added a paragraph in the preamble emphasizing that its provisions still required additional negotiations . that moved in the direction of developing countries , which have refused to give in on market access .
greater access to developing countries ' industrial markets has been a key demand of wealthy countries such as the us and eu in return for reducing support for farmers , which poor countries blame for pricing them out of world markets . five big players agree on farming the world 's poorest countries were also given more leeway with provisions on special treatment .
the united states , european union , australia , brazil and india on thursday struck an agreement on the thorny issue of farming , although it is not clear how much this influenced the revised compromise . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wto general director supachai panitchpakdi , right .
" i welcome the agreement among five key members on the agriculture text , " wto director-general supachai panitchpakdi said in a statement conveyed by a spokesman .
" it is an important input into our negotiations and gives momentum to our efforts at completing negotiations .
but i must caution that no agricultural framework deal is possible without the consensus of all wto member governments . " however , the move annoyed many other countries , while insufficient time has been given to other hot topics such as reducing tariffs on non-farm products .

by audrey brown bbc correspondent in south africa with a pithy " do n't call me , i 'll call you " , former south african president nelson mandela told the world in june this year , that he was retiring .
but we in south africa had heard it all before .
mr mandela holding the olympic torch outside his former cell on robben island he had warned us in 1997 , when he anointed thabo mbeki to succeed him as president when his term ended in 1999 , that he intended to step out of the limelight and live the life of a pensioner .
no-one really believed that he would fade from prominence because as arguably the most famous pensioner in the world - everything he does is news .
and since his latest retirement announcement , mr mandela does not seem to have slowed down a bit .
workaholic he was an olympic torch-bearer when the flame came to cape town in june , en route to athens .
he flew half-way round the world to deliver a major address at the unaids conference in thailand 's capital , bangkok , earlier this month .
then he popped by to " greet " the protagonists involved in the burundi peace talks , who were meeting in south africa last week .
mandela celebrated his birthday with wives , past and present he also celebrated his birthday - quietly this time - but with a high-profile reunion with his ex-wife winnie madikizela-mandela , who turned up at his rural retreat in the transkei , to enjoy the festivities with him and his current wife graca machel .
he even edited the afrikaans newspaper beeld for a day in a special issue to commemorate his 86th birthday .
when he was given the freedom of the city of johannesburg just a few days ago , he jokingly requested that he be allowed to drive his cows through the streets of the city of gold without having to pay taxes .
and this does not include the numerous phone calls and guests mr mandela receives every day .
let alone the places and people he decides to visit on the spur of the moment .
those who 've worked with him say quite plainly that mr mandela is a workaholic .
hand-wringing his ubiquitous personal assistant zelda le grange said that retirement for madiba , as mr mandela is affectionately known here , was for real this time .
she said he would be spending more time reading , waking up later than the usual 0500 and just relaxing .
mandela landmarks 1918 : born in eastern cape 1943 : joins anc 1964 : jailed for life 1990 : freed 1993 : wins nobel peace prize 1994 : elected president 1999 : steps down profile : nelson mandela he is also meant to be writing the next instalment of his memoirs .
but when asked whether she thought madiba really meant it this time - ms le grange just laughed .
and so did we .
although we did believe that he might take it easier this time around .
he is 86 and walks with difficulty .
but our concern for his health and well-being is not new either .
we 've been worriedly wringing our hands since his release in 1990 , when he took on a punishing schedule of meetings and travel , as well as the hectic negotiations which brought about peaceful elections in south africa in 1994 .
when he was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2001 , everyone believed once again that he would be forced to slow down .
this did not happen .
instead , mr mandela completed his treatment , and as soon as he was given a clean bill of health by his doctors , he was again out and about , pronouncing on matters of great significance - like the time he accused us president george bush of being " a president who ca n't think properly and who wants to plunge the world into a holocaust " .
years in jail in fact , not a week goes by without madiba being featured in the news .
he continued to initiate campaigns to fight against hiv / aids and he would invite tycoons on trips to rural areas and delicately manipulate them into pledging money to build schools and clinics .
at one time , president mbeki was said to be exasperated by madiba 's hyperactivity .
but to their credit both men are gracious about each other , with mr mandela making a point of reminding everyone that mr mbeki is the president of the ruling african national congress , and leader of south africa .
mr mandela gave a helping-hand to burundi 's peace talks mr mbeki 's reported exasperation and the general concern for his health notwithstanding , mr mandela is clearly a man with lots of energy , insight and the drive to try and influence events in whichever way he can .
perhaps nelson mandela has no intention of retiring - not if he can help it anyway .
perhaps after so many years in jail for trying to make the world a better place and with his concern for world affairs , he is just not able to retire .
perhaps he feels he has given up too much for too long to let other people just mess it up .
and he has spent much of his life at the very centre of one of the greatest stories of the twentieth century , so how can he retire ?
indeed , why should he retire ?
he is nelson mandela after all .

perhaps after so many years in jail for trying to make the world a better place and with his concern for world affairs , he is just not able to retire .
perhaps he feels he has given up too much for too long to let other people just mess it up .
and he has spent much of his life at the very centre of one of the greatest stories of the twentieth century , so how can he retire ?
indeed , why should he retire ?
he is nelson mandela after all .
