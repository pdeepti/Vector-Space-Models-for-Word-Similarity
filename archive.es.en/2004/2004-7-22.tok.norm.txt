using the threat of moving jobs abroad as a bargaining chip to get labor concessions is becoming popular amongst german companies .
but there 's more to outsourcing than the heated political debate it 's created . shifting jobs to low-wage countries to save costs is n't a particularly new phenomenon to germany .
but in recent months it has become an extremely sensitive topic in a country plagued by chronically high unemployment .
german chancellor gerhard schröder even called corporate outsourcing efforts " unpatriotic " this spring . " in the mid-1990s there was a wave of moving manufacturing jobs out of the country , " dr stephan wimmers from the german chamber of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- told dw-world .
" but now germany is also losing its advantage for better quality and capital-intensive jobs . " part of the new scrutiny of outsourcing began this spring when germany ’ s low-wage eastern neighbors poland and the czech republic finally joined the european union .
but a full-blown nationwide debate on the issue started in earnest in june , after electronics giant siemens convinced german workers that 2,000 jobs would be moved to hungary unless they moved from a 35-hour to a 40-hour workweek without added pay . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes c-class that encouraged several big companies to follow suit with similar offshoring threats .
carmaker daimlerchrysler is currently in talks with workers over the fate of 6,000 positions at its plant in sindelfingen near stuttgart .
unless it saves € 500 million in annual labor costs , daimlerchrysler has said it will move production of its mercedes c-class to cheaper sites in bremen and south africa . but whereas in germany offshoring has become synonymous for any attempt to move jobs abroad , in the united states and britain it frequently refers more specifically to outsourcing customer service call centers and it positions to cheaper facilities overseas . lagging behind that type of classic outsourcing has been slow to take off in germany , stymied by the country 's restrictive labor laws , language issues and the conservative nature of germany 's corporate culture . “ compared to us and uk companies , german interest in outsourcing has been much smaller , ” said andrew parker , an analyst for technology consultancy forrester .
although that was beginning to change , he said german offshoring was developing its own special focus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wipro employees undergo training in the use of specialized software to provide services to overseas clients at the company in bangalore , india .
india remains the dominant outsourcing destination for british and american firms , partly due to the high number of proficient english speakers there .
plenty of german companies also farm out it jobs and other back-office tasks to " offshore " indian operations , but parker said germany was looking more to " nearshore " central and eastern europe for many of its outsourcing needs . although it was more expensive than asia , parker said german clients appeared willing to pay a premium for geographic proximity and german language skills .
“ there are russian firms that still have a strong reservoir of german speaking developers in moscow and st. petersburg that they can tap into as needed , ” parker said . the benefits of language are obvious , but sometimes the " nearshore " helps facilitate " offshore " activities .
for example , us outsourcing giant eds each day ships truckloads of paper documents from clients in germany to its operations in nearby hungary so they can be scanned into the company ’ s database , thereby allowing the information to be processed electronically elsewhere around the world . creating jobs in germany however , offshoring is n't quite as simple as just siphoning off jobs to low-wage countries in eastern europe and asia .
surprisingly , it is also leading to more positions inside germany , at least for outsourcing companies . " we want to hire a lot of people locally , " debjit chaudhuri , head the german division of indian software and services outsourcing specialist infosys technologies , told dw-world . chaudhuri said he needed to expand his 200-person office near frankfurt in order to take advantage of corporate germany 's increasing appetite for outsourcing .
the burgeoning workload also means infosys is training people in india to become familiar with german culture . " they can ’ t all be in germany but they need to know how it is here .
the whole idea is to be as german as possible , " he said . marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de daimlerchrysler board may take salary cut to help defuse a growing labor dispute over longer working hours for employees , top managers at carmaker daimlerchrysler appear ready to accept large salary cuts .

outlining his goals for his country 's six-month eu presidency before the european parliament , dutch premier jan-peter balkenende has called for fairness in deciding whether to start accession talks with turkey . speaking before the newly elected parliament in strasbourg on wednesday , the christian democrat said eu countries must not be guided by a fear of islam when deciding about the bloc 's future relationship with turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende " resistance towards a religion is not consistent european values , " balkenende said . "
our resistance has to be focussed on people who abuse worshipping god to propagate violence . " in december , eu leaders will decide whether turkey meets the political and economic criteria to begin negotiations towards joining the bloc at some point in the future .
that process is expected to take at least 10 years . balkenende said turkey 's readiness for negotiations should be judged honestly but strictly on the existing criteria of human rights , democracy and the rule of law without inventing new conditions . refuting bin laden martin schulz , the leader of the european socialists , agreed with balkenende .
he added that the eu had raised turkey 's hopes to join the union and could not switch gears at this point . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin schulz " islam is n't the problem , " schulz -lrb- photo -rrb- said .
" if it were possible to show that western values and an islamic society are not mutually exclusive , the arguments of the world 's bin ladens would be refuted .
the increase in the level of security that europe could gain from this should not be dismissed lightly . " but hans-gert pöttering , schulz 's political opponent as leader of the conservatives in the european parliament , said that the union should offer turkey a special partnership but not full membership . france is on the fence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan earlier this week , turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan -lrb- photo -rrb- visited france to lobby for paris to support turkey 's accession to the eu . french president jacques chirac on tuesday reaffirmed his support for turkey 's eventual membership of the european union , without specifying any time frame . according to a chirac aide , the president said that " turkey 's integration into the eu is welcome as soon as it becomes possible ... turkey has made considerable progress .
it must continue and intensify the implementation of democratic and economic reforms . " chirac has previously said he believes the path to turkish membership is " irreversible , " but he is at odds with many in his own union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- party and the public who believe the predominantly muslim country has no place in the club of 25 . the debate over turkey 's right to join the eu has been particularly robust in france , where there is strong opposition both from those who fear its implications for immigration and europe 's cultural heritage , and those who say it will mean the end of their vision for a politically integrated continent . abstention rather than opposition ? the nationalist leader philippe de villiers on tuesday condemned erdogan 's visit and what he described as chirac 's " determination " to see turkey join the eu .
he said he would ensure turkey 's membership is at the " heart of the debate " ahead of next year 's planned referendum on the eu constitution . as britain , germany and spain already lean towards supporting commencing negotiations with turkey , some think that it 's unlikely that france would block such a step . " france will either fight for the opening of negotiations or abstain , because it does n't want to oppose the main european countries which have already come out clearly in favor , " didier billion , an expert on turkey and the deputy director of the paris-based institute for international and strategic relations , told reuters news agency .

outlining his goals for his country 's six-month eu presidency before the european parliament , dutch premier jan-peter balkenende has called for fairness in deciding whether to start accession talks with turkey . speaking before the newly elected parliament in strasbourg on wednesday , the christian democrat said eu countries must not be guided by a fear of islam when deciding about the bloc 's future relationship with turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende " resistance towards a religion is not consistent european values , " balkenende said . "
our resistance has to be focussed on people who abuse worshipping god to propagate violence . " in december , eu leaders will decide whether turkey meets the political and economic criteria to begin negotiations towards joining the bloc at some point in the future .
that process is expected to take at least 10 years . balkenende said turkey 's readiness for negotiations should be judged honestly but strictly on the existing criteria of human rights , democracy and the rule of law without inventing new conditions . refuting bin laden martin schulz , the leader of the european socialists , agreed with balkenende .
he added that the eu had raised turkey 's hopes to join the union and could not switch gears at this point . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin schulz " islam is n't the problem , " schulz -lrb- photo -rrb- said .
" if it were possible to show that western values and an islamic society are not mutually exclusive , the arguments of the world 's bin ladens would be refuted .
the increase in the level of security that europe could gain from this should not be dismissed lightly . " but hans-gert pöttering , schulz 's political opponent as leader of the conservatives in the european parliament , said that the union should offer turkey a special partnership but not full membership . france is on the fence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan earlier this week , turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan -lrb- photo -rrb- visited france to lobby for paris to support turkey 's accession to the eu . french president jacques chirac on tuesday reaffirmed his support for turkey 's eventual membership of the european union , without specifying any time frame . according to a chirac aide , the president said that " turkey 's integration into the eu is welcome as soon as it becomes possible ... turkey has made considerable progress .
it must continue and intensify the implementation of democratic and economic reforms . " chirac has previously said he believes the path to turkish membership is " irreversible , " but he is at odds with many in his own union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- party and the public who believe the predominantly muslim country has no place in the club of 25 . the debate over turkey 's right to join the eu has been particularly robust in france , where there is strong opposition both from those who fear its implications for immigration and europe 's cultural heritage , and those who say it will mean the end of their vision for a politically integrated continent . abstention rather than opposition ? the nationalist leader philippe de villiers on tuesday condemned erdogan 's visit and what he described as chirac 's " determination " to see turkey join the eu .
he said he would ensure turkey 's membership is at the " heart of the debate " ahead of next year 's planned referendum on the eu constitution . as britain , germany and spain already lean towards supporting commencing negotiations with turkey , some think that it 's unlikely that france would block such a step . " france will either fight for the opening of negotiations or abstain , because it does n't want to oppose the main european countries which have already come out clearly in favor , " didier billion , an expert on turkey and the deputy director of the paris-based institute for international and strategic relations , told reuters news agency .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 22.07.2004 all acquitted in mannesmann trial großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trial centered on vodafone 's takeover of mannesmann deutsche bank chairman josef ackermann and five other co-defendants were found not guilty of the charges of breach of trust in the so-called mannesmann trial , a düsseldorf court ruled on thursday . ackermann , former mannesmann chairman klaus esser , mannesmann 's former supervisory board chief joachim funk , the former head of the powerful ig metall trade union , klaus zwickel , and two others , were found not guilty of any wrongdoing in the blockbuster corporate trial . all were accused of approving millions of euros in severance packages for mannesmann 's top executives after british competitor vodafone took over the company .
the case has been seen as putting german corporate governance in the dock . the presiding judge , brigitte koppenhföer , already said in a preliminary assessment half-way through the trial in march that while the actions of ackermann and his five co-defendants may have breached german stock law - which would be a civil matter - they were not serious enough to warrant a criminal conviction . " in this criminal process it is not up to the court to make management decisions or moral or ethical judgements , " said koppenhöfer on thursday .
" we are not judging german corporate culture although the evidence we saw was puzzling at times . " big bonuses all were accused , to varying degrees , of wrongdoing , when they approved 111.5 million deutsche marks -lrb- $ 71 million -rrb- in bonuses to management board members during the multi-billion-euro takeover of mannesmann by british mobile phone giant vodafone in 2000 .
esser alone pocketed more than € 15 million . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus esser and josef ackermann prosecutors had argued that the size of the payouts clearly went against the interests of both mannesmann and its shareholders and were therefore illegal under german share law .
they called for a jail sentence of two years with probation for deutsche bank chairman ackermann and wanted a two-and-a-half-year prison sentence without parole for former mannesmann chairman esser . judge koppenhföer did rule that the payment to esser broke corporate law because it came after the sale of the company to vodafone . " additional remuneration for esser equals double pay , " she said .
" there was no benefit for mannesmann to pay him for this integration period into vodafone . " common elsewhere the defendants had argued that such large payments are common practice in other countries such as the united states and that sanctioning the executives would discourage any bold decision-making in german companies in future . the blockbuster trial began on january 21 , and the head of germany 's biggest bank was required to spend two days every week in court .
some 55 witnesses were heard during a total 37 days in court . on the very first day , ackermann , who has spent around € 1.9 million on his defense , sparked widespread anger by making the " v " victory sign as he entered the court .
but even after his acquittal , the trial will have hurt the image of ackermann 's bank , already scratched after a series of pr mishaps , such as deutsche bank 's bungled handling of the flotation of postbank and a lawsuit lodged by former client and one-time media magnate , leo kirch . " i am extraordinarily grateful that the court sees the situation the way we have always presented it , " a relieved ackermann told reporters on thursday . but prosecutors could still decide to appeal the verdict to a higher court , which could cause the saga to drag on for years . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trying germany 's business elite a verdict is expected this week in germany 's most-watched business trial : top executives , including the head of deutsche bank , are accused of approving astronomical severance packages .

using the threat of moving jobs abroad as a bargaining chip to get labor concessions is becoming popular amongst german companies .
but there 's more to outsourcing than the heated political debate it 's created . shifting jobs to low-wage countries to save costs is n't a particularly new phenomenon to germany .
but in recent months it has become an extremely sensitive topic in a country plagued by chronically high unemployment .
german chancellor gerhard schröder even called corporate outsourcing efforts " unpatriotic " this spring . " in the mid-1990s there was a wave of moving manufacturing jobs out of the country , " dr stephan wimmers from the german chamber of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- told dw-world .
" but now germany is also losing its advantage for better quality and capital-intensive jobs . " part of the new scrutiny of outsourcing began this spring when germany ’ s low-wage eastern neighbors poland and the czech republic finally joined the european union .
but a full-blown nationwide debate on the issue started in earnest in june , after electronics giant siemens convinced german workers that 2,000 jobs would be moved to hungary unless they moved from a 35-hour to a 40-hour workweek without added pay . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes c-class that encouraged several big companies to follow suit with similar offshoring threats .
carmaker daimlerchrysler is currently in talks with workers over the fate of 6,000 positions at its plant in sindelfingen near stuttgart .
unless it saves € 500 million in annual labor costs , daimlerchrysler has said it will move production of its mercedes c-class to cheaper sites in bremen and south africa . but whereas in germany offshoring has become synonymous for any attempt to move jobs abroad , in the united states and britain it frequently refers more specifically to outsourcing customer service call centers and it positions to cheaper facilities overseas . lagging behind that type of classic outsourcing has been slow to take off in germany , stymied by the country 's restrictive labor laws , language issues and the conservative nature of germany 's corporate culture . “ compared to us and uk companies , german interest in outsourcing has been much smaller , ” said andrew parker , an analyst for technology consultancy forrester .
although that was beginning to change , he said german offshoring was developing its own special focus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wipro employees undergo training in the use of specialized software to provide services to overseas clients at the company in bangalore , india .
india remains the dominant outsourcing destination for british and american firms , partly due to the high number of proficient english speakers there .
plenty of german companies also farm out it jobs and other back-office tasks to " offshore " indian operations , but parker said germany was looking more to " nearshore " central and eastern europe for many of its outsourcing needs . although it was more expensive than asia , parker said german clients appeared willing to pay a premium for geographic proximity and german language skills .
“ there are russian firms that still have a strong reservoir of german speaking developers in moscow and st. petersburg that they can tap into as needed , ” parker said . the benefits of language are obvious , but sometimes the " nearshore " helps facilitate " offshore " activities .
for example , us outsourcing giant eds each day ships truckloads of paper documents from clients in germany to its operations in nearby hungary so they can be scanned into the company ’ s database , thereby allowing the information to be processed electronically elsewhere around the world . creating jobs in germany however , offshoring is n't quite as simple as just siphoning off jobs to low-wage countries in eastern europe and asia .
surprisingly , it is also leading to more positions inside germany , at least for outsourcing companies . " we want to hire a lot of people locally , " debjit chaudhuri , head the german division of indian software and services outsourcing specialist infosys technologies , told dw-world . chaudhuri said he needed to expand his 200-person office near frankfurt in order to take advantage of corporate germany 's increasing appetite for outsourcing .
the burgeoning workload also means infosys is training people in india to become familiar with german culture . " they can ’ t all be in germany but they need to know how it is here .
the whole idea is to be as german as possible , " he said . marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de daimlerchrysler board may take salary cut to help defuse a growing labor dispute over longer working hours for employees , top managers at carmaker daimlerchrysler appear ready to accept large salary cuts .

413 of the legislature 's 732 members voted for him . eu leaders agreed on barroso in june as a compromise candidate to replace outgoing commission president romano prodi .
barroso has since embarked on a charm offensive to win over the various factions of the european parliament .
on wednesday , the day before the vote , he summarized his plans for the new executive . barroso headed a conservative government in portugal , and many socialist and green meps are still skeptical about his efforts to present himself as an unbiased , centrist reformer . “ i will not be the president of the right against the left , or the left against the right , that i can promise you , ” he said . but barroso ’ s assertive campaign , conducted in fluent french , portuguese and english , has convinced others to support the commission ’ s candidate .
when barroso ’ s nomination was announced , irish premier bertie ahern gave him his enthusiastic backing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president romano prodi , right , and bertie ahern “ jose manuel durao barroso has the qualities that are needed for a strong and independent commission in these times , " ahern -lrb- photo , left -rrb- said .
" i know that he will lead the commission with strength , vigour , and vision . ” explaining the eu to its citizens following record low voter turnouts in the recent european elections , one of barroso ’ s key concerns is the need for eu institutions to do a better job of explaining their policies to european citizens .
he also told the european parliament that he hopes to act as a bridge between old and new eu members , as well as between the richer and poorer countries , and urged meps to confirm him in his candidacy . bildunterschrift : general view of the newly elected european parliament “ i need your support - not only personal support to me but support to the commission , " he said .
" because we need in this moment of europe , we need a strong , credible , independent commission , and the only way to have a strong commission , to say sometimes no to some member states , is to have the strong backing of the european parliament . ” “ no ” has been durao barroso 's response to leaders who have called for the rewriting of the european growth and stability pact , which ensures the stability of europe 's common currency , the euro . on wednesday he referred only to the need to ensure both flexibility and monetary stability , but he has previously stated his belief that the eu ’ s budgetary limitations , which are being broken with virtual impunity by germany , france and italy , should be respected .
guiding the eu constitution towards ratification is also one of his priorities . from maoist to war supporter a former maoist student activist under the portuguese dictatorship of antonio salazar , barroso ’ s politics shifted to the right after the restoration of democracy in 1974 .
he won his first senior government post at the age of just 29 , and had seven years later he had already served as foreign minister .
in 1999 he took over the leadership of his conservative social democratic party , winning the election in 2002 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. president george bush , center , british prime minister tony blair , second from left , and spain 's prime minister jose maria aznar , right , seen together with portugal 's prime minister jose manuel durao barroso , left , after arriving in the azores march 16 , 2003 to attend a summit to discuss the crisis with iraq barroso supported the us-led war on iraq , a decision for which he has been heavily criticized both in his own country and abroad , and one he defended in recent days as one of the most difficult of his life .

413 of the legislature 's 732 members voted for him . eu leaders agreed on barroso in june as a compromise candidate to replace outgoing commission president romano prodi .
barroso has since embarked on a charm offensive to win over the various factions of the european parliament .
on wednesday , the day before the vote , he summarized his plans for the new executive . barroso headed a conservative government in portugal , and many socialist and green meps are still skeptical about his efforts to present himself as an unbiased , centrist reformer . “ i will not be the president of the right against the left , or the left against the right , that i can promise you , ” he said . but barroso ’ s assertive campaign , conducted in fluent french , portuguese and english , has convinced others to support the commission ’ s candidate .
when barroso ’ s nomination was announced , irish premier bertie ahern gave him his enthusiastic backing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president romano prodi , right , and bertie ahern “ jose manuel durao barroso has the qualities that are needed for a strong and independent commission in these times , " ahern -lrb- photo , left -rrb- said .
" i know that he will lead the commission with strength , vigour , and vision . ” explaining the eu to its citizens following record low voter turnouts in the recent european elections , one of barroso ’ s key concerns is the need for eu institutions to do a better job of explaining their policies to european citizens .
he also told the european parliament that he hopes to act as a bridge between old and new eu members , as well as between the richer and poorer countries , and urged meps to confirm him in his candidacy . bildunterschrift : general view of the newly elected european parliament “ i need your support - not only personal support to me but support to the commission , " he said .
" because we need in this moment of europe , we need a strong , credible , independent commission , and the only way to have a strong commission , to say sometimes no to some member states , is to have the strong backing of the european parliament . ” “ no ” has been durao barroso 's response to leaders who have called for the rewriting of the european growth and stability pact , which ensures the stability of europe 's common currency , the euro . on wednesday he referred only to the need to ensure both flexibility and monetary stability , but he has previously stated his belief that the eu ’ s budgetary limitations , which are being broken with virtual impunity by germany , france and italy , should be respected .
guiding the eu constitution towards ratification is also one of his priorities . from maoist to war supporter a former maoist student activist under the portuguese dictatorship of antonio salazar , barroso ’ s politics shifted to the right after the restoration of democracy in 1974 .
he won his first senior government post at the age of just 29 , and had seven years later he had already served as foreign minister .
in 1999 he took over the leadership of his conservative social democratic party , winning the election in 2002 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. president george bush , center , british prime minister tony blair , second from left , and spain 's prime minister jose maria aznar , right , seen together with portugal 's prime minister jose manuel durao barroso , left , after arriving in the azores march 16 , 2003 to attend a summit to discuss the crisis with iraq barroso supported the us-led war on iraq , a decision for which he has been heavily criticized both in his own country and abroad , and one he defended in recent days as one of the most difficult of his life .

outlining his goals for his country 's six-month eu presidency before the european parliament , dutch premier jan-peter balkenende has called for fairness in deciding whether to start accession talks with turkey . speaking before the newly elected parliament in strasbourg on wednesday , the christian democrat said eu countries must not be guided by a fear of islam when deciding about the bloc 's future relationship with turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende " resistance towards a religion is not consistent european values , " balkenende said . "
our resistance has to be focussed on people who abuse worshipping god to propagate violence . " in december , eu leaders will decide whether turkey meets the political and economic criteria to begin negotiations towards joining the bloc at some point in the future .
that process is expected to take at least 10 years . balkenende said turkey 's readiness for negotiations should be judged honestly but strictly on the existing criteria of human rights , democracy and the rule of law without inventing new conditions . refuting bin laden martin schulz , the leader of the european socialists , agreed with balkenende .
he added that the eu had raised turkey 's hopes to join the union and could not switch gears at this point . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin schulz " islam is n't the problem , " schulz -lrb- photo -rrb- said .
" if it were possible to show that western values and an islamic society are not mutually exclusive , the arguments of the world 's bin ladens would be refuted .
the increase in the level of security that europe could gain from this should not be dismissed lightly . " but hans-gert pöttering , schulz 's political opponent as leader of the conservatives in the european parliament , said that the union should offer turkey a special partnership but not full membership . france is on the fence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan earlier this week , turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan -lrb- photo -rrb- visited france to lobby for paris to support turkey 's accession to the eu . french president jacques chirac on tuesday reaffirmed his support for turkey 's eventual membership of the european union , without specifying any time frame . according to a chirac aide , the president said that " turkey 's integration into the eu is welcome as soon as it becomes possible ... turkey has made considerable progress .
it must continue and intensify the implementation of democratic and economic reforms . " chirac has previously said he believes the path to turkish membership is " irreversible , " but he is at odds with many in his own union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- party and the public who believe the predominantly muslim country has no place in the club of 25 . the debate over turkey 's right to join the eu has been particularly robust in france , where there is strong opposition both from those who fear its implications for immigration and europe 's cultural heritage , and those who say it will mean the end of their vision for a politically integrated continent . abstention rather than opposition ? the nationalist leader philippe de villiers on tuesday condemned erdogan 's visit and what he described as chirac 's " determination " to see turkey join the eu .
he said he would ensure turkey 's membership is at the " heart of the debate " ahead of next year 's planned referendum on the eu constitution . as britain , germany and spain already lean towards supporting commencing negotiations with turkey , some think that it 's unlikely that france would block such a step . " france will either fight for the opening of negotiations or abstain , because it does n't want to oppose the main european countries which have already come out clearly in favor , " didier billion , an expert on turkey and the deputy director of the paris-based institute for international and strategic relations , told reuters news agency .

speculation is growing that former star striker jürgen klinsmann will take over the vacant coaching job for germany 's national soccer team .
he would lead the squad into the 2006 world cup being held in germany . the president of the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- , gerhard mayer-vorfelder , held talks with klinsmann in new york on tuesday " to discuss the future planning for staffing of the national team , " a dfb spokesman said on wednesday . although it was not yet certain klinsmann would take over from rudi völler , who resigned last month after germany 's miserable euro 2004 campaign , he expressed his desire to help the national team get back on its feet . " the world cup is the most important sporting event of the past 40 years in germany .
it 's obvious that i 'll help the dfb , independently of the post , " klinsmann said . the 39-year-old former vfb stuttgart , inter milan and tottenham star , who won the world cup in 1990 , currently runs a sports marketing company in california .
he holds a training license but does not have any professional coaching experience . bierhoff as manager but according to media reports , klinsmann was now the frontrunner for the top coaching spot and another former star striker , oliver bierhoff , is set to fill the newly created position of team manager .
bierhoff , who is known to be a close friend of klinsmann , has already expressed his interest working with him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soccer star oliver bierhoff " if jürgen will agree to be coach , then i can imagine the job will be a lot of fun - that would be a good model , " bierhoff said according to the associated press . klinsmann has also been a vocal critic of the dfb 's recent disorganization and bumbling in trying to find a replacement for völler .
after ex-bayern munich coach ottmar hitzfeld balked at taking the job , german soccer officials have flailed about embarrassingly in their search . euro 2004-winning greece coach otto rehhagel said he 'd serve out his contract with the greeks and the dfb has been reluctant to sign a foreign coach like dutchman guus hiddink and dane morten olsen . most observers believe a klinsmann-bierhoff tandem would be an elegant solution , which would represent a fresh start for the national squad .
both are know for their intelligence and international experience that could serve germany well as it hosts the sport 's biggest event in 2006 . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's most unwanted the coach of germany 's national soccer team still remains unfilled despite once being a coveted and prestigious position .

" chirac has previously said he believes the path to turkish membership is " irreversible , " but he is at odds with many in his own union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- party and the public who believe the predominantly muslim country has no place in the club of 25 . the debate over turkey 's right to join the eu has been particularly robust in france , where there is strong opposition both from those who fear its implications for immigration and europe 's cultural heritage , and those who say it will mean the end of their vision for a politically integrated continent . abstention rather than opposition ? the nationalist leader philippe de villiers on tuesday condemned erdogan 's visit and what he described as chirac 's " determination " to see turkey join the eu .
he said he would ensure turkey 's membership is at the " heart of the debate " ahead of next year 's planned referendum on the eu constitution . as britain , germany and spain already lean towards supporting commencing negotiations with turkey , some think that it 's unlikely that france would block such a step . " france will either fight for the opening of negotiations or abstain , because it does n't want to oppose the main european countries which have already come out clearly in favor , " didier billion , an expert on turkey and the deputy director of the paris-based institute for international and strategic relations , told reuters news agency .

using the threat of moving jobs abroad as a bargaining chip to get labor concessions is becoming popular amongst german companies .
but there 's more to outsourcing than the heated political debate it 's created . shifting jobs to low-wage countries to save costs is n't a particularly new phenomenon to germany .
but in recent months it has become an extremely sensitive topic in a country plagued by chronically high unemployment .
german chancellor gerhard schröder even called corporate outsourcing efforts " unpatriotic " this spring . " in the mid-1990s there was a wave of moving manufacturing jobs out of the country , " dr stephan wimmers from the german chamber of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- told dw-world .
" but now germany is also losing its advantage for better quality and capital-intensive jobs . " part of the new scrutiny of outsourcing began this spring when germany ’ s low-wage eastern neighbors poland and the czech republic finally joined the european union .
but a full-blown nationwide debate on the issue started in earnest in june , after electronics giant siemens convinced german workers that 2,000 jobs would be moved to hungary unless they moved from a 35-hour to a 40-hour workweek without added pay . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes c-class that encouraged several big companies to follow suit with similar offshoring threats .
carmaker daimlerchrysler is currently in talks with workers over the fate of 6,000 positions at its plant in sindelfingen near stuttgart .
unless it saves € 500 million in annual labor costs , daimlerchrysler has said it will move production of its mercedes c-class to cheaper sites in bremen and south africa . but whereas in germany offshoring has become synonymous for any attempt to move jobs abroad , in the united states and britain it frequently refers more specifically to outsourcing customer service call centers and it positions to cheaper facilities overseas . lagging behind that type of classic outsourcing has been slow to take off in germany , stymied by the country 's restrictive labor laws , language issues and the conservative nature of germany 's corporate culture . “ compared to us and uk companies , german interest in outsourcing has been much smaller , ” said andrew parker , an analyst for technology consultancy forrester .
although that was beginning to change , he said german offshoring was developing its own special focus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wipro employees undergo training in the use of specialized software to provide services to overseas clients at the company in bangalore , india .
india remains the dominant outsourcing destination for british and american firms , partly due to the high number of proficient english speakers there .
plenty of german companies also farm out it jobs and other back-office tasks to " offshore " indian operations , but parker said germany was looking more to " nearshore " central and eastern europe for many of its outsourcing needs . although it was more expensive than asia , parker said german clients appeared willing to pay a premium for geographic proximity and german language skills .
“ there are russian firms that still have a strong reservoir of german speaking developers in moscow and st. petersburg that they can tap into as needed , ” parker said . the benefits of language are obvious , but sometimes the " nearshore " helps facilitate " offshore " activities .
for example , us outsourcing giant eds each day ships truckloads of paper documents from clients in germany to its operations in nearby hungary so they can be scanned into the company ’ s database , thereby allowing the information to be processed electronically elsewhere around the world . creating jobs in germany however , offshoring is n't quite as simple as just siphoning off jobs to low-wage countries in eastern europe and asia .
surprisingly , it is also leading to more positions inside germany , at least for outsourcing companies . " we want to hire a lot of people locally , " debjit chaudhuri , head the german division of indian software and services outsourcing specialist infosys technologies , told dw-world . chaudhuri said he needed to expand his 200-person office near frankfurt in order to take advantage of corporate germany 's increasing appetite for outsourcing .
the burgeoning workload also means infosys is training people in india to become familiar with german culture . " they can ’ t all be in germany but they need to know how it is here .

the case has been seen as putting german corporate governance in the dock . the presiding judge , brigitte koppenhföer , already said in a preliminary assessment half-way through the trial in march that while the actions of ackermann and his five co-defendants may have breached german stock law - which would be a civil matter - they were not serious enough to warrant a criminal conviction . " in this criminal process it is not up to the court to make management decisions or moral or ethical judgements , " said koppenhöfer on thursday .
" we are not judging german corporate culture although the evidence we saw was puzzling at times . " big bonuses all were accused , to varying degrees , of wrongdoing , when they approved 111.5 million deutsche marks -lrb- $ 71 million -rrb- in bonuses to management board members during the multi-billion-euro takeover of mannesmann by british mobile phone giant vodafone in 2000 .
esser alone pocketed more than € 15 million . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus esser and josef ackermann prosecutors had argued that the size of the payouts clearly went against the interests of both mannesmann and its shareholders and were therefore illegal under german share law .
they called for a jail sentence of two years with probation for deutsche bank chairman ackermann and wanted a two-and-a-half-year prison sentence without parole for former mannesmann chairman esser . judge koppenhföer did rule that the payment to esser broke corporate law because it came after the sale of the company to vodafone . " additional remuneration for esser equals double pay , " she said .
" there was no benefit for mannesmann to pay him for this integration period into vodafone . " common elsewhere the defendants had argued that such large payments are common practice in other countries such as the united states and that sanctioning the executives would discourage any bold decision-making in german companies in future . the blockbuster trial began on january 21 , and the head of germany 's biggest bank was required to spend two days every week in court .
some 55 witnesses were heard during a total 37 days in court . on the very first day , ackermann , who has spent around € 1.9 million on his defense , sparked widespread anger by making the " v " victory sign as he entered the court .
but even after his acquittal , the trial will have hurt the image of ackermann 's bank , already scratched after a series of pr mishaps , such as deutsche bank 's bungled handling of the flotation of postbank and a lawsuit lodged by former client and one-time media magnate , leo kirch . " i am extraordinarily grateful that the court sees the situation the way we have always presented it , " a relieved ackermann told reporters on thursday . but prosecutors could still decide to appeal the verdict to a higher court , which could cause the saga to drag on for years . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trying germany 's business elite a verdict is expected this week in germany 's most-watched business trial : top executives , including the head of deutsche bank , are accused of approving astronomical severance packages .

begun in august 2000 , the program hoped to attract 20,000 highly skilled workers to the country in three years .
but by the end of that time , only 14,000 foreign workers had taken advantage of the visa project - 4,000 of them were from india .
many complained that the program was overly bureaucratic .
time limitations on the work visas as well as restrictions on bringing family members over dampened the enthusiasm of many . " it 's easier for a terrorist to get asylum in germany than it is for a foreign software expert to enter the german labor market , " one indian computer specialist told fischer during the meeting in bombay . fischer assured the audience that new immigrations laws to take effect in january would change that . pushing business ties the foreign minister also did some campaigning for germany as a location for industry , saying that his country 's highly developed infrastructure and location in the middle of the european union made for " excellent conditions " for foreign companies . he also appealed to german companies to take advantage of " the enormous opportunities " offered by the indian market and announced a visit this fall by chancellor gerhard schröder , who will be accompanied by a large business delegation .
fischer called on india to cut some of its red tape in order to improve its attractiveness to foreign investors . he praised progress in the peace process with india 's long-time rival pakistan , saying a lasting peace between the neighbors was important to convince investors that the region was a profitable and secure place to do business . on wednesday night , fischer flew to pakistan for a two-day visit there .

speculation is growing that former star striker jürgen klinsmann will take over the vacant coaching job for germany 's national soccer team .
he would lead the squad into the 2006 world cup being held in germany . the president of the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- , gerhard mayer-vorfelder , held talks with klinsmann in new york on tuesday " to discuss the future planning for staffing of the national team , " a dfb spokesman said on wednesday . although it was not yet certain klinsmann would take over from rudi völler , who resigned last month after germany 's miserable euro 2004 campaign , he expressed his desire to help the national team get back on its feet . " the world cup is the most important sporting event of the past 40 years in germany .
it 's obvious that i 'll help the dfb , independently of the post , " klinsmann said . the 39-year-old former vfb stuttgart , inter milan and tottenham star , who won the world cup in 1990 , currently runs a sports marketing company in california .
he holds a training license but does not have any professional coaching experience . bierhoff as manager but according to media reports , klinsmann was now the frontrunner for the top coaching spot and another former star striker , oliver bierhoff , is set to fill the newly created position of team manager .
bierhoff , who is known to be a close friend of klinsmann , has already expressed his interest working with him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soccer star oliver bierhoff " if jürgen will agree to be coach , then i can imagine the job will be a lot of fun - that would be a good model , " bierhoff said according to the associated press . klinsmann has also been a vocal critic of the dfb 's recent disorganization and bumbling in trying to find a replacement for völler .
after ex-bayern munich coach ottmar hitzfeld balked at taking the job , german soccer officials have flailed about embarrassingly in their search . euro 2004-winning greece coach otto rehhagel said he 'd serve out his contract with the greeks and the dfb has been reluctant to sign a foreign coach like dutchman guus hiddink and dane morten olsen . most observers believe a klinsmann-bierhoff tandem would be an elegant solution , which would represent a fresh start for the national squad .

using the threat of moving jobs abroad as a bargaining chip to get labor concessions is becoming popular amongst german companies .
but there 's more to outsourcing than the heated political debate it 's created . shifting jobs to low-wage countries to save costs is n't a particularly new phenomenon to germany .
but in recent months it has become an extremely sensitive topic in a country plagued by chronically high unemployment .
german chancellor gerhard schröder even called corporate outsourcing efforts " unpatriotic " this spring . " in the mid-1990s there was a wave of moving manufacturing jobs out of the country , " dr stephan wimmers from the german chamber of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- told dw-world .
" but now germany is also losing its advantage for better quality and capital-intensive jobs . " part of the new scrutiny of outsourcing began this spring when germany ’ s low-wage eastern neighbors poland and the czech republic finally joined the european union .
but a full-blown nationwide debate on the issue started in earnest in june , after electronics giant siemens convinced german workers that 2,000 jobs would be moved to hungary unless they moved from a 35-hour to a 40-hour workweek without added pay . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes c-class that encouraged several big companies to follow suit with similar offshoring threats .
carmaker daimlerchrysler is currently in talks with workers over the fate of 6,000 positions at its plant in sindelfingen near stuttgart .
unless it saves € 500 million in annual labor costs , daimlerchrysler has said it will move production of its mercedes c-class to cheaper sites in bremen and south africa . but whereas in germany offshoring has become synonymous for any attempt to move jobs abroad , in the united states and britain it frequently refers more specifically to outsourcing customer service call centers and it positions to cheaper facilities overseas . lagging behind that type of classic outsourcing has been slow to take off in germany , stymied by the country 's restrictive labor laws , language issues and the conservative nature of germany 's corporate culture . “ compared to us and uk companies , german interest in outsourcing has been much smaller , ” said andrew parker , an analyst for technology consultancy forrester .
although that was beginning to change , he said german offshoring was developing its own special focus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wipro employees undergo training in the use of specialized software to provide services to overseas clients at the company in bangalore , india .
india remains the dominant outsourcing destination for british and american firms , partly due to the high number of proficient english speakers there .
plenty of german companies also farm out it jobs and other back-office tasks to " offshore " indian operations , but parker said germany was looking more to " nearshore " central and eastern europe for many of its outsourcing needs . although it was more expensive than asia , parker said german clients appeared willing to pay a premium for geographic proximity and german language skills .
“ there are russian firms that still have a strong reservoir of german speaking developers in moscow and st. petersburg that they can tap into as needed , ” parker said . the benefits of language are obvious , but sometimes the " nearshore " helps facilitate " offshore " activities .
for example , us outsourcing giant eds each day ships truckloads of paper documents from clients in germany to its operations in nearby hungary so they can be scanned into the company ’ s database , thereby allowing the information to be processed electronically elsewhere around the world . creating jobs in germany however , offshoring is n't quite as simple as just siphoning off jobs to low-wage countries in eastern europe and asia .
surprisingly , it is also leading to more positions inside germany , at least for outsourcing companies . " we want to hire a lot of people locally , " debjit chaudhuri , head the german division of indian software and services outsourcing specialist infosys technologies , told dw-world . chaudhuri said he needed to expand his 200-person office near frankfurt in order to take advantage of corporate germany 's increasing appetite for outsourcing .
the burgeoning workload also means infosys is training people in india to become familiar with german culture . " they can ’ t all be in germany but they need to know how it is here .
the whole idea is to be as german as possible , " he said . marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de daimlerchrysler board may take salary cut to help defuse a growing labor dispute over longer working hours for employees , top managers at carmaker daimlerchrysler appear ready to accept large salary cuts .

that process is expected to take at least 10 years . balkenende said turkey 's readiness for negotiations should be judged honestly but strictly on the existing criteria of human rights , democracy and the rule of law without inventing new conditions . refuting bin laden martin schulz , the leader of the european socialists , agreed with balkenende .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 22.07.2004 all acquitted in mannesmann trial großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trial centered on vodafone 's takeover of mannesmann deutsche bank chairman josef ackermann and five other co-defendants were found not guilty of the charges of breach of trust in the so-called mannesmann trial , a düsseldorf court ruled on thursday . ackermann , former mannesmann chairman klaus esser , mannesmann 's former supervisory board chief joachim funk , the former head of the powerful ig metall trade union , klaus zwickel , and two others , were found not guilty of any wrongdoing in the blockbuster corporate trial . all were accused of approving millions of euros in severance packages for mannesmann 's top executives after british competitor vodafone took over the company .
the case has been seen as putting german corporate governance in the dock . the presiding judge , brigitte koppenhföer , already said in a preliminary assessment half-way through the trial in march that while the actions of ackermann and his five co-defendants may have breached german stock law - which would be a civil matter - they were not serious enough to warrant a criminal conviction . " in this criminal process it is not up to the court to make management decisions or moral or ethical judgements , " said koppenhöfer on thursday .
" we are not judging german corporate culture although the evidence we saw was puzzling at times . " big bonuses all were accused , to varying degrees , of wrongdoing , when they approved 111.5 million deutsche marks -lrb- $ 71 million -rrb- in bonuses to management board members during the multi-billion-euro takeover of mannesmann by british mobile phone giant vodafone in 2000 .
esser alone pocketed more than € 15 million . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus esser and josef ackermann prosecutors had argued that the size of the payouts clearly went against the interests of both mannesmann and its shareholders and were therefore illegal under german share law .
they called for a jail sentence of two years with probation for deutsche bank chairman ackermann and wanted a two-and-a-half-year prison sentence without parole for former mannesmann chairman esser . judge koppenhföer did rule that the payment to esser broke corporate law because it came after the sale of the company to vodafone . " additional remuneration for esser equals double pay , " she said .
" there was no benefit for mannesmann to pay him for this integration period into vodafone . " common elsewhere the defendants had argued that such large payments are common practice in other countries such as the united states and that sanctioning the executives would discourage any bold decision-making in german companies in future . the blockbuster trial began on january 21 , and the head of germany 's biggest bank was required to spend two days every week in court .
some 55 witnesses were heard during a total 37 days in court . on the very first day , ackermann , who has spent around € 1.9 million on his defense , sparked widespread anger by making the " v " victory sign as he entered the court .
but even after his acquittal , the trial will have hurt the image of ackermann 's bank , already scratched after a series of pr mishaps , such as deutsche bank 's bungled handling of the flotation of postbank and a lawsuit lodged by former client and one-time media magnate , leo kirch . " i am extraordinarily grateful that the court sees the situation the way we have always presented it , " a relieved ackermann told reporters on thursday . but prosecutors could still decide to appeal the verdict to a higher court , which could cause the saga to drag on for years . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trying germany 's business elite a verdict is expected this week in germany 's most-watched business trial : top executives , including the head of deutsche bank , are accused of approving astronomical severance packages .

begun in august 2000 , the program hoped to attract 20,000 highly skilled workers to the country in three years .
but by the end of that time , only 14,000 foreign workers had taken advantage of the visa project - 4,000 of them were from india .
many complained that the program was overly bureaucratic .
time limitations on the work visas as well as restrictions on bringing family members over dampened the enthusiasm of many . " it 's easier for a terrorist to get asylum in germany than it is for a foreign software expert to enter the german labor market , " one indian computer specialist told fischer during the meeting in bombay . fischer assured the audience that new immigrations laws to take effect in january would change that . pushing business ties the foreign minister also did some campaigning for germany as a location for industry , saying that his country 's highly developed infrastructure and location in the middle of the european union made for " excellent conditions " for foreign companies . he also appealed to german companies to take advantage of " the enormous opportunities " offered by the indian market and announced a visit this fall by chancellor gerhard schröder , who will be accompanied by a large business delegation .
fischer called on india to cut some of its red tape in order to improve its attractiveness to foreign investors . he praised progress in the peace process with india 's long-time rival pakistan , saying a lasting peace between the neighbors was important to convince investors that the region was a profitable and secure place to do business . on wednesday night , fischer flew to pakistan for a two-day visit there .

outlining his goals for his country 's six-month eu presidency before the european parliament , dutch premier jan-peter balkenende has called for fairness in deciding whether to start accession talks with turkey . speaking before the newly elected parliament in strasbourg on wednesday , the christian democrat said eu countries must not be guided by a fear of islam when deciding about the bloc 's future relationship with turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende " resistance towards a religion is not consistent european values , " balkenende said . "
our resistance has to be focussed on people who abuse worshipping god to propagate violence . " in december , eu leaders will decide whether turkey meets the political and economic criteria to begin negotiations towards joining the bloc at some point in the future .
that process is expected to take at least 10 years . balkenende said turkey 's readiness for negotiations should be judged honestly but strictly on the existing criteria of human rights , democracy and the rule of law without inventing new conditions . refuting bin laden martin schulz , the leader of the european socialists , agreed with balkenende .
he added that the eu had raised turkey 's hopes to join the union and could not switch gears at this point . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin schulz " islam is n't the problem , " schulz -lrb- photo -rrb- said .

outlining his goals for his country 's six-month eu presidency before the european parliament , dutch premier jan-peter balkenende has called for fairness in deciding whether to start accession talks with turkey . speaking before the newly elected parliament in strasbourg on wednesday , the christian democrat said eu countries must not be guided by a fear of islam when deciding about the bloc 's future relationship with turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende " resistance towards a religion is not consistent european values , " balkenende said .

413 of the legislature 's 732 members voted for him . eu leaders agreed on barroso in june as a compromise candidate to replace outgoing commission president romano prodi .
barroso has since embarked on a charm offensive to win over the various factions of the european parliament .
on wednesday , the day before the vote , he summarized his plans for the new executive . barroso headed a conservative government in portugal , and many socialist and green meps are still skeptical about his efforts to present himself as an unbiased , centrist reformer . “ i will not be the president of the right against the left , or the left against the right , that i can promise you , ” he said . but barroso ’ s assertive campaign , conducted in fluent french , portuguese and english , has convinced others to support the commission ’ s candidate .
when barroso ’ s nomination was announced , irish premier bertie ahern gave him his enthusiastic backing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president romano prodi , right , and bertie ahern “ jose manuel durao barroso has the qualities that are needed for a strong and independent commission in these times , " ahern -lrb- photo , left -rrb- said .
" i know that he will lead the commission with strength , vigour , and vision . ” explaining the eu to its citizens following record low voter turnouts in the recent european elections , one of barroso ’ s key concerns is the need for eu institutions to do a better job of explaining their policies to european citizens .
he also told the european parliament that he hopes to act as a bridge between old and new eu members , as well as between the richer and poorer countries , and urged meps to confirm him in his candidacy . bildunterschrift : general view of the newly elected european parliament “ i need your support - not only personal support to me but support to the commission , " he said .
" because we need in this moment of europe , we need a strong , credible , independent commission , and the only way to have a strong commission , to say sometimes no to some member states , is to have the strong backing of the european parliament . ” “ no ” has been durao barroso 's response to leaders who have called for the rewriting of the european growth and stability pact , which ensures the stability of europe 's common currency , the euro . on wednesday he referred only to the need to ensure both flexibility and monetary stability , but he has previously stated his belief that the eu ’ s budgetary limitations , which are being broken with virtual impunity by germany , france and italy , should be respected .
guiding the eu constitution towards ratification is also one of his priorities . from maoist to war supporter a former maoist student activist under the portuguese dictatorship of antonio salazar , barroso ’ s politics shifted to the right after the restoration of democracy in 1974 .
he won his first senior government post at the age of just 29 , and had seven years later he had already served as foreign minister .
in 1999 he took over the leadership of his conservative social democratic party , winning the election in 2002 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. president george bush , center , british prime minister tony blair , second from left , and spain 's prime minister jose maria aznar , right , seen together with portugal 's prime minister jose manuel durao barroso , left , after arriving in the azores march 16 , 2003 to attend a summit to discuss the crisis with iraq barroso supported the us-led war on iraq , a decision for which he has been heavily criticized both in his own country and abroad , and one he defended in recent days as one of the most difficult of his life .
the crisis sparked by his resignation as portuguese prime minister in june now appears to have been resolved by the appointment of his successor , pedro santana lopes . his own master barroso insists that , as commission president , he will be his own master .
he backed this up on wednesday by indicating that he would not bow to pressure from germany to appoint a “ super-commissioner ” for economic policy ´ , a position it wants for its current enlargement commissioner , günther verheugen . “ in a commission led by me there will be no first- or second-class commissioners , ” barroso said . susan houlton -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de barroso snubs german call for eu super-commissioner european commission president-designate jose barroso rebuffed wednesday german plans for an economic " super-commissioner " in the new eu executive he is expected to head .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 22.07.2004 all acquitted in mannesmann trial großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trial centered on vodafone 's takeover of mannesmann deutsche bank chairman josef ackermann and five other co-defendants were found not guilty of the charges of breach of trust in the so-called mannesmann trial , a düsseldorf court ruled on thursday . ackermann , former mannesmann chairman klaus esser , mannesmann 's former supervisory board chief joachim funk , the former head of the powerful ig metall trade union , klaus zwickel , and two others , were found not guilty of any wrongdoing in the blockbuster corporate trial . all were accused of approving millions of euros in severance packages for mannesmann 's top executives after british competitor vodafone took over the company .
the case has been seen as putting german corporate governance in the dock . the presiding judge , brigitte koppenhföer , already said in a preliminary assessment half-way through the trial in march that while the actions of ackermann and his five co-defendants may have breached german stock law - which would be a civil matter - they were not serious enough to warrant a criminal conviction . " in this criminal process it is not up to the court to make management decisions or moral or ethical judgements , " said koppenhöfer on thursday .
" we are not judging german corporate culture although the evidence we saw was puzzling at times . " big bonuses all were accused , to varying degrees , of wrongdoing , when they approved 111.5 million deutsche marks -lrb- $ 71 million -rrb- in bonuses to management board members during the multi-billion-euro takeover of mannesmann by british mobile phone giant vodafone in 2000 .
esser alone pocketed more than € 15 million . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus esser and josef ackermann prosecutors had argued that the size of the payouts clearly went against the interests of both mannesmann and its shareholders and were therefore illegal under german share law .
they called for a jail sentence of two years with probation for deutsche bank chairman ackermann and wanted a two-and-a-half-year prison sentence without parole for former mannesmann chairman esser . judge koppenhföer did rule that the payment to esser broke corporate law because it came after the sale of the company to vodafone . " additional remuneration for esser equals double pay , " she said .
" there was no benefit for mannesmann to pay him for this integration period into vodafone . " common elsewhere the defendants had argued that such large payments are common practice in other countries such as the united states and that sanctioning the executives would discourage any bold decision-making in german companies in future . the blockbuster trial began on january 21 , and the head of germany 's biggest bank was required to spend two days every week in court .
some 55 witnesses were heard during a total 37 days in court . on the very first day , ackermann , who has spent around € 1.9 million on his defense , sparked widespread anger by making the " v " victory sign as he entered the court .
but even after his acquittal , the trial will have hurt the image of ackermann 's bank , already scratched after a series of pr mishaps , such as deutsche bank 's bungled handling of the flotation of postbank and a lawsuit lodged by former client and one-time media magnate , leo kirch . " i am extraordinarily grateful that the court sees the situation the way we have always presented it , " a relieved ackermann told reporters on thursday . but prosecutors could still decide to appeal the verdict to a higher court , which could cause the saga to drag on for years . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trying germany 's business elite a verdict is expected this week in germany 's most-watched business trial : top executives , including the head of deutsche bank , are accused of approving astronomical severance packages .

the case has been seen as putting german corporate governance in the dock . the presiding judge , brigitte koppenhföer , already said in a preliminary assessment half-way through the trial in march that while the actions of ackermann and his five co-defendants may have breached german stock law - which would be a civil matter - they were not serious enough to warrant a criminal conviction . " in this criminal process it is not up to the court to make management decisions or moral or ethical judgements , " said koppenhöfer on thursday .
" we are not judging german corporate culture although the evidence we saw was puzzling at times . " big bonuses all were accused , to varying degrees , of wrongdoing , when they approved 111.5 million deutsche marks -lrb- $ 71 million -rrb- in bonuses to management board members during the multi-billion-euro takeover of mannesmann by british mobile phone giant vodafone in 2000 .
esser alone pocketed more than € 15 million . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus esser and josef ackermann prosecutors had argued that the size of the payouts clearly went against the interests of both mannesmann and its shareholders and were therefore illegal under german share law .
they called for a jail sentence of two years with probation for deutsche bank chairman ackermann and wanted a two-and-a-half-year prison sentence without parole for former mannesmann chairman esser . judge koppenhföer did rule that the payment to esser broke corporate law because it came after the sale of the company to vodafone . " additional remuneration for esser equals double pay , " she said .
" there was no benefit for mannesmann to pay him for this integration period into vodafone . " common elsewhere the defendants had argued that such large payments are common practice in other countries such as the united states and that sanctioning the executives would discourage any bold decision-making in german companies in future . the blockbuster trial began on january 21 , and the head of germany 's biggest bank was required to spend two days every week in court .
some 55 witnesses were heard during a total 37 days in court . on the very first day , ackermann , who has spent around € 1.9 million on his defense , sparked widespread anger by making the " v " victory sign as he entered the court .
but even after his acquittal , the trial will have hurt the image of ackermann 's bank , already scratched after a series of pr mishaps , such as deutsche bank 's bungled handling of the flotation of postbank and a lawsuit lodged by former client and one-time media magnate , leo kirch . " i am extraordinarily grateful that the court sees the situation the way we have always presented it , " a relieved ackermann told reporters on thursday . but prosecutors could still decide to appeal the verdict to a higher court , which could cause the saga to drag on for years . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trying germany 's business elite a verdict is expected this week in germany 's most-watched business trial : top executives , including the head of deutsche bank , are accused of approving astronomical severance packages .

speculation is growing that former star striker jürgen klinsmann will take over the vacant coaching job for germany 's national soccer team .
he would lead the squad into the 2006 world cup being held in germany . the president of the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- , gerhard mayer-vorfelder , held talks with klinsmann in new york on tuesday " to discuss the future planning for staffing of the national team , " a dfb spokesman said on wednesday . although it was not yet certain klinsmann would take over from rudi völler , who resigned last month after germany 's miserable euro 2004 campaign , he expressed his desire to help the national team get back on its feet . " the world cup is the most important sporting event of the past 40 years in germany .
it 's obvious that i 'll help the dfb , independently of the post , " klinsmann said . the 39-year-old former vfb stuttgart , inter milan and tottenham star , who won the world cup in 1990 , currently runs a sports marketing company in california .
he holds a training license but does not have any professional coaching experience . bierhoff as manager but according to media reports , klinsmann was now the frontrunner for the top coaching spot and another former star striker , oliver bierhoff , is set to fill the newly created position of team manager .
bierhoff , who is known to be a close friend of klinsmann , has already expressed his interest working with him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soccer star oliver bierhoff " if jürgen will agree to be coach , then i can imagine the job will be a lot of fun - that would be a good model , " bierhoff said according to the associated press . klinsmann has also been a vocal critic of the dfb 's recent disorganization and bumbling in trying to find a replacement for völler .
after ex-bayern munich coach ottmar hitzfeld balked at taking the job , german soccer officials have flailed about embarrassingly in their search . euro 2004-winning greece coach otto rehhagel said he 'd serve out his contract with the greeks and the dfb has been reluctant to sign a foreign coach like dutchman guus hiddink and dane morten olsen . most observers believe a klinsmann-bierhoff tandem would be an elegant solution , which would represent a fresh start for the national squad .

outlining his goals for his country 's six-month eu presidency before the european parliament , dutch premier jan-peter balkenende has called for fairness in deciding whether to start accession talks with turkey . speaking before the newly elected parliament in strasbourg on wednesday , the christian democrat said eu countries must not be guided by a fear of islam when deciding about the bloc 's future relationship with turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende " resistance towards a religion is not consistent european values , " balkenende said . "
our resistance has to be focussed on people who abuse worshipping god to propagate violence . " in december , eu leaders will decide whether turkey meets the political and economic criteria to begin negotiations towards joining the bloc at some point in the future .
that process is expected to take at least 10 years . balkenende said turkey 's readiness for negotiations should be judged honestly but strictly on the existing criteria of human rights , democracy and the rule of law without inventing new conditions . refuting bin laden martin schulz , the leader of the european socialists , agreed with balkenende .
he added that the eu had raised turkey 's hopes to join the union and could not switch gears at this point . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin schulz " islam is n't the problem , " schulz -lrb- photo -rrb- said .
" if it were possible to show that western values and an islamic society are not mutually exclusive , the arguments of the world 's bin ladens would be refuted .
the increase in the level of security that europe could gain from this should not be dismissed lightly . " but hans-gert pöttering , schulz 's political opponent as leader of the conservatives in the european parliament , said that the union should offer turkey a special partnership but not full membership . france is on the fence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan earlier this week , turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan -lrb- photo -rrb- visited france to lobby for paris to support turkey 's accession to the eu . french president jacques chirac on tuesday reaffirmed his support for turkey 's eventual membership of the european union , without specifying any time frame . according to a chirac aide , the president said that " turkey 's integration into the eu is welcome as soon as it becomes possible ... turkey has made considerable progress .
it must continue and intensify the implementation of democratic and economic reforms . " chirac has previously said he believes the path to turkish membership is " irreversible , " but he is at odds with many in his own union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- party and the public who believe the predominantly muslim country has no place in the club of 25 . the debate over turkey 's right to join the eu has been particularly robust in france , where there is strong opposition both from those who fear its implications for immigration and europe 's cultural heritage , and those who say it will mean the end of their vision for a politically integrated continent . abstention rather than opposition ? the nationalist leader philippe de villiers on tuesday condemned erdogan 's visit and what he described as chirac 's " determination " to see turkey join the eu .
he said he would ensure turkey 's membership is at the " heart of the debate " ahead of next year 's planned referendum on the eu constitution . as britain , germany and spain already lean towards supporting commencing negotiations with turkey , some think that it 's unlikely that france would block such a step . " france will either fight for the opening of negotiations or abstain , because it does n't want to oppose the main european countries which have already come out clearly in favor , " didier billion , an expert on turkey and the deputy director of the paris-based institute for international and strategic relations , told reuters news agency .

413 of the legislature 's 732 members voted for him . eu leaders agreed on barroso in june as a compromise candidate to replace outgoing commission president romano prodi .
barroso has since embarked on a charm offensive to win over the various factions of the european parliament .
on wednesday , the day before the vote , he summarized his plans for the new executive . barroso headed a conservative government in portugal , and many socialist and green meps are still skeptical about his efforts to present himself as an unbiased , centrist reformer . “ i will not be the president of the right against the left , or the left against the right , that i can promise you , ” he said . but barroso ’ s assertive campaign , conducted in fluent french , portuguese and english , has convinced others to support the commission ’ s candidate .
when barroso ’ s nomination was announced , irish premier bertie ahern gave him his enthusiastic backing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president romano prodi , right , and bertie ahern “ jose manuel durao barroso has the qualities that are needed for a strong and independent commission in these times , " ahern -lrb- photo , left -rrb- said .
" i know that he will lead the commission with strength , vigour , and vision . ” explaining the eu to its citizens following record low voter turnouts in the recent european elections , one of barroso ’ s key concerns is the need for eu institutions to do a better job of explaining their policies to european citizens .
he also told the european parliament that he hopes to act as a bridge between old and new eu members , as well as between the richer and poorer countries , and urged meps to confirm him in his candidacy . bildunterschrift : general view of the newly elected european parliament “ i need your support - not only personal support to me but support to the commission , " he said .
" because we need in this moment of europe , we need a strong , credible , independent commission , and the only way to have a strong commission , to say sometimes no to some member states , is to have the strong backing of the european parliament . ” “ no ” has been durao barroso 's response to leaders who have called for the rewriting of the european growth and stability pact , which ensures the stability of europe 's common currency , the euro . on wednesday he referred only to the need to ensure both flexibility and monetary stability , but he has previously stated his belief that the eu ’ s budgetary limitations , which are being broken with virtual impunity by germany , france and italy , should be respected .
guiding the eu constitution towards ratification is also one of his priorities . from maoist to war supporter a former maoist student activist under the portuguese dictatorship of antonio salazar , barroso ’ s politics shifted to the right after the restoration of democracy in 1974 .
he won his first senior government post at the age of just 29 , and had seven years later he had already served as foreign minister .
in 1999 he took over the leadership of his conservative social democratic party , winning the election in 2002 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. president george bush , center , british prime minister tony blair , second from left , and spain 's prime minister jose maria aznar , right , seen together with portugal 's prime minister jose manuel durao barroso , left , after arriving in the azores march 16 , 2003 to attend a summit to discuss the crisis with iraq barroso supported the us-led war on iraq , a decision for which he has been heavily criticized both in his own country and abroad , and one he defended in recent days as one of the most difficult of his life .
the crisis sparked by his resignation as portuguese prime minister in june now appears to have been resolved by the appointment of his successor , pedro santana lopes . his own master barroso insists that , as commission president , he will be his own master .
he backed this up on wednesday by indicating that he would not bow to pressure from germany to appoint a “ super-commissioner ” for economic policy ´ , a position it wants for its current enlargement commissioner , günther verheugen . “ in a commission led by me there will be no first- or second-class commissioners , ” barroso said . susan houlton -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de barroso snubs german call for eu super-commissioner european commission president-designate jose barroso rebuffed wednesday german plans for an economic " super-commissioner " in the new eu executive he is expected to head .

using the threat of moving jobs abroad as a bargaining chip to get labor concessions is becoming popular amongst german companies .
but there 's more to outsourcing than the heated political debate it 's created . shifting jobs to low-wage countries to save costs is n't a particularly new phenomenon to germany .
but in recent months it has become an extremely sensitive topic in a country plagued by chronically high unemployment .
german chancellor gerhard schröder even called corporate outsourcing efforts " unpatriotic " this spring . " in the mid-1990s there was a wave of moving manufacturing jobs out of the country , " dr stephan wimmers from the german chamber of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- told dw-world .
" but now germany is also losing its advantage for better quality and capital-intensive jobs . " part of the new scrutiny of outsourcing began this spring when germany ’ s low-wage eastern neighbors poland and the czech republic finally joined the european union .
but a full-blown nationwide debate on the issue started in earnest in june , after electronics giant siemens convinced german workers that 2,000 jobs would be moved to hungary unless they moved from a 35-hour to a 40-hour workweek without added pay . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes c-class that encouraged several big companies to follow suit with similar offshoring threats .
carmaker daimlerchrysler is currently in talks with workers over the fate of 6,000 positions at its plant in sindelfingen near stuttgart .
unless it saves € 500 million in annual labor costs , daimlerchrysler has said it will move production of its mercedes c-class to cheaper sites in bremen and south africa . but whereas in germany offshoring has become synonymous for any attempt to move jobs abroad , in the united states and britain it frequently refers more specifically to outsourcing customer service call centers and it positions to cheaper facilities overseas . lagging behind that type of classic outsourcing has been slow to take off in germany , stymied by the country 's restrictive labor laws , language issues and the conservative nature of germany 's corporate culture . “ compared to us and uk companies , german interest in outsourcing has been much smaller , ” said andrew parker , an analyst for technology consultancy forrester .
although that was beginning to change , he said german offshoring was developing its own special focus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wipro employees undergo training in the use of specialized software to provide services to overseas clients at the company in bangalore , india .
india remains the dominant outsourcing destination for british and american firms , partly due to the high number of proficient english speakers there .
plenty of german companies also farm out it jobs and other back-office tasks to " offshore " indian operations , but parker said germany was looking more to " nearshore " central and eastern europe for many of its outsourcing needs . although it was more expensive than asia , parker said german clients appeared willing to pay a premium for geographic proximity and german language skills .
“ there are russian firms that still have a strong reservoir of german speaking developers in moscow and st. petersburg that they can tap into as needed , ” parker said . the benefits of language are obvious , but sometimes the " nearshore " helps facilitate " offshore " activities .
for example , us outsourcing giant eds each day ships truckloads of paper documents from clients in germany to its operations in nearby hungary so they can be scanned into the company ’ s database , thereby allowing the information to be processed electronically elsewhere around the world . creating jobs in germany however , offshoring is n't quite as simple as just siphoning off jobs to low-wage countries in eastern europe and asia .
surprisingly , it is also leading to more positions inside germany , at least for outsourcing companies . " we want to hire a lot of people locally , " debjit chaudhuri , head the german division of indian software and services outsourcing specialist infosys technologies , told dw-world . chaudhuri said he needed to expand his 200-person office near frankfurt in order to take advantage of corporate germany 's increasing appetite for outsourcing .
the burgeoning workload also means infosys is training people in india to become familiar with german culture . " they can ’ t all be in germany but they need to know how it is here .
the whole idea is to be as german as possible , " he said . marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de daimlerchrysler board may take salary cut to help defuse a growing labor dispute over longer working hours for employees , top managers at carmaker daimlerchrysler appear ready to accept large salary cuts .

using the threat of moving jobs abroad as a bargaining chip to get labor concessions is becoming popular amongst german companies .
but there 's more to outsourcing than the heated political debate it 's created . shifting jobs to low-wage countries to save costs is n't a particularly new phenomenon to germany .

" but now germany is also losing its advantage for better quality and capital-intensive jobs . " part of the new scrutiny of outsourcing began this spring when germany ’ s low-wage eastern neighbors poland and the czech republic finally joined the european union .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 22.07.2004 all acquitted in mannesmann trial großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trial centered on vodafone 's takeover of mannesmann deutsche bank chairman josef ackermann and five other co-defendants were found not guilty of the charges of breach of trust in the so-called mannesmann trial , a düsseldorf court ruled on thursday . ackermann , former mannesmann chairman klaus esser , mannesmann 's former supervisory board chief joachim funk , the former head of the powerful ig metall trade union , klaus zwickel , and two others , were found not guilty of any wrongdoing in the blockbuster corporate trial . all were accused of approving millions of euros in severance packages for mannesmann 's top executives after british competitor vodafone took over the company .
the case has been seen as putting german corporate governance in the dock . the presiding judge , brigitte koppenhföer , already said in a preliminary assessment half-way through the trial in march that while the actions of ackermann and his five co-defendants may have breached german stock law - which would be a civil matter - they were not serious enough to warrant a criminal conviction . " in this criminal process it is not up to the court to make management decisions or moral or ethical judgements , " said koppenhöfer on thursday .
" we are not judging german corporate culture although the evidence we saw was puzzling at times . " big bonuses all were accused , to varying degrees , of wrongdoing , when they approved 111.5 million deutsche marks -lrb- $ 71 million -rrb- in bonuses to management board members during the multi-billion-euro takeover of mannesmann by british mobile phone giant vodafone in 2000 .
esser alone pocketed more than € 15 million . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus esser and josef ackermann prosecutors had argued that the size of the payouts clearly went against the interests of both mannesmann and its shareholders and were therefore illegal under german share law .
they called for a jail sentence of two years with probation for deutsche bank chairman ackermann and wanted a two-and-a-half-year prison sentence without parole for former mannesmann chairman esser . judge koppenhföer did rule that the payment to esser broke corporate law because it came after the sale of the company to vodafone . " additional remuneration for esser equals double pay , " she said .
" there was no benefit for mannesmann to pay him for this integration period into vodafone . " common elsewhere the defendants had argued that such large payments are common practice in other countries such as the united states and that sanctioning the executives would discourage any bold decision-making in german companies in future . the blockbuster trial began on january 21 , and the head of germany 's biggest bank was required to spend two days every week in court .
some 55 witnesses were heard during a total 37 days in court . on the very first day , ackermann , who has spent around € 1.9 million on his defense , sparked widespread anger by making the " v " victory sign as he entered the court .
but even after his acquittal , the trial will have hurt the image of ackermann 's bank , already scratched after a series of pr mishaps , such as deutsche bank 's bungled handling of the flotation of postbank and a lawsuit lodged by former client and one-time media magnate , leo kirch . " i am extraordinarily grateful that the court sees the situation the way we have always presented it , " a relieved ackermann told reporters on thursday . but prosecutors could still decide to appeal the verdict to a higher court , which could cause the saga to drag on for years . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trying germany 's business elite a verdict is expected this week in germany 's most-watched business trial : top executives , including the head of deutsche bank , are accused of approving astronomical severance packages .

the case has been seen as putting german corporate governance in the dock . the presiding judge , brigitte koppenhföer , already said in a preliminary assessment half-way through the trial in march that while the actions of ackermann and his five co-defendants may have breached german stock law - which would be a civil matter - they were not serious enough to warrant a criminal conviction .

using the threat of moving jobs abroad as a bargaining chip to get labor concessions is becoming popular amongst german companies .
but there 's more to outsourcing than the heated political debate it 's created . shifting jobs to low-wage countries to save costs is n't a particularly new phenomenon to germany .
but in recent months it has become an extremely sensitive topic in a country plagued by chronically high unemployment .
german chancellor gerhard schröder even called corporate outsourcing efforts " unpatriotic " this spring . " in the mid-1990s there was a wave of moving manufacturing jobs out of the country , " dr stephan wimmers from the german chamber of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- told dw-world .
" but now germany is also losing its advantage for better quality and capital-intensive jobs . " part of the new scrutiny of outsourcing began this spring when germany ’ s low-wage eastern neighbors poland and the czech republic finally joined the european union .
but a full-blown nationwide debate on the issue started in earnest in june , after electronics giant siemens convinced german workers that 2,000 jobs would be moved to hungary unless they moved from a 35-hour to a 40-hour workweek without added pay . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes c-class that encouraged several big companies to follow suit with similar offshoring threats .
carmaker daimlerchrysler is currently in talks with workers over the fate of 6,000 positions at its plant in sindelfingen near stuttgart .
unless it saves € 500 million in annual labor costs , daimlerchrysler has said it will move production of its mercedes c-class to cheaper sites in bremen and south africa . but whereas in germany offshoring has become synonymous for any attempt to move jobs abroad , in the united states and britain it frequently refers more specifically to outsourcing customer service call centers and it positions to cheaper facilities overseas . lagging behind that type of classic outsourcing has been slow to take off in germany , stymied by the country 's restrictive labor laws , language issues and the conservative nature of germany 's corporate culture . “ compared to us and uk companies , german interest in outsourcing has been much smaller , ” said andrew parker , an analyst for technology consultancy forrester .
although that was beginning to change , he said german offshoring was developing its own special focus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wipro employees undergo training in the use of specialized software to provide services to overseas clients at the company in bangalore , india .
india remains the dominant outsourcing destination for british and american firms , partly due to the high number of proficient english speakers there .
plenty of german companies also farm out it jobs and other back-office tasks to " offshore " indian operations , but parker said germany was looking more to " nearshore " central and eastern europe for many of its outsourcing needs . although it was more expensive than asia , parker said german clients appeared willing to pay a premium for geographic proximity and german language skills .
“ there are russian firms that still have a strong reservoir of german speaking developers in moscow and st. petersburg that they can tap into as needed , ” parker said . the benefits of language are obvious , but sometimes the " nearshore " helps facilitate " offshore " activities .
for example , us outsourcing giant eds each day ships truckloads of paper documents from clients in germany to its operations in nearby hungary so they can be scanned into the company ’ s database , thereby allowing the information to be processed electronically elsewhere around the world . creating jobs in germany however , offshoring is n't quite as simple as just siphoning off jobs to low-wage countries in eastern europe and asia .
surprisingly , it is also leading to more positions inside germany , at least for outsourcing companies . " we want to hire a lot of people locally , " debjit chaudhuri , head the german division of indian software and services outsourcing specialist infosys technologies , told dw-world . chaudhuri said he needed to expand his 200-person office near frankfurt in order to take advantage of corporate germany 's increasing appetite for outsourcing .
the burgeoning workload also means infosys is training people in india to become familiar with german culture . " they can ’ t all be in germany but they need to know how it is here .

using the threat of moving jobs abroad as a bargaining chip to get labor concessions is becoming popular amongst german companies .
but there 's more to outsourcing than the heated political debate it 's created . shifting jobs to low-wage countries to save costs is n't a particularly new phenomenon to germany .
but in recent months it has become an extremely sensitive topic in a country plagued by chronically high unemployment .
german chancellor gerhard schröder even called corporate outsourcing efforts " unpatriotic " this spring . " in the mid-1990s there was a wave of moving manufacturing jobs out of the country , " dr stephan wimmers from the german chamber of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- told dw-world .
" but now germany is also losing its advantage for better quality and capital-intensive jobs . " part of the new scrutiny of outsourcing began this spring when germany ’ s low-wage eastern neighbors poland and the czech republic finally joined the european union .
but a full-blown nationwide debate on the issue started in earnest in june , after electronics giant siemens convinced german workers that 2,000 jobs would be moved to hungary unless they moved from a 35-hour to a 40-hour workweek without added pay . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes c-class that encouraged several big companies to follow suit with similar offshoring threats .
carmaker daimlerchrysler is currently in talks with workers over the fate of 6,000 positions at its plant in sindelfingen near stuttgart .
unless it saves € 500 million in annual labor costs , daimlerchrysler has said it will move production of its mercedes c-class to cheaper sites in bremen and south africa . but whereas in germany offshoring has become synonymous for any attempt to move jobs abroad , in the united states and britain it frequently refers more specifically to outsourcing customer service call centers and it positions to cheaper facilities overseas . lagging behind that type of classic outsourcing has been slow to take off in germany , stymied by the country 's restrictive labor laws , language issues and the conservative nature of germany 's corporate culture . “ compared to us and uk companies , german interest in outsourcing has been much smaller , ” said andrew parker , an analyst for technology consultancy forrester .
although that was beginning to change , he said german offshoring was developing its own special focus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wipro employees undergo training in the use of specialized software to provide services to overseas clients at the company in bangalore , india .
india remains the dominant outsourcing destination for british and american firms , partly due to the high number of proficient english speakers there .
plenty of german companies also farm out it jobs and other back-office tasks to " offshore " indian operations , but parker said germany was looking more to " nearshore " central and eastern europe for many of its outsourcing needs . although it was more expensive than asia , parker said german clients appeared willing to pay a premium for geographic proximity and german language skills .
“ there are russian firms that still have a strong reservoir of german speaking developers in moscow and st. petersburg that they can tap into as needed , ” parker said . the benefits of language are obvious , but sometimes the " nearshore " helps facilitate " offshore " activities .
for example , us outsourcing giant eds each day ships truckloads of paper documents from clients in germany to its operations in nearby hungary so they can be scanned into the company ’ s database , thereby allowing the information to be processed electronically elsewhere around the world . creating jobs in germany however , offshoring is n't quite as simple as just siphoning off jobs to low-wage countries in eastern europe and asia .
surprisingly , it is also leading to more positions inside germany , at least for outsourcing companies . " we want to hire a lot of people locally , " debjit chaudhuri , head the german division of indian software and services outsourcing specialist infosys technologies , told dw-world . chaudhuri said he needed to expand his 200-person office near frankfurt in order to take advantage of corporate germany 's increasing appetite for outsourcing .
the burgeoning workload also means infosys is training people in india to become familiar with german culture . " they can ’ t all be in germany but they need to know how it is here .
the whole idea is to be as german as possible , " he said . marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de daimlerchrysler board may take salary cut to help defuse a growing labor dispute over longer working hours for employees , top managers at carmaker daimlerchrysler appear ready to accept large salary cuts .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 22.07.2004 all acquitted in mannesmann trial großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trial centered on vodafone 's takeover of mannesmann deutsche bank chairman josef ackermann and five other co-defendants were found not guilty of the charges of breach of trust in the so-called mannesmann trial , a düsseldorf court ruled on thursday . ackermann , former mannesmann chairman klaus esser , mannesmann 's former supervisory board chief joachim funk , the former head of the powerful ig metall trade union , klaus zwickel , and two others , were found not guilty of any wrongdoing in the blockbuster corporate trial . all were accused of approving millions of euros in severance packages for mannesmann 's top executives after british competitor vodafone took over the company .
the case has been seen as putting german corporate governance in the dock . the presiding judge , brigitte koppenhföer , already said in a preliminary assessment half-way through the trial in march that while the actions of ackermann and his five co-defendants may have breached german stock law - which would be a civil matter - they were not serious enough to warrant a criminal conviction . " in this criminal process it is not up to the court to make management decisions or moral or ethical judgements , " said koppenhöfer on thursday .
" we are not judging german corporate culture although the evidence we saw was puzzling at times . " big bonuses all were accused , to varying degrees , of wrongdoing , when they approved 111.5 million deutsche marks -lrb- $ 71 million -rrb- in bonuses to management board members during the multi-billion-euro takeover of mannesmann by british mobile phone giant vodafone in 2000 .
esser alone pocketed more than € 15 million . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus esser and josef ackermann prosecutors had argued that the size of the payouts clearly went against the interests of both mannesmann and its shareholders and were therefore illegal under german share law .
they called for a jail sentence of two years with probation for deutsche bank chairman ackermann and wanted a two-and-a-half-year prison sentence without parole for former mannesmann chairman esser . judge koppenhföer did rule that the payment to esser broke corporate law because it came after the sale of the company to vodafone . " additional remuneration for esser equals double pay , " she said .
" there was no benefit for mannesmann to pay him for this integration period into vodafone . " common elsewhere the defendants had argued that such large payments are common practice in other countries such as the united states and that sanctioning the executives would discourage any bold decision-making in german companies in future . the blockbuster trial began on january 21 , and the head of germany 's biggest bank was required to spend two days every week in court .
some 55 witnesses were heard during a total 37 days in court . on the very first day , ackermann , who has spent around € 1.9 million on his defense , sparked widespread anger by making the " v " victory sign as he entered the court .
but even after his acquittal , the trial will have hurt the image of ackermann 's bank , already scratched after a series of pr mishaps , such as deutsche bank 's bungled handling of the flotation of postbank and a lawsuit lodged by former client and one-time media magnate , leo kirch . " i am extraordinarily grateful that the court sees the situation the way we have always presented it , " a relieved ackermann told reporters on thursday . but prosecutors could still decide to appeal the verdict to a higher court , which could cause the saga to drag on for years . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trying germany 's business elite a verdict is expected this week in germany 's most-watched business trial : top executives , including the head of deutsche bank , are accused of approving astronomical severance packages .

outlining his goals for his country 's six-month eu presidency before the european parliament , dutch premier jan-peter balkenende has called for fairness in deciding whether to start accession talks with turkey . speaking before the newly elected parliament in strasbourg on wednesday , the christian democrat said eu countries must not be guided by a fear of islam when deciding about the bloc 's future relationship with turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende " resistance towards a religion is not consistent european values , " balkenende said . "
our resistance has to be focussed on people who abuse worshipping god to propagate violence . " in december , eu leaders will decide whether turkey meets the political and economic criteria to begin negotiations towards joining the bloc at some point in the future .
that process is expected to take at least 10 years . balkenende said turkey 's readiness for negotiations should be judged honestly but strictly on the existing criteria of human rights , democracy and the rule of law without inventing new conditions . refuting bin laden martin schulz , the leader of the european socialists , agreed with balkenende .
he added that the eu had raised turkey 's hopes to join the union and could not switch gears at this point . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin schulz " islam is n't the problem , " schulz -lrb- photo -rrb- said .
" if it were possible to show that western values and an islamic society are not mutually exclusive , the arguments of the world 's bin ladens would be refuted .
the increase in the level of security that europe could gain from this should not be dismissed lightly . " but hans-gert pöttering , schulz 's political opponent as leader of the conservatives in the european parliament , said that the union should offer turkey a special partnership but not full membership . france is on the fence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan earlier this week , turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan -lrb- photo -rrb- visited france to lobby for paris to support turkey 's accession to the eu . french president jacques chirac on tuesday reaffirmed his support for turkey 's eventual membership of the european union , without specifying any time frame . according to a chirac aide , the president said that " turkey 's integration into the eu is welcome as soon as it becomes possible ... turkey has made considerable progress .
it must continue and intensify the implementation of democratic and economic reforms . " chirac has previously said he believes the path to turkish membership is " irreversible , " but he is at odds with many in his own union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- party and the public who believe the predominantly muslim country has no place in the club of 25 . the debate over turkey 's right to join the eu has been particularly robust in france , where there is strong opposition both from those who fear its implications for immigration and europe 's cultural heritage , and those who say it will mean the end of their vision for a politically integrated continent . abstention rather than opposition ? the nationalist leader philippe de villiers on tuesday condemned erdogan 's visit and what he described as chirac 's " determination " to see turkey join the eu .
he said he would ensure turkey 's membership is at the " heart of the debate " ahead of next year 's planned referendum on the eu constitution . as britain , germany and spain already lean towards supporting commencing negotiations with turkey , some think that it 's unlikely that france would block such a step . " france will either fight for the opening of negotiations or abstain , because it does n't want to oppose the main european countries which have already come out clearly in favor , " didier billion , an expert on turkey and the deputy director of the paris-based institute for international and strategic relations , told reuters news agency .

speculation is growing that former star striker jürgen klinsmann will take over the vacant coaching job for germany 's national soccer team .
he would lead the squad into the 2006 world cup being held in germany . the president of the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- , gerhard mayer-vorfelder , held talks with klinsmann in new york on tuesday " to discuss the future planning for staffing of the national team , " a dfb spokesman said on wednesday . although it was not yet certain klinsmann would take over from rudi völler , who resigned last month after germany 's miserable euro 2004 campaign , he expressed his desire to help the national team get back on its feet . " the world cup is the most important sporting event of the past 40 years in germany .
it 's obvious that i 'll help the dfb , independently of the post , " klinsmann said . the 39-year-old former vfb stuttgart , inter milan and tottenham star , who won the world cup in 1990 , currently runs a sports marketing company in california .
he holds a training license but does not have any professional coaching experience . bierhoff as manager but according to media reports , klinsmann was now the frontrunner for the top coaching spot and another former star striker , oliver bierhoff , is set to fill the newly created position of team manager .
bierhoff , who is known to be a close friend of klinsmann , has already expressed his interest working with him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soccer star oliver bierhoff " if jürgen will agree to be coach , then i can imagine the job will be a lot of fun - that would be a good model , " bierhoff said according to the associated press . klinsmann has also been a vocal critic of the dfb 's recent disorganization and bumbling in trying to find a replacement for völler .
after ex-bayern munich coach ottmar hitzfeld balked at taking the job , german soccer officials have flailed about embarrassingly in their search . euro 2004-winning greece coach otto rehhagel said he 'd serve out his contract with the greeks and the dfb has been reluctant to sign a foreign coach like dutchman guus hiddink and dane morten olsen . most observers believe a klinsmann-bierhoff tandem would be an elegant solution , which would represent a fresh start for the national squad .

speculation is growing that former star striker jürgen klinsmann will take over the vacant coaching job for germany 's national soccer team .
he would lead the squad into the 2006 world cup being held in germany . the president of the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- , gerhard mayer-vorfelder , held talks with klinsmann in new york on tuesday " to discuss the future planning for staffing of the national team , " a dfb spokesman said on wednesday . although it was not yet certain klinsmann would take over from rudi völler , who resigned last month after germany 's miserable euro 2004 campaign , he expressed his desire to help the national team get back on its feet . " the world cup is the most important sporting event of the past 40 years in germany .
it 's obvious that i 'll help the dfb , independently of the post , " klinsmann said . the 39-year-old former vfb stuttgart , inter milan and tottenham star , who won the world cup in 1990 , currently runs a sports marketing company in california .
he holds a training license but does not have any professional coaching experience . bierhoff as manager but according to media reports , klinsmann was now the frontrunner for the top coaching spot and another former star striker , oliver bierhoff , is set to fill the newly created position of team manager .
bierhoff , who is known to be a close friend of klinsmann , has already expressed his interest working with him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soccer star oliver bierhoff " if jürgen will agree to be coach , then i can imagine the job will be a lot of fun - that would be a good model , " bierhoff said according to the associated press . klinsmann has also been a vocal critic of the dfb 's recent disorganization and bumbling in trying to find a replacement for völler .
after ex-bayern munich coach ottmar hitzfeld balked at taking the job , german soccer officials have flailed about embarrassingly in their search . euro 2004-winning greece coach otto rehhagel said he 'd serve out his contract with the greeks and the dfb has been reluctant to sign a foreign coach like dutchman guus hiddink and dane morten olsen . most observers believe a klinsmann-bierhoff tandem would be an elegant solution , which would represent a fresh start for the national squad .

using the threat of moving jobs abroad as a bargaining chip to get labor concessions is becoming popular amongst german companies .
but there 's more to outsourcing than the heated political debate it 's created . shifting jobs to low-wage countries to save costs is n't a particularly new phenomenon to germany .
but in recent months it has become an extremely sensitive topic in a country plagued by chronically high unemployment .
german chancellor gerhard schröder even called corporate outsourcing efforts " unpatriotic " this spring . " in the mid-1990s there was a wave of moving manufacturing jobs out of the country , " dr stephan wimmers from the german chamber of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- told dw-world .
" but now germany is also losing its advantage for better quality and capital-intensive jobs . " part of the new scrutiny of outsourcing began this spring when germany ’ s low-wage eastern neighbors poland and the czech republic finally joined the european union .
but a full-blown nationwide debate on the issue started in earnest in june , after electronics giant siemens convinced german workers that 2,000 jobs would be moved to hungary unless they moved from a 35-hour to a 40-hour workweek without added pay . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes c-class that encouraged several big companies to follow suit with similar offshoring threats .
carmaker daimlerchrysler is currently in talks with workers over the fate of 6,000 positions at its plant in sindelfingen near stuttgart .
unless it saves € 500 million in annual labor costs , daimlerchrysler has said it will move production of its mercedes c-class to cheaper sites in bremen and south africa . but whereas in germany offshoring has become synonymous for any attempt to move jobs abroad , in the united states and britain it frequently refers more specifically to outsourcing customer service call centers and it positions to cheaper facilities overseas . lagging behind that type of classic outsourcing has been slow to take off in germany , stymied by the country 's restrictive labor laws , language issues and the conservative nature of germany 's corporate culture . “ compared to us and uk companies , german interest in outsourcing has been much smaller , ” said andrew parker , an analyst for technology consultancy forrester .
although that was beginning to change , he said german offshoring was developing its own special focus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wipro employees undergo training in the use of specialized software to provide services to overseas clients at the company in bangalore , india .
india remains the dominant outsourcing destination for british and american firms , partly due to the high number of proficient english speakers there .
plenty of german companies also farm out it jobs and other back-office tasks to " offshore " indian operations , but parker said germany was looking more to " nearshore " central and eastern europe for many of its outsourcing needs . although it was more expensive than asia , parker said german clients appeared willing to pay a premium for geographic proximity and german language skills .
“ there are russian firms that still have a strong reservoir of german speaking developers in moscow and st. petersburg that they can tap into as needed , ” parker said . the benefits of language are obvious , but sometimes the " nearshore " helps facilitate " offshore " activities .
for example , us outsourcing giant eds each day ships truckloads of paper documents from clients in germany to its operations in nearby hungary so they can be scanned into the company ’ s database , thereby allowing the information to be processed electronically elsewhere around the world . creating jobs in germany however , offshoring is n't quite as simple as just siphoning off jobs to low-wage countries in eastern europe and asia .
surprisingly , it is also leading to more positions inside germany , at least for outsourcing companies . " we want to hire a lot of people locally , " debjit chaudhuri , head the german division of indian software and services outsourcing specialist infosys technologies , told dw-world . chaudhuri said he needed to expand his 200-person office near frankfurt in order to take advantage of corporate germany 's increasing appetite for outsourcing .
the burgeoning workload also means infosys is training people in india to become familiar with german culture . " they can ’ t all be in germany but they need to know how it is here .

using the threat of moving jobs abroad as a bargaining chip to get labor concessions is becoming popular amongst german companies .
but there 's more to outsourcing than the heated political debate it 's created . shifting jobs to low-wage countries to save costs is n't a particularly new phenomenon to germany .
but in recent months it has become an extremely sensitive topic in a country plagued by chronically high unemployment .
german chancellor gerhard schröder even called corporate outsourcing efforts " unpatriotic " this spring . " in the mid-1990s there was a wave of moving manufacturing jobs out of the country , " dr stephan wimmers from the german chamber of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- told dw-world .
" but now germany is also losing its advantage for better quality and capital-intensive jobs . " part of the new scrutiny of outsourcing began this spring when germany ’ s low-wage eastern neighbors poland and the czech republic finally joined the european union .
but a full-blown nationwide debate on the issue started in earnest in june , after electronics giant siemens convinced german workers that 2,000 jobs would be moved to hungary unless they moved from a 35-hour to a 40-hour workweek without added pay . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes c-class that encouraged several big companies to follow suit with similar offshoring threats .
carmaker daimlerchrysler is currently in talks with workers over the fate of 6,000 positions at its plant in sindelfingen near stuttgart .
unless it saves € 500 million in annual labor costs , daimlerchrysler has said it will move production of its mercedes c-class to cheaper sites in bremen and south africa . but whereas in germany offshoring has become synonymous for any attempt to move jobs abroad , in the united states and britain it frequently refers more specifically to outsourcing customer service call centers and it positions to cheaper facilities overseas . lagging behind that type of classic outsourcing has been slow to take off in germany , stymied by the country 's restrictive labor laws , language issues and the conservative nature of germany 's corporate culture . “ compared to us and uk companies , german interest in outsourcing has been much smaller , ” said andrew parker , an analyst for technology consultancy forrester .
although that was beginning to change , he said german offshoring was developing its own special focus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wipro employees undergo training in the use of specialized software to provide services to overseas clients at the company in bangalore , india .
india remains the dominant outsourcing destination for british and american firms , partly due to the high number of proficient english speakers there .
plenty of german companies also farm out it jobs and other back-office tasks to " offshore " indian operations , but parker said germany was looking more to " nearshore " central and eastern europe for many of its outsourcing needs . although it was more expensive than asia , parker said german clients appeared willing to pay a premium for geographic proximity and german language skills .
“ there are russian firms that still have a strong reservoir of german speaking developers in moscow and st. petersburg that they can tap into as needed , ” parker said . the benefits of language are obvious , but sometimes the " nearshore " helps facilitate " offshore " activities .
for example , us outsourcing giant eds each day ships truckloads of paper documents from clients in germany to its operations in nearby hungary so they can be scanned into the company ’ s database , thereby allowing the information to be processed electronically elsewhere around the world . creating jobs in germany however , offshoring is n't quite as simple as just siphoning off jobs to low-wage countries in eastern europe and asia .
surprisingly , it is also leading to more positions inside germany , at least for outsourcing companies . " we want to hire a lot of people locally , " debjit chaudhuri , head the german division of indian software and services outsourcing specialist infosys technologies , told dw-world . chaudhuri said he needed to expand his 200-person office near frankfurt in order to take advantage of corporate germany 's increasing appetite for outsourcing .
the burgeoning workload also means infosys is training people in india to become familiar with german culture . " they can ’ t all be in germany but they need to know how it is here .

although that was beginning to change , he said german offshoring was developing its own special focus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wipro employees undergo training in the use of specialized software to provide services to overseas clients at the company in bangalore , india .
india remains the dominant outsourcing destination for british and american firms , partly due to the high number of proficient english speakers there .
plenty of german companies also farm out it jobs and other back-office tasks to " offshore " indian operations , but parker said germany was looking more to " nearshore " central and eastern europe for many of its outsourcing needs . although it was more expensive than asia , parker said german clients appeared willing to pay a premium for geographic proximity and german language skills .
“ there are russian firms that still have a strong reservoir of german speaking developers in moscow and st. petersburg that they can tap into as needed , ” parker said . the benefits of language are obvious , but sometimes the " nearshore " helps facilitate " offshore " activities .
for example , us outsourcing giant eds each day ships truckloads of paper documents from clients in germany to its operations in nearby hungary so they can be scanned into the company ’ s database , thereby allowing the information to be processed electronically elsewhere around the world . creating jobs in germany however , offshoring is n't quite as simple as just siphoning off jobs to low-wage countries in eastern europe and asia .
surprisingly , it is also leading to more positions inside germany , at least for outsourcing companies . " we want to hire a lot of people locally , " debjit chaudhuri , head the german division of indian software and services outsourcing specialist infosys technologies , told dw-world . chaudhuri said he needed to expand his 200-person office near frankfurt in order to take advantage of corporate germany 's increasing appetite for outsourcing .
the burgeoning workload also means infosys is training people in india to become familiar with german culture . " they can ’ t all be in germany but they need to know how it is here .
the whole idea is to be as german as possible , " he said . marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de daimlerchrysler board may take salary cut to help defuse a growing labor dispute over longer working hours for employees , top managers at carmaker daimlerchrysler appear ready to accept large salary cuts .

begun in august 2000 , the program hoped to attract 20,000 highly skilled workers to the country in three years .
but by the end of that time , only 14,000 foreign workers had taken advantage of the visa project - 4,000 of them were from india .
many complained that the program was overly bureaucratic .
time limitations on the work visas as well as restrictions on bringing family members over dampened the enthusiasm of many . " it 's easier for a terrorist to get asylum in germany than it is for a foreign software expert to enter the german labor market , " one indian computer specialist told fischer during the meeting in bombay . fischer assured the audience that new immigrations laws to take effect in january would change that . pushing business ties the foreign minister also did some campaigning for germany as a location for industry , saying that his country 's highly developed infrastructure and location in the middle of the european union made for " excellent conditions " for foreign companies . he also appealed to german companies to take advantage of " the enormous opportunities " offered by the indian market and announced a visit this fall by chancellor gerhard schröder , who will be accompanied by a large business delegation .
fischer called on india to cut some of its red tape in order to improve its attractiveness to foreign investors . he praised progress in the peace process with india 's long-time rival pakistan , saying a lasting peace between the neighbors was important to convince investors that the region was a profitable and secure place to do business . on wednesday night , fischer flew to pakistan for a two-day visit there .

413 of the legislature 's 732 members voted for him . eu leaders agreed on barroso in june as a compromise candidate to replace outgoing commission president romano prodi .
barroso has since embarked on a charm offensive to win over the various factions of the european parliament .
on wednesday , the day before the vote , he summarized his plans for the new executive . barroso headed a conservative government in portugal , and many socialist and green meps are still skeptical about his efforts to present himself as an unbiased , centrist reformer . “ i will not be the president of the right against the left , or the left against the right , that i can promise you , ” he said . but barroso ’ s assertive campaign , conducted in fluent french , portuguese and english , has convinced others to support the commission ’ s candidate .
when barroso ’ s nomination was announced , irish premier bertie ahern gave him his enthusiastic backing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president romano prodi , right , and bertie ahern “ jose manuel durao barroso has the qualities that are needed for a strong and independent commission in these times , " ahern -lrb- photo , left -rrb- said .
" i know that he will lead the commission with strength , vigour , and vision . ” explaining the eu to its citizens following record low voter turnouts in the recent european elections , one of barroso ’ s key concerns is the need for eu institutions to do a better job of explaining their policies to european citizens .
he also told the european parliament that he hopes to act as a bridge between old and new eu members , as well as between the richer and poorer countries , and urged meps to confirm him in his candidacy . bildunterschrift : general view of the newly elected european parliament “ i need your support - not only personal support to me but support to the commission , " he said .
" because we need in this moment of europe , we need a strong , credible , independent commission , and the only way to have a strong commission , to say sometimes no to some member states , is to have the strong backing of the european parliament . ” “ no ” has been durao barroso 's response to leaders who have called for the rewriting of the european growth and stability pact , which ensures the stability of europe 's common currency , the euro . on wednesday he referred only to the need to ensure both flexibility and monetary stability , but he has previously stated his belief that the eu ’ s budgetary limitations , which are being broken with virtual impunity by germany , france and italy , should be respected .
guiding the eu constitution towards ratification is also one of his priorities . from maoist to war supporter a former maoist student activist under the portuguese dictatorship of antonio salazar , barroso ’ s politics shifted to the right after the restoration of democracy in 1974 .
he won his first senior government post at the age of just 29 , and had seven years later he had already served as foreign minister .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 22.07.2004 all acquitted in mannesmann trial großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trial centered on vodafone 's takeover of mannesmann deutsche bank chairman josef ackermann and five other co-defendants were found not guilty of the charges of breach of trust in the so-called mannesmann trial , a düsseldorf court ruled on thursday . ackermann , former mannesmann chairman klaus esser , mannesmann 's former supervisory board chief joachim funk , the former head of the powerful ig metall trade union , klaus zwickel , and two others , were found not guilty of any wrongdoing in the blockbuster corporate trial . all were accused of approving millions of euros in severance packages for mannesmann 's top executives after british competitor vodafone took over the company .
the case has been seen as putting german corporate governance in the dock . the presiding judge , brigitte koppenhföer , already said in a preliminary assessment half-way through the trial in march that while the actions of ackermann and his five co-defendants may have breached german stock law - which would be a civil matter - they were not serious enough to warrant a criminal conviction . " in this criminal process it is not up to the court to make management decisions or moral or ethical judgements , " said koppenhöfer on thursday .
" we are not judging german corporate culture although the evidence we saw was puzzling at times . " big bonuses all were accused , to varying degrees , of wrongdoing , when they approved 111.5 million deutsche marks -lrb- $ 71 million -rrb- in bonuses to management board members during the multi-billion-euro takeover of mannesmann by british mobile phone giant vodafone in 2000 .
esser alone pocketed more than € 15 million . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus esser and josef ackermann prosecutors had argued that the size of the payouts clearly went against the interests of both mannesmann and its shareholders and were therefore illegal under german share law .
they called for a jail sentence of two years with probation for deutsche bank chairman ackermann and wanted a two-and-a-half-year prison sentence without parole for former mannesmann chairman esser . judge koppenhföer did rule that the payment to esser broke corporate law because it came after the sale of the company to vodafone . " additional remuneration for esser equals double pay , " she said .
" there was no benefit for mannesmann to pay him for this integration period into vodafone . " common elsewhere the defendants had argued that such large payments are common practice in other countries such as the united states and that sanctioning the executives would discourage any bold decision-making in german companies in future . the blockbuster trial began on january 21 , and the head of germany 's biggest bank was required to spend two days every week in court .
some 55 witnesses were heard during a total 37 days in court . on the very first day , ackermann , who has spent around € 1.9 million on his defense , sparked widespread anger by making the " v " victory sign as he entered the court .
but even after his acquittal , the trial will have hurt the image of ackermann 's bank , already scratched after a series of pr mishaps , such as deutsche bank 's bungled handling of the flotation of postbank and a lawsuit lodged by former client and one-time media magnate , leo kirch . " i am extraordinarily grateful that the court sees the situation the way we have always presented it , " a relieved ackermann told reporters on thursday . but prosecutors could still decide to appeal the verdict to a higher court , which could cause the saga to drag on for years . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trying germany 's business elite a verdict is expected this week in germany 's most-watched business trial : top executives , including the head of deutsche bank , are accused of approving astronomical severance packages .

part of the plan , his spokesperson said , would involve " significantly extending " europe 's coastguard rescue services .

schily 's spokesperson added that refugees in the asylum centers would be guaranteed legal proceedings " in absolute security . "
in order to achieve this , the eu should form international agreements with african transit countries .
before the asylum centers were constructed , it would have to be clear that the terms of the geneva convention on the status of refugees would apply , the interior ministry said . dw-world.de greens oppose eu asylum center members of germany 's greens party have rejected a proposal to set up eu asylum centers in north africa .

on wednesday , five of the group of 37 refugees were flown back to their home countries .
of the five that are still in italy , only one has been granted permission to stay .
a plane to ghana carrying the 27 africans left rome at dawn , accompanied by demonstrations against the italian authorities treatment of the refugees .
opposition politicians called the expulsions " shameful . "
italian interior minister giuseppe pisanu defended the government , saying the operators of the german ship , owned by the cologne-based aid agency cap anamur , were " capable manipulators " of the media and had sought the " biggest possible return " in publicity through its rescue action .
pisanu said that italian police had found that none of the refugees was from sudan 's darfur region as claimed , and that none deserved asylum . dw-world.de italian judge frees german aid workers three germans working for a charity organization that helped 37 african asylum-seekers reach italy this week were released by an italian judge on friday .

on wednesday , five of the group of 37 refugees were flown back to their home countries .
of the five that are still in italy , only one has been granted permission to stay .
a plane to ghana carrying the 27 africans left rome at dawn , accompanied by demonstrations against the italian authorities treatment of the refugees .
opposition politicians called the expulsions " shameful . "
italian interior minister giuseppe pisanu defended the government , saying the operators of the german ship , owned by the cologne-based aid agency cap anamur , were " capable manipulators " of the media and had sought the " biggest possible return " in publicity through its rescue action .
pisanu said that italian police had found that none of the refugees was from sudan 's darfur region as claimed , and that none deserved asylum . dw-world.de italian judge frees german aid workers three germans working for a charity organization that helped 37 african asylum-seekers reach italy this week were released by an italian judge on friday .

begun in august 2000 , the program hoped to attract 20,000 highly skilled workers to the country in three years .
but by the end of that time , only 14,000 foreign workers had taken advantage of the visa project - 4,000 of them were from india .
many complained that the program was overly bureaucratic .
time limitations on the work visas as well as restrictions on bringing family members over dampened the enthusiasm of many . " it 's easier for a terrorist to get asylum in germany than it is for a foreign software expert to enter the german labor market , " one indian computer specialist told fischer during the meeting in bombay . fischer assured the audience that new immigrations laws to take effect in january would change that . pushing business ties the foreign minister also did some campaigning for germany as a location for industry , saying that his country 's highly developed infrastructure and location in the middle of the european union made for " excellent conditions " for foreign companies . he also appealed to german companies to take advantage of " the enormous opportunities " offered by the indian market and announced a visit this fall by chancellor gerhard schröder , who will be accompanied by a large business delegation .
fischer called on india to cut some of its red tape in order to improve its attractiveness to foreign investors . he praised progress in the peace process with india 's long-time rival pakistan , saying a lasting peace between the neighbors was important to convince investors that the region was a profitable and secure place to do business . on wednesday night , fischer flew to pakistan for a two-day visit there .

outlining his goals for his country 's six-month eu presidency before the european parliament , dutch premier jan-peter balkenende has called for fairness in deciding whether to start accession talks with turkey . speaking before the newly elected parliament in strasbourg on wednesday , the christian democrat said eu countries must not be guided by a fear of islam when deciding about the bloc 's future relationship with turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende " resistance towards a religion is not consistent european values , " balkenende said . "
our resistance has to be focussed on people who abuse worshipping god to propagate violence . " in december , eu leaders will decide whether turkey meets the political and economic criteria to begin negotiations towards joining the bloc at some point in the future .
that process is expected to take at least 10 years . balkenende said turkey 's readiness for negotiations should be judged honestly but strictly on the existing criteria of human rights , democracy and the rule of law without inventing new conditions . refuting bin laden martin schulz , the leader of the european socialists , agreed with balkenende .
he added that the eu had raised turkey 's hopes to join the union and could not switch gears at this point . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin schulz " islam is n't the problem , " schulz -lrb- photo -rrb- said .
" if it were possible to show that western values and an islamic society are not mutually exclusive , the arguments of the world 's bin ladens would be refuted .
the increase in the level of security that europe could gain from this should not be dismissed lightly . " but hans-gert pöttering , schulz 's political opponent as leader of the conservatives in the european parliament , said that the union should offer turkey a special partnership but not full membership . france is on the fence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan earlier this week , turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan -lrb- photo -rrb- visited france to lobby for paris to support turkey 's accession to the eu . french president jacques chirac on tuesday reaffirmed his support for turkey 's eventual membership of the european union , without specifying any time frame . according to a chirac aide , the president said that " turkey 's integration into the eu is welcome as soon as it becomes possible ... turkey has made considerable progress .
it must continue and intensify the implementation of democratic and economic reforms . " chirac has previously said he believes the path to turkish membership is " irreversible , " but he is at odds with many in his own union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- party and the public who believe the predominantly muslim country has no place in the club of 25 . the debate over turkey 's right to join the eu has been particularly robust in france , where there is strong opposition both from those who fear its implications for immigration and europe 's cultural heritage , and those who say it will mean the end of their vision for a politically integrated continent . abstention rather than opposition ? the nationalist leader philippe de villiers on tuesday condemned erdogan 's visit and what he described as chirac 's " determination " to see turkey join the eu .
he said he would ensure turkey 's membership is at the " heart of the debate " ahead of next year 's planned referendum on the eu constitution . as britain , germany and spain already lean towards supporting commencing negotiations with turkey , some think that it 's unlikely that france would block such a step .

speculation is growing that former star striker jürgen klinsmann will take over the vacant coaching job for germany 's national soccer team .
he would lead the squad into the 2006 world cup being held in germany . the president of the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- , gerhard mayer-vorfelder , held talks with klinsmann in new york on tuesday " to discuss the future planning for staffing of the national team , " a dfb spokesman said on wednesday . although it was not yet certain klinsmann would take over from rudi völler , who resigned last month after germany 's miserable euro 2004 campaign , he expressed his desire to help the national team get back on its feet . " the world cup is the most important sporting event of the past 40 years in germany .
it 's obvious that i 'll help the dfb , independently of the post , " klinsmann said . the 39-year-old former vfb stuttgart , inter milan and tottenham star , who won the world cup in 1990 , currently runs a sports marketing company in california .
he holds a training license but does not have any professional coaching experience . bierhoff as manager but according to media reports , klinsmann was now the frontrunner for the top coaching spot and another former star striker , oliver bierhoff , is set to fill the newly created position of team manager .
bierhoff , who is known to be a close friend of klinsmann , has already expressed his interest working with him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soccer star oliver bierhoff " if jürgen will agree to be coach , then i can imagine the job will be a lot of fun - that would be a good model , " bierhoff said according to the associated press . klinsmann has also been a vocal critic of the dfb 's recent disorganization and bumbling in trying to find a replacement for völler .
after ex-bayern munich coach ottmar hitzfeld balked at taking the job , german soccer officials have flailed about embarrassingly in their search . euro 2004-winning greece coach otto rehhagel said he 'd serve out his contract with the greeks and the dfb has been reluctant to sign a foreign coach like dutchman guus hiddink and dane morten olsen . most observers believe a klinsmann-bierhoff tandem would be an elegant solution , which would represent a fresh start for the national squad .
both are know for their intelligence and international experience that could serve germany well as it hosts the sport 's biggest event in 2006 . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's most unwanted the coach of germany 's national soccer team still remains unfilled despite once being a coveted and prestigious position .

outlining his goals for his country 's six-month eu presidency before the european parliament , dutch premier jan-peter balkenende has called for fairness in deciding whether to start accession talks with turkey . speaking before the newly elected parliament in strasbourg on wednesday , the christian democrat said eu countries must not be guided by a fear of islam when deciding about the bloc 's future relationship with turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende " resistance towards a religion is not consistent european values , " balkenende said . "
our resistance has to be focussed on people who abuse worshipping god to propagate violence . " in december , eu leaders will decide whether turkey meets the political and economic criteria to begin negotiations towards joining the bloc at some point in the future .
that process is expected to take at least 10 years . balkenende said turkey 's readiness for negotiations should be judged honestly but strictly on the existing criteria of human rights , democracy and the rule of law without inventing new conditions . refuting bin laden martin schulz , the leader of the european socialists , agreed with balkenende .
he added that the eu had raised turkey 's hopes to join the union and could not switch gears at this point . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin schulz " islam is n't the problem , " schulz -lrb- photo -rrb- said .
" if it were possible to show that western values and an islamic society are not mutually exclusive , the arguments of the world 's bin ladens would be refuted .
the increase in the level of security that europe could gain from this should not be dismissed lightly . " but hans-gert pöttering , schulz 's political opponent as leader of the conservatives in the european parliament , said that the union should offer turkey a special partnership but not full membership . france is on the fence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan earlier this week , turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan -lrb- photo -rrb- visited france to lobby for paris to support turkey 's accession to the eu . french president jacques chirac on tuesday reaffirmed his support for turkey 's eventual membership of the european union , without specifying any time frame . according to a chirac aide , the president said that " turkey 's integration into the eu is welcome as soon as it becomes possible ... turkey has made considerable progress .
it must continue and intensify the implementation of democratic and economic reforms . " chirac has previously said he believes the path to turkish membership is " irreversible , " but he is at odds with many in his own union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- party and the public who believe the predominantly muslim country has no place in the club of 25 . the debate over turkey 's right to join the eu has been particularly robust in france , where there is strong opposition both from those who fear its implications for immigration and europe 's cultural heritage , and those who say it will mean the end of their vision for a politically integrated continent . abstention rather than opposition ? the nationalist leader philippe de villiers on tuesday condemned erdogan 's visit and what he described as chirac 's " determination " to see turkey join the eu .
he said he would ensure turkey 's membership is at the " heart of the debate " ahead of next year 's planned referendum on the eu constitution . as britain , germany and spain already lean towards supporting commencing negotiations with turkey , some think that it 's unlikely that france would block such a step . " france will either fight for the opening of negotiations or abstain , because it does n't want to oppose the main european countries which have already come out clearly in favor , " didier billion , an expert on turkey and the deputy director of the paris-based institute for international and strategic relations , told reuters news agency .
" i do n't think that france will risk taking a position that would spark a crisis within the european union .

413 of the legislature 's 732 members voted for him . eu leaders agreed on barroso in june as a compromise candidate to replace outgoing commission president romano prodi .
barroso has since embarked on a charm offensive to win over the various factions of the european parliament .
on wednesday , the day before the vote , he summarized his plans for the new executive . barroso headed a conservative government in portugal , and many socialist and green meps are still skeptical about his efforts to present himself as an unbiased , centrist reformer . “ i will not be the president of the right against the left , or the left against the right , that i can promise you , ” he said . but barroso ’ s assertive campaign , conducted in fluent french , portuguese and english , has convinced others to support the commission ’ s candidate .
when barroso ’ s nomination was announced , irish premier bertie ahern gave him his enthusiastic backing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president romano prodi , right , and bertie ahern “ jose manuel durao barroso has the qualities that are needed for a strong and independent commission in these times , " ahern -lrb- photo , left -rrb- said .
" i know that he will lead the commission with strength , vigour , and vision . ” explaining the eu to its citizens following record low voter turnouts in the recent european elections , one of barroso ’ s key concerns is the need for eu institutions to do a better job of explaining their policies to european citizens .
he also told the european parliament that he hopes to act as a bridge between old and new eu members , as well as between the richer and poorer countries , and urged meps to confirm him in his candidacy . bildunterschrift : general view of the newly elected european parliament “ i need your support - not only personal support to me but support to the commission , " he said .
" because we need in this moment of europe , we need a strong , credible , independent commission , and the only way to have a strong commission , to say sometimes no to some member states , is to have the strong backing of the european parliament . ” “ no ” has been durao barroso 's response to leaders who have called for the rewriting of the european growth and stability pact , which ensures the stability of europe 's common currency , the euro . on wednesday he referred only to the need to ensure both flexibility and monetary stability , but he has previously stated his belief that the eu ’ s budgetary limitations , which are being broken with virtual impunity by germany , france and italy , should be respected .
guiding the eu constitution towards ratification is also one of his priorities . from maoist to war supporter a former maoist student activist under the portuguese dictatorship of antonio salazar , barroso ’ s politics shifted to the right after the restoration of democracy in 1974 .
he won his first senior government post at the age of just 29 , and had seven years later he had already served as foreign minister .
in 1999 he took over the leadership of his conservative social democratic party , winning the election in 2002 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. president george bush , center , british prime minister tony blair , second from left , and spain 's prime minister jose maria aznar , right , seen together with portugal 's prime minister jose manuel durao barroso , left , after arriving in the azores march 16 , 2003 to attend a summit to discuss the crisis with iraq barroso supported the us-led war on iraq , a decision for which he has been heavily criticized both in his own country and abroad , and one he defended in recent days as one of the most difficult of his life .
the crisis sparked by his resignation as portuguese prime minister in june now appears to have been resolved by the appointment of his successor , pedro santana lopes . his own master barroso insists that , as commission president , he will be his own master .
he backed this up on wednesday by indicating that he would not bow to pressure from germany to appoint a “ super-commissioner ” for economic policy ´ , a position it wants for its current enlargement commissioner , günther verheugen . “ in a commission led by me there will be no first- or second-class commissioners , ” barroso said . susan houlton -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de barroso snubs german call for eu super-commissioner european commission president-designate jose barroso rebuffed wednesday german plans for an economic " super-commissioner " in the new eu executive he is expected to head .

he would lead the squad into the 2006 world cup being held in germany . the president of the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- , gerhard mayer-vorfelder , held talks with klinsmann in new york on tuesday " to discuss the future planning for staffing of the national team , " a dfb spokesman said on wednesday . although it was not yet certain klinsmann would take over from rudi völler , who resigned last month after germany 's miserable euro 2004 campaign , he expressed his desire to help the national team get back on its feet . " the world cup is the most important sporting event of the past 40 years in germany .
it 's obvious that i 'll help the dfb , independently of the post , " klinsmann said . the 39-year-old former vfb stuttgart , inter milan and tottenham star , who won the world cup in 1990 , currently runs a sports marketing company in california .
he holds a training license but does not have any professional coaching experience . bierhoff as manager but according to media reports , klinsmann was now the frontrunner for the top coaching spot and another former star striker , oliver bierhoff , is set to fill the newly created position of team manager .
bierhoff , who is known to be a close friend of klinsmann , has already expressed his interest working with him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soccer star oliver bierhoff " if jürgen will agree to be coach , then i can imagine the job will be a lot of fun - that would be a good model , " bierhoff said according to the associated press . klinsmann has also been a vocal critic of the dfb 's recent disorganization and bumbling in trying to find a replacement for völler .
after ex-bayern munich coach ottmar hitzfeld balked at taking the job , german soccer officials have flailed about embarrassingly in their search . euro 2004-winning greece coach otto rehhagel said he 'd serve out his contract with the greeks and the dfb has been reluctant to sign a foreign coach like dutchman guus hiddink and dane morten olsen . most observers believe a klinsmann-bierhoff tandem would be an elegant solution , which would represent a fresh start for the national squad .
both are know for their intelligence and international experience that could serve germany well as it hosts the sport 's biggest event in 2006 . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's most unwanted the coach of germany 's national soccer team still remains unfilled despite once being a coveted and prestigious position .
as the saga continues , many explanations for the job 's current pariah status have been offered .

the case has been seen as putting german corporate governance in the dock . the presiding judge , brigitte koppenhföer , already said in a preliminary assessment half-way through the trial in march that while the actions of ackermann and his five co-defendants may have breached german stock law - which would be a civil matter - they were not serious enough to warrant a criminal conviction . " in this criminal process it is not up to the court to make management decisions or moral or ethical judgements , " said koppenhöfer on thursday .
" we are not judging german corporate culture although the evidence we saw was puzzling at times .

using the threat of moving jobs abroad as a bargaining chip to get labor concessions is becoming popular amongst german companies .
but there 's more to outsourcing than the heated political debate it 's created . shifting jobs to low-wage countries to save costs is n't a particularly new phenomenon to germany .
but in recent months it has become an extremely sensitive topic in a country plagued by chronically high unemployment .
german chancellor gerhard schröder even called corporate outsourcing efforts " unpatriotic " this spring . " in the mid-1990s there was a wave of moving manufacturing jobs out of the country , " dr stephan wimmers from the german chamber of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- told dw-world .
" but now germany is also losing its advantage for better quality and capital-intensive jobs . " part of the new scrutiny of outsourcing began this spring when germany ’ s low-wage eastern neighbors poland and the czech republic finally joined the european union .
but a full-blown nationwide debate on the issue started in earnest in june , after electronics giant siemens convinced german workers that 2,000 jobs would be moved to hungary unless they moved from a 35-hour to a 40-hour workweek without added pay . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes c-class that encouraged several big companies to follow suit with similar offshoring threats .
carmaker daimlerchrysler is currently in talks with workers over the fate of 6,000 positions at its plant in sindelfingen near stuttgart .
unless it saves € 500 million in annual labor costs , daimlerchrysler has said it will move production of its mercedes c-class to cheaper sites in bremen and south africa . but whereas in germany offshoring has become synonymous for any attempt to move jobs abroad , in the united states and britain it frequently refers more specifically to outsourcing customer service call centers and it positions to cheaper facilities overseas . lagging behind that type of classic outsourcing has been slow to take off in germany , stymied by the country 's restrictive labor laws , language issues and the conservative nature of germany 's corporate culture . “ compared to us and uk companies , german interest in outsourcing has been much smaller , ” said andrew parker , an analyst for technology consultancy forrester .
although that was beginning to change , he said german offshoring was developing its own special focus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wipro employees undergo training in the use of specialized software to provide services to overseas clients at the company in bangalore , india .
india remains the dominant outsourcing destination for british and american firms , partly due to the high number of proficient english speakers there .
plenty of german companies also farm out it jobs and other back-office tasks to " offshore " indian operations , but parker said germany was looking more to " nearshore " central and eastern europe for many of its outsourcing needs . although it was more expensive than asia , parker said german clients appeared willing to pay a premium for geographic proximity and german language skills .
“ there are russian firms that still have a strong reservoir of german speaking developers in moscow and st. petersburg that they can tap into as needed , ” parker said . the benefits of language are obvious , but sometimes the " nearshore " helps facilitate " offshore " activities .
for example , us outsourcing giant eds each day ships truckloads of paper documents from clients in germany to its operations in nearby hungary so they can be scanned into the company ’ s database , thereby allowing the information to be processed electronically elsewhere around the world . creating jobs in germany however , offshoring is n't quite as simple as just siphoning off jobs to low-wage countries in eastern europe and asia .
surprisingly , it is also leading to more positions inside germany , at least for outsourcing companies . " we want to hire a lot of people locally , " debjit chaudhuri , head the german division of indian software and services outsourcing specialist infosys technologies , told dw-world . chaudhuri said he needed to expand his 200-person office near frankfurt in order to take advantage of corporate germany 's increasing appetite for outsourcing .
the burgeoning workload also means infosys is training people in india to become familiar with german culture . " they can ’ t all be in germany but they need to know how it is here .

using the threat of moving jobs abroad as a bargaining chip to get labor concessions is becoming popular amongst german companies .
but there 's more to outsourcing than the heated political debate it 's created . shifting jobs to low-wage countries to save costs is n't a particularly new phenomenon to germany .
but in recent months it has become an extremely sensitive topic in a country plagued by chronically high unemployment .
german chancellor gerhard schröder even called corporate outsourcing efforts " unpatriotic " this spring . " in the mid-1990s there was a wave of moving manufacturing jobs out of the country , " dr stephan wimmers from the german chamber of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- told dw-world .
" but now germany is also losing its advantage for better quality and capital-intensive jobs . " part of the new scrutiny of outsourcing began this spring when germany ’ s low-wage eastern neighbors poland and the czech republic finally joined the european union .
but a full-blown nationwide debate on the issue started in earnest in june , after electronics giant siemens convinced german workers that 2,000 jobs would be moved to hungary unless they moved from a 35-hour to a 40-hour workweek without added pay . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes c-class that encouraged several big companies to follow suit with similar offshoring threats .
carmaker daimlerchrysler is currently in talks with workers over the fate of 6,000 positions at its plant in sindelfingen near stuttgart .
unless it saves € 500 million in annual labor costs , daimlerchrysler has said it will move production of its mercedes c-class to cheaper sites in bremen and south africa . but whereas in germany offshoring has become synonymous for any attempt to move jobs abroad , in the united states and britain it frequently refers more specifically to outsourcing customer service call centers and it positions to cheaper facilities overseas . lagging behind that type of classic outsourcing has been slow to take off in germany , stymied by the country 's restrictive labor laws , language issues and the conservative nature of germany 's corporate culture . “ compared to us and uk companies , german interest in outsourcing has been much smaller , ” said andrew parker , an analyst for technology consultancy forrester .
although that was beginning to change , he said german offshoring was developing its own special focus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wipro employees undergo training in the use of specialized software to provide services to overseas clients at the company in bangalore , india .
india remains the dominant outsourcing destination for british and american firms , partly due to the high number of proficient english speakers there .
plenty of german companies also farm out it jobs and other back-office tasks to " offshore " indian operations , but parker said germany was looking more to " nearshore " central and eastern europe for many of its outsourcing needs . although it was more expensive than asia , parker said german clients appeared willing to pay a premium for geographic proximity and german language skills .
“ there are russian firms that still have a strong reservoir of german speaking developers in moscow and st. petersburg that they can tap into as needed , ” parker said . the benefits of language are obvious , but sometimes the " nearshore " helps facilitate " offshore " activities .
for example , us outsourcing giant eds each day ships truckloads of paper documents from clients in germany to its operations in nearby hungary so they can be scanned into the company ’ s database , thereby allowing the information to be processed electronically elsewhere around the world . creating jobs in germany however , offshoring is n't quite as simple as just siphoning off jobs to low-wage countries in eastern europe and asia .
surprisingly , it is also leading to more positions inside germany , at least for outsourcing companies . " we want to hire a lot of people locally , " debjit chaudhuri , head the german division of indian software and services outsourcing specialist infosys technologies , told dw-world . chaudhuri said he needed to expand his 200-person office near frankfurt in order to take advantage of corporate germany 's increasing appetite for outsourcing .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 22.07.2004 all acquitted in mannesmann trial großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trial centered on vodafone 's takeover of mannesmann deutsche bank chairman josef ackermann and five other co-defendants were found not guilty of the charges of breach of trust in the so-called mannesmann trial , a düsseldorf court ruled on thursday . ackermann , former mannesmann chairman klaus esser , mannesmann 's former supervisory board chief joachim funk , the former head of the powerful ig metall trade union , klaus zwickel , and two others , were found not guilty of any wrongdoing in the blockbuster corporate trial . all were accused of approving millions of euros in severance packages for mannesmann 's top executives after british competitor vodafone took over the company .
the case has been seen as putting german corporate governance in the dock . the presiding judge , brigitte koppenhföer , already said in a preliminary assessment half-way through the trial in march that while the actions of ackermann and his five co-defendants may have breached german stock law - which would be a civil matter - they were not serious enough to warrant a criminal conviction . " in this criminal process it is not up to the court to make management decisions or moral or ethical judgements , " said koppenhöfer on thursday .
" we are not judging german corporate culture although the evidence we saw was puzzling at times .

the case has been seen as putting german corporate governance in the dock . the presiding judge , brigitte koppenhföer , already said in a preliminary assessment half-way through the trial in march that while the actions of ackermann and his five co-defendants may have breached german stock law - which would be a civil matter - they were not serious enough to warrant a criminal conviction . " in this criminal process it is not up to the court to make management decisions or moral or ethical judgements , " said koppenhöfer on thursday .
" we are not judging german corporate culture although the evidence we saw was puzzling at times .

guiding the eu constitution towards ratification is also one of his priorities . from maoist to war supporter a former maoist student activist under the portuguese dictatorship of antonio salazar , barroso ’ s politics shifted to the right after the restoration of democracy in 1974 .

speculation is growing that former star striker jürgen klinsmann will take over the vacant coaching job for germany 's national soccer team .
he would lead the squad into the 2006 world cup being held in germany . the president of the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- , gerhard mayer-vorfelder , held talks with klinsmann in new york on tuesday " to discuss the future planning for staffing of the national team , " a dfb spokesman said on wednesday . although it was not yet certain klinsmann would take over from rudi völler , who resigned last month after germany 's miserable euro 2004 campaign , he expressed his desire to help the national team get back on its feet .

413 of the legislature 's 732 members voted for him . eu leaders agreed on barroso in june as a compromise candidate to replace outgoing commission president romano prodi .
barroso has since embarked on a charm offensive to win over the various factions of the european parliament .
on wednesday , the day before the vote , he summarized his plans for the new executive . barroso headed a conservative government in portugal , and many socialist and green meps are still skeptical about his efforts to present himself as an unbiased , centrist reformer . “ i will not be the president of the right against the left , or the left against the right , that i can promise you , ” he said . but barroso ’ s assertive campaign , conducted in fluent french , portuguese and english , has convinced others to support the commission ’ s candidate .
when barroso ’ s nomination was announced , irish premier bertie ahern gave him his enthusiastic backing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president romano prodi , right , and bertie ahern “ jose manuel durao barroso has the qualities that are needed for a strong and independent commission in these times , " ahern -lrb- photo , left -rrb- said .
" i know that he will lead the commission with strength , vigour , and vision . ” explaining the eu to its citizens following record low voter turnouts in the recent european elections , one of barroso ’ s key concerns is the need for eu institutions to do a better job of explaining their policies to european citizens .
he also told the european parliament that he hopes to act as a bridge between old and new eu members , as well as between the richer and poorer countries , and urged meps to confirm him in his candidacy . bildunterschrift : general view of the newly elected european parliament “ i need your support - not only personal support to me but support to the commission , " he said .
" because we need in this moment of europe , we need a strong , credible , independent commission , and the only way to have a strong commission , to say sometimes no to some member states , is to have the strong backing of the european parliament . ” “ no ” has been durao barroso 's response to leaders who have called for the rewriting of the european growth and stability pact , which ensures the stability of europe 's common currency , the euro . on wednesday he referred only to the need to ensure both flexibility and monetary stability , but he has previously stated his belief that the eu ’ s budgetary limitations , which are being broken with virtual impunity by germany , france and italy , should be respected .
guiding the eu constitution towards ratification is also one of his priorities . from maoist to war supporter a former maoist student activist under the portuguese dictatorship of antonio salazar , barroso ’ s politics shifted to the right after the restoration of democracy in 1974 .
he won his first senior government post at the age of just 29 , and had seven years later he had already served as foreign minister .
in 1999 he took over the leadership of his conservative social democratic party , winning the election in 2002 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. president george bush , center , british prime minister tony blair , second from left , and spain 's prime minister jose maria aznar , right , seen together with portugal 's prime minister jose manuel durao barroso , left , after arriving in the azores march 16 , 2003 to attend a summit to discuss the crisis with iraq barroso supported the us-led war on iraq , a decision for which he has been heavily criticized both in his own country and abroad , and one he defended in recent days as one of the most difficult of his life .
the crisis sparked by his resignation as portuguese prime minister in june now appears to have been resolved by the appointment of his successor , pedro santana lopes . his own master barroso insists that , as commission president , he will be his own master .
he backed this up on wednesday by indicating that he would not bow to pressure from germany to appoint a “ super-commissioner ” for economic policy ´ , a position it wants for its current enlargement commissioner , günther verheugen . “ in a commission led by me there will be no first- or second-class commissioners , ” barroso said . susan houlton -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de barroso snubs german call for eu super-commissioner european commission president-designate jose barroso rebuffed wednesday german plans for an economic " super-commissioner " in the new eu executive he is expected to head .

outlining his goals for his country 's six-month eu presidency before the european parliament , dutch premier jan-peter balkenende has called for fairness in deciding whether to start accession talks with turkey . speaking before the newly elected parliament in strasbourg on wednesday , the christian democrat said eu countries must not be guided by a fear of islam when deciding about the bloc 's future relationship with turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende " resistance towards a religion is not consistent european values , " balkenende said . "
our resistance has to be focussed on people who abuse worshipping god to propagate violence . " in december , eu leaders will decide whether turkey meets the political and economic criteria to begin negotiations towards joining the bloc at some point in the future .
that process is expected to take at least 10 years . balkenende said turkey 's readiness for negotiations should be judged honestly but strictly on the existing criteria of human rights , democracy and the rule of law without inventing new conditions . refuting bin laden martin schulz , the leader of the european socialists , agreed with balkenende .
he added that the eu had raised turkey 's hopes to join the union and could not switch gears at this point . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin schulz " islam is n't the problem , " schulz -lrb- photo -rrb- said .
" if it were possible to show that western values and an islamic society are not mutually exclusive , the arguments of the world 's bin ladens would be refuted .
the increase in the level of security that europe could gain from this should not be dismissed lightly . " but hans-gert pöttering , schulz 's political opponent as leader of the conservatives in the european parliament , said that the union should offer turkey a special partnership but not full membership . france is on the fence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan earlier this week , turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan -lrb- photo -rrb- visited france to lobby for paris to support turkey 's accession to the eu . french president jacques chirac on tuesday reaffirmed his support for turkey 's eventual membership of the european union , without specifying any time frame . according to a chirac aide , the president said that " turkey 's integration into the eu is welcome as soon as it becomes possible ... turkey has made considerable progress .
it must continue and intensify the implementation of democratic and economic reforms . " chirac has previously said he believes the path to turkish membership is " irreversible , " but he is at odds with many in his own union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- party and the public who believe the predominantly muslim country has no place in the club of 25 . the debate over turkey 's right to join the eu has been particularly robust in france , where there is strong opposition both from those who fear its implications for immigration and europe 's cultural heritage , and those who say it will mean the end of their vision for a politically integrated continent . abstention rather than opposition ? the nationalist leader philippe de villiers on tuesday condemned erdogan 's visit and what he described as chirac 's " determination " to see turkey join the eu .
he said he would ensure turkey 's membership is at the " heart of the debate " ahead of next year 's planned referendum on the eu constitution . as britain , germany and spain already lean towards supporting commencing negotiations with turkey , some think that it 's unlikely that france would block such a step . " france will either fight for the opening of negotiations or abstain , because it does n't want to oppose the main european countries which have already come out clearly in favor , " didier billion , an expert on turkey and the deputy director of the paris-based institute for international and strategic relations , told reuters news agency .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 22.07.2004 all acquitted in mannesmann trial großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trial centered on vodafone 's takeover of mannesmann deutsche bank chairman josef ackermann and five other co-defendants were found not guilty of the charges of breach of trust in the so-called mannesmann trial , a düsseldorf court ruled on thursday . ackermann , former mannesmann chairman klaus esser , mannesmann 's former supervisory board chief joachim funk , the former head of the powerful ig metall trade union , klaus zwickel , and two others , were found not guilty of any wrongdoing in the blockbuster corporate trial . all were accused of approving millions of euros in severance packages for mannesmann 's top executives after british competitor vodafone took over the company .
the case has been seen as putting german corporate governance in the dock . the presiding judge , brigitte koppenhföer , already said in a preliminary assessment half-way through the trial in march that while the actions of ackermann and his five co-defendants may have breached german stock law - which would be a civil matter - they were not serious enough to warrant a criminal conviction . " in this criminal process it is not up to the court to make management decisions or moral or ethical judgements , " said koppenhöfer on thursday .
" we are not judging german corporate culture although the evidence we saw was puzzling at times . " big bonuses all were accused , to varying degrees , of wrongdoing , when they approved 111.5 million deutsche marks -lrb- $ 71 million -rrb- in bonuses to management board members during the multi-billion-euro takeover of mannesmann by british mobile phone giant vodafone in 2000 .
esser alone pocketed more than € 15 million . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus esser and josef ackermann prosecutors had argued that the size of the payouts clearly went against the interests of both mannesmann and its shareholders and were therefore illegal under german share law .
they called for a jail sentence of two years with probation for deutsche bank chairman ackermann and wanted a two-and-a-half-year prison sentence without parole for former mannesmann chairman esser . judge koppenhföer did rule that the payment to esser broke corporate law because it came after the sale of the company to vodafone . " additional remuneration for esser equals double pay , " she said .
" there was no benefit for mannesmann to pay him for this integration period into vodafone . " common elsewhere the defendants had argued that such large payments are common practice in other countries such as the united states and that sanctioning the executives would discourage any bold decision-making in german companies in future . the blockbuster trial began on january 21 , and the head of germany 's biggest bank was required to spend two days every week in court .
some 55 witnesses were heard during a total 37 days in court . on the very first day , ackermann , who has spent around € 1.9 million on his defense , sparked widespread anger by making the " v " victory sign as he entered the court .
but even after his acquittal , the trial will have hurt the image of ackermann 's bank , already scratched after a series of pr mishaps , such as deutsche bank 's bungled handling of the flotation of postbank and a lawsuit lodged by former client and one-time media magnate , leo kirch . " i am extraordinarily grateful that the court sees the situation the way we have always presented it , " a relieved ackermann told reporters on thursday . but prosecutors could still decide to appeal the verdict to a higher court , which could cause the saga to drag on for years . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trying germany 's business elite a verdict is expected this week in germany 's most-watched business trial : top executives , including the head of deutsche bank , are accused of approving astronomical severance packages .

using the threat of moving jobs abroad as a bargaining chip to get labor concessions is becoming popular amongst german companies .
but there 's more to outsourcing than the heated political debate it 's created . shifting jobs to low-wage countries to save costs is n't a particularly new phenomenon to germany .
but in recent months it has become an extremely sensitive topic in a country plagued by chronically high unemployment .
german chancellor gerhard schröder even called corporate outsourcing efforts " unpatriotic " this spring . " in the mid-1990s there was a wave of moving manufacturing jobs out of the country , " dr stephan wimmers from the german chamber of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- told dw-world .
" but now germany is also losing its advantage for better quality and capital-intensive jobs . " part of the new scrutiny of outsourcing began this spring when germany ’ s low-wage eastern neighbors poland and the czech republic finally joined the european union .
but a full-blown nationwide debate on the issue started in earnest in june , after electronics giant siemens convinced german workers that 2,000 jobs would be moved to hungary unless they moved from a 35-hour to a 40-hour workweek without added pay . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes c-class that encouraged several big companies to follow suit with similar offshoring threats .
carmaker daimlerchrysler is currently in talks with workers over the fate of 6,000 positions at its plant in sindelfingen near stuttgart .
unless it saves € 500 million in annual labor costs , daimlerchrysler has said it will move production of its mercedes c-class to cheaper sites in bremen and south africa . but whereas in germany offshoring has become synonymous for any attempt to move jobs abroad , in the united states and britain it frequently refers more specifically to outsourcing customer service call centers and it positions to cheaper facilities overseas . lagging behind that type of classic outsourcing has been slow to take off in germany , stymied by the country 's restrictive labor laws , language issues and the conservative nature of germany 's corporate culture . “ compared to us and uk companies , german interest in outsourcing has been much smaller , ” said andrew parker , an analyst for technology consultancy forrester .
although that was beginning to change , he said german offshoring was developing its own special focus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wipro employees undergo training in the use of specialized software to provide services to overseas clients at the company in bangalore , india .
india remains the dominant outsourcing destination for british and american firms , partly due to the high number of proficient english speakers there .
plenty of german companies also farm out it jobs and other back-office tasks to " offshore " indian operations , but parker said germany was looking more to " nearshore " central and eastern europe for many of its outsourcing needs . although it was more expensive than asia , parker said german clients appeared willing to pay a premium for geographic proximity and german language skills .
“ there are russian firms that still have a strong reservoir of german speaking developers in moscow and st. petersburg that they can tap into as needed , ” parker said . the benefits of language are obvious , but sometimes the " nearshore " helps facilitate " offshore " activities .
for example , us outsourcing giant eds each day ships truckloads of paper documents from clients in germany to its operations in nearby hungary so they can be scanned into the company ’ s database , thereby allowing the information to be processed electronically elsewhere around the world . creating jobs in germany however , offshoring is n't quite as simple as just siphoning off jobs to low-wage countries in eastern europe and asia .
surprisingly , it is also leading to more positions inside germany , at least for outsourcing companies . " we want to hire a lot of people locally , " debjit chaudhuri , head the german division of indian software and services outsourcing specialist infosys technologies , told dw-world . chaudhuri said he needed to expand his 200-person office near frankfurt in order to take advantage of corporate germany 's increasing appetite for outsourcing .
the burgeoning workload also means infosys is training people in india to become familiar with german culture . " they can ’ t all be in germany but they need to know how it is here .
the whole idea is to be as german as possible , " he said . marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de daimlerchrysler board may take salary cut to help defuse a growing labor dispute over longer working hours for employees , top managers at carmaker daimlerchrysler appear ready to accept large salary cuts .

the case has been seen as putting german corporate governance in the dock . the presiding judge , brigitte koppenhföer , already said in a preliminary assessment half-way through the trial in march that while the actions of ackermann and his five co-defendants may have breached german stock law - which would be a civil matter - they were not serious enough to warrant a criminal conviction . " in this criminal process it is not up to the court to make management decisions or moral or ethical judgements , " said koppenhöfer on thursday .
" we are not judging german corporate culture although the evidence we saw was puzzling at times . " big bonuses all were accused , to varying degrees , of wrongdoing , when they approved 111.5 million deutsche marks -lrb- $ 71 million -rrb- in bonuses to management board members during the multi-billion-euro takeover of mannesmann by british mobile phone giant vodafone in 2000 .
esser alone pocketed more than € 15 million . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus esser and josef ackermann prosecutors had argued that the size of the payouts clearly went against the interests of both mannesmann and its shareholders and were therefore illegal under german share law .
they called for a jail sentence of two years with probation for deutsche bank chairman ackermann and wanted a two-and-a-half-year prison sentence without parole for former mannesmann chairman esser . judge koppenhföer did rule that the payment to esser broke corporate law because it came after the sale of the company to vodafone . " additional remuneration for esser equals double pay , " she said .
" there was no benefit for mannesmann to pay him for this integration period into vodafone . " common elsewhere the defendants had argued that such large payments are common practice in other countries such as the united states and that sanctioning the executives would discourage any bold decision-making in german companies in future . the blockbuster trial began on january 21 , and the head of germany 's biggest bank was required to spend two days every week in court .
some 55 witnesses were heard during a total 37 days in court . on the very first day , ackermann , who has spent around € 1.9 million on his defense , sparked widespread anger by making the " v " victory sign as he entered the court .
but even after his acquittal , the trial will have hurt the image of ackermann 's bank , already scratched after a series of pr mishaps , such as deutsche bank 's bungled handling of the flotation of postbank and a lawsuit lodged by former client and one-time media magnate , leo kirch . " i am extraordinarily grateful that the court sees the situation the way we have always presented it , " a relieved ackermann told reporters on thursday . but prosecutors could still decide to appeal the verdict to a higher court , which could cause the saga to drag on for years . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trying germany 's business elite a verdict is expected this week in germany 's most-watched business trial : top executives , including the head of deutsche bank , are accused of approving astronomical severance packages .

outlining his goals for his country 's six-month eu presidency before the european parliament , dutch premier jan-peter balkenende has called for fairness in deciding whether to start accession talks with turkey . speaking before the newly elected parliament in strasbourg on wednesday , the christian democrat said eu countries must not be guided by a fear of islam when deciding about the bloc 's future relationship with turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende " resistance towards a religion is not consistent european values , " balkenende said . "
our resistance has to be focussed on people who abuse worshipping god to propagate violence . " in december , eu leaders will decide whether turkey meets the political and economic criteria to begin negotiations towards joining the bloc at some point in the future .
that process is expected to take at least 10 years . balkenende said turkey 's readiness for negotiations should be judged honestly but strictly on the existing criteria of human rights , democracy and the rule of law without inventing new conditions . refuting bin laden martin schulz , the leader of the european socialists , agreed with balkenende .
he added that the eu had raised turkey 's hopes to join the union and could not switch gears at this point . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin schulz " islam is n't the problem , " schulz -lrb- photo -rrb- said .
" if it were possible to show that western values and an islamic society are not mutually exclusive , the arguments of the world 's bin ladens would be refuted .
the increase in the level of security that europe could gain from this should not be dismissed lightly . " but hans-gert pöttering , schulz 's political opponent as leader of the conservatives in the european parliament , said that the union should offer turkey a special partnership but not full membership . france is on the fence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan earlier this week , turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan -lrb- photo -rrb- visited france to lobby for paris to support turkey 's accession to the eu . french president jacques chirac on tuesday reaffirmed his support for turkey 's eventual membership of the european union , without specifying any time frame . according to a chirac aide , the president said that " turkey 's integration into the eu is welcome as soon as it becomes possible ... turkey has made considerable progress .
it must continue and intensify the implementation of democratic and economic reforms . " chirac has previously said he believes the path to turkish membership is " irreversible , " but he is at odds with many in his own union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- party and the public who believe the predominantly muslim country has no place in the club of 25 . the debate over turkey 's right to join the eu has been particularly robust in france , where there is strong opposition both from those who fear its implications for immigration and europe 's cultural heritage , and those who say it will mean the end of their vision for a politically integrated continent . abstention rather than opposition ? the nationalist leader philippe de villiers on tuesday condemned erdogan 's visit and what he described as chirac 's " determination " to see turkey join the eu .
he said he would ensure turkey 's membership is at the " heart of the debate " ahead of next year 's planned referendum on the eu constitution . as britain , germany and spain already lean towards supporting commencing negotiations with turkey , some think that it 's unlikely that france would block such a step . " france will either fight for the opening of negotiations or abstain , because it does n't want to oppose the main european countries which have already come out clearly in favor , " didier billion , an expert on turkey and the deputy director of the paris-based institute for international and strategic relations , told reuters news agency .

413 of the legislature 's 732 members voted for him . eu leaders agreed on barroso in june as a compromise candidate to replace outgoing commission president romano prodi .
barroso has since embarked on a charm offensive to win over the various factions of the european parliament .
on wednesday , the day before the vote , he summarized his plans for the new executive . barroso headed a conservative government in portugal , and many socialist and green meps are still skeptical about his efforts to present himself as an unbiased , centrist reformer . “ i will not be the president of the right against the left , or the left against the right , that i can promise you , ” he said . but barroso ’ s assertive campaign , conducted in fluent french , portuguese and english , has convinced others to support the commission ’ s candidate .
when barroso ’ s nomination was announced , irish premier bertie ahern gave him his enthusiastic backing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president romano prodi , right , and bertie ahern “ jose manuel durao barroso has the qualities that are needed for a strong and independent commission in these times , " ahern -lrb- photo , left -rrb- said .
" i know that he will lead the commission with strength , vigour , and vision . ” explaining the eu to its citizens following record low voter turnouts in the recent european elections , one of barroso ’ s key concerns is the need for eu institutions to do a better job of explaining their policies to european citizens .
he also told the european parliament that he hopes to act as a bridge between old and new eu members , as well as between the richer and poorer countries , and urged meps to confirm him in his candidacy . bildunterschrift : general view of the newly elected european parliament “ i need your support - not only personal support to me but support to the commission , " he said .
" because we need in this moment of europe , we need a strong , credible , independent commission , and the only way to have a strong commission , to say sometimes no to some member states , is to have the strong backing of the european parliament . ” “ no ” has been durao barroso 's response to leaders who have called for the rewriting of the european growth and stability pact , which ensures the stability of europe 's common currency , the euro . on wednesday he referred only to the need to ensure both flexibility and monetary stability , but he has previously stated his belief that the eu ’ s budgetary limitations , which are being broken with virtual impunity by germany , france and italy , should be respected .
guiding the eu constitution towards ratification is also one of his priorities . from maoist to war supporter a former maoist student activist under the portuguese dictatorship of antonio salazar , barroso ’ s politics shifted to the right after the restoration of democracy in 1974 .
he won his first senior government post at the age of just 29 , and had seven years later he had already served as foreign minister .
in 1999 he took over the leadership of his conservative social democratic party , winning the election in 2002 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. president george bush , center , british prime minister tony blair , second from left , and spain 's prime minister jose maria aznar , right , seen together with portugal 's prime minister jose manuel durao barroso , left , after arriving in the azores march 16 , 2003 to attend a summit to discuss the crisis with iraq barroso supported the us-led war on iraq , a decision for which he has been heavily criticized both in his own country and abroad , and one he defended in recent days as one of the most difficult of his life .
the crisis sparked by his resignation as portuguese prime minister in june now appears to have been resolved by the appointment of his successor , pedro santana lopes . his own master barroso insists that , as commission president , he will be his own master .
he backed this up on wednesday by indicating that he would not bow to pressure from germany to appoint a “ super-commissioner ” for economic policy ´ , a position it wants for its current enlargement commissioner , günther verheugen . “ in a commission led by me there will be no first- or second-class commissioners , ” barroso said . susan houlton -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de barroso snubs german call for eu super-commissioner european commission president-designate jose barroso rebuffed wednesday german plans for an economic " super-commissioner " in the new eu executive he is expected to head .

the case has been seen as putting german corporate governance in the dock . the presiding judge , brigitte koppenhföer , already said in a preliminary assessment half-way through the trial in march that while the actions of ackermann and his five co-defendants may have breached german stock law - which would be a civil matter - they were not serious enough to warrant a criminal conviction . " in this criminal process it is not up to the court to make management decisions or moral or ethical judgements , " said koppenhöfer on thursday .
" we are not judging german corporate culture although the evidence we saw was puzzling at times . " big bonuses all were accused , to varying degrees , of wrongdoing , when they approved 111.5 million deutsche marks -lrb- $ 71 million -rrb- in bonuses to management board members during the multi-billion-euro takeover of mannesmann by british mobile phone giant vodafone in 2000 .

" additional remuneration for esser equals double pay , " she said .
" there was no benefit for mannesmann to pay him for this integration period into vodafone .

begun in august 2000 , the program hoped to attract 20,000 highly skilled workers to the country in three years .
but by the end of that time , only 14,000 foreign workers had taken advantage of the visa project - 4,000 of them were from india .
many complained that the program was overly bureaucratic .
time limitations on the work visas as well as restrictions on bringing family members over dampened the enthusiasm of many . " it 's easier for a terrorist to get asylum in germany than it is for a foreign software expert to enter the german labor market , " one indian computer specialist told fischer during the meeting in bombay . fischer assured the audience that new immigrations laws to take effect in january would change that . pushing business ties the foreign minister also did some campaigning for germany as a location for industry , saying that his country 's highly developed infrastructure and location in the middle of the european union made for " excellent conditions " for foreign companies . he also appealed to german companies to take advantage of " the enormous opportunities " offered by the indian market and announced a visit this fall by chancellor gerhard schröder , who will be accompanied by a large business delegation .
fischer called on india to cut some of its red tape in order to improve its attractiveness to foreign investors . he praised progress in the peace process with india 's long-time rival pakistan , saying a lasting peace between the neighbors was important to convince investors that the region was a profitable and secure place to do business . on wednesday night , fischer flew to pakistan for a two-day visit there .

when barroso ’ s nomination was announced , irish premier bertie ahern gave him his enthusiastic backing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president romano prodi , right , and bertie ahern “ jose manuel durao barroso has the qualities that are needed for a strong and independent commission in these times , " ahern -lrb- photo , left -rrb- said .
" i know that he will lead the commission with strength , vigour , and vision . ” explaining the eu to its citizens following record low voter turnouts in the recent european elections , one of barroso ’ s key concerns is the need for eu institutions to do a better job of explaining their policies to european citizens .
he also told the european parliament that he hopes to act as a bridge between old and new eu members , as well as between the richer and poorer countries , and urged meps to confirm him in his candidacy . bildunterschrift : general view of the newly elected european parliament “ i need your support - not only personal support to me but support to the commission , " he said .
" because we need in this moment of europe , we need a strong , credible , independent commission , and the only way to have a strong commission , to say sometimes no to some member states , is to have the strong backing of the european parliament . ” “ no ” has been durao barroso 's response to leaders who have called for the rewriting of the european growth and stability pact , which ensures the stability of europe 's common currency , the euro . on wednesday he referred only to the need to ensure both flexibility and monetary stability , but he has previously stated his belief that the eu ’ s budgetary limitations , which are being broken with virtual impunity by germany , france and italy , should be respected .
guiding the eu constitution towards ratification is also one of his priorities . from maoist to war supporter a former maoist student activist under the portuguese dictatorship of antonio salazar , barroso ’ s politics shifted to the right after the restoration of democracy in 1974 .
he won his first senior government post at the age of just 29 , and had seven years later he had already served as foreign minister .
in 1999 he took over the leadership of his conservative social democratic party , winning the election in 2002 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. president george bush , center , british prime minister tony blair , second from left , and spain 's prime minister jose maria aznar , right , seen together with portugal 's prime minister jose manuel durao barroso , left , after arriving in the azores march 16 , 2003 to attend a summit to discuss the crisis with iraq barroso supported the us-led war on iraq , a decision for which he has been heavily criticized both in his own country and abroad , and one he defended in recent days as one of the most difficult of his life .
the crisis sparked by his resignation as portuguese prime minister in june now appears to have been resolved by the appointment of his successor , pedro santana lopes . his own master barroso insists that , as commission president , he will be his own master .
he backed this up on wednesday by indicating that he would not bow to pressure from germany to appoint a “ super-commissioner ” for economic policy ´ , a position it wants for its current enlargement commissioner , günther verheugen . “ in a commission led by me there will be no first- or second-class commissioners , ” barroso said . susan houlton -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de barroso snubs german call for eu super-commissioner european commission president-designate jose barroso rebuffed wednesday german plans for an economic " super-commissioner " in the new eu executive he is expected to head .

using the threat of moving jobs abroad as a bargaining chip to get labor concessions is becoming popular amongst german companies .
but there 's more to outsourcing than the heated political debate it 's created . shifting jobs to low-wage countries to save costs is n't a particularly new phenomenon to germany .
but in recent months it has become an extremely sensitive topic in a country plagued by chronically high unemployment .
german chancellor gerhard schröder even called corporate outsourcing efforts " unpatriotic " this spring . " in the mid-1990s there was a wave of moving manufacturing jobs out of the country , " dr stephan wimmers from the german chamber of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- told dw-world .
" but now germany is also losing its advantage for better quality and capital-intensive jobs . " part of the new scrutiny of outsourcing began this spring when germany ’ s low-wage eastern neighbors poland and the czech republic finally joined the european union .
but a full-blown nationwide debate on the issue started in earnest in june , after electronics giant siemens convinced german workers that 2,000 jobs would be moved to hungary unless they moved from a 35-hour to a 40-hour workweek without added pay . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes c-class that encouraged several big companies to follow suit with similar offshoring threats .
carmaker daimlerchrysler is currently in talks with workers over the fate of 6,000 positions at its plant in sindelfingen near stuttgart .
unless it saves € 500 million in annual labor costs , daimlerchrysler has said it will move production of its mercedes c-class to cheaper sites in bremen and south africa . but whereas in germany offshoring has become synonymous for any attempt to move jobs abroad , in the united states and britain it frequently refers more specifically to outsourcing customer service call centers and it positions to cheaper facilities overseas . lagging behind that type of classic outsourcing has been slow to take off in germany , stymied by the country 's restrictive labor laws , language issues and the conservative nature of germany 's corporate culture . “ compared to us and uk companies , german interest in outsourcing has been much smaller , ” said andrew parker , an analyst for technology consultancy forrester .
although that was beginning to change , he said german offshoring was developing its own special focus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wipro employees undergo training in the use of specialized software to provide services to overseas clients at the company in bangalore , india .
india remains the dominant outsourcing destination for british and american firms , partly due to the high number of proficient english speakers there .
plenty of german companies also farm out it jobs and other back-office tasks to " offshore " indian operations , but parker said germany was looking more to " nearshore " central and eastern europe for many of its outsourcing needs . although it was more expensive than asia , parker said german clients appeared willing to pay a premium for geographic proximity and german language skills .
“ there are russian firms that still have a strong reservoir of german speaking developers in moscow and st. petersburg that they can tap into as needed , ” parker said . the benefits of language are obvious , but sometimes the " nearshore " helps facilitate " offshore " activities .
for example , us outsourcing giant eds each day ships truckloads of paper documents from clients in germany to its operations in nearby hungary so they can be scanned into the company ’ s database , thereby allowing the information to be processed electronically elsewhere around the world . creating jobs in germany however , offshoring is n't quite as simple as just siphoning off jobs to low-wage countries in eastern europe and asia .
surprisingly , it is also leading to more positions inside germany , at least for outsourcing companies .

speculation is growing that former star striker jürgen klinsmann will take over the vacant coaching job for germany 's national soccer team .
he would lead the squad into the 2006 world cup being held in germany . the president of the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- , gerhard mayer-vorfelder , held talks with klinsmann in new york on tuesday " to discuss the future planning for staffing of the national team , " a dfb spokesman said on wednesday . although it was not yet certain klinsmann would take over from rudi völler , who resigned last month after germany 's miserable euro 2004 campaign , he expressed his desire to help the national team get back on its feet . " the world cup is the most important sporting event of the past 40 years in germany .
it 's obvious that i 'll help the dfb , independently of the post , " klinsmann said . the 39-year-old former vfb stuttgart , inter milan and tottenham star , who won the world cup in 1990 , currently runs a sports marketing company in california .

outlining his goals for his country 's six-month eu presidency before the european parliament , dutch premier jan-peter balkenende has called for fairness in deciding whether to start accession talks with turkey . speaking before the newly elected parliament in strasbourg on wednesday , the christian democrat said eu countries must not be guided by a fear of islam when deciding about the bloc 's future relationship with turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende " resistance towards a religion is not consistent european values , " balkenende said . "
our resistance has to be focussed on people who abuse worshipping god to propagate violence . " in december , eu leaders will decide whether turkey meets the political and economic criteria to begin negotiations towards joining the bloc at some point in the future .
that process is expected to take at least 10 years . balkenende said turkey 's readiness for negotiations should be judged honestly but strictly on the existing criteria of human rights , democracy and the rule of law without inventing new conditions . refuting bin laden martin schulz , the leader of the european socialists , agreed with balkenende .
he added that the eu had raised turkey 's hopes to join the union and could not switch gears at this point . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin schulz " islam is n't the problem , " schulz -lrb- photo -rrb- said .

it must continue and intensify the implementation of democratic and economic reforms . " chirac has previously said he believes the path to turkish membership is " irreversible , " but he is at odds with many in his own union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- party and the public who believe the predominantly muslim country has no place in the club of 25 . the debate over turkey 's right to join the eu has been particularly robust in france , where there is strong opposition both from those who fear its implications for immigration and europe 's cultural heritage , and those who say it will mean the end of their vision for a politically integrated continent . abstention rather than opposition ? the nationalist leader philippe de villiers on tuesday condemned erdogan 's visit and what he described as chirac 's " determination " to see turkey join the eu .
he said he would ensure turkey 's membership is at the " heart of the debate " ahead of next year 's planned referendum on the eu constitution . as britain , germany and spain already lean towards supporting commencing negotiations with turkey , some think that it 's unlikely that france would block such a step .

using the threat of moving jobs abroad as a bargaining chip to get labor concessions is becoming popular amongst german companies .
but there 's more to outsourcing than the heated political debate it 's created . shifting jobs to low-wage countries to save costs is n't a particularly new phenomenon to germany .
but in recent months it has become an extremely sensitive topic in a country plagued by chronically high unemployment .
german chancellor gerhard schröder even called corporate outsourcing efforts " unpatriotic " this spring . " in the mid-1990s there was a wave of moving manufacturing jobs out of the country , " dr stephan wimmers from the german chamber of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- told dw-world .
" but now germany is also losing its advantage for better quality and capital-intensive jobs . " part of the new scrutiny of outsourcing began this spring when germany ’ s low-wage eastern neighbors poland and the czech republic finally joined the european union .
but a full-blown nationwide debate on the issue started in earnest in june , after electronics giant siemens convinced german workers that 2,000 jobs would be moved to hungary unless they moved from a 35-hour to a 40-hour workweek without added pay . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes c-class that encouraged several big companies to follow suit with similar offshoring threats .
carmaker daimlerchrysler is currently in talks with workers over the fate of 6,000 positions at its plant in sindelfingen near stuttgart .
unless it saves € 500 million in annual labor costs , daimlerchrysler has said it will move production of its mercedes c-class to cheaper sites in bremen and south africa . but whereas in germany offshoring has become synonymous for any attempt to move jobs abroad , in the united states and britain it frequently refers more specifically to outsourcing customer service call centers and it positions to cheaper facilities overseas . lagging behind that type of classic outsourcing has been slow to take off in germany , stymied by the country 's restrictive labor laws , language issues and the conservative nature of germany 's corporate culture . “ compared to us and uk companies , german interest in outsourcing has been much smaller , ” said andrew parker , an analyst for technology consultancy forrester .
although that was beginning to change , he said german offshoring was developing its own special focus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wipro employees undergo training in the use of specialized software to provide services to overseas clients at the company in bangalore , india .
india remains the dominant outsourcing destination for british and american firms , partly due to the high number of proficient english speakers there .
plenty of german companies also farm out it jobs and other back-office tasks to " offshore " indian operations , but parker said germany was looking more to " nearshore " central and eastern europe for many of its outsourcing needs . although it was more expensive than asia , parker said german clients appeared willing to pay a premium for geographic proximity and german language skills .
“ there are russian firms that still have a strong reservoir of german speaking developers in moscow and st. petersburg that they can tap into as needed , ” parker said . the benefits of language are obvious , but sometimes the " nearshore " helps facilitate " offshore " activities .
for example , us outsourcing giant eds each day ships truckloads of paper documents from clients in germany to its operations in nearby hungary so they can be scanned into the company ’ s database , thereby allowing the information to be processed electronically elsewhere around the world . creating jobs in germany however , offshoring is n't quite as simple as just siphoning off jobs to low-wage countries in eastern europe and asia .
surprisingly , it is also leading to more positions inside germany , at least for outsourcing companies . " we want to hire a lot of people locally , " debjit chaudhuri , head the german division of indian software and services outsourcing specialist infosys technologies , told dw-world . chaudhuri said he needed to expand his 200-person office near frankfurt in order to take advantage of corporate germany 's increasing appetite for outsourcing .
the burgeoning workload also means infosys is training people in india to become familiar with german culture . " they can ’ t all be in germany but they need to know how it is here .
the whole idea is to be as german as possible , " he said . marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de daimlerchrysler board may take salary cut to help defuse a growing labor dispute over longer working hours for employees , top managers at carmaker daimlerchrysler appear ready to accept large salary cuts .

outlining his goals for his country 's six-month eu presidency before the european parliament , dutch premier jan-peter balkenende has called for fairness in deciding whether to start accession talks with turkey . speaking before the newly elected parliament in strasbourg on wednesday , the christian democrat said eu countries must not be guided by a fear of islam when deciding about the bloc 's future relationship with turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende " resistance towards a religion is not consistent european values , " balkenende said . "
our resistance has to be focussed on people who abuse worshipping god to propagate violence . " in december , eu leaders will decide whether turkey meets the political and economic criteria to begin negotiations towards joining the bloc at some point in the future .
that process is expected to take at least 10 years . balkenende said turkey 's readiness for negotiations should be judged honestly but strictly on the existing criteria of human rights , democracy and the rule of law without inventing new conditions . refuting bin laden martin schulz , the leader of the european socialists , agreed with balkenende .
he added that the eu had raised turkey 's hopes to join the union and could not switch gears at this point . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin schulz " islam is n't the problem , " schulz -lrb- photo -rrb- said .
" if it were possible to show that western values and an islamic society are not mutually exclusive , the arguments of the world 's bin ladens would be refuted .
the increase in the level of security that europe could gain from this should not be dismissed lightly . " but hans-gert pöttering , schulz 's political opponent as leader of the conservatives in the european parliament , said that the union should offer turkey a special partnership but not full membership . france is on the fence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan earlier this week , turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan -lrb- photo -rrb- visited france to lobby for paris to support turkey 's accession to the eu . french president jacques chirac on tuesday reaffirmed his support for turkey 's eventual membership of the european union , without specifying any time frame . according to a chirac aide , the president said that " turkey 's integration into the eu is welcome as soon as it becomes possible ... turkey has made considerable progress .
it must continue and intensify the implementation of democratic and economic reforms . " chirac has previously said he believes the path to turkish membership is " irreversible , " but he is at odds with many in his own union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- party and the public who believe the predominantly muslim country has no place in the club of 25 . the debate over turkey 's right to join the eu has been particularly robust in france , where there is strong opposition both from those who fear its implications for immigration and europe 's cultural heritage , and those who say it will mean the end of their vision for a politically integrated continent . abstention rather than opposition ? the nationalist leader philippe de villiers on tuesday condemned erdogan 's visit and what he described as chirac 's " determination " to see turkey join the eu .
he said he would ensure turkey 's membership is at the " heart of the debate " ahead of next year 's planned referendum on the eu constitution . as britain , germany and spain already lean towards supporting commencing negotiations with turkey , some think that it 's unlikely that france would block such a step . " france will either fight for the opening of negotiations or abstain , because it does n't want to oppose the main european countries which have already come out clearly in favor , " didier billion , an expert on turkey and the deputy director of the paris-based institute for international and strategic relations , told reuters news agency .

using the threat of moving jobs abroad as a bargaining chip to get labor concessions is becoming popular amongst german companies .
but there 's more to outsourcing than the heated political debate it 's created . shifting jobs to low-wage countries to save costs is n't a particularly new phenomenon to germany .
but in recent months it has become an extremely sensitive topic in a country plagued by chronically high unemployment .
german chancellor gerhard schröder even called corporate outsourcing efforts " unpatriotic " this spring . " in the mid-1990s there was a wave of moving manufacturing jobs out of the country , " dr stephan wimmers from the german chamber of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- told dw-world .
" but now germany is also losing its advantage for better quality and capital-intensive jobs . " part of the new scrutiny of outsourcing began this spring when germany ’ s low-wage eastern neighbors poland and the czech republic finally joined the european union .
but a full-blown nationwide debate on the issue started in earnest in june , after electronics giant siemens convinced german workers that 2,000 jobs would be moved to hungary unless they moved from a 35-hour to a 40-hour workweek without added pay . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes c-class that encouraged several big companies to follow suit with similar offshoring threats .
carmaker daimlerchrysler is currently in talks with workers over the fate of 6,000 positions at its plant in sindelfingen near stuttgart .
unless it saves € 500 million in annual labor costs , daimlerchrysler has said it will move production of its mercedes c-class to cheaper sites in bremen and south africa . but whereas in germany offshoring has become synonymous for any attempt to move jobs abroad , in the united states and britain it frequently refers more specifically to outsourcing customer service call centers and it positions to cheaper facilities overseas . lagging behind that type of classic outsourcing has been slow to take off in germany , stymied by the country 's restrictive labor laws , language issues and the conservative nature of germany 's corporate culture . “ compared to us and uk companies , german interest in outsourcing has been much smaller , ” said andrew parker , an analyst for technology consultancy forrester .
although that was beginning to change , he said german offshoring was developing its own special focus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wipro employees undergo training in the use of specialized software to provide services to overseas clients at the company in bangalore , india .
india remains the dominant outsourcing destination for british and american firms , partly due to the high number of proficient english speakers there .
plenty of german companies also farm out it jobs and other back-office tasks to " offshore " indian operations , but parker said germany was looking more to " nearshore " central and eastern europe for many of its outsourcing needs . although it was more expensive than asia , parker said german clients appeared willing to pay a premium for geographic proximity and german language skills .
“ there are russian firms that still have a strong reservoir of german speaking developers in moscow and st. petersburg that they can tap into as needed , ” parker said . the benefits of language are obvious , but sometimes the " nearshore " helps facilitate " offshore " activities .
for example , us outsourcing giant eds each day ships truckloads of paper documents from clients in germany to its operations in nearby hungary so they can be scanned into the company ’ s database , thereby allowing the information to be processed electronically elsewhere around the world . creating jobs in germany however , offshoring is n't quite as simple as just siphoning off jobs to low-wage countries in eastern europe and asia .
surprisingly , it is also leading to more positions inside germany , at least for outsourcing companies . " we want to hire a lot of people locally , " debjit chaudhuri , head the german division of indian software and services outsourcing specialist infosys technologies , told dw-world . chaudhuri said he needed to expand his 200-person office near frankfurt in order to take advantage of corporate germany 's increasing appetite for outsourcing .
the burgeoning workload also means infosys is training people in india to become familiar with german culture . " they can ’ t all be in germany but they need to know how it is here .

speculation is growing that former star striker jürgen klinsmann will take over the vacant coaching job for germany 's national soccer team .
he would lead the squad into the 2006 world cup being held in germany . the president of the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- , gerhard mayer-vorfelder , held talks with klinsmann in new york on tuesday " to discuss the future planning for staffing of the national team , " a dfb spokesman said on wednesday . although it was not yet certain klinsmann would take over from rudi völler , who resigned last month after germany 's miserable euro 2004 campaign , he expressed his desire to help the national team get back on its feet . " the world cup is the most important sporting event of the past 40 years in germany .
it 's obvious that i 'll help the dfb , independently of the post , " klinsmann said . the 39-year-old former vfb stuttgart , inter milan and tottenham star , who won the world cup in 1990 , currently runs a sports marketing company in california .
he holds a training license but does not have any professional coaching experience . bierhoff as manager but according to media reports , klinsmann was now the frontrunner for the top coaching spot and another former star striker , oliver bierhoff , is set to fill the newly created position of team manager .
bierhoff , who is known to be a close friend of klinsmann , has already expressed his interest working with him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soccer star oliver bierhoff " if jürgen will agree to be coach , then i can imagine the job will be a lot of fun - that would be a good model , " bierhoff said according to the associated press . klinsmann has also been a vocal critic of the dfb 's recent disorganization and bumbling in trying to find a replacement for völler .
after ex-bayern munich coach ottmar hitzfeld balked at taking the job , german soccer officials have flailed about embarrassingly in their search . euro 2004-winning greece coach otto rehhagel said he 'd serve out his contract with the greeks and the dfb has been reluctant to sign a foreign coach like dutchman guus hiddink and dane morten olsen . most observers believe a klinsmann-bierhoff tandem would be an elegant solution , which would represent a fresh start for the national squad .
both are know for their intelligence and international experience that could serve germany well as it hosts the sport 's biggest event in 2006 . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's most unwanted the coach of germany 's national soccer team still remains unfilled despite once being a coveted and prestigious position .

speculation is growing that former star striker jürgen klinsmann will take over the vacant coaching job for germany 's national soccer team .
he would lead the squad into the 2006 world cup being held in germany . the president of the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- , gerhard mayer-vorfelder , held talks with klinsmann in new york on tuesday " to discuss the future planning for staffing of the national team , " a dfb spokesman said on wednesday . although it was not yet certain klinsmann would take over from rudi völler , who resigned last month after germany 's miserable euro 2004 campaign , he expressed his desire to help the national team get back on its feet . " the world cup is the most important sporting event of the past 40 years in germany .

bierhoff , who is known to be a close friend of klinsmann , has already expressed his interest working with him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soccer star oliver bierhoff " if jürgen will agree to be coach , then i can imagine the job will be a lot of fun - that would be a good model , " bierhoff said according to the associated press . klinsmann has also been a vocal critic of the dfb 's recent disorganization and bumbling in trying to find a replacement for völler .
after ex-bayern munich coach ottmar hitzfeld balked at taking the job , german soccer officials have flailed about embarrassingly in their search . euro 2004-winning greece coach otto rehhagel said he 'd serve out his contract with the greeks and the dfb has been reluctant to sign a foreign coach like dutchman guus hiddink and dane morten olsen . most observers believe a klinsmann-bierhoff tandem would be an elegant solution , which would represent a fresh start for the national squad .

begun in august 2000 , the program hoped to attract 20,000 highly skilled workers to the country in three years .
but by the end of that time , only 14,000 foreign workers had taken advantage of the visa project - 4,000 of them were from india .
many complained that the program was overly bureaucratic .
time limitations on the work visas as well as restrictions on bringing family members over dampened the enthusiasm of many . " it 's easier for a terrorist to get asylum in germany than it is for a foreign software expert to enter the german labor market , " one indian computer specialist told fischer during the meeting in bombay . fischer assured the audience that new immigrations laws to take effect in january would change that . pushing business ties the foreign minister also did some campaigning for germany as a location for industry , saying that his country 's highly developed infrastructure and location in the middle of the european union made for " excellent conditions " for foreign companies . he also appealed to german companies to take advantage of " the enormous opportunities " offered by the indian market and announced a visit this fall by chancellor gerhard schröder , who will be accompanied by a large business delegation .
fischer called on india to cut some of its red tape in order to improve its attractiveness to foreign investors . he praised progress in the peace process with india 's long-time rival pakistan , saying a lasting peace between the neighbors was important to convince investors that the region was a profitable and secure place to do business . on wednesday night , fischer flew to pakistan for a two-day visit there .

the case has been seen as putting german corporate governance in the dock . the presiding judge , brigitte koppenhföer , already said in a preliminary assessment half-way through the trial in march that while the actions of ackermann and his five co-defendants may have breached german stock law - which would be a civil matter - they were not serious enough to warrant a criminal conviction .

using the threat of moving jobs abroad as a bargaining chip to get labor concessions is becoming popular amongst german companies .
but there 's more to outsourcing than the heated political debate it 's created . shifting jobs to low-wage countries to save costs is n't a particularly new phenomenon to germany .
but in recent months it has become an extremely sensitive topic in a country plagued by chronically high unemployment .
german chancellor gerhard schröder even called corporate outsourcing efforts " unpatriotic " this spring . " in the mid-1990s there was a wave of moving manufacturing jobs out of the country , " dr stephan wimmers from the german chamber of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- told dw-world .
" but now germany is also losing its advantage for better quality and capital-intensive jobs . " part of the new scrutiny of outsourcing began this spring when germany ’ s low-wage eastern neighbors poland and the czech republic finally joined the european union .
but a full-blown nationwide debate on the issue started in earnest in june , after electronics giant siemens convinced german workers that 2,000 jobs would be moved to hungary unless they moved from a 35-hour to a 40-hour workweek without added pay . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes c-class that encouraged several big companies to follow suit with similar offshoring threats .
carmaker daimlerchrysler is currently in talks with workers over the fate of 6,000 positions at its plant in sindelfingen near stuttgart .
unless it saves € 500 million in annual labor costs , daimlerchrysler has said it will move production of its mercedes c-class to cheaper sites in bremen and south africa . but whereas in germany offshoring has become synonymous for any attempt to move jobs abroad , in the united states and britain it frequently refers more specifically to outsourcing customer service call centers and it positions to cheaper facilities overseas . lagging behind that type of classic outsourcing has been slow to take off in germany , stymied by the country 's restrictive labor laws , language issues and the conservative nature of germany 's corporate culture . “ compared to us and uk companies , german interest in outsourcing has been much smaller , ” said andrew parker , an analyst for technology consultancy forrester .
although that was beginning to change , he said german offshoring was developing its own special focus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wipro employees undergo training in the use of specialized software to provide services to overseas clients at the company in bangalore , india .
india remains the dominant outsourcing destination for british and american firms , partly due to the high number of proficient english speakers there .
plenty of german companies also farm out it jobs and other back-office tasks to " offshore " indian operations , but parker said germany was looking more to " nearshore " central and eastern europe for many of its outsourcing needs . although it was more expensive than asia , parker said german clients appeared willing to pay a premium for geographic proximity and german language skills .
“ there are russian firms that still have a strong reservoir of german speaking developers in moscow and st. petersburg that they can tap into as needed , ” parker said . the benefits of language are obvious , but sometimes the " nearshore " helps facilitate " offshore " activities .
for example , us outsourcing giant eds each day ships truckloads of paper documents from clients in germany to its operations in nearby hungary so they can be scanned into the company ’ s database , thereby allowing the information to be processed electronically elsewhere around the world . creating jobs in germany however , offshoring is n't quite as simple as just siphoning off jobs to low-wage countries in eastern europe and asia .
surprisingly , it is also leading to more positions inside germany , at least for outsourcing companies . " we want to hire a lot of people locally , " debjit chaudhuri , head the german division of indian software and services outsourcing specialist infosys technologies , told dw-world . chaudhuri said he needed to expand his 200-person office near frankfurt in order to take advantage of corporate germany 's increasing appetite for outsourcing .
the burgeoning workload also means infosys is training people in india to become familiar with german culture . " they can ’ t all be in germany but they need to know how it is here .

using the threat of moving jobs abroad as a bargaining chip to get labor concessions is becoming popular amongst german companies .
but there 's more to outsourcing than the heated political debate it 's created . shifting jobs to low-wage countries to save costs is n't a particularly new phenomenon to germany .
but in recent months it has become an extremely sensitive topic in a country plagued by chronically high unemployment .
german chancellor gerhard schröder even called corporate outsourcing efforts " unpatriotic " this spring . " in the mid-1990s there was a wave of moving manufacturing jobs out of the country , " dr stephan wimmers from the german chamber of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- told dw-world .
" but now germany is also losing its advantage for better quality and capital-intensive jobs . " part of the new scrutiny of outsourcing began this spring when germany ’ s low-wage eastern neighbors poland and the czech republic finally joined the european union .
but a full-blown nationwide debate on the issue started in earnest in june , after electronics giant siemens convinced german workers that 2,000 jobs would be moved to hungary unless they moved from a 35-hour to a 40-hour workweek without added pay . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes c-class that encouraged several big companies to follow suit with similar offshoring threats .
carmaker daimlerchrysler is currently in talks with workers over the fate of 6,000 positions at its plant in sindelfingen near stuttgart .
unless it saves € 500 million in annual labor costs , daimlerchrysler has said it will move production of its mercedes c-class to cheaper sites in bremen and south africa . but whereas in germany offshoring has become synonymous for any attempt to move jobs abroad , in the united states and britain it frequently refers more specifically to outsourcing customer service call centers and it positions to cheaper facilities overseas . lagging behind that type of classic outsourcing has been slow to take off in germany , stymied by the country 's restrictive labor laws , language issues and the conservative nature of germany 's corporate culture . “ compared to us and uk companies , german interest in outsourcing has been much smaller , ” said andrew parker , an analyst for technology consultancy forrester .
although that was beginning to change , he said german offshoring was developing its own special focus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wipro employees undergo training in the use of specialized software to provide services to overseas clients at the company in bangalore , india .
india remains the dominant outsourcing destination for british and american firms , partly due to the high number of proficient english speakers there .
plenty of german companies also farm out it jobs and other back-office tasks to " offshore " indian operations , but parker said germany was looking more to " nearshore " central and eastern europe for many of its outsourcing needs . although it was more expensive than asia , parker said german clients appeared willing to pay a premium for geographic proximity and german language skills .
“ there are russian firms that still have a strong reservoir of german speaking developers in moscow and st. petersburg that they can tap into as needed , ” parker said . the benefits of language are obvious , but sometimes the " nearshore " helps facilitate " offshore " activities .
for example , us outsourcing giant eds each day ships truckloads of paper documents from clients in germany to its operations in nearby hungary so they can be scanned into the company ’ s database , thereby allowing the information to be processed electronically elsewhere around the world . creating jobs in germany however , offshoring is n't quite as simple as just siphoning off jobs to low-wage countries in eastern europe and asia .
surprisingly , it is also leading to more positions inside germany , at least for outsourcing companies . " we want to hire a lot of people locally , " debjit chaudhuri , head the german division of indian software and services outsourcing specialist infosys technologies , told dw-world . chaudhuri said he needed to expand his 200-person office near frankfurt in order to take advantage of corporate germany 's increasing appetite for outsourcing .
the burgeoning workload also means infosys is training people in india to become familiar with german culture . " they can ’ t all be in germany but they need to know how it is here .
the whole idea is to be as german as possible , " he said . marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de daimlerchrysler board may take salary cut to help defuse a growing labor dispute over longer working hours for employees , top managers at carmaker daimlerchrysler appear ready to accept large salary cuts .
the company had threatened to move jobs to save costs .

the top three locations all scored high marks when it came to economic structures , low unemployment figures , and ability to compete .
the study concluded that southern germany is likely to have a far better business future than the northern half of the country .
with the exception of the northern city of wolfsburg , home to volkswagen , the top 10 list of best business locations consisted entirely of cities and regions in the southern states of bavaria , baden-württemberg , and hesse .
handelsblatt reported that generally , locations in the north and west of the country are looking at an " average " future , although the cities of düsseldorf and hamburg both scored well .
the paper also identified eastern german cities such as jena , dresden and potsdam as locations with a promising economic future . more briefs 22.07.2004 -pipe- daimlerchrysler resumes negotiations 21.07.2004 -pipe- volkswagen refines savings plans 21.07.2004 -pipe- bundesbank seals code of ethics for top managers 21.07.2004 -pipe- germans already working 42 hours a week 20.07.2004 -pipe- tensions continue at daimlerchrysler german plant 20.07.2004 -pipe- investor confidence rises in july 20.07.2004 -pipe- infineon posts unexpected loss 19.07.2004 -pipe- german , swiss stock exchanges mull merger radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

as of late wednesday , no agreement had been reached , and talks continued into the night before being broken off . on thursday morning , representatives met in small circles to continue negotiating .
" it makes more sense to try and untie the knots in smaller groups , " said union spokesman uwe meinhard .
the head of the workers ' council said that talks with management had reached a " very difficult phase . "
daimlerchrysler has faced a week of protests and work stoppages in response to its demand that workers accommodate a € 500 million -lrb- $ 620 million -rrb- reduction in labor costs annually , or see 6,000 jobs moved from its factory in sindelfingen , near stuttgart , to bremen and south africa .
should the talks fail to reach agreement on thursday , employee representatives have said there will be nationwide protests . dw-world.de unions wary of executive pay cut offer trade union leaders on monday had a mixed reaction to an offer by daimlerchrysler executives to take a pay cut if workers agree to do the same .
negotiations are expected to resume on tuesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 22.07.2004 -pipe- 14:00 utc bright future ahead for southern germany the best future business locations in germany are munich , stuttgart , and the region surrounding the junction of the rivers rhine and main near frankfurt , according to a study by the consultancy firm prognos and the german business daily handelsblatt .
the top three locations all scored high marks when it came to economic structures , low unemployment figures , and ability to compete .
the study concluded that southern germany is likely to have a far better business future than the northern half of the country .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 22.07.2004 eu parliament confirms barroso großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso will become eu commission president in november the european parliament has confirmed jose barroso as the next president of the european commission on thursday .
413 of the legislature 's 732 members voted for him . eu leaders agreed on barroso in june as a compromise candidate to replace outgoing commission president romano prodi .
barroso has since embarked on a charm offensive to win over the various factions of the european parliament .
on wednesday , the day before the vote , he summarized his plans for the new executive . barroso headed a conservative government in portugal , and many socialist and green meps are still skeptical about his efforts to present himself as an unbiased , centrist reformer . “ i will not be the president of the right against the left , or the left against the right , that i can promise you , ” he said . but barroso ’ s assertive campaign , conducted in fluent french , portuguese and english , has convinced others to support the commission ’ s candidate .
when barroso ’ s nomination was announced , irish premier bertie ahern gave him his enthusiastic backing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president romano prodi , right , and bertie ahern “ jose manuel durao barroso has the qualities that are needed for a strong and independent commission in these times , " ahern -lrb- photo , left -rrb- said .
" i know that he will lead the commission with strength , vigour , and vision . ” explaining the eu to its citizens following record low voter turnouts in the recent european elections , one of barroso ’ s key concerns is the need for eu institutions to do a better job of explaining their policies to european citizens .
he also told the european parliament that he hopes to act as a bridge between old and new eu members , as well as between the richer and poorer countries , and urged meps to confirm him in his candidacy . bildunterschrift : general view of the newly elected european parliament “ i need your support - not only personal support to me but support to the commission , " he said .
" because we need in this moment of europe , we need a strong , credible , independent commission , and the only way to have a strong commission , to say sometimes no to some member states , is to have the strong backing of the european parliament . ” “ no ” has been durao barroso 's response to leaders who have called for the rewriting of the european growth and stability pact , which ensures the stability of europe 's common currency , the euro . on wednesday he referred only to the need to ensure both flexibility and monetary stability , but he has previously stated his belief that the eu ’ s budgetary limitations , which are being broken with virtual impunity by germany , france and italy , should be respected .

413 of the legislature 's 732 members voted for him . eu leaders agreed on barroso in june as a compromise candidate to replace outgoing commission president romano prodi .
barroso has since embarked on a charm offensive to win over the various factions of the european parliament .
on wednesday , the day before the vote , he summarized his plans for the new executive . barroso headed a conservative government in portugal , and many socialist and green meps are still skeptical about his efforts to present himself as an unbiased , centrist reformer . “ i will not be the president of the right against the left , or the left against the right , that i can promise you , ” he said . but barroso ’ s assertive campaign , conducted in fluent french , portuguese and english , has convinced others to support the commission ’ s candidate .
when barroso ’ s nomination was announced , irish premier bertie ahern gave him his enthusiastic backing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president romano prodi , right , and bertie ahern “ jose manuel durao barroso has the qualities that are needed for a strong and independent commission in these times , " ahern -lrb- photo , left -rrb- said .
" i know that he will lead the commission with strength , vigour , and vision . ” explaining the eu to its citizens following record low voter turnouts in the recent european elections , one of barroso ’ s key concerns is the need for eu institutions to do a better job of explaining their policies to european citizens .
he also told the european parliament that he hopes to act as a bridge between old and new eu members , as well as between the richer and poorer countries , and urged meps to confirm him in his candidacy . bildunterschrift : general view of the newly elected european parliament “ i need your support - not only personal support to me but support to the commission , " he said .
" because we need in this moment of europe , we need a strong , credible , independent commission , and the only way to have a strong commission , to say sometimes no to some member states , is to have the strong backing of the european parliament . ” “ no ” has been durao barroso 's response to leaders who have called for the rewriting of the european growth and stability pact , which ensures the stability of europe 's common currency , the euro . on wednesday he referred only to the need to ensure both flexibility and monetary stability , but he has previously stated his belief that the eu ’ s budgetary limitations , which are being broken with virtual impunity by germany , france and italy , should be respected .
guiding the eu constitution towards ratification is also one of his priorities . from maoist to war supporter a former maoist student activist under the portuguese dictatorship of antonio salazar , barroso ’ s politics shifted to the right after the restoration of democracy in 1974 .

as of late wednesday , no agreement had been reached , and talks continued into the night before being broken off . on thursday morning , representatives met in small circles to continue negotiating .
" it makes more sense to try and untie the knots in smaller groups , " said union spokesman uwe meinhard .
the head of the workers ' council said that talks with management had reached a " very difficult phase . "
daimlerchrysler has faced a week of protests and work stoppages in response to its demand that workers accommodate a € 500 million -lrb- $ 620 million -rrb- reduction in labor costs annually , or see 6,000 jobs moved from its factory in sindelfingen , near stuttgart , to bremen and south africa .
should the talks fail to reach agreement on thursday , employee representatives have said there will be nationwide protests . dw-world.de unions wary of executive pay cut offer trade union leaders on monday had a mixed reaction to an offer by daimlerchrysler executives to take a pay cut if workers agree to do the same .
negotiations are expected to resume on tuesday .

413 of the legislature 's 732 members voted for him . eu leaders agreed on barroso in june as a compromise candidate to replace outgoing commission president romano prodi .
barroso has since embarked on a charm offensive to win over the various factions of the european parliament .
on wednesday , the day before the vote , he summarized his plans for the new executive . barroso headed a conservative government in portugal , and many socialist and green meps are still skeptical about his efforts to present himself as an unbiased , centrist reformer . “ i will not be the president of the right against the left , or the left against the right , that i can promise you , ” he said . but barroso ’ s assertive campaign , conducted in fluent french , portuguese and english , has convinced others to support the commission ’ s candidate .
when barroso ’ s nomination was announced , irish premier bertie ahern gave him his enthusiastic backing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president romano prodi , right , and bertie ahern “ jose manuel durao barroso has the qualities that are needed for a strong and independent commission in these times , " ahern -lrb- photo , left -rrb- said .
" i know that he will lead the commission with strength , vigour , and vision . ” explaining the eu to its citizens following record low voter turnouts in the recent european elections , one of barroso ’ s key concerns is the need for eu institutions to do a better job of explaining their policies to european citizens .
he also told the european parliament that he hopes to act as a bridge between old and new eu members , as well as between the richer and poorer countries , and urged meps to confirm him in his candidacy . bildunterschrift : general view of the newly elected european parliament “ i need your support - not only personal support to me but support to the commission , " he said .
" because we need in this moment of europe , we need a strong , credible , independent commission , and the only way to have a strong commission , to say sometimes no to some member states , is to have the strong backing of the european parliament . ” “ no ” has been durao barroso 's response to leaders who have called for the rewriting of the european growth and stability pact , which ensures the stability of europe 's common currency , the euro . on wednesday he referred only to the need to ensure both flexibility and monetary stability , but he has previously stated his belief that the eu ’ s budgetary limitations , which are being broken with virtual impunity by germany , france and italy , should be respected .
guiding the eu constitution towards ratification is also one of his priorities . from maoist to war supporter a former maoist student activist under the portuguese dictatorship of antonio salazar , barroso ’ s politics shifted to the right after the restoration of democracy in 1974 .
he won his first senior government post at the age of just 29 , and had seven years later he had already served as foreign minister .
in 1999 he took over the leadership of his conservative social democratic party , winning the election in 2002 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. president george bush , center , british prime minister tony blair , second from left , and spain 's prime minister jose maria aznar , right , seen together with portugal 's prime minister jose manuel durao barroso , left , after arriving in the azores march 16 , 2003 to attend a summit to discuss the crisis with iraq barroso supported the us-led war on iraq , a decision for which he has been heavily criticized both in his own country and abroad , and one he defended in recent days as one of the most difficult of his life .

but the federal labor agency said it intends to keep the workers it 's hired from the west , arguing they 've already been trained , and their contracts only go until the end of june 2005 .
western workers from the deutsche telekom subsidiary vivento who volunteered to take jobs in the east counselling the unemployed were offered a € 5,000 -lrb- $ 6,100 -rrb- " flexibility " premium - a practice that has outraged government leaders in the eastern states .
saxony 's state premier , georg milbradt , said the program showed how little understanding the federal government had for the situation in the east .
" why should we take people from bavaria , which hardly has any unemployment and pay them generous premiums when there are enough well-trained unemployed people in the east to do these jobs ? "

speculation is growing that former star striker jürgen klinsmann will take over the vacant coaching job for germany 's national soccer team .
he would lead the squad into the 2006 world cup being held in germany . the president of the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- , gerhard mayer-vorfelder , held talks with klinsmann in new york on tuesday " to discuss the future planning for staffing of the national team , " a dfb spokesman said on wednesday . although it was not yet certain klinsmann would take over from rudi völler , who resigned last month after germany 's miserable euro 2004 campaign , he expressed his desire to help the national team get back on its feet . " the world cup is the most important sporting event of the past 40 years in germany .
it 's obvious that i 'll help the dfb , independently of the post , " klinsmann said . the 39-year-old former vfb stuttgart , inter milan and tottenham star , who won the world cup in 1990 , currently runs a sports marketing company in california .
he holds a training license but does not have any professional coaching experience . bierhoff as manager but according to media reports , klinsmann was now the frontrunner for the top coaching spot and another former star striker , oliver bierhoff , is set to fill the newly created position of team manager .
bierhoff , who is known to be a close friend of klinsmann , has already expressed his interest working with him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soccer star oliver bierhoff " if jürgen will agree to be coach , then i can imagine the job will be a lot of fun - that would be a good model , " bierhoff said according to the associated press . klinsmann has also been a vocal critic of the dfb 's recent disorganization and bumbling in trying to find a replacement for völler .
after ex-bayern munich coach ottmar hitzfeld balked at taking the job , german soccer officials have flailed about embarrassingly in their search . euro 2004-winning greece coach otto rehhagel said he 'd serve out his contract with the greeks and the dfb has been reluctant to sign a foreign coach like dutchman guus hiddink and dane morten olsen . most observers believe a klinsmann-bierhoff tandem would be an elegant solution , which would represent a fresh start for the national squad .

speculation is growing that former star striker jürgen klinsmann will take over the vacant coaching job for germany 's national soccer team .
he would lead the squad into the 2006 world cup being held in germany . the president of the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- , gerhard mayer-vorfelder , held talks with klinsmann in new york on tuesday " to discuss the future planning for staffing of the national team , " a dfb spokesman said on wednesday . although it was not yet certain klinsmann would take over from rudi völler , who resigned last month after germany 's miserable euro 2004 campaign , he expressed his desire to help the national team get back on its feet .

outlining his goals for his country 's six-month eu presidency before the european parliament , dutch premier jan-peter balkenende has called for fairness in deciding whether to start accession talks with turkey . speaking before the newly elected parliament in strasbourg on wednesday , the christian democrat said eu countries must not be guided by a fear of islam when deciding about the bloc 's future relationship with turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende " resistance towards a religion is not consistent european values , " balkenende said . "
our resistance has to be focussed on people who abuse worshipping god to propagate violence . " in december , eu leaders will decide whether turkey meets the political and economic criteria to begin negotiations towards joining the bloc at some point in the future .
that process is expected to take at least 10 years . balkenende said turkey 's readiness for negotiations should be judged honestly but strictly on the existing criteria of human rights , democracy and the rule of law without inventing new conditions . refuting bin laden martin schulz , the leader of the european socialists , agreed with balkenende .
he added that the eu had raised turkey 's hopes to join the union and could not switch gears at this point . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin schulz " islam is n't the problem , " schulz -lrb- photo -rrb- said .
" if it were possible to show that western values and an islamic society are not mutually exclusive , the arguments of the world 's bin ladens would be refuted .
the increase in the level of security that europe could gain from this should not be dismissed lightly . " but hans-gert pöttering , schulz 's political opponent as leader of the conservatives in the european parliament , said that the union should offer turkey a special partnership but not full membership . france is on the fence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan earlier this week , turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan -lrb- photo -rrb- visited france to lobby for paris to support turkey 's accession to the eu . french president jacques chirac on tuesday reaffirmed his support for turkey 's eventual membership of the european union , without specifying any time frame . according to a chirac aide , the president said that " turkey 's integration into the eu is welcome as soon as it becomes possible ... turkey has made considerable progress .
it must continue and intensify the implementation of democratic and economic reforms . " chirac has previously said he believes the path to turkish membership is " irreversible , " but he is at odds with many in his own union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- party and the public who believe the predominantly muslim country has no place in the club of 25 . the debate over turkey 's right to join the eu has been particularly robust in france , where there is strong opposition both from those who fear its implications for immigration and europe 's cultural heritage , and those who say it will mean the end of their vision for a politically integrated continent . abstention rather than opposition ? the nationalist leader philippe de villiers on tuesday condemned erdogan 's visit and what he described as chirac 's " determination " to see turkey join the eu .
he said he would ensure turkey 's membership is at the " heart of the debate " ahead of next year 's planned referendum on the eu constitution . as britain , germany and spain already lean towards supporting commencing negotiations with turkey , some think that it 's unlikely that france would block such a step . " france will either fight for the opening of negotiations or abstain , because it does n't want to oppose the main european countries which have already come out clearly in favor , " didier billion , an expert on turkey and the deputy director of the paris-based institute for international and strategic relations , told reuters news agency .

outlining his goals for his country 's six-month eu presidency before the european parliament , dutch premier jan-peter balkenende has called for fairness in deciding whether to start accession talks with turkey . speaking before the newly elected parliament in strasbourg on wednesday , the christian democrat said eu countries must not be guided by a fear of islam when deciding about the bloc 's future relationship with turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende " resistance towards a religion is not consistent european values , " balkenende said . "
our resistance has to be focussed on people who abuse worshipping god to propagate violence . " in december , eu leaders will decide whether turkey meets the political and economic criteria to begin negotiations towards joining the bloc at some point in the future .
that process is expected to take at least 10 years . balkenende said turkey 's readiness for negotiations should be judged honestly but strictly on the existing criteria of human rights , democracy and the rule of law without inventing new conditions . refuting bin laden martin schulz , the leader of the european socialists , agreed with balkenende .

" if it were possible to show that western values and an islamic society are not mutually exclusive , the arguments of the world 's bin ladens would be refuted .
the increase in the level of security that europe could gain from this should not be dismissed lightly .

it must continue and intensify the implementation of democratic and economic reforms . " chirac has previously said he believes the path to turkish membership is " irreversible , " but he is at odds with many in his own union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- party and the public who believe the predominantly muslim country has no place in the club of 25 . the debate over turkey 's right to join the eu has been particularly robust in france , where there is strong opposition both from those who fear its implications for immigration and europe 's cultural heritage , and those who say it will mean the end of their vision for a politically integrated continent . abstention rather than opposition ? the nationalist leader philippe de villiers on tuesday condemned erdogan 's visit and what he described as chirac 's " determination " to see turkey join the eu .
he said he would ensure turkey 's membership is at the " heart of the debate " ahead of next year 's planned referendum on the eu constitution . as britain , germany and spain already lean towards supporting commencing negotiations with turkey , some think that it 's unlikely that france would block such a step . " france will either fight for the opening of negotiations or abstain , because it does n't want to oppose the main european countries which have already come out clearly in favor , " didier billion , an expert on turkey and the deputy director of the paris-based institute for international and strategic relations , told reuters news agency .

outlining his goals for his country 's six-month eu presidency before the european parliament , dutch premier jan-peter balkenende has called for fairness in deciding whether to start accession talks with turkey . speaking before the newly elected parliament in strasbourg on wednesday , the christian democrat said eu countries must not be guided by a fear of islam when deciding about the bloc 's future relationship with turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende " resistance towards a religion is not consistent european values , " balkenende said . "
our resistance has to be focussed on people who abuse worshipping god to propagate violence . " in december , eu leaders will decide whether turkey meets the political and economic criteria to begin negotiations towards joining the bloc at some point in the future .
that process is expected to take at least 10 years . balkenende said turkey 's readiness for negotiations should be judged honestly but strictly on the existing criteria of human rights , democracy and the rule of law without inventing new conditions . refuting bin laden martin schulz , the leader of the european socialists , agreed with balkenende .
he added that the eu had raised turkey 's hopes to join the union and could not switch gears at this point . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin schulz " islam is n't the problem , " schulz -lrb- photo -rrb- said .
" if it were possible to show that western values and an islamic society are not mutually exclusive , the arguments of the world 's bin ladens would be refuted .
the increase in the level of security that europe could gain from this should not be dismissed lightly . " but hans-gert pöttering , schulz 's political opponent as leader of the conservatives in the european parliament , said that the union should offer turkey a special partnership but not full membership . france is on the fence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan earlier this week , turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan -lrb- photo -rrb- visited france to lobby for paris to support turkey 's accession to the eu . french president jacques chirac on tuesday reaffirmed his support for turkey 's eventual membership of the european union , without specifying any time frame . according to a chirac aide , the president said that " turkey 's integration into the eu is welcome as soon as it becomes possible ... turkey has made considerable progress .
it must continue and intensify the implementation of democratic and economic reforms . " chirac has previously said he believes the path to turkish membership is " irreversible , " but he is at odds with many in his own union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- party and the public who believe the predominantly muslim country has no place in the club of 25 . the debate over turkey 's right to join the eu has been particularly robust in france , where there is strong opposition both from those who fear its implications for immigration and europe 's cultural heritage , and those who say it will mean the end of their vision for a politically integrated continent . abstention rather than opposition ? the nationalist leader philippe de villiers on tuesday condemned erdogan 's visit and what he described as chirac 's " determination " to see turkey join the eu .
he said he would ensure turkey 's membership is at the " heart of the debate " ahead of next year 's planned referendum on the eu constitution . as britain , germany and spain already lean towards supporting commencing negotiations with turkey , some think that it 's unlikely that france would block such a step . " france will either fight for the opening of negotiations or abstain , because it does n't want to oppose the main european countries which have already come out clearly in favor , " didier billion , an expert on turkey and the deputy director of the paris-based institute for international and strategic relations , told reuters news agency .

but the federal labor agency said it intends to keep the workers it 's hired from the west , arguing they 've already been trained , and their contracts only go until the end of june 2005 .
western workers from the deutsche telekom subsidiary vivento who volunteered to take jobs in the east counselling the unemployed were offered a € 5,000 -lrb- $ 6,100 -rrb- " flexibility " premium - a practice that has outraged government leaders in the eastern states .
saxony 's state premier , georg milbradt , said the program showed how little understanding the federal government had for the situation in the east .
" why should we take people from bavaria , which hardly has any unemployment and pay them generous premiums when there are enough well-trained unemployed people in the east to do these jobs ? "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 22.07.2004 -pipe- 13:00 utc daimlerchrysler resumes negotiations union representatives and members of daimlerchrysler 's workers ' council and board of directors have resumed negotiations about the company 's cost-saving proposals .
as of late wednesday , no agreement had been reached , and talks continued into the night before being broken off . on thursday morning , representatives met in small circles to continue negotiating .
" it makes more sense to try and untie the knots in smaller groups , " said union spokesman uwe meinhard .
the head of the workers ' council said that talks with management had reached a " very difficult phase . "
daimlerchrysler has faced a week of protests and work stoppages in response to its demand that workers accommodate a € 500 million -lrb- $ 620 million -rrb- reduction in labor costs annually , or see 6,000 jobs moved from its factory in sindelfingen , near stuttgart , to bremen and south africa .

using the threat of moving jobs abroad as a bargaining chip to get labor concessions is becoming popular amongst german companies .
but there 's more to outsourcing than the heated political debate it 's created . shifting jobs to low-wage countries to save costs is n't a particularly new phenomenon to germany .
but in recent months it has become an extremely sensitive topic in a country plagued by chronically high unemployment .
german chancellor gerhard schröder even called corporate outsourcing efforts " unpatriotic " this spring . " in the mid-1990s there was a wave of moving manufacturing jobs out of the country , " dr stephan wimmers from the german chamber of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- told dw-world .
" but now germany is also losing its advantage for better quality and capital-intensive jobs . " part of the new scrutiny of outsourcing began this spring when germany ’ s low-wage eastern neighbors poland and the czech republic finally joined the european union .
but a full-blown nationwide debate on the issue started in earnest in june , after electronics giant siemens convinced german workers that 2,000 jobs would be moved to hungary unless they moved from a 35-hour to a 40-hour workweek without added pay . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes c-class that encouraged several big companies to follow suit with similar offshoring threats .
carmaker daimlerchrysler is currently in talks with workers over the fate of 6,000 positions at its plant in sindelfingen near stuttgart .
unless it saves € 500 million in annual labor costs , daimlerchrysler has said it will move production of its mercedes c-class to cheaper sites in bremen and south africa . but whereas in germany offshoring has become synonymous for any attempt to move jobs abroad , in the united states and britain it frequently refers more specifically to outsourcing customer service call centers and it positions to cheaper facilities overseas . lagging behind that type of classic outsourcing has been slow to take off in germany , stymied by the country 's restrictive labor laws , language issues and the conservative nature of germany 's corporate culture . “ compared to us and uk companies , german interest in outsourcing has been much smaller , ” said andrew parker , an analyst for technology consultancy forrester .
although that was beginning to change , he said german offshoring was developing its own special focus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wipro employees undergo training in the use of specialized software to provide services to overseas clients at the company in bangalore , india .
india remains the dominant outsourcing destination for british and american firms , partly due to the high number of proficient english speakers there .
plenty of german companies also farm out it jobs and other back-office tasks to " offshore " indian operations , but parker said germany was looking more to " nearshore " central and eastern europe for many of its outsourcing needs . although it was more expensive than asia , parker said german clients appeared willing to pay a premium for geographic proximity and german language skills .
“ there are russian firms that still have a strong reservoir of german speaking developers in moscow and st. petersburg that they can tap into as needed , ” parker said . the benefits of language are obvious , but sometimes the " nearshore " helps facilitate " offshore " activities .
for example , us outsourcing giant eds each day ships truckloads of paper documents from clients in germany to its operations in nearby hungary so they can be scanned into the company ’ s database , thereby allowing the information to be processed electronically elsewhere around the world . creating jobs in germany however , offshoring is n't quite as simple as just siphoning off jobs to low-wage countries in eastern europe and asia .
surprisingly , it is also leading to more positions inside germany , at least for outsourcing companies . " we want to hire a lot of people locally , " debjit chaudhuri , head the german division of indian software and services outsourcing specialist infosys technologies , told dw-world . chaudhuri said he needed to expand his 200-person office near frankfurt in order to take advantage of corporate germany 's increasing appetite for outsourcing .
the burgeoning workload also means infosys is training people in india to become familiar with german culture . " they can ’ t all be in germany but they need to know how it is here .

begun in august 2000 , the program hoped to attract 20,000 highly skilled workers to the country in three years .
but by the end of that time , only 14,000 foreign workers had taken advantage of the visa project - 4,000 of them were from india .
many complained that the program was overly bureaucratic .
time limitations on the work visas as well as restrictions on bringing family members over dampened the enthusiasm of many . " it 's easier for a terrorist to get asylum in germany than it is for a foreign software expert to enter the german labor market , " one indian computer specialist told fischer during the meeting in bombay . fischer assured the audience that new immigrations laws to take effect in january would change that . pushing business ties the foreign minister also did some campaigning for germany as a location for industry , saying that his country 's highly developed infrastructure and location in the middle of the european union made for " excellent conditions " for foreign companies . he also appealed to german companies to take advantage of " the enormous opportunities " offered by the indian market and announced a visit this fall by chancellor gerhard schröder , who will be accompanied by a large business delegation .
fischer called on india to cut some of its red tape in order to improve its attractiveness to foreign investors . he praised progress in the peace process with india 's long-time rival pakistan , saying a lasting peace between the neighbors was important to convince investors that the region was a profitable and secure place to do business . on wednesday night , fischer flew to pakistan for a two-day visit there .
he plans to return to berlin on friday . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : fischer pressures sudan to act to avert tragedy german foreign minister joschka fischer has held discussions with the sudanese president and foreign minister , saying the eu and germany will only provide aid if sudan acts to resolve the crisis in the darfur region .

the meal comes in a pouch that filters out 99.9 % of most toxins , says new scientist magazine .
the aim is to reduce the amount of water soldiers need to carry .
the firm behind it says soldiers should only use urine as last resort - as the membrane can not filter out urea , which in the long term causes kidney damage .
" the pouch - containing chicken and rice - relies on osmosis to filter the water or urine , " the new scientist magazine reported .
the liquid passes through a membrane , thin sheets of a cellulose-based plastic with gaps just 0.5 nanometres wide .
it means only clean water can reach the food , and the bacteria is left behind .
' indestructible sandwich ' the idea has come from the combat feeding directorate , part of the us army soldier systems center in natick , massachusetts .
the organisation is also the brains behind the " indestructible sandwich " , which can stay fresh for three years .
a spokeswoman said the dehydrated pouches would reduce the current weight of 3.5kg for a day 's food supply of three meals , to 0.4kg.
but hydration technology inc , in albany , oregon , which made the membrane , warned it is too coarse to filter out urea so soldiers should only use urine in an absolute emergency .
engineer ed beaudry was quoted by the new scientist as saying that the body would not find using urine to rehydrate food toxic in the short term , but in the long term it would cause kidney damage .

the £ 385m thames gateway bridge will link newham and greenwich in east london .
after a public consultation the plans have changed to include priority for local traffic , a 40mph speed limit and a separate public transport lane .
the application will be submitted to both newham and greenwich councils , with a decision expected in november .
if the councils approve the application , then the bridge could be completed in 2012 - a year ahead of the projected opening .
the bridge is an important part of mayor of london ken livingstone 's plans to regenerate the thames gateway , a 40-mile-wide area from east and south-east london to kent and essex .
bridge plans the bridge will link beckton with thamesmead at gallions reach the crossing is designed to have two lanes in either direction for cars and commercial vehicles it will also have separate lanes , located on the western side of the bridge for public transport , pedestrians and cyclists the proposed toll is £ 1 for local car users and £ 2 for others .
exemptions similar to the congestion charge will apply the bridge could be upgraded to accommodate dockland light railway or trams in the future there are only three crossings for traffic to the east of tower bridge , while central london has eight bridges and there are 16 to the west between chelsea bridge and the m25 .
the initial costs of the thames gateway bridge will be put up by a private company .
it will recoup the funds through tolls and £ 200m of government funding confirmed in chancellor gordon brown 's spending review earlier this month .
thames gateway bridge project director mike clarke told bbc news online that the three year construction project would create up to 3,000 local jobs .
but he said the effect of the bridge on jobs in the area will be " even greater " .
" the lack of a crossing in the area has been to its detriment and this bridge will bring huge benefit to the thames gateway , " he said .
" we are very positive that the councils will give their approval .
" we know local residents are behind us because during the public consultation , 85 % of those that took part , including local businesses , backed the plans . "
but environmentalists have criticised the scheme claiming it will be used by businesses to transport more road freight , creating more pollution .

the beatson institute in glasgow will take part in interaction proteome , a project which will bring together europe 's leading researchers .
it aims to catalogue the complex functions and interactions of thousands of proteins found in the human body .
the project will analyse which proteins have a role in cancer and identify new targets for anti-cancer drugs .
future research proteins are made by the genes in the body 's cells and affect every aspect of cell behaviour .
cancers can develop when proteins are not working properly .
professor walter kolch , leading the work at the beatson institute , said : " proteomics is an emerging science that aims to answer questions about proteins and how they work .

it will deliver a wealth of data on how and where proteins talk to each other , which will undoubtedly help us develop treatments for cancer prof james cassidy " the project has huge implications for our understanding of cancer .
we will be able to categorise the proteins that are faulty in cancer , and design new drugs using this knowledge . "
professor kolch 's team was asked to join forces with other leading scientists in denmark , germany , italy , belgium and the netherlands .
professor james cassidy , chair of the cancer research uk department of medical oncology at glasgow university , said the interaction proteome project would " essentially do for proteins what the human genome project did for genes " .

the beatson institute in glasgow will take part in interaction proteome , a project which will bring together europe 's leading researchers .
it aims to catalogue the complex functions and interactions of thousands of proteins found in the human body .
the project will analyse which proteins have a role in cancer and identify new targets for anti-cancer drugs .
future research proteins are made by the genes in the body 's cells and affect every aspect of cell behaviour .
cancers can develop when proteins are not working properly .
professor walter kolch , leading the work at the beatson institute , said : " proteomics is an emerging science that aims to answer questions about proteins and how they work .

it will deliver a wealth of data on how and where proteins talk to each other , which will undoubtedly help us develop treatments for cancer prof james cassidy " the project has huge implications for our understanding of cancer .
we will be able to categorise the proteins that are faulty in cancer , and design new drugs using this knowledge . "

wales office minister don touhig , whose responsibilities include anti-crime measures , welcomed the overall reduction in recorded crime .
he said : " i am very pleased to note that wales has the lowest burglary rate of any region in england and wales .
" domestic burglary recorded in 2003-4 fell by 9 % in wales , and the records also show that theft of vehicles in wales fell by 9 % .
" part of the success in reducing crime is down to the fact that there are more police officers in wales .
" there were 7,366 in december 2003 , an increase of 98 over six months previously .
" there is no room for complacency , and we are determined not to let up in the continuing fight against crime . "

by tom bourton bbc wales news online chris moyles has encouraged listeners to watch s4c jonathan ross and chris moyles have been talking about it for months .
now leading tv critic victor lewis-smith has joined the ranks of celebrity viewers across the uk using digital tv to watch welsh language channel s4c .
in this new digital world , viewers have more choice of what to watch than ever before .
in his newspaper column this week , lewis-smith told readers that s4c was " well worth a look " .
he particularly recommended the " natural and often funny " dialogue of the long-running soap opera pobol y cwm -lrb- people of the valley -rrb- , although he did claim that very little happens in the way of storylines " in a typical episode " .
with far more to choose on the digital platform , all channels are facing a tough fight to secure audiences .
this is particularly the case in wales which , with almost 60 % of homes having access to digital tv , is leading digital take-up in the uk .
pobol y cwm , made by bbc wales , has been on air for 30 years of course , the breadth of choice from cable , satellite and free-to-air services cuts both ways .
viewers in wales can check out what is going on all over the uk , whether they are nominally regional shows such as the evening news on bbc scotland , or network radio stations , like bbc six and 1xtra .
on the other side , uk audiences can watch programmes on bbc one wales , 2w and s4c , or listen to radio wales and radio cymru via their tvs , digital radios or the internet .
martyn ingram , commissioning editor of bbc wales ' 2w - an english-language channel available in the evenings - said that the increased level of competition was " something we all have to live with " .
" we do get a lot of people who watch in other parts of the uk , especially sports events , " he said .
" there are some ex-pats , but not exclusively . "
in the evolving digital world , plaid cymru is urging the uk government to make wales one of the first areas to completely switch over to digital television from the current analogue service .
ceredigion mp simon thomas argued that using wales as a testing ground for the new technology would help ensure rural areas do not miss out when the analogue switch-off takes place between 2006-2010 .
wowing audiences one thing is certain - public support from celebrities is not going to hurt any channel .
regular listeners to jonathan ross ' bbc two radio show on saturday mornings will be used to him talking about the joys of watching s4c on " digidol " from his london home .
victor lewis-smith has spoken of watching pobol y cwm and radio one dj chris moyles has been actively encouraging his audience to tune into s4c 's wawffactor , on which one of his team - bb aled - helps judge wannabe singers .
aled , who is from aberystwyth , said the show did wonders for his national profile .
" i had a lot of people in england coming up and recognising me - i asked how and they said because of wawffactor , " he said .
a new series of the show is planned for next year , and aled expects chris moyles to tune in again and pull in plenty of fresh viewers in his wake .
" now we are on the breakfast show , we can educate a brand new lot of english people into the wawffactor phenomenon . "
s4c says it is delighted at picking up viewers across the uk , and claims it is not just appealing to " welsh exiles eager for a taste of home " .
" viewers with no connection to wales are watching our programmes because they find them entertaining in their own right , " said a spokesman .
" only this week , members of the public from swindon and dundee registered to take part in s4c 's harness horse racing series rasus ' viewers ' competition . "
jonathan ross has programmes on both bbc 1 and radio 2 delyth ford , originally from ruthin , north wales now lives in stevenage , north of london , with her husband steffan .
" i watch pobol y cwm every night , and i did n't when i was at home , " she said .
" it is nice to hear welsh spoken in the home .
" i watch newyddion too as everyone knows everyone in wales so there is a good chance of seeing people we know .
" and it is a godsend for cardiff blues rugby games on a saturday . "

by tom bourton bbc wales news online chris moyles has encouraged listeners to watch s4c jonathan ross and chris moyles have been talking about it for months .
now leading tv critic victor lewis-smith has joined the ranks of celebrity viewers across the uk using digital tv to watch welsh language channel s4c .
in this new digital world , viewers have more choice of what to watch than ever before .
in his newspaper column this week , lewis-smith told readers that s4c was " well worth a look " .
he particularly recommended the " natural and often funny " dialogue of the long-running soap opera pobol y cwm -lrb- people of the valley -rrb- , although he did claim that very little happens in the way of storylines " in a typical episode " .
with far more to choose on the digital platform , all channels are facing a tough fight to secure audiences .
this is particularly the case in wales which , with almost 60 % of homes having access to digital tv , is leading digital take-up in the uk .
pobol y cwm , made by bbc wales , has been on air for 30 years of course , the breadth of choice from cable , satellite and free-to-air services cuts both ways .
viewers in wales can check out what is going on all over the uk , whether they are nominally regional shows such as the evening news on bbc scotland , or network radio stations , like bbc six and 1xtra .
on the other side , uk audiences can watch programmes on bbc one wales , 2w and s4c , or listen to radio wales and radio cymru via their tvs , digital radios or the internet .
martyn ingram , commissioning editor of bbc wales ' 2w - an english-language channel available in the evenings - said that the increased level of competition was " something we all have to live with " .
" we do get a lot of people who watch in other parts of the uk , especially sports events , " he said .
" there are some ex-pats , but not exclusively . "
in the evolving digital world , plaid cymru is urging the uk government to make wales one of the first areas to completely switch over to digital television from the current analogue service .
ceredigion mp simon thomas argued that using wales as a testing ground for the new technology would help ensure rural areas do not miss out when the analogue switch-off takes place between 2006-2010 .
wowing audiences one thing is certain - public support from celebrities is not going to hurt any channel .
regular listeners to jonathan ross ' bbc two radio show on saturday mornings will be used to him talking about the joys of watching s4c on " digidol " from his london home .
victor lewis-smith has spoken of watching pobol y cwm and radio one dj chris moyles has been actively encouraging his audience to tune into s4c 's wawffactor , on which one of his team - bb aled - helps judge wannabe singers .
aled , who is from aberystwyth , said the show did wonders for his national profile .
" i had a lot of people in england coming up and recognising me - i asked how and they said because of wawffactor , " he said .
a new series of the show is planned for next year , and aled expects chris moyles to tune in again and pull in plenty of fresh viewers in his wake .
" now we are on the breakfast show , we can educate a brand new lot of english people into the wawffactor phenomenon . "
s4c says it is delighted at picking up viewers across the uk , and claims it is not just appealing to " welsh exiles eager for a taste of home " .
" viewers with no connection to wales are watching our programmes because they find them entertaining in their own right , " said a spokesman .
" only this week , members of the public from swindon and dundee registered to take part in s4c 's harness horse racing series rasus ' viewers ' competition . "
jonathan ross has programmes on both bbc 1 and radio 2 delyth ford , originally from ruthin , north wales now lives in stevenage , north of london , with her husband steffan .
" i watch pobol y cwm every night , and i did n't when i was at home , " she said .
" it is nice to hear welsh spoken in the home .
" i watch newyddion too as everyone knows everyone in wales so there is a good chance of seeing people we know .
" and it is a godsend for cardiff blues rugby games on a saturday . "
