less than 45 percent of europeans turned out for the eu parliament elections , and those who did were motivated more by domestic than eu issues .
hardly a good sign for brussels and strasbourg , but democracy nonetheless . the election results were determined by issues such as the iraq war , fears about terrorism , and painful social and economic reforms in the member states , and not by european issues such as the constitution , agricultural subsidies , and regional funding . the elections for the european parliament turned into 25 separate national elections , and - in the case of states with long sitting governments - elections of protest .
britain 's prime minister , france 's president , poland 's prime minister , and germany 's chancellor were all punished for various reasons . and in the czech republic , poland and britain , the anti-eu parties all celebrated impressive victories .
the low voter turnout was a boon to the smaller , more extremist parties , who as a rule , were better able to mobilize their supporters . national concerns ruled the day there is no " european electorate , " no eu-wide party ticket or electoral law .
so it 's not surprising that the majority of voters care little about far-away brussels , and care a lot more about the problems that play a role for them at home . but even the politicians , who are now complaining loudly about the low turnout , only contributed to the meager interest by focusing their campaigns on national issues . especially bitter was the extremely low voter turnout in the new eastern european member states .
the political elite in these countries failed to make it clear to their electorate that europe , too , is an important topic that should concern them . lack of power ? perhaps voters felt that they were n't being called upon to decide a powerful political representation in the classical sense of a national parliament .
after all , the parliament does n't serve a european government .
and whatever the parliament 's political make-up , it 's not going to change much about the way the european union does politics in brussels . the power remains with the council of ministers - which represents the interests of the member states - and not with the parliament , which represents the interests of the people . but before the laments about a refusal to embrace the democratic process grow too loud , let 's cast a quick glance across the atlantic .
in the united states , that democratic superpower , voter turnout levels have hovered around the 50 percent mark since the 1970s .
but that does n't give anyone there the idea to deny the legitimacy of the u.s. congress or the president . it 's still far better to have an eu body to represent the people - even if it was elected by a minority - than to have no checks and balances at all for the eu 's vast bureaucracy . bernd riegert -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de social democrats suffer double defeat german chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats took a drubbing in elections for the european parliament , as well as regional elections in the eastern state of thuringia , raising doubts about the party 's future .

less than 45 percent of europeans turned out for the eu parliament elections , and those who did were motivated more by domestic than eu issues .
hardly a good sign for brussels and strasbourg , but democracy nonetheless . the election results were determined by issues such as the iraq war , fears about terrorism , and painful social and economic reforms in the member states , and not by european issues such as the constitution , agricultural subsidies , and regional funding . the elections for the european parliament turned into 25 separate national elections , and - in the case of states with long sitting governments - elections of protest .
britain 's prime minister , france 's president , poland 's prime minister , and germany 's chancellor were all punished for various reasons . and in the czech republic , poland and britain , the anti-eu parties all celebrated impressive victories .
the low voter turnout was a boon to the smaller , more extremist parties , who as a rule , were better able to mobilize their supporters . national concerns ruled the day there is no " european electorate , " no eu-wide party ticket or electoral law .
so it 's not surprising that the majority of voters care little about far-away brussels , and care a lot more about the problems that play a role for them at home . but even the politicians , who are now complaining loudly about the low turnout , only contributed to the meager interest by focusing their campaigns on national issues . especially bitter was the extremely low voter turnout in the new eastern european member states .
the political elite in these countries failed to make it clear to their electorate that europe , too , is an important topic that should concern them . lack of power ? perhaps voters felt that they were n't being called upon to decide a powerful political representation in the classical sense of a national parliament .

less than 45 percent of europeans turned out for the eu parliament elections , and those who did were motivated more by domestic than eu issues .
hardly a good sign for brussels and strasbourg , but democracy nonetheless . the election results were determined by issues such as the iraq war , fears about terrorism , and painful social and economic reforms in the member states , and not by european issues such as the constitution , agricultural subsidies , and regional funding . the elections for the european parliament turned into 25 separate national elections , and - in the case of states with long sitting governments - elections of protest .
britain 's prime minister , france 's president , poland 's prime minister , and germany 's chancellor were all punished for various reasons . and in the czech republic , poland and britain , the anti-eu parties all celebrated impressive victories .
the low voter turnout was a boon to the smaller , more extremist parties , who as a rule , were better able to mobilize their supporters . national concerns ruled the day there is no " european electorate , " no eu-wide party ticket or electoral law .
so it 's not surprising that the majority of voters care little about far-away brussels , and care a lot more about the problems that play a role for them at home . but even the politicians , who are now complaining loudly about the low turnout , only contributed to the meager interest by focusing their campaigns on national issues . especially bitter was the extremely low voter turnout in the new eastern european member states .

sweden demolished bulgaria 5-0 in the second group c match on monday , as striker henrik larsson sealed his return to the national team with two goals in rapid succession . the match in the portuguese capital lisbon started with a spirited first half with scoring chances on both sides .
the bulgarians came fast and furious , repeatedly launching attacks .
martin petrov broke free to feed the ball to zoran jankovich and dimitar berbatov , but the swedish defense always managed to ward off the worst . sweden took the lead in the 32nd minute after freddie ljungberg tapped in a pass from zlatan ibrahimovic , who bolted away from bulgarian defenders attempting to leave him offside .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgaria had a chance to level when petrov got past mikael nilsson and chipped it to jankovich who had a clear shot on goal but he headed it past the far post . it was then that henrik larsson buried bulgaria 's hopes early in the second half after scoring two goals within two minutes .
first the striker put one past the keeper with a flying header in the 57th minute and 60 seconds later he returned to the penalty area to use his left foot to score again . it marked an amazing return for larsson , who had retired from international soccer after the 2002 world cup to spend more time with his son .
begged by his coach and politely asked by members of the swedish royal family to return , only after his six-year-old son gave his approval did he decide to don the national jersey again . after ljungberg was downed on the edge of the penalty area , ibrahimovic nailed the coffin shut by converting a penalty in the 76th minute and substitute marcus allbäck added insult to injury by sinking a distance shot after the match had crossed into injury time . the 5-0 win is the highest scoring victory for the swedes at a european championship . lineups : sweden : andreas isaksson ; teddy lucic , olof mellberg , andreas jakobsson , erik edman ; tobias linderoth , mikael nilsson , fredrik ljungberg , anders svensson ; zlatan ibrahimovic , henrik larsson . bulgaria : zdravko zdravkov ; vladimir ivanov , rossen kirilov , ivailo petkov , pedrag pajin ; stilian petrov , marian hristov , georgi peev , martin petrov ; zoran jankovich , dimitar berbatov . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro 2004 : group by group dw-world looks at how the groups match up .

german chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats took a drubbing in elections for the european parliament , as well as regional elections in the eastern state of thuringia , raising doubts about the party 's future . sunday 's election results were just the latest in an almost unbroken 18-month run of defeats for the social democrats . exit polls in elections for the european parliament showed a dismal slump to just 21.5 percent for the spd , compared with 44.5 percent for the conservative opposition parties , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- . bildunterschrift : results for germany 's political parties in the european elections at 21:42 utc . the spd also suffered a landslide defeat in thuringia 's regional elections , sliding to 14.5 percent .
despite a slight dip in popularity , the cdu was able to maintain its absolute majority in the eastern german state . capping the spd 's defeat is the fact that the former east german communist party , the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- came in a strong second in thuringia , usurping the spd 's traditional role as the worker 's party .
in the parliamentary elections , the pds also improved its standing from the last european election in 1999 . social democrats concede ' surprise ' although the spd had expected to suffer some losses in the polls , the party 's main candidate for the eu parliament , martin schulz , conceded that he was " surprised " by how heavy the defeats were .
" i did n't think it would hit us so hard , " he told german public broadcaster phoenix .
schulz said that low turnout , particularly for the eu parliamentary elections , which were held on the opening weekend of the euro 2004 soccer championships , was partly to blame . " it 's a bitter result , " said klaus uwe benneter , the spd 's general secretary .
benneter also attributed the painful round of social cuts and economic reforms for the dismal result .
throughout europe , he said , parties have been punished for their reform policies .
" but it would be irresponsible for us to align our policies with election dates and polls . " most political analysts agree that schröder has no option but to carry on with his party 's reform agenda , although they acknowledge that staying the course could force the spd into a downward spiral , and usher in a new period of conservative rule in germany . conservative leaders were understandably gleeful about the outcome , with cdu leader angela merkel calling it a " disaster " for schröder 's government .
" this is a great day for the cdu and a good day for germany , " said cdu general secretary laurenz meyer .
he added that the spd had fallen to a " low point never seen before . " crunch time the spd is hoping to achieve a turnaround in voter sentiment in time for a crucial state election in its stronghold and the country 's industrial heartland - north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- .
the election there is slated for may , 2005 .
if the party loses this core state , the conservatives will have a two-thirds majority in the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , giving them the power to block all government legislation . before the nrw election , the spd faces three more state polls in september .
pressure is mounting from many party insiders to ease the pace of economic reforms in an effort to save the spd 's fading reputation as the people 's party .
there is also speculation about a possible cabinet reshuffle . however , party chief franz müntefering insisted there would be no change in policy and no reshuffle despite what he called a " bitter result . " " i 'm convinced we 're doing the right thing to combine lasting social justice with wealth , " müntefering said . strong gains by greens as the social democrats licked their wounds , their junior coalition partner in berlin , the greens , celebrated their best result yet in a european election . bildunterschrift : gains and losses by party in 2004 compared to the 1999 european election . green party chief reinhard bütikofer described his party as the day 's " true victor . "
the green 's main parliamentary candidate , rebecca harms , said the gains were the result of the environmentally friendly party 's " hard work , " the strong candidates it put forward , and voter affinity with the green 's platforms on human rights , environmental protection , consumer protection , and agricultural policy . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european parliament elections 2004 dw-world 's full coverage of this year 's european parliamentary elections .

german chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats took a drubbing in elections for the european parliament , as well as regional elections in the eastern state of thuringia , raising doubts about the party 's future . sunday 's election results were just the latest in an almost unbroken 18-month run of defeats for the social democrats . exit polls in elections for the european parliament showed a dismal slump to just 21.5 percent for the spd , compared with 44.5 percent for the conservative opposition parties , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- . bildunterschrift : results for germany 's political parties in the european elections at 21:42 utc . the spd also suffered a landslide defeat in thuringia 's regional elections , sliding to 14.5 percent .
despite a slight dip in popularity , the cdu was able to maintain its absolute majority in the eastern german state . capping the spd 's defeat is the fact that the former east german communist party , the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- came in a strong second in thuringia , usurping the spd 's traditional role as the worker 's party .
in the parliamentary elections , the pds also improved its standing from the last european election in 1999 . social democrats concede ' surprise ' although the spd had expected to suffer some losses in the polls , the party 's main candidate for the eu parliament , martin schulz , conceded that he was " surprised " by how heavy the defeats were .
" i did n't think it would hit us so hard , " he told german public broadcaster phoenix .
schulz said that low turnout , particularly for the eu parliamentary elections , which were held on the opening weekend of the euro 2004 soccer championships , was partly to blame . " it 's a bitter result , " said klaus uwe benneter , the spd 's general secretary .
benneter also attributed the painful round of social cuts and economic reforms for the dismal result .
throughout europe , he said , parties have been punished for their reform policies .
" but it would be irresponsible for us to align our policies with election dates and polls . " most political analysts agree that schröder has no option but to carry on with his party 's reform agenda , although they acknowledge that staying the course could force the spd into a downward spiral , and usher in a new period of conservative rule in germany . conservative leaders were understandably gleeful about the outcome , with cdu leader angela merkel calling it a " disaster " for schröder 's government .
" this is a great day for the cdu and a good day for germany , " said cdu general secretary laurenz meyer .
he added that the spd had fallen to a " low point never seen before . " crunch time the spd is hoping to achieve a turnaround in voter sentiment in time for a crucial state election in its stronghold and the country 's industrial heartland - north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- .
the election there is slated for may , 2005 .

german chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats took a drubbing in elections for the european parliament , as well as regional elections in the eastern state of thuringia , raising doubts about the party 's future . sunday 's election results were just the latest in an almost unbroken 18-month run of defeats for the social democrats . exit polls in elections for the european parliament showed a dismal slump to just 21.5 percent for the spd , compared with 44.5 percent for the conservative opposition parties , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- . bildunterschrift : results for germany 's political parties in the european elections at 21:42 utc . the spd also suffered a landslide defeat in thuringia 's regional elections , sliding to 14.5 percent .
despite a slight dip in popularity , the cdu was able to maintain its absolute majority in the eastern german state . capping the spd 's defeat is the fact that the former east german communist party , the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- came in a strong second in thuringia , usurping the spd 's traditional role as the worker 's party .
in the parliamentary elections , the pds also improved its standing from the last european election in 1999 . social democrats concede ' surprise ' although the spd had expected to suffer some losses in the polls , the party 's main candidate for the eu parliament , martin schulz , conceded that he was " surprised " by how heavy the defeats were .
" i did n't think it would hit us so hard , " he told german public broadcaster phoenix .
schulz said that low turnout , particularly for the eu parliamentary elections , which were held on the opening weekend of the euro 2004 soccer championships , was partly to blame . " it 's a bitter result , " said klaus uwe benneter , the spd 's general secretary .
benneter also attributed the painful round of social cuts and economic reforms for the dismal result .
throughout europe , he said , parties have been punished for their reform policies .
" but it would be irresponsible for us to align our policies with election dates and polls . " most political analysts agree that schröder has no option but to carry on with his party 's reform agenda , although they acknowledge that staying the course could force the spd into a downward spiral , and usher in a new period of conservative rule in germany . conservative leaders were understandably gleeful about the outcome , with cdu leader angela merkel calling it a " disaster " for schröder 's government .
" this is a great day for the cdu and a good day for germany , " said cdu general secretary laurenz meyer .
he added that the spd had fallen to a " low point never seen before . " crunch time the spd is hoping to achieve a turnaround in voter sentiment in time for a crucial state election in its stronghold and the country 's industrial heartland - north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- .
the election there is slated for may , 2005 .
if the party loses this core state , the conservatives will have a two-thirds majority in the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , giving them the power to block all government legislation . before the nrw election , the spd faces three more state polls in september .
pressure is mounting from many party insiders to ease the pace of economic reforms in an effort to save the spd 's fading reputation as the people 's party .
there is also speculation about a possible cabinet reshuffle . however , party chief franz müntefering insisted there would be no change in policy and no reshuffle despite what he called a " bitter result . " " i 'm convinced we 're doing the right thing to combine lasting social justice with wealth , " müntefering said . strong gains by greens as the social democrats licked their wounds , their junior coalition partner in berlin , the greens , celebrated their best result yet in a european election . bildunterschrift : gains and losses by party in 2004 compared to the 1999 european election . green party chief reinhard bütikofer described his party as the day 's " true victor . "

dw-world readers wrote in : ukip is no threat to the eu itself but to the uk 's membership in it .
most " brits " are not willing to be subsumed into an undemocratic superstate that does n't act in the national interest of member states but seeks to destroy nations and nationhood .
most ukip supporters are freedom-loving individuals with far more experience of mainland europe than the average brit .
we wish to trade with the eu , holiday there , buy property and invest there , but we do not wish to be ruled by others - simple .
we love you as equals but not as our masters . - michael mcgough it appears that ukip is taking a page from the u.s. republican party playbook and promoting the illusion that " going it alone " will somehow help the uk achieve an enhanced " muscular " independence from its euro partners .
but like the u.s. republican party , it will come to regret turning its back on its true friends and partners and come crawling back - when things get rough . - tom ukip is not necessarily right wing ; plenty of its support comes from the left .
although it will never gain power at westminster , it has already managed to get people talking about leaving the eu as a real possibility and thus has shattered 30 years of cozy consensus between the major parties on this issue .
the eu will in any case disintegrate under the weight of its own contradictions , corruption , bureaucracy , waste and fraud , but whether the uk can leave before this happens remains to be seen . - richard sigrist contrary to media reports , most ukip members and supporters are not racist , fascist or mad .
they just look at the arguments about sovereignty , economic advantage etc and draw a logical conclusion - we put in far more than we get back .
why not reverse the net disadvantage and get out ?
we would still trade with other european counties and would maintain cordial and constructive relations with all .
why is it seen as crazy behaviour - is the idea of self government such a frightening concept ? - george roberts send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu-skeptics gain momentum in britain elections for the european parliament started thursday as dutch and british voters headed to the polls .
in britain , an anti-eu party with celebrity backing could do particularly well .

despite blazing hot temperatures in the in the northern city of guimarães , the first match of group c failed to ignite on monday as denmark held favorite italy to a 0-0 draw . in a game punctuated by solid defense and neutralized scoring chances , the squad of italian coach giovanni trapattoni failed to live up to expectations that they would dominate the danish . instead of melting in a blistering 33 degree celsius -lrb- 91 fahrenheit -rrb- heat , the scandinavians came out fighting and showed from the opening minutes of play that they would not be intimidated . the danish held the ball longer than their opponents and thomas helveg and jon dahl tomasson kept attacking throughout the match . denmark even managed to set the pace for large stretches of the game and threatened italian goalkeeper gianluigi buffon on a number of occasions .

as italy tried to increase the pressure at the end of the first half , sörensen managed two quick saves after rapid shots by alessandro del piero and francesco totti . the italians put together a beautiful combination in the 53rd minute but gianluca zambrotta failed to get the goal as his shot rolled just past the post .
after another chance by del piero was pushed over the crossbar by sörensen , play on both sides started to slow . del piero was pulled out in the 64th minute for substitute antonio cassano as trapattoni tried to up italy 's attack , but to no avail . barring a similar result in the other group c matchup of sweden and bulgaria , the draw will force both teams to win their next matches to keep their hopes of advancing alive . lineups : denmark : thomas sörensen ; thomas helveg , martin laursen , rene henriksen , niclas jensen ; dennis rommedahl , danieljensen , christian poulsen , martin jörgensen ; jon dahl tomasson ; ebbe sand . italy : gianluigi buffon ; christian panucci , fabio cannavaro , alessandro nesta , gianluca zambrotta ; simone perrotta , cristiano zanetti ; mauro camoranesi , francesco totti , alessandro del piero ; christian vieri . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro 2004 : group by group www-links euro 2004 official web site information on fc porto 's dragão stadium dw-tv europe live journal - nachrichten mit interview we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

it commented that voters wanted to punish chancellor gerhard schröder for his social and economic reform package known as agenda 2010 , which is why his social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- party slipped to an all-time low .
the daily said they -lrb- the spd -rrb- can not even call themselves the people ’ s party anymore .
this disaster , according to the paper , proves that although schröder stepped down as spd leader earlier this year in order to create some distance between the party and the reforms , the strategy didn ’ t work . munich ’ s süddeutsche zeitung commented that the spd now finds itself in the fateful situation that whatever schröder does is wrong .
he promotes budget cuts , which makes people afraid that their social system will be dismantled and he pushes for new debts in order to promote investment , which makes the public worry that their social system will collapse , the paper said .
it warned that if schröder doesn ’ t succeed in winning back the public ’ s confidence , the next 12 months will spell the death of his government . other german newspapers turned to the continuing violence in iraq which resulted in the killing of two senior iraqi government officials and a professor on the weekend . even though the iraqi interim government hasn ’ t officially taken over power in the country yet , two of its members have already fallen victim to the insurgency , wrote the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
the extremists don ’ t respect the first sovereign government since saddam hussein any more than they did the american-appointed governing council before it .
the paper concluded that the government will only be acknowledged by the public once it begins to curb the violence and terror . the neue osnabrücker zeitung said the men and women in the interim government want to build a new iraq , a country of peace , liberty and freedom .
and these courageous politicians , as well as thousands of allied soldiers , are risking their lives to realize this dream .
but instead of fully supporting these people , the paper commented that anti-war countries like germany and france are using their opposition to the war to win votes – and this , it wrote , is a slap in the face for iraq ’ s reformers . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

on monday , eu hearings begin on bmg 's planned merger with sony . the major housecleaning at the german division of bmg is part of the creation of a " fundamental cultural change " at the company , according to the division 's new president , maarten steinkamp , who announced the new policy in a employee newsletter .
according to a spokesman , oliver fahlbusch , in the current situation that record companies find themselves in , having seen sales plummet a fifth since 2000 , bmg has to change the way it does business .
the company does n't want any more one-hit wonders .
last year , 85 percent of the new releases by bmg germany 's national artists sold fewer than 25,000 times , a statistic which according to steinkamp , is not sustainable .
" that brings us market share , but no money , " he said .
the new strategy is to concentrate on a few " career artists , " or on newcomers with potential for more than one hit or one successful cd .
in the past , according to the company , it spread its resources over too many different artists , instead of concentrating on a few promising ones and trying to turn them into " brand names . "
" while we will likely show fewer sales in fiscal year 2004 , our operating profits will double , " said steinkamp according to the financial times deutschland , although bmg germany 's 2003 results have not been published , they are thought to be weak , making steinkamp 's operating profit goal feasible .
bmg is not the only big record company to trying to get a grip on the industry 's financial situation by cleaning its house of poorer-selling artists , but its plan is the most far reaching .
emi records is also culling its ranks , but has thus far dropped 20 percent of its artists .
less choice , more market concentration independent labels have criticized bmg 's actions , saying it will result in a further concentration of the market and fewer artists being represented in record stores .
" it will lead to fewer artists having big marketing budgets to work with , " horst weidenmüller of impala , which represents about 2,000 independents , told the financial times deutschland .
" market access for new music will be harder and consumer choice will suffer . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beyonce knowles is one of sony 's most successful artists .
independent music companies are also critical of the planned merger between bmg and another of the globe 's top five record companies , sony .
on monday , bmg and sony went in front eu 's antitrust commission to try to get the bloc 's approval for a fusion , which would create the world 's second-largest music company .
indie labels have said a sony-bmg tie-up could prove deadly to smaller companies , who are also struggling to survive in the current economic climate .
" it 's much more dangerous to allow market concentration in a weak market , because small companies will find it even harder to survive , " osman eralp , economic advisor to impala , told the associated press . he and other heads of some of europe 's largest independents say a merger would put them in danger of being " marginalized further " by the big players who " manipulate access to music at retail , media and on the internet . "
they called on the eu to block the merger or call on the sony and bmg to put " broad remedies " in place to curb possible abuses of market power .
up to the now , the eu has objected to the deal because the new company would control some 25 percent of the market and reduce the " big five " record companies to four , which would control 80 percent of the market .
however , sony and bmg has said a merger is necessary to sustain long-term viability in a turbulent market and that a partnership would allow them to invest more in artists and repertoire than they could on their own .
silver lining despite the criticism of bmg germany 's contract cancellations , some indies see a bright side .
michael haentjes of germany-based edel music said the less-popular artists suddenly finding themselves without a label could find a new home with the independents .
" artists that only sell midsize numbers will probably become available for companies like us , " haentjes said .

" it 's much more dangerous to allow market concentration in a weak market , because small companies will find it even harder to survive , " osman eralp , economic advisor to impala , told the associated press . he and other heads of some of europe 's largest independents say a merger would put them in danger of being " marginalized further " by the big players who " manipulate access to music at retail , media and on the internet . "
they called on the eu to block the merger or call on the sony and bmg to put " broad remedies " in place to curb possible abuses of market power .
up to the now , the eu has objected to the deal because the new company would control some 25 percent of the market and reduce the " big five " record companies to four , which would control 80 percent of the market .
however , sony and bmg has said a merger is necessary to sustain long-term viability in a turbulent market and that a partnership would allow them to invest more in artists and repertoire than they could on their own .
silver lining despite the criticism of bmg germany 's contract cancellations , some indies see a bright side .
michael haentjes of germany-based edel music said the less-popular artists suddenly finding themselves without a label could find a new home with the independents .
" artists that only sell midsize numbers will probably become available for companies like us , " haentjes said . " that could be an advantage for the independent sector and make the market more competitive .

on monday , eu hearings begin on bmg 's planned merger with sony . the major housecleaning at the german division of bmg is part of the creation of a " fundamental cultural change " at the company , according to the division 's new president , maarten steinkamp , who announced the new policy in a employee newsletter .
according to a spokesman , oliver fahlbusch , in the current situation that record companies find themselves in , having seen sales plummet a fifth since 2000 , bmg has to change the way it does business .
the company does n't want any more one-hit wonders .
last year , 85 percent of the new releases by bmg germany 's national artists sold fewer than 25,000 times , a statistic which according to steinkamp , is not sustainable .
" that brings us market share , but no money , " he said .
the new strategy is to concentrate on a few " career artists , " or on newcomers with potential for more than one hit or one successful cd .
in the past , according to the company , it spread its resources over too many different artists , instead of concentrating on a few promising ones and trying to turn them into " brand names . "
" while we will likely show fewer sales in fiscal year 2004 , our operating profits will double , " said steinkamp according to the financial times deutschland , although bmg germany 's 2003 results have not been published , they are thought to be weak , making steinkamp 's operating profit goal feasible .
bmg is not the only big record company to trying to get a grip on the industry 's financial situation by cleaning its house of poorer-selling artists , but its plan is the most far reaching .
emi records is also culling its ranks , but has thus far dropped 20 percent of its artists .
less choice , more market concentration independent labels have criticized bmg 's actions , saying it will result in a further concentration of the market and fewer artists being represented in record stores .
" it will lead to fewer artists having big marketing budgets to work with , " horst weidenmüller of impala , which represents about 2,000 independents , told the financial times deutschland .
" market access for new music will be harder and consumer choice will suffer . "

on monday , eu hearings begin on bmg 's planned merger with sony . the major housecleaning at the german division of bmg is part of the creation of a " fundamental cultural change " at the company , according to the division 's new president , maarten steinkamp , who announced the new policy in a employee newsletter .
according to a spokesman , oliver fahlbusch , in the current situation that record companies find themselves in , having seen sales plummet a fifth since 2000 , bmg has to change the way it does business .
the company does n't want any more one-hit wonders .
last year , 85 percent of the new releases by bmg germany 's national artists sold fewer than 25,000 times , a statistic which according to steinkamp , is not sustainable .
" that brings us market share , but no money , " he said .
the new strategy is to concentrate on a few " career artists , " or on newcomers with potential for more than one hit or one successful cd .
in the past , according to the company , it spread its resources over too many different artists , instead of concentrating on a few promising ones and trying to turn them into " brand names . "
" while we will likely show fewer sales in fiscal year 2004 , our operating profits will double , " said steinkamp according to the financial times deutschland , although bmg germany 's 2003 results have not been published , they are thought to be weak , making steinkamp 's operating profit goal feasible .
bmg is not the only big record company to trying to get a grip on the industry 's financial situation by cleaning its house of poorer-selling artists , but its plan is the most far reaching .
emi records is also culling its ranks , but has thus far dropped 20 percent of its artists .
less choice , more market concentration independent labels have criticized bmg 's actions , saying it will result in a further concentration of the market and fewer artists being represented in record stores .
" it will lead to fewer artists having big marketing budgets to work with , " horst weidenmüller of impala , which represents about 2,000 independents , told the financial times deutschland .
" market access for new music will be harder and consumer choice will suffer . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beyonce knowles is one of sony 's most successful artists .
independent music companies are also critical of the planned merger between bmg and another of the globe 's top five record companies , sony .
on monday , bmg and sony went in front eu 's antitrust commission to try to get the bloc 's approval for a fusion , which would create the world 's second-largest music company .
indie labels have said a sony-bmg tie-up could prove deadly to smaller companies , who are also struggling to survive in the current economic climate .
" it 's much more dangerous to allow market concentration in a weak market , because small companies will find it even harder to survive , " osman eralp , economic advisor to impala , told the associated press . he and other heads of some of europe 's largest independents say a merger would put them in danger of being " marginalized further " by the big players who " manipulate access to music at retail , media and on the internet . "
they called on the eu to block the merger or call on the sony and bmg to put " broad remedies " in place to curb possible abuses of market power .
up to the now , the eu has objected to the deal because the new company would control some 25 percent of the market and reduce the " big five " record companies to four , which would control 80 percent of the market .
however , sony and bmg has said a merger is necessary to sustain long-term viability in a turbulent market and that a partnership would allow them to invest more in artists and repertoire than they could on their own .
silver lining despite the criticism of bmg germany 's contract cancellations , some indies see a bright side .
michael haentjes of germany-based edel music said the less-popular artists suddenly finding themselves without a label could find a new home with the independents .
" artists that only sell midsize numbers will probably become available for companies like us , " haentjes said . " that could be an advantage for the independent sector and make the market more competitive .

german chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats took a drubbing in elections for the european parliament , as well as regional elections in the eastern state of thuringia , raising doubts about the party 's future . sunday 's election results were just the latest in an almost unbroken 18-month run of defeats for the social democrats . exit polls in elections for the european parliament showed a dismal slump to just 21.5 percent for the spd , compared with 44.5 percent for the conservative opposition parties , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- . bildunterschrift : results for germany 's political parties in the european elections at 21:42 utc . the spd also suffered a landslide defeat in thuringia 's regional elections , sliding to 14.5 percent .
despite a slight dip in popularity , the cdu was able to maintain its absolute majority in the eastern german state . capping the spd 's defeat is the fact that the former east german communist party , the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- came in a strong second in thuringia , usurping the spd 's traditional role as the worker 's party .
in the parliamentary elections , the pds also improved its standing from the last european election in 1999 . social democrats concede ' surprise ' although the spd had expected to suffer some losses in the polls , the party 's main candidate for the eu parliament , martin schulz , conceded that he was " surprised " by how heavy the defeats were .
" i did n't think it would hit us so hard , " he told german public broadcaster phoenix .
schulz said that low turnout , particularly for the eu parliamentary elections , which were held on the opening weekend of the euro 2004 soccer championships , was partly to blame . " it 's a bitter result , " said klaus uwe benneter , the spd 's general secretary .
benneter also attributed the painful round of social cuts and economic reforms for the dismal result .
throughout europe , he said , parties have been punished for their reform policies .
" but it would be irresponsible for us to align our policies with election dates and polls . " most political analysts agree that schröder has no option but to carry on with his party 's reform agenda , although they acknowledge that staying the course could force the spd into a downward spiral , and usher in a new period of conservative rule in germany . conservative leaders were understandably gleeful about the outcome , with cdu leader angela merkel calling it a " disaster " for schröder 's government .
" this is a great day for the cdu and a good day for germany , " said cdu general secretary laurenz meyer .
he added that the spd had fallen to a " low point never seen before . " crunch time the spd is hoping to achieve a turnaround in voter sentiment in time for a crucial state election in its stronghold and the country 's industrial heartland - north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- .
the election there is slated for may , 2005 .
if the party loses this core state , the conservatives will have a two-thirds majority in the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , giving them the power to block all government legislation . before the nrw election , the spd faces three more state polls in september .
pressure is mounting from many party insiders to ease the pace of economic reforms in an effort to save the spd 's fading reputation as the people 's party .
there is also speculation about a possible cabinet reshuffle . however , party chief franz müntefering insisted there would be no change in policy and no reshuffle despite what he called a " bitter result .

despite a slight dip in popularity , the cdu was able to maintain its absolute majority in the eastern german state . capping the spd 's defeat is the fact that the former east german communist party , the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- came in a strong second in thuringia , usurping the spd 's traditional role as the worker 's party .
in the parliamentary elections , the pds also improved its standing from the last european election in 1999 . social democrats concede ' surprise ' although the spd had expected to suffer some losses in the polls , the party 's main candidate for the eu parliament , martin schulz , conceded that he was " surprised " by how heavy the defeats were .
" i did n't think it would hit us so hard , " he told german public broadcaster phoenix .
schulz said that low turnout , particularly for the eu parliamentary elections , which were held on the opening weekend of the euro 2004 soccer championships , was partly to blame . " it 's a bitter result , " said klaus uwe benneter , the spd 's general secretary .
benneter also attributed the painful round of social cuts and economic reforms for the dismal result .
throughout europe , he said , parties have been punished for their reform policies .
" but it would be irresponsible for us to align our policies with election dates and polls . " most political analysts agree that schröder has no option but to carry on with his party 's reform agenda , although they acknowledge that staying the course could force the spd into a downward spiral , and usher in a new period of conservative rule in germany . conservative leaders were understandably gleeful about the outcome , with cdu leader angela merkel calling it a " disaster " for schröder 's government .
" this is a great day for the cdu and a good day for germany , " said cdu general secretary laurenz meyer .
he added that the spd had fallen to a " low point never seen before . " crunch time the spd is hoping to achieve a turnaround in voter sentiment in time for a crucial state election in its stronghold and the country 's industrial heartland - north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- .
the election there is slated for may , 2005 .
if the party loses this core state , the conservatives will have a two-thirds majority in the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , giving them the power to block all government legislation . before the nrw election , the spd faces three more state polls in september .
pressure is mounting from many party insiders to ease the pace of economic reforms in an effort to save the spd 's fading reputation as the people 's party .
there is also speculation about a possible cabinet reshuffle . however , party chief franz müntefering insisted there would be no change in policy and no reshuffle despite what he called a " bitter result . " " i 'm convinced we 're doing the right thing to combine lasting social justice with wealth , " müntefering said . strong gains by greens as the social democrats licked their wounds , their junior coalition partner in berlin , the greens , celebrated their best result yet in a european election . bildunterschrift : gains and losses by party in 2004 compared to the 1999 european election . green party chief reinhard bütikofer described his party as the day 's " true victor . "
the green 's main parliamentary candidate , rebecca harms , said the gains were the result of the environmentally friendly party 's " hard work , " the strong candidates it put forward , and voter affinity with the green 's platforms on human rights , environmental protection , consumer protection , and agricultural policy . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european parliament elections 2004 dw-world 's full coverage of this year 's european parliamentary elections .

sweden demolished bulgaria 5-0 in the second group c match on monday , as striker henrik larsson sealed his return to the national team with two goals in rapid succession . the match in the portuguese capital lisbon started with a spirited first half with scoring chances on both sides .
the bulgarians came fast and furious , repeatedly launching attacks .
martin petrov broke free to feed the ball to zoran jankovich and dimitar berbatov , but the swedish defense always managed to ward off the worst . sweden took the lead in the 32nd minute after freddie ljungberg tapped in a pass from zlatan ibrahimovic , who bolted away from bulgarian defenders attempting to leave him offside .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgaria had a chance to level when petrov got past mikael nilsson and chipped it to jankovich who had a clear shot on goal but he headed it past the far post . it was then that henrik larsson buried bulgaria 's hopes early in the second half after scoring two goals within two minutes .
first the striker put one past the keeper with a flying header in the 57th minute and 60 seconds later he returned to the penalty area to use his left foot to score again . it marked an amazing return for larsson , who had retired from international soccer after the 2002 world cup to spend more time with his son .

sweden demolished bulgaria 5-0 in the second group c match on monday , as striker henrik larsson sealed his return to the national team with two goals in rapid succession . the match in the portuguese capital lisbon started with a spirited first half with scoring chances on both sides .
the bulgarians came fast and furious , repeatedly launching attacks .
martin petrov broke free to feed the ball to zoran jankovich and dimitar berbatov , but the swedish defense always managed to ward off the worst . sweden took the lead in the 32nd minute after freddie ljungberg tapped in a pass from zlatan ibrahimovic , who bolted away from bulgarian defenders attempting to leave him offside .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgaria had a chance to level when petrov got past mikael nilsson and chipped it to jankovich who had a clear shot on goal but he headed it past the far post . it was then that henrik larsson buried bulgaria 's hopes early in the second half after scoring two goals within two minutes .
first the striker put one past the keeper with a flying header in the 57th minute and 60 seconds later he returned to the penalty area to use his left foot to score again . it marked an amazing return for larsson , who had retired from international soccer after the 2002 world cup to spend more time with his son .

time and financial difficulties have eventually caught up with berlin 's legendary tempelhof airport .
the site of the berlin airlift is set to close later this year . if things go according to plan , the airport , a nazi jewel that later became a cold war legend , will close some time in october . officials at the administrative authority that runs berlin 's three airports say tempelhof 's declining passenger numbers combined with a need to trim down the number of airports in the capital , sealed its fate . " the airport has lost money for years , and we do n't think that 's going to change any time soon , " eberhart ellie , a spokesman for the authority told dw-world . two airports too many last year the airport , which is funded by subsidies from city and federal coffers , lost € 15 million , said ellie .
the poor economic performance is a death knell for any business in the capital , which is swimming in a € 30-billion debt . add to that a bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tempelhof is home to mostly regional airlines desire by berlin city officials to turn the now-schoenefeld airport into the berlin-brandenburg international airport -lrb- bbi -rrb- by 2010 , and tempelhof 's closing was predestined . " even if it had survived a few more years , they do n't plan on keeping two city airports open after bbi opens in 2010 , " said ellie . the airport 's advocates , among them city officials and industry heads , have started a grassroots movement to save tempelhof .
the world 's oldest airport is now used primarily by regional and smaller airlines which would be left out in the cold by tempelhof 's closure , said andreas peter . the head of icat , an organization made up of tempelhof supporters , peter says as passenger numbers continue to climb , tegel and schoenefeld will face over-capacity problems .
peter blames the berlin airport authority for not doing enough to try and save it . critics : will is n't there " if -lrb- the airport -rrb- was n't constantly dismissed , if the buildings were n't managed so poorly , they might not be losing all the money , " peter told dw-world .
" it needs to be marketed better . " of the three airports , tempelhof is the largest , most central and most storied .
hitler cast his eye on the building in the 1930s , investing large sums of money to create a fitting airport for his massive capital .
following the end of wwii , the airport became part of the u.s. sector of berlin , where only a few years later it would find a place in history . airlift sealed its place in history it was in west berlin 's tempelhof that american planes landed with much-needed supplies after the soviets sealed off berlin in 1948 .
the ussr eventually relented in 1949 , and tempelhof and the " raisin bombers " that brought food , candy and supplies to thankful berliners became part of the city 's lore . but since the end of the cold war , the airport has suffered from increasing competition and decreasing passenger counts .
lufthansa left in the mid-1990s and moved to tegel airport in the northwest part of the city .
last year , only 400,000 passengers passed through the airport .
elie said 1.5 million were needed for the airport to break even . a home where the buffalo roam ? though airlines dba and germania said last week they would be willing to transfer their business to tempelhof from tegel , elie has yet to see any indication they really mean it . " there are no concrete business plans -lrb- out there -rrb- that look at how tempelhof can be made financially solvent , " said elie . architects are already debating what should be done with the estimated 300,000 square meters of space near the city center .
one group wants to establish a " central park , " another company wants to build a golf course .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 14.06.2004 record giant bmg to drop majority of its german artists großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yvonne catterfeld is one of the few german bmg artists safe from cuts bmg , music arm of the bertelsmann group , announced it will dissolve its relationship with 60 percent of its german artists in a radical restructuring plan .
on monday , eu hearings begin on bmg 's planned merger with sony . the major housecleaning at the german division of bmg is part of the creation of a " fundamental cultural change " at the company , according to the division 's new president , maarten steinkamp , who announced the new policy in a employee newsletter .
according to a spokesman , oliver fahlbusch , in the current situation that record companies find themselves in , having seen sales plummet a fifth since 2000 , bmg has to change the way it does business .
the company does n't want any more one-hit wonders .
last year , 85 percent of the new releases by bmg germany 's national artists sold fewer than 25,000 times , a statistic which according to steinkamp , is not sustainable .
" that brings us market share , but no money , " he said .
the new strategy is to concentrate on a few " career artists , " or on newcomers with potential for more than one hit or one successful cd .
in the past , according to the company , it spread its resources over too many different artists , instead of concentrating on a few promising ones and trying to turn them into " brand names . "
" while we will likely show fewer sales in fiscal year 2004 , our operating profits will double , " said steinkamp according to the financial times deutschland , although bmg germany 's 2003 results have not been published , they are thought to be weak , making steinkamp 's operating profit goal feasible .
bmg is not the only big record company to trying to get a grip on the industry 's financial situation by cleaning its house of poorer-selling artists , but its plan is the most far reaching .
emi records is also culling its ranks , but has thus far dropped 20 percent of its artists .
less choice , more market concentration independent labels have criticized bmg 's actions , saying it will result in a further concentration of the market and fewer artists being represented in record stores .
" it will lead to fewer artists having big marketing budgets to work with , " horst weidenmüller of impala , which represents about 2,000 independents , told the financial times deutschland .
" market access for new music will be harder and consumer choice will suffer . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beyonce knowles is one of sony 's most successful artists .
independent music companies are also critical of the planned merger between bmg and another of the globe 's top five record companies , sony .
on monday , bmg and sony went in front eu 's antitrust commission to try to get the bloc 's approval for a fusion , which would create the world 's second-largest music company .
indie labels have said a sony-bmg tie-up could prove deadly to smaller companies , who are also struggling to survive in the current economic climate .
" it 's much more dangerous to allow market concentration in a weak market , because small companies will find it even harder to survive , " osman eralp , economic advisor to impala , told the associated press . he and other heads of some of europe 's largest independents say a merger would put them in danger of being " marginalized further " by the big players who " manipulate access to music at retail , media and on the internet . "
they called on the eu to block the merger or call on the sony and bmg to put " broad remedies " in place to curb possible abuses of market power .
up to the now , the eu has objected to the deal because the new company would control some 25 percent of the market and reduce the " big five " record companies to four , which would control 80 percent of the market .
however , sony and bmg has said a merger is necessary to sustain long-term viability in a turbulent market and that a partnership would allow them to invest more in artists and repertoire than they could on their own .
silver lining despite the criticism of bmg germany 's contract cancellations , some indies see a bright side .
michael haentjes of germany-based edel music said the less-popular artists suddenly finding themselves without a label could find a new home with the independents .
" artists that only sell midsize numbers will probably become available for companies like us , " haentjes said . " that could be an advantage for the independent sector and make the market more competitive .

on monday , eu hearings begin on bmg 's planned merger with sony . the major housecleaning at the german division of bmg is part of the creation of a " fundamental cultural change " at the company , according to the division 's new president , maarten steinkamp , who announced the new policy in a employee newsletter .
according to a spokesman , oliver fahlbusch , in the current situation that record companies find themselves in , having seen sales plummet a fifth since 2000 , bmg has to change the way it does business .
the company does n't want any more one-hit wonders .
last year , 85 percent of the new releases by bmg germany 's national artists sold fewer than 25,000 times , a statistic which according to steinkamp , is not sustainable .
" that brings us market share , but no money , " he said .
the new strategy is to concentrate on a few " career artists , " or on newcomers with potential for more than one hit or one successful cd .
in the past , according to the company , it spread its resources over too many different artists , instead of concentrating on a few promising ones and trying to turn them into " brand names . "
" while we will likely show fewer sales in fiscal year 2004 , our operating profits will double , " said steinkamp according to the financial times deutschland , although bmg germany 's 2003 results have not been published , they are thought to be weak , making steinkamp 's operating profit goal feasible .
bmg is not the only big record company to trying to get a grip on the industry 's financial situation by cleaning its house of poorer-selling artists , but its plan is the most far reaching .
emi records is also culling its ranks , but has thus far dropped 20 percent of its artists .
less choice , more market concentration independent labels have criticized bmg 's actions , saying it will result in a further concentration of the market and fewer artists being represented in record stores .
" it will lead to fewer artists having big marketing budgets to work with , " horst weidenmüller of impala , which represents about 2,000 independents , told the financial times deutschland .
" market access for new music will be harder and consumer choice will suffer . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beyonce knowles is one of sony 's most successful artists .
independent music companies are also critical of the planned merger between bmg and another of the globe 's top five record companies , sony .
on monday , bmg and sony went in front eu 's antitrust commission to try to get the bloc 's approval for a fusion , which would create the world 's second-largest music company .
indie labels have said a sony-bmg tie-up could prove deadly to smaller companies , who are also struggling to survive in the current economic climate .
" it 's much more dangerous to allow market concentration in a weak market , because small companies will find it even harder to survive , " osman eralp , economic advisor to impala , told the associated press . he and other heads of some of europe 's largest independents say a merger would put them in danger of being " marginalized further " by the big players who " manipulate access to music at retail , media and on the internet . "
they called on the eu to block the merger or call on the sony and bmg to put " broad remedies " in place to curb possible abuses of market power .
up to the now , the eu has objected to the deal because the new company would control some 25 percent of the market and reduce the " big five " record companies to four , which would control 80 percent of the market .
however , sony and bmg has said a merger is necessary to sustain long-term viability in a turbulent market and that a partnership would allow them to invest more in artists and repertoire than they could on their own .
silver lining despite the criticism of bmg germany 's contract cancellations , some indies see a bright side .
michael haentjes of germany-based edel music said the less-popular artists suddenly finding themselves without a label could find a new home with the independents .
" artists that only sell midsize numbers will probably become available for companies like us , " haentjes said .

up to the now , the eu has objected to the deal because the new company would control some 25 percent of the market and reduce the " big five " record companies to four , which would control 80 percent of the market .
however , sony and bmg has said a merger is necessary to sustain long-term viability in a turbulent market and that a partnership would allow them to invest more in artists and repertoire than they could on their own .
silver lining despite the criticism of bmg germany 's contract cancellations , some indies see a bright side .

on monday , eu hearings begin on bmg 's planned merger with sony . the major housecleaning at the german division of bmg is part of the creation of a " fundamental cultural change " at the company , according to the division 's new president , maarten steinkamp , who announced the new policy in a employee newsletter .
according to a spokesman , oliver fahlbusch , in the current situation that record companies find themselves in , having seen sales plummet a fifth since 2000 , bmg has to change the way it does business .
the company does n't want any more one-hit wonders .
last year , 85 percent of the new releases by bmg germany 's national artists sold fewer than 25,000 times , a statistic which according to steinkamp , is not sustainable .
" that brings us market share , but no money , " he said .
the new strategy is to concentrate on a few " career artists , " or on newcomers with potential for more than one hit or one successful cd .
in the past , according to the company , it spread its resources over too many different artists , instead of concentrating on a few promising ones and trying to turn them into " brand names . "
" while we will likely show fewer sales in fiscal year 2004 , our operating profits will double , " said steinkamp according to the financial times deutschland , although bmg germany 's 2003 results have not been published , they are thought to be weak , making steinkamp 's operating profit goal feasible .
bmg is not the only big record company to trying to get a grip on the industry 's financial situation by cleaning its house of poorer-selling artists , but its plan is the most far reaching .
emi records is also culling its ranks , but has thus far dropped 20 percent of its artists .
less choice , more market concentration independent labels have criticized bmg 's actions , saying it will result in a further concentration of the market and fewer artists being represented in record stores .
" it will lead to fewer artists having big marketing budgets to work with , " horst weidenmüller of impala , which represents about 2,000 independents , told the financial times deutschland .
" market access for new music will be harder and consumer choice will suffer . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beyonce knowles is one of sony 's most successful artists .
independent music companies are also critical of the planned merger between bmg and another of the globe 's top five record companies , sony .
on monday , bmg and sony went in front eu 's antitrust commission to try to get the bloc 's approval for a fusion , which would create the world 's second-largest music company .
indie labels have said a sony-bmg tie-up could prove deadly to smaller companies , who are also struggling to survive in the current economic climate .
" it 's much more dangerous to allow market concentration in a weak market , because small companies will find it even harder to survive , " osman eralp , economic advisor to impala , told the associated press . he and other heads of some of europe 's largest independents say a merger would put them in danger of being " marginalized further " by the big players who " manipulate access to music at retail , media and on the internet . "
they called on the eu to block the merger or call on the sony and bmg to put " broad remedies " in place to curb possible abuses of market power .
up to the now , the eu has objected to the deal because the new company would control some 25 percent of the market and reduce the " big five " record companies to four , which would control 80 percent of the market .
however , sony and bmg has said a merger is necessary to sustain long-term viability in a turbulent market and that a partnership would allow them to invest more in artists and repertoire than they could on their own .
silver lining despite the criticism of bmg germany 's contract cancellations , some indies see a bright side .
michael haentjes of germany-based edel music said the less-popular artists suddenly finding themselves without a label could find a new home with the independents .
" artists that only sell midsize numbers will probably become available for companies like us , " haentjes said . " that could be an advantage for the independent sector and make the market more competitive .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 14.06.2004 berlin 's legendary tempelhof airport to close großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : west berliners cheer as a plane lands at tempelhof during the 1948 airlift .
time and financial difficulties have eventually caught up with berlin 's legendary tempelhof airport .
the site of the berlin airlift is set to close later this year . if things go according to plan , the airport , a nazi jewel that later became a cold war legend , will close some time in october . officials at the administrative authority that runs berlin 's three airports say tempelhof 's declining passenger numbers combined with a need to trim down the number of airports in the capital , sealed its fate . " the airport has lost money for years , and we do n't think that 's going to change any time soon , " eberhart ellie , a spokesman for the authority told dw-world . two airports too many last year the airport , which is funded by subsidies from city and federal coffers , lost € 15 million , said ellie .
the poor economic performance is a death knell for any business in the capital , which is swimming in a € 30-billion debt . add to that a bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tempelhof is home to mostly regional airlines desire by berlin city officials to turn the now-schoenefeld airport into the berlin-brandenburg international airport -lrb- bbi -rrb- by 2010 , and tempelhof 's closing was predestined . " even if it had survived a few more years , they do n't plan on keeping two city airports open after bbi opens in 2010 , " said ellie . the airport 's advocates , among them city officials and industry heads , have started a grassroots movement to save tempelhof .
the world 's oldest airport is now used primarily by regional and smaller airlines which would be left out in the cold by tempelhof 's closure , said andreas peter . the head of icat , an organization made up of tempelhof supporters , peter says as passenger numbers continue to climb , tegel and schoenefeld will face over-capacity problems .
peter blames the berlin airport authority for not doing enough to try and save it . critics : will is n't there " if -lrb- the airport -rrb- was n't constantly dismissed , if the buildings were n't managed so poorly , they might not be losing all the money , " peter told dw-world .
" it needs to be marketed better . " of the three airports , tempelhof is the largest , most central and most storied .
hitler cast his eye on the building in the 1930s , investing large sums of money to create a fitting airport for his massive capital .
following the end of wwii , the airport became part of the u.s. sector of berlin , where only a few years later it would find a place in history . airlift sealed its place in history it was in west berlin 's tempelhof that american planes landed with much-needed supplies after the soviets sealed off berlin in 1948 .
the ussr eventually relented in 1949 , and tempelhof and the " raisin bombers " that brought food , candy and supplies to thankful berliners became part of the city 's lore . but since the end of the cold war , the airport has suffered from increasing competition and decreasing passenger counts .
lufthansa left in the mid-1990s and moved to tegel airport in the northwest part of the city .
last year , only 400,000 passengers passed through the airport .
elie said 1.5 million were needed for the airport to break even . a home where the buffalo roam ? though airlines dba and germania said last week they would be willing to transfer their business to tempelhof from tegel , elie has yet to see any indication they really mean it . " there are no concrete business plans -lrb- out there -rrb- that look at how tempelhof can be made financially solvent , " said elie . architects are already debating what should be done with the estimated 300,000 square meters of space near the city center .

dw-world readers wrote in : ukip is no threat to the eu itself but to the uk 's membership in it .
most " brits " are not willing to be subsumed into an undemocratic superstate that does n't act in the national interest of member states but seeks to destroy nations and nationhood .
most ukip supporters are freedom-loving individuals with far more experience of mainland europe than the average brit .
we wish to trade with the eu , holiday there , buy property and invest there , but we do not wish to be ruled by others - simple .
we love you as equals but not as our masters . - michael mcgough it appears that ukip is taking a page from the u.s. republican party playbook and promoting the illusion that " going it alone " will somehow help the uk achieve an enhanced " muscular " independence from its euro partners .
but like the u.s. republican party , it will come to regret turning its back on its true friends and partners and come crawling back - when things get rough . - tom ukip is not necessarily right wing ; plenty of its support comes from the left .
although it will never gain power at westminster , it has already managed to get people talking about leaving the eu as a real possibility and thus has shattered 30 years of cozy consensus between the major parties on this issue .
the eu will in any case disintegrate under the weight of its own contradictions , corruption , bureaucracy , waste and fraud , but whether the uk can leave before this happens remains to be seen . - richard sigrist contrary to media reports , most ukip members and supporters are not racist , fascist or mad .
they just look at the arguments about sovereignty , economic advantage etc and draw a logical conclusion - we put in far more than we get back .
why not reverse the net disadvantage and get out ?
we would still trade with other european counties and would maintain cordial and constructive relations with all .
why is it seen as crazy behaviour - is the idea of self government such a frightening concept ? - george roberts send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu-skeptics gain momentum in britain elections for the european parliament started thursday as dutch and british voters headed to the polls .
in britain , an anti-eu party with celebrity backing could do particularly well .

on monday , eu hearings begin on bmg 's planned merger with sony . the major housecleaning at the german division of bmg is part of the creation of a " fundamental cultural change " at the company , according to the division 's new president , maarten steinkamp , who announced the new policy in a employee newsletter .
according to a spokesman , oliver fahlbusch , in the current situation that record companies find themselves in , having seen sales plummet a fifth since 2000 , bmg has to change the way it does business .
the company does n't want any more one-hit wonders .
last year , 85 percent of the new releases by bmg germany 's national artists sold fewer than 25,000 times , a statistic which according to steinkamp , is not sustainable .
" that brings us market share , but no money , " he said .
the new strategy is to concentrate on a few " career artists , " or on newcomers with potential for more than one hit or one successful cd .
in the past , according to the company , it spread its resources over too many different artists , instead of concentrating on a few promising ones and trying to turn them into " brand names . "
" while we will likely show fewer sales in fiscal year 2004 , our operating profits will double , " said steinkamp according to the financial times deutschland , although bmg germany 's 2003 results have not been published , they are thought to be weak , making steinkamp 's operating profit goal feasible .
bmg is not the only big record company to trying to get a grip on the industry 's financial situation by cleaning its house of poorer-selling artists , but its plan is the most far reaching .
emi records is also culling its ranks , but has thus far dropped 20 percent of its artists .
less choice , more market concentration independent labels have criticized bmg 's actions , saying it will result in a further concentration of the market and fewer artists being represented in record stores .
" it will lead to fewer artists having big marketing budgets to work with , " horst weidenmüller of impala , which represents about 2,000 independents , told the financial times deutschland .
" market access for new music will be harder and consumer choice will suffer . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beyonce knowles is one of sony 's most successful artists .
independent music companies are also critical of the planned merger between bmg and another of the globe 's top five record companies , sony .
on monday , bmg and sony went in front eu 's antitrust commission to try to get the bloc 's approval for a fusion , which would create the world 's second-largest music company .
indie labels have said a sony-bmg tie-up could prove deadly to smaller companies , who are also struggling to survive in the current economic climate .
" it 's much more dangerous to allow market concentration in a weak market , because small companies will find it even harder to survive , " osman eralp , economic advisor to impala , told the associated press . he and other heads of some of europe 's largest independents say a merger would put them in danger of being " marginalized further " by the big players who " manipulate access to music at retail , media and on the internet . "
they called on the eu to block the merger or call on the sony and bmg to put " broad remedies " in place to curb possible abuses of market power .
up to the now , the eu has objected to the deal because the new company would control some 25 percent of the market and reduce the " big five " record companies to four , which would control 80 percent of the market .
however , sony and bmg has said a merger is necessary to sustain long-term viability in a turbulent market and that a partnership would allow them to invest more in artists and repertoire than they could on their own .
silver lining despite the criticism of bmg germany 's contract cancellations , some indies see a bright side .
michael haentjes of germany-based edel music said the less-popular artists suddenly finding themselves without a label could find a new home with the independents .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beyonce knowles is one of sony 's most successful artists .
independent music companies are also critical of the planned merger between bmg and another of the globe 's top five record companies , sony .
on monday , bmg and sony went in front eu 's antitrust commission to try to get the bloc 's approval for a fusion , which would create the world 's second-largest music company .
indie labels have said a sony-bmg tie-up could prove deadly to smaller companies , who are also struggling to survive in the current economic climate .
" it 's much more dangerous to allow market concentration in a weak market , because small companies will find it even harder to survive , " osman eralp , economic advisor to impala , told the associated press . he and other heads of some of europe 's largest independents say a merger would put them in danger of being " marginalized further " by the big players who " manipulate access to music at retail , media and on the internet . "
they called on the eu to block the merger or call on the sony and bmg to put " broad remedies " in place to curb possible abuses of market power .
up to the now , the eu has objected to the deal because the new company would control some 25 percent of the market and reduce the " big five " record companies to four , which would control 80 percent of the market .
however , sony and bmg has said a merger is necessary to sustain long-term viability in a turbulent market and that a partnership would allow them to invest more in artists and repertoire than they could on their own .
silver lining despite the criticism of bmg germany 's contract cancellations , some indies see a bright side .
michael haentjes of germany-based edel music said the less-popular artists suddenly finding themselves without a label could find a new home with the independents .
" artists that only sell midsize numbers will probably become available for companies like us , " haentjes said . " that could be an advantage for the independent sector and make the market more competitive .

on monday , eu hearings begin on bmg 's planned merger with sony . the major housecleaning at the german division of bmg is part of the creation of a " fundamental cultural change " at the company , according to the division 's new president , maarten steinkamp , who announced the new policy in a employee newsletter .
according to a spokesman , oliver fahlbusch , in the current situation that record companies find themselves in , having seen sales plummet a fifth since 2000 , bmg has to change the way it does business .
the company does n't want any more one-hit wonders .
last year , 85 percent of the new releases by bmg germany 's national artists sold fewer than 25,000 times , a statistic which according to steinkamp , is not sustainable .
" that brings us market share , but no money , " he said .
the new strategy is to concentrate on a few " career artists , " or on newcomers with potential for more than one hit or one successful cd .
in the past , according to the company , it spread its resources over too many different artists , instead of concentrating on a few promising ones and trying to turn them into " brand names . "
" while we will likely show fewer sales in fiscal year 2004 , our operating profits will double , " said steinkamp according to the financial times deutschland , although bmg germany 's 2003 results have not been published , they are thought to be weak , making steinkamp 's operating profit goal feasible .
bmg is not the only big record company to trying to get a grip on the industry 's financial situation by cleaning its house of poorer-selling artists , but its plan is the most far reaching .
emi records is also culling its ranks , but has thus far dropped 20 percent of its artists .
less choice , more market concentration independent labels have criticized bmg 's actions , saying it will result in a further concentration of the market and fewer artists being represented in record stores .
" it will lead to fewer artists having big marketing budgets to work with , " horst weidenmüller of impala , which represents about 2,000 independents , told the financial times deutschland .
" market access for new music will be harder and consumer choice will suffer . "

time and financial difficulties have eventually caught up with berlin 's legendary tempelhof airport .
the site of the berlin airlift is set to close later this year . if things go according to plan , the airport , a nazi jewel that later became a cold war legend , will close some time in october . officials at the administrative authority that runs berlin 's three airports say tempelhof 's declining passenger numbers combined with a need to trim down the number of airports in the capital , sealed its fate . " the airport has lost money for years , and we do n't think that 's going to change any time soon , " eberhart ellie , a spokesman for the authority told dw-world . two airports too many last year the airport , which is funded by subsidies from city and federal coffers , lost € 15 million , said ellie .
the poor economic performance is a death knell for any business in the capital , which is swimming in a € 30-billion debt . add to that a bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tempelhof is home to mostly regional airlines desire by berlin city officials to turn the now-schoenefeld airport into the berlin-brandenburg international airport -lrb- bbi -rrb- by 2010 , and tempelhof 's closing was predestined . " even if it had survived a few more years , they do n't plan on keeping two city airports open after bbi opens in 2010 , " said ellie . the airport 's advocates , among them city officials and industry heads , have started a grassroots movement to save tempelhof .
the world 's oldest airport is now used primarily by regional and smaller airlines which would be left out in the cold by tempelhof 's closure , said andreas peter . the head of icat , an organization made up of tempelhof supporters , peter says as passenger numbers continue to climb , tegel and schoenefeld will face over-capacity problems .
peter blames the berlin airport authority for not doing enough to try and save it . critics : will is n't there " if -lrb- the airport -rrb- was n't constantly dismissed , if the buildings were n't managed so poorly , they might not be losing all the money , " peter told dw-world .
" it needs to be marketed better . " of the three airports , tempelhof is the largest , most central and most storied .
hitler cast his eye on the building in the 1930s , investing large sums of money to create a fitting airport for his massive capital .
following the end of wwii , the airport became part of the u.s. sector of berlin , where only a few years later it would find a place in history . airlift sealed its place in history it was in west berlin 's tempelhof that american planes landed with much-needed supplies after the soviets sealed off berlin in 1948 .
the ussr eventually relented in 1949 , and tempelhof and the " raisin bombers " that brought food , candy and supplies to thankful berliners became part of the city 's lore . but since the end of the cold war , the airport has suffered from increasing competition and decreasing passenger counts .
lufthansa left in the mid-1990s and moved to tegel airport in the northwest part of the city .
last year , only 400,000 passengers passed through the airport .
elie said 1.5 million were needed for the airport to break even . a home where the buffalo roam ? though airlines dba and germania said last week they would be willing to transfer their business to tempelhof from tegel , elie has yet to see any indication they really mean it . " there are no concrete business plans -lrb- out there -rrb- that look at how tempelhof can be made financially solvent , " said elie . architects are already debating what should be done with the estimated 300,000 square meters of space near the city center .
one group wants to establish a " central park , " another company wants to build a golf course .
the strangest , and most unlikely , is a plan to create a reserve - for buffalo . andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de breakthrough in sight for berlin airport project insiders say project-planning company pps will take a major step towards constructing a new international airport for the german capital .

martin petrov broke free to feed the ball to zoran jankovich and dimitar berbatov , but the swedish defense always managed to ward off the worst . sweden took the lead in the 32nd minute after freddie ljungberg tapped in a pass from zlatan ibrahimovic , who bolted away from bulgarian defenders attempting to leave him offside .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgaria had a chance to level when petrov got past mikael nilsson and chipped it to jankovich who had a clear shot on goal but he headed it past the far post . it was then that henrik larsson buried bulgaria 's hopes early in the second half after scoring two goals within two minutes .
first the striker put one past the keeper with a flying header in the 57th minute and 60 seconds later he returned to the penalty area to use his left foot to score again . it marked an amazing return for larsson , who had retired from international soccer after the 2002 world cup to spend more time with his son .
begged by his coach and politely asked by members of the swedish royal family to return , only after his six-year-old son gave his approval did he decide to don the national jersey again . after ljungberg was downed on the edge of the penalty area , ibrahimovic nailed the coffin shut by converting a penalty in the 76th minute and substitute marcus allbäck added insult to injury by sinking a distance shot after the match had crossed into injury time . the 5-0 win is the highest scoring victory for the swedes at a european championship . lineups : sweden : andreas isaksson ; teddy lucic , olof mellberg , andreas jakobsson , erik edman ; tobias linderoth , mikael nilsson , fredrik ljungberg , anders svensson ; zlatan ibrahimovic , henrik larsson . bulgaria : zdravko zdravkov ; vladimir ivanov , rossen kirilov , ivailo petkov , pedrag pajin ; stilian petrov , marian hristov , georgi peev , martin petrov ; zoran jankovich , dimitar berbatov . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro 2004 : group by group dw-world looks at how the groups match up .

time and financial difficulties have eventually caught up with berlin 's legendary tempelhof airport .
the site of the berlin airlift is set to close later this year . if things go according to plan , the airport , a nazi jewel that later became a cold war legend , will close some time in october . officials at the administrative authority that runs berlin 's three airports say tempelhof 's declining passenger numbers combined with a need to trim down the number of airports in the capital , sealed its fate . " the airport has lost money for years , and we do n't think that 's going to change any time soon , " eberhart ellie , a spokesman for the authority told dw-world . two airports too many last year the airport , which is funded by subsidies from city and federal coffers , lost € 15 million , said ellie .
the poor economic performance is a death knell for any business in the capital , which is swimming in a € 30-billion debt . add to that a bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tempelhof is home to mostly regional airlines desire by berlin city officials to turn the now-schoenefeld airport into the berlin-brandenburg international airport -lrb- bbi -rrb- by 2010 , and tempelhof 's closing was predestined . " even if it had survived a few more years , they do n't plan on keeping two city airports open after bbi opens in 2010 , " said ellie . the airport 's advocates , among them city officials and industry heads , have started a grassroots movement to save tempelhof .
the world 's oldest airport is now used primarily by regional and smaller airlines which would be left out in the cold by tempelhof 's closure , said andreas peter . the head of icat , an organization made up of tempelhof supporters , peter says as passenger numbers continue to climb , tegel and schoenefeld will face over-capacity problems .
peter blames the berlin airport authority for not doing enough to try and save it . critics : will is n't there " if -lrb- the airport -rrb- was n't constantly dismissed , if the buildings were n't managed so poorly , they might not be losing all the money , " peter told dw-world .
" it needs to be marketed better . " of the three airports , tempelhof is the largest , most central and most storied .
hitler cast his eye on the building in the 1930s , investing large sums of money to create a fitting airport for his massive capital .
following the end of wwii , the airport became part of the u.s. sector of berlin , where only a few years later it would find a place in history . airlift sealed its place in history it was in west berlin 's tempelhof that american planes landed with much-needed supplies after the soviets sealed off berlin in 1948 .
the ussr eventually relented in 1949 , and tempelhof and the " raisin bombers " that brought food , candy and supplies to thankful berliners became part of the city 's lore . but since the end of the cold war , the airport has suffered from increasing competition and decreasing passenger counts .
lufthansa left in the mid-1990s and moved to tegel airport in the northwest part of the city .
last year , only 400,000 passengers passed through the airport .
elie said 1.5 million were needed for the airport to break even . a home where the buffalo roam ? though airlines dba and germania said last week they would be willing to transfer their business to tempelhof from tegel , elie has yet to see any indication they really mean it . " there are no concrete business plans -lrb- out there -rrb- that look at how tempelhof can be made financially solvent , " said elie . architects are already debating what should be done with the estimated 300,000 square meters of space near the city center .
one group wants to establish a " central park , " another company wants to build a golf course .
the strangest , and most unlikely , is a plan to create a reserve - for buffalo . andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de breakthrough in sight for berlin airport project insiders say project-planning company pps will take a major step towards constructing a new international airport for the german capital .

on monday , eu hearings begin on bmg 's planned merger with sony . the major housecleaning at the german division of bmg is part of the creation of a " fundamental cultural change " at the company , according to the division 's new president , maarten steinkamp , who announced the new policy in a employee newsletter .
according to a spokesman , oliver fahlbusch , in the current situation that record companies find themselves in , having seen sales plummet a fifth since 2000 , bmg has to change the way it does business .
the company does n't want any more one-hit wonders .
last year , 85 percent of the new releases by bmg germany 's national artists sold fewer than 25,000 times , a statistic which according to steinkamp , is not sustainable .
" that brings us market share , but no money , " he said .
the new strategy is to concentrate on a few " career artists , " or on newcomers with potential for more than one hit or one successful cd .
in the past , according to the company , it spread its resources over too many different artists , instead of concentrating on a few promising ones and trying to turn them into " brand names . "
" while we will likely show fewer sales in fiscal year 2004 , our operating profits will double , " said steinkamp according to the financial times deutschland , although bmg germany 's 2003 results have not been published , they are thought to be weak , making steinkamp 's operating profit goal feasible .
bmg is not the only big record company to trying to get a grip on the industry 's financial situation by cleaning its house of poorer-selling artists , but its plan is the most far reaching .
emi records is also culling its ranks , but has thus far dropped 20 percent of its artists .
less choice , more market concentration independent labels have criticized bmg 's actions , saying it will result in a further concentration of the market and fewer artists being represented in record stores .
" it will lead to fewer artists having big marketing budgets to work with , " horst weidenmüller of impala , which represents about 2,000 independents , told the financial times deutschland .
" market access for new music will be harder and consumer choice will suffer . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beyonce knowles is one of sony 's most successful artists .
independent music companies are also critical of the planned merger between bmg and another of the globe 's top five record companies , sony .
on monday , bmg and sony went in front eu 's antitrust commission to try to get the bloc 's approval for a fusion , which would create the world 's second-largest music company .
indie labels have said a sony-bmg tie-up could prove deadly to smaller companies , who are also struggling to survive in the current economic climate .
" it 's much more dangerous to allow market concentration in a weak market , because small companies will find it even harder to survive , " osman eralp , economic advisor to impala , told the associated press . he and other heads of some of europe 's largest independents say a merger would put them in danger of being " marginalized further " by the big players who " manipulate access to music at retail , media and on the internet . "
they called on the eu to block the merger or call on the sony and bmg to put " broad remedies " in place to curb possible abuses of market power .
up to the now , the eu has objected to the deal because the new company would control some 25 percent of the market and reduce the " big five " record companies to four , which would control 80 percent of the market .
however , sony and bmg has said a merger is necessary to sustain long-term viability in a turbulent market and that a partnership would allow them to invest more in artists and repertoire than they could on their own .
silver lining despite the criticism of bmg germany 's contract cancellations , some indies see a bright side .
michael haentjes of germany-based edel music said the less-popular artists suddenly finding themselves without a label could find a new home with the independents .
" artists that only sell midsize numbers will probably become available for companies like us , " haentjes said . " that could be an advantage for the independent sector and make the market more competitive .

on monday , eu hearings begin on bmg 's planned merger with sony . the major housecleaning at the german division of bmg is part of the creation of a " fundamental cultural change " at the company , according to the division 's new president , maarten steinkamp , who announced the new policy in a employee newsletter .
according to a spokesman , oliver fahlbusch , in the current situation that record companies find themselves in , having seen sales plummet a fifth since 2000 , bmg has to change the way it does business .
the company does n't want any more one-hit wonders .
last year , 85 percent of the new releases by bmg germany 's national artists sold fewer than 25,000 times , a statistic which according to steinkamp , is not sustainable .
" that brings us market share , but no money , " he said .
the new strategy is to concentrate on a few " career artists , " or on newcomers with potential for more than one hit or one successful cd .
in the past , according to the company , it spread its resources over too many different artists , instead of concentrating on a few promising ones and trying to turn them into " brand names . "
" while we will likely show fewer sales in fiscal year 2004 , our operating profits will double , " said steinkamp according to the financial times deutschland , although bmg germany 's 2003 results have not been published , they are thought to be weak , making steinkamp 's operating profit goal feasible .
bmg is not the only big record company to trying to get a grip on the industry 's financial situation by cleaning its house of poorer-selling artists , but its plan is the most far reaching .
emi records is also culling its ranks , but has thus far dropped 20 percent of its artists .
less choice , more market concentration independent labels have criticized bmg 's actions , saying it will result in a further concentration of the market and fewer artists being represented in record stores .
" it will lead to fewer artists having big marketing budgets to work with , " horst weidenmüller of impala , which represents about 2,000 independents , told the financial times deutschland .
" market access for new music will be harder and consumer choice will suffer . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beyonce knowles is one of sony 's most successful artists .
independent music companies are also critical of the planned merger between bmg and another of the globe 's top five record companies , sony .
on monday , bmg and sony went in front eu 's antitrust commission to try to get the bloc 's approval for a fusion , which would create the world 's second-largest music company .
indie labels have said a sony-bmg tie-up could prove deadly to smaller companies , who are also struggling to survive in the current economic climate .
" it 's much more dangerous to allow market concentration in a weak market , because small companies will find it even harder to survive , " osman eralp , economic advisor to impala , told the associated press . he and other heads of some of europe 's largest independents say a merger would put them in danger of being " marginalized further " by the big players who " manipulate access to music at retail , media and on the internet . "
they called on the eu to block the merger or call on the sony and bmg to put " broad remedies " in place to curb possible abuses of market power .
up to the now , the eu has objected to the deal because the new company would control some 25 percent of the market and reduce the " big five " record companies to four , which would control 80 percent of the market .
however , sony and bmg has said a merger is necessary to sustain long-term viability in a turbulent market and that a partnership would allow them to invest more in artists and repertoire than they could on their own .

time and financial difficulties have eventually caught up with berlin 's legendary tempelhof airport .
the site of the berlin airlift is set to close later this year . if things go according to plan , the airport , a nazi jewel that later became a cold war legend , will close some time in october . officials at the administrative authority that runs berlin 's three airports say tempelhof 's declining passenger numbers combined with a need to trim down the number of airports in the capital , sealed its fate . " the airport has lost money for years , and we do n't think that 's going to change any time soon , " eberhart ellie , a spokesman for the authority told dw-world . two airports too many last year the airport , which is funded by subsidies from city and federal coffers , lost € 15 million , said ellie .
the poor economic performance is a death knell for any business in the capital , which is swimming in a € 30-billion debt . add to that a bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tempelhof is home to mostly regional airlines desire by berlin city officials to turn the now-schoenefeld airport into the berlin-brandenburg international airport -lrb- bbi -rrb- by 2010 , and tempelhof 's closing was predestined . " even if it had survived a few more years , they do n't plan on keeping two city airports open after bbi opens in 2010 , " said ellie . the airport 's advocates , among them city officials and industry heads , have started a grassroots movement to save tempelhof .
the world 's oldest airport is now used primarily by regional and smaller airlines which would be left out in the cold by tempelhof 's closure , said andreas peter . the head of icat , an organization made up of tempelhof supporters , peter says as passenger numbers continue to climb , tegel and schoenefeld will face over-capacity problems .
peter blames the berlin airport authority for not doing enough to try and save it . critics : will is n't there " if -lrb- the airport -rrb- was n't constantly dismissed , if the buildings were n't managed so poorly , they might not be losing all the money , " peter told dw-world .
" it needs to be marketed better . " of the three airports , tempelhof is the largest , most central and most storied .
hitler cast his eye on the building in the 1930s , investing large sums of money to create a fitting airport for his massive capital .
following the end of wwii , the airport became part of the u.s. sector of berlin , where only a few years later it would find a place in history . airlift sealed its place in history it was in west berlin 's tempelhof that american planes landed with much-needed supplies after the soviets sealed off berlin in 1948 .
the ussr eventually relented in 1949 , and tempelhof and the " raisin bombers " that brought food , candy and supplies to thankful berliners became part of the city 's lore . but since the end of the cold war , the airport has suffered from increasing competition and decreasing passenger counts .
lufthansa left in the mid-1990s and moved to tegel airport in the northwest part of the city .
last year , only 400,000 passengers passed through the airport .
elie said 1.5 million were needed for the airport to break even . a home where the buffalo roam ? though airlines dba and germania said last week they would be willing to transfer their business to tempelhof from tegel , elie has yet to see any indication they really mean it . " there are no concrete business plans -lrb- out there -rrb- that look at how tempelhof can be made financially solvent , " said elie . architects are already debating what should be done with the estimated 300,000 square meters of space near the city center .
one group wants to establish a " central park , " another company wants to build a golf course .
the strangest , and most unlikely , is a plan to create a reserve - for buffalo . andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de breakthrough in sight for berlin airport project insiders say project-planning company pps will take a major step towards constructing a new international airport for the german capital .

time and financial difficulties have eventually caught up with berlin 's legendary tempelhof airport .
the site of the berlin airlift is set to close later this year . if things go according to plan , the airport , a nazi jewel that later became a cold war legend , will close some time in october . officials at the administrative authority that runs berlin 's three airports say tempelhof 's declining passenger numbers combined with a need to trim down the number of airports in the capital , sealed its fate . " the airport has lost money for years , and we do n't think that 's going to change any time soon , " eberhart ellie , a spokesman for the authority told dw-world . two airports too many last year the airport , which is funded by subsidies from city and federal coffers , lost € 15 million , said ellie .
the poor economic performance is a death knell for any business in the capital , which is swimming in a € 30-billion debt . add to that a bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tempelhof is home to mostly regional airlines desire by berlin city officials to turn the now-schoenefeld airport into the berlin-brandenburg international airport -lrb- bbi -rrb- by 2010 , and tempelhof 's closing was predestined . " even if it had survived a few more years , they do n't plan on keeping two city airports open after bbi opens in 2010 , " said ellie . the airport 's advocates , among them city officials and industry heads , have started a grassroots movement to save tempelhof .
the world 's oldest airport is now used primarily by regional and smaller airlines which would be left out in the cold by tempelhof 's closure , said andreas peter . the head of icat , an organization made up of tempelhof supporters , peter says as passenger numbers continue to climb , tegel and schoenefeld will face over-capacity problems .
peter blames the berlin airport authority for not doing enough to try and save it . critics : will is n't there " if -lrb- the airport -rrb- was n't constantly dismissed , if the buildings were n't managed so poorly , they might not be losing all the money , " peter told dw-world .
" it needs to be marketed better . " of the three airports , tempelhof is the largest , most central and most storied .
hitler cast his eye on the building in the 1930s , investing large sums of money to create a fitting airport for his massive capital .
following the end of wwii , the airport became part of the u.s. sector of berlin , where only a few years later it would find a place in history . airlift sealed its place in history it was in west berlin 's tempelhof that american planes landed with much-needed supplies after the soviets sealed off berlin in 1948 .
the ussr eventually relented in 1949 , and tempelhof and the " raisin bombers " that brought food , candy and supplies to thankful berliners became part of the city 's lore . but since the end of the cold war , the airport has suffered from increasing competition and decreasing passenger counts .
lufthansa left in the mid-1990s and moved to tegel airport in the northwest part of the city .
last year , only 400,000 passengers passed through the airport .
elie said 1.5 million were needed for the airport to break even . a home where the buffalo roam ? though airlines dba and germania said last week they would be willing to transfer their business to tempelhof from tegel , elie has yet to see any indication they really mean it . " there are no concrete business plans -lrb- out there -rrb- that look at how tempelhof can be made financially solvent , " said elie . architects are already debating what should be done with the estimated 300,000 square meters of space near the city center .
one group wants to establish a " central park , " another company wants to build a golf course .
the strangest , and most unlikely , is a plan to create a reserve - for buffalo . andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de breakthrough in sight for berlin airport project insiders say project-planning company pps will take a major step towards constructing a new international airport for the german capital .

sweden demolished bulgaria 5-0 in the second group c match on monday , as striker henrik larsson sealed his return to the national team with two goals in rapid succession . the match in the portuguese capital lisbon started with a spirited first half with scoring chances on both sides .
the bulgarians came fast and furious , repeatedly launching attacks .
martin petrov broke free to feed the ball to zoran jankovich and dimitar berbatov , but the swedish defense always managed to ward off the worst . sweden took the lead in the 32nd minute after freddie ljungberg tapped in a pass from zlatan ibrahimovic , who bolted away from bulgarian defenders attempting to leave him offside .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgaria had a chance to level when petrov got past mikael nilsson and chipped it to jankovich who had a clear shot on goal but he headed it past the far post . it was then that henrik larsson buried bulgaria 's hopes early in the second half after scoring two goals within two minutes .
first the striker put one past the keeper with a flying header in the 57th minute and 60 seconds later he returned to the penalty area to use his left foot to score again . it marked an amazing return for larsson , who had retired from international soccer after the 2002 world cup to spend more time with his son .
begged by his coach and politely asked by members of the swedish royal family to return , only after his six-year-old son gave his approval did he decide to don the national jersey again . after ljungberg was downed on the edge of the penalty area , ibrahimovic nailed the coffin shut by converting a penalty in the 76th minute and substitute marcus allbäck added insult to injury by sinking a distance shot after the match had crossed into injury time . the 5-0 win is the highest scoring victory for the swedes at a european championship . lineups : sweden : andreas isaksson ; teddy lucic , olof mellberg , andreas jakobsson , erik edman ; tobias linderoth , mikael nilsson , fredrik ljungberg , anders svensson ; zlatan ibrahimovic , henrik larsson . bulgaria : zdravko zdravkov ; vladimir ivanov , rossen kirilov , ivailo petkov , pedrag pajin ; stilian petrov , marian hristov , georgi peev , martin petrov ; zoran jankovich , dimitar berbatov . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro 2004 : group by group dw-world looks at how the groups match up .

sweden demolished bulgaria 5-0 in the second group c match on monday , as striker henrik larsson sealed his return to the national team with two goals in rapid succession . the match in the portuguese capital lisbon started with a spirited first half with scoring chances on both sides .
the bulgarians came fast and furious , repeatedly launching attacks .
martin petrov broke free to feed the ball to zoran jankovich and dimitar berbatov , but the swedish defense always managed to ward off the worst . sweden took the lead in the 32nd minute after freddie ljungberg tapped in a pass from zlatan ibrahimovic , who bolted away from bulgarian defenders attempting to leave him offside .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgaria had a chance to level when petrov got past mikael nilsson and chipped it to jankovich who had a clear shot on goal but he headed it past the far post . it was then that henrik larsson buried bulgaria 's hopes early in the second half after scoring two goals within two minutes .
first the striker put one past the keeper with a flying header in the 57th minute and 60 seconds later he returned to the penalty area to use his left foot to score again . it marked an amazing return for larsson , who had retired from international soccer after the 2002 world cup to spend more time with his son .
begged by his coach and politely asked by members of the swedish royal family to return , only after his six-year-old son gave his approval did he decide to don the national jersey again . after ljungberg was downed on the edge of the penalty area , ibrahimovic nailed the coffin shut by converting a penalty in the 76th minute and substitute marcus allbäck added insult to injury by sinking a distance shot after the match had crossed into injury time . the 5-0 win is the highest scoring victory for the swedes at a european championship . lineups : sweden : andreas isaksson ; teddy lucic , olof mellberg , andreas jakobsson , erik edman ; tobias linderoth , mikael nilsson , fredrik ljungberg , anders svensson ; zlatan ibrahimovic , henrik larsson . bulgaria : zdravko zdravkov ; vladimir ivanov , rossen kirilov , ivailo petkov , pedrag pajin ; stilian petrov , marian hristov , georgi peev , martin petrov ; zoran jankovich , dimitar berbatov . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro 2004 : group by group dw-world looks at how the groups match up .

german chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats took a drubbing in elections for the european parliament , as well as regional elections in the eastern state of thuringia , raising doubts about the party 's future . sunday 's election results were just the latest in an almost unbroken 18-month run of defeats for the social democrats . exit polls in elections for the european parliament showed a dismal slump to just 21.5 percent for the spd , compared with 44.5 percent for the conservative opposition parties , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- . bildunterschrift : results for germany 's political parties in the european elections at 21:42 utc . the spd also suffered a landslide defeat in thuringia 's regional elections , sliding to 14.5 percent .
despite a slight dip in popularity , the cdu was able to maintain its absolute majority in the eastern german state . capping the spd 's defeat is the fact that the former east german communist party , the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- came in a strong second in thuringia , usurping the spd 's traditional role as the worker 's party .
in the parliamentary elections , the pds also improved its standing from the last european election in 1999 . social democrats concede ' surprise ' although the spd had expected to suffer some losses in the polls , the party 's main candidate for the eu parliament , martin schulz , conceded that he was " surprised " by how heavy the defeats were .
" i did n't think it would hit us so hard , " he told german public broadcaster phoenix .
schulz said that low turnout , particularly for the eu parliamentary elections , which were held on the opening weekend of the euro 2004 soccer championships , was partly to blame . " it 's a bitter result , " said klaus uwe benneter , the spd 's general secretary .
benneter also attributed the painful round of social cuts and economic reforms for the dismal result .
throughout europe , he said , parties have been punished for their reform policies .
" but it would be irresponsible for us to align our policies with election dates and polls . " most political analysts agree that schröder has no option but to carry on with his party 's reform agenda , although they acknowledge that staying the course could force the spd into a downward spiral , and usher in a new period of conservative rule in germany . conservative leaders were understandably gleeful about the outcome , with cdu leader angela merkel calling it a " disaster " for schröder 's government .
" this is a great day for the cdu and a good day for germany , " said cdu general secretary laurenz meyer .
he added that the spd had fallen to a " low point never seen before . " crunch time the spd is hoping to achieve a turnaround in voter sentiment in time for a crucial state election in its stronghold and the country 's industrial heartland - north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- .
the election there is slated for may , 2005 .
if the party loses this core state , the conservatives will have a two-thirds majority in the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , giving them the power to block all government legislation . before the nrw election , the spd faces three more state polls in september .
pressure is mounting from many party insiders to ease the pace of economic reforms in an effort to save the spd 's fading reputation as the people 's party .
there is also speculation about a possible cabinet reshuffle . however , party chief franz müntefering insisted there would be no change in policy and no reshuffle despite what he called a " bitter result . " " i 'm convinced we 're doing the right thing to combine lasting social justice with wealth , " müntefering said . strong gains by greens as the social democrats licked their wounds , their junior coalition partner in berlin , the greens , celebrated their best result yet in a european election . bildunterschrift : gains and losses by party in 2004 compared to the 1999 european election . green party chief reinhard bütikofer described his party as the day 's " true victor . "
the green 's main parliamentary candidate , rebecca harms , said the gains were the result of the environmentally friendly party 's " hard work , " the strong candidates it put forward , and voter affinity with the green 's platforms on human rights , environmental protection , consumer protection , and agricultural policy . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european parliament elections 2004 dw-world 's full coverage of this year 's european parliamentary elections .

german chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats took a drubbing in elections for the european parliament , as well as regional elections in the eastern state of thuringia , raising doubts about the party 's future . sunday 's election results were just the latest in an almost unbroken 18-month run of defeats for the social democrats . exit polls in elections for the european parliament showed a dismal slump to just 21.5 percent for the spd , compared with 44.5 percent for the conservative opposition parties , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- . bildunterschrift : results for germany 's political parties in the european elections at 21:42 utc . the spd also suffered a landslide defeat in thuringia 's regional elections , sliding to 14.5 percent .
despite a slight dip in popularity , the cdu was able to maintain its absolute majority in the eastern german state . capping the spd 's defeat is the fact that the former east german communist party , the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- came in a strong second in thuringia , usurping the spd 's traditional role as the worker 's party .
in the parliamentary elections , the pds also improved its standing from the last european election in 1999 . social democrats concede ' surprise ' although the spd had expected to suffer some losses in the polls , the party 's main candidate for the eu parliament , martin schulz , conceded that he was " surprised " by how heavy the defeats were .
" i did n't think it would hit us so hard , " he told german public broadcaster phoenix .
schulz said that low turnout , particularly for the eu parliamentary elections , which were held on the opening weekend of the euro 2004 soccer championships , was partly to blame . " it 's a bitter result , " said klaus uwe benneter , the spd 's general secretary .
benneter also attributed the painful round of social cuts and economic reforms for the dismal result .
throughout europe , he said , parties have been punished for their reform policies .
" but it would be irresponsible for us to align our policies with election dates and polls . " most political analysts agree that schröder has no option but to carry on with his party 's reform agenda , although they acknowledge that staying the course could force the spd into a downward spiral , and usher in a new period of conservative rule in germany . conservative leaders were understandably gleeful about the outcome , with cdu leader angela merkel calling it a " disaster " for schröder 's government .
" this is a great day for the cdu and a good day for germany , " said cdu general secretary laurenz meyer .
he added that the spd had fallen to a " low point never seen before . " crunch time the spd is hoping to achieve a turnaround in voter sentiment in time for a crucial state election in its stronghold and the country 's industrial heartland - north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- .

on monday , eu hearings begin on bmg 's planned merger with sony . the major housecleaning at the german division of bmg is part of the creation of a " fundamental cultural change " at the company , according to the division 's new president , maarten steinkamp , who announced the new policy in a employee newsletter .
according to a spokesman , oliver fahlbusch , in the current situation that record companies find themselves in , having seen sales plummet a fifth since 2000 , bmg has to change the way it does business .
the company does n't want any more one-hit wonders .
last year , 85 percent of the new releases by bmg germany 's national artists sold fewer than 25,000 times , a statistic which according to steinkamp , is not sustainable .
" that brings us market share , but no money , " he said .
the new strategy is to concentrate on a few " career artists , " or on newcomers with potential for more than one hit or one successful cd .
in the past , according to the company , it spread its resources over too many different artists , instead of concentrating on a few promising ones and trying to turn them into " brand names . "
" while we will likely show fewer sales in fiscal year 2004 , our operating profits will double , " said steinkamp according to the financial times deutschland , although bmg germany 's 2003 results have not been published , they are thought to be weak , making steinkamp 's operating profit goal feasible .
bmg is not the only big record company to trying to get a grip on the industry 's financial situation by cleaning its house of poorer-selling artists , but its plan is the most far reaching .
emi records is also culling its ranks , but has thus far dropped 20 percent of its artists .
less choice , more market concentration independent labels have criticized bmg 's actions , saying it will result in a further concentration of the market and fewer artists being represented in record stores .
" it will lead to fewer artists having big marketing budgets to work with , " horst weidenmüller of impala , which represents about 2,000 independents , told the financial times deutschland .
" market access for new music will be harder and consumer choice will suffer . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beyonce knowles is one of sony 's most successful artists .
independent music companies are also critical of the planned merger between bmg and another of the globe 's top five record companies , sony .
on monday , bmg and sony went in front eu 's antitrust commission to try to get the bloc 's approval for a fusion , which would create the world 's second-largest music company .
indie labels have said a sony-bmg tie-up could prove deadly to smaller companies , who are also struggling to survive in the current economic climate .
" it 's much more dangerous to allow market concentration in a weak market , because small companies will find it even harder to survive , " osman eralp , economic advisor to impala , told the associated press . he and other heads of some of europe 's largest independents say a merger would put them in danger of being " marginalized further " by the big players who " manipulate access to music at retail , media and on the internet . "
they called on the eu to block the merger or call on the sony and bmg to put " broad remedies " in place to curb possible abuses of market power .
up to the now , the eu has objected to the deal because the new company would control some 25 percent of the market and reduce the " big five " record companies to four , which would control 80 percent of the market .
however , sony and bmg has said a merger is necessary to sustain long-term viability in a turbulent market and that a partnership would allow them to invest more in artists and repertoire than they could on their own .
silver lining despite the criticism of bmg germany 's contract cancellations , some indies see a bright side .
michael haentjes of germany-based edel music said the less-popular artists suddenly finding themselves without a label could find a new home with the independents .

sweden demolished bulgaria 5-0 in the second group c match on monday , as striker henrik larsson sealed his return to the national team with two goals in rapid succession . the match in the portuguese capital lisbon started with a spirited first half with scoring chances on both sides .
the bulgarians came fast and furious , repeatedly launching attacks .
martin petrov broke free to feed the ball to zoran jankovich and dimitar berbatov , but the swedish defense always managed to ward off the worst . sweden took the lead in the 32nd minute after freddie ljungberg tapped in a pass from zlatan ibrahimovic , who bolted away from bulgarian defenders attempting to leave him offside .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgaria had a chance to level when petrov got past mikael nilsson and chipped it to jankovich who had a clear shot on goal but he headed it past the far post . it was then that henrik larsson buried bulgaria 's hopes early in the second half after scoring two goals within two minutes .
first the striker put one past the keeper with a flying header in the 57th minute and 60 seconds later he returned to the penalty area to use his left foot to score again . it marked an amazing return for larsson , who had retired from international soccer after the 2002 world cup to spend more time with his son .
begged by his coach and politely asked by members of the swedish royal family to return , only after his six-year-old son gave his approval did he decide to don the national jersey again . after ljungberg was downed on the edge of the penalty area , ibrahimovic nailed the coffin shut by converting a penalty in the 76th minute and substitute marcus allbäck added insult to injury by sinking a distance shot after the match had crossed into injury time . the 5-0 win is the highest scoring victory for the swedes at a european championship . lineups : sweden : andreas isaksson ; teddy lucic , olof mellberg , andreas jakobsson , erik edman ; tobias linderoth , mikael nilsson , fredrik ljungberg , anders svensson ; zlatan ibrahimovic , henrik larsson . bulgaria : zdravko zdravkov ; vladimir ivanov , rossen kirilov , ivailo petkov , pedrag pajin ; stilian petrov , marian hristov , georgi peev , martin petrov ; zoran jankovich , dimitar berbatov . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro 2004 : group by group dw-world looks at how the groups match up .

despite blazing hot temperatures in the in the northern city of guimarães , the first match of group c failed to ignite on monday as denmark held favorite italy to a 0-0 draw . in a game punctuated by solid defense and neutralized scoring chances , the squad of italian coach giovanni trapattoni failed to live up to expectations that they would dominate the danish . instead of melting in a blistering 33 degree celsius -lrb- 91 fahrenheit -rrb- heat , the scandinavians came out fighting and showed from the opening minutes of play that they would not be intimidated . the danish held the ball longer than their opponents and thomas helveg and jon dahl tomasson kept attacking throughout the match . denmark even managed to set the pace for large stretches of the game and threatened italian goalkeeper gianluigi buffon on a number of occasions .
buffon could not avoid giving the danish a couple of corner kicks , but he never failed to make the important saves . bildunterschrift : " is that il catenaccio ? " at the other end of the pitch , danish keeper thomas sörensen blunted the attack of italy 's star-studded offense .
as italy tried to increase the pressure at the end of the first half , sörensen managed two quick saves after rapid shots by alessandro del piero and francesco totti . the italians put together a beautiful combination in the 53rd minute but gianluca zambrotta failed to get the goal as his shot rolled just past the post .
after another chance by del piero was pushed over the crossbar by sörensen , play on both sides started to slow . del piero was pulled out in the 64th minute for substitute antonio cassano as trapattoni tried to up italy 's attack , but to no avail . barring a similar result in the other group c matchup of sweden and bulgaria , the draw will force both teams to win their next matches to keep their hopes of advancing alive . lineups : denmark : thomas sörensen ; thomas helveg , martin laursen , rene henriksen , niclas jensen ; dennis rommedahl , danieljensen , christian poulsen , martin jörgensen ; jon dahl tomasson ; ebbe sand . italy : gianluigi buffon ; christian panucci , fabio cannavaro , alessandro nesta , gianluca zambrotta ; simone perrotta , cristiano zanetti ; mauro camoranesi , francesco totti , alessandro del piero ; christian vieri . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro 2004 : group by group www-links euro 2004 official web site information on fc porto 's dragão stadium 9798 dw-tv europe live journal - news with business review we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

sweden demolished bulgaria 5-0 in the second group c match on monday , as striker henrik larsson sealed his return to the national team with two goals in rapid succession . the match in the portuguese capital lisbon started with a spirited first half with scoring chances on both sides .
the bulgarians came fast and furious , repeatedly launching attacks .
martin petrov broke free to feed the ball to zoran jankovich and dimitar berbatov , but the swedish defense always managed to ward off the worst . sweden took the lead in the 32nd minute after freddie ljungberg tapped in a pass from zlatan ibrahimovic , who bolted away from bulgarian defenders attempting to leave him offside .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgaria had a chance to level when petrov got past mikael nilsson and chipped it to jankovich who had a clear shot on goal but he headed it past the far post . it was then that henrik larsson buried bulgaria 's hopes early in the second half after scoring two goals within two minutes .
first the striker put one past the keeper with a flying header in the 57th minute and 60 seconds later he returned to the penalty area to use his left foot to score again . it marked an amazing return for larsson , who had retired from international soccer after the 2002 world cup to spend more time with his son .
begged by his coach and politely asked by members of the swedish royal family to return , only after his six-year-old son gave his approval did he decide to don the national jersey again . after ljungberg was downed on the edge of the penalty area , ibrahimovic nailed the coffin shut by converting a penalty in the 76th minute and substitute marcus allbäck added insult to injury by sinking a distance shot after the match had crossed into injury time . the 5-0 win is the highest scoring victory for the swedes at a european championship . lineups : sweden : andreas isaksson ; teddy lucic , olof mellberg , andreas jakobsson , erik edman ; tobias linderoth , mikael nilsson , fredrik ljungberg , anders svensson ; zlatan ibrahimovic , henrik larsson . bulgaria : zdravko zdravkov ; vladimir ivanov , rossen kirilov , ivailo petkov , pedrag pajin ; stilian petrov , marian hristov , georgi peev , martin petrov ; zoran jankovich , dimitar berbatov . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro 2004 : group by group dw-world looks at how the groups match up .

despite blazing hot temperatures in the in the northern city of guimarães , the first match of group c failed to ignite on monday as denmark held favorite italy to a 0-0 draw . in a game punctuated by solid defense and neutralized scoring chances , the squad of italian coach giovanni trapattoni failed to live up to expectations that they would dominate the danish . instead of melting in a blistering 33 degree celsius -lrb- 91 fahrenheit -rrb- heat , the scandinavians came out fighting and showed from the opening minutes of play that they would not be intimidated . the danish held the ball longer than their opponents and thomas helveg and jon dahl tomasson kept attacking throughout the match . denmark even managed to set the pace for large stretches of the game and threatened italian goalkeeper gianluigi buffon on a number of occasions .
buffon could not avoid giving the danish a couple of corner kicks , but he never failed to make the important saves . bildunterschrift : " is that il catenaccio ? " at the other end of the pitch , danish keeper thomas sörensen blunted the attack of italy 's star-studded offense .
as italy tried to increase the pressure at the end of the first half , sörensen managed two quick saves after rapid shots by alessandro del piero and francesco totti . the italians put together a beautiful combination in the 53rd minute but gianluca zambrotta failed to get the goal as his shot rolled just past the post .

as italy tried to increase the pressure at the end of the first half , sörensen managed two quick saves after rapid shots by alessandro del piero and francesco totti . the italians put together a beautiful combination in the 53rd minute but gianluca zambrotta failed to get the goal as his shot rolled just past the post .
after another chance by del piero was pushed over the crossbar by sörensen , play on both sides started to slow . del piero was pulled out in the 64th minute for substitute antonio cassano as trapattoni tried to up italy 's attack , but to no avail . barring a similar result in the other group c matchup of sweden and bulgaria , the draw will force both teams to win their next matches to keep their hopes of advancing alive . lineups : denmark : thomas sörensen ; thomas helveg , martin laursen , rene henriksen , niclas jensen ; dennis rommedahl , danieljensen , christian poulsen , martin jörgensen ; jon dahl tomasson ; ebbe sand . italy : gianluigi buffon ; christian panucci , fabio cannavaro , alessandro nesta , gianluca zambrotta ; simone perrotta , cristiano zanetti ; mauro camoranesi , francesco totti , alessandro del piero ; christian vieri . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro 2004 : group by group www-links euro 2004 official web site information on fc porto 's dragão stadium 9798 dw-tv europe live special program we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

dw-world readers wrote in : ukip is no threat to the eu itself but to the uk 's membership in it .
most " brits " are not willing to be subsumed into an undemocratic superstate that does n't act in the national interest of member states but seeks to destroy nations and nationhood .
most ukip supporters are freedom-loving individuals with far more experience of mainland europe than the average brit .
we wish to trade with the eu , holiday there , buy property and invest there , but we do not wish to be ruled by others - simple .
we love you as equals but not as our masters . - michael mcgough it appears that ukip is taking a page from the u.s. republican party playbook and promoting the illusion that " going it alone " will somehow help the uk achieve an enhanced " muscular " independence from its euro partners .
but like the u.s. republican party , it will come to regret turning its back on its true friends and partners and come crawling back - when things get rough . - tom ukip is not necessarily right wing ; plenty of its support comes from the left .
although it will never gain power at westminster , it has already managed to get people talking about leaving the eu as a real possibility and thus has shattered 30 years of cozy consensus between the major parties on this issue .
the eu will in any case disintegrate under the weight of its own contradictions , corruption , bureaucracy , waste and fraud , but whether the uk can leave before this happens remains to be seen . - richard sigrist contrary to media reports , most ukip members and supporters are not racist , fascist or mad .
they just look at the arguments about sovereignty , economic advantage etc and draw a logical conclusion - we put in far more than we get back .
why not reverse the net disadvantage and get out ?

dw-world readers wrote in : ukip is no threat to the eu itself but to the uk 's membership in it .

we wish to trade with the eu , holiday there , buy property and invest there , but we do not wish to be ruled by others - simple .

but like the u.s. republican party , it will come to regret turning its back on its true friends and partners and come crawling back - when things get rough . - tom ukip is not necessarily right wing ; plenty of its support comes from the left .
although it will never gain power at westminster , it has already managed to get people talking about leaving the eu as a real possibility and thus has shattered 30 years of cozy consensus between the major parties on this issue .
the eu will in any case disintegrate under the weight of its own contradictions , corruption , bureaucracy , waste and fraud , but whether the uk can leave before this happens remains to be seen . - richard sigrist contrary to media reports , most ukip members and supporters are not racist , fascist or mad .

german chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats took a drubbing in elections for the european parliament , as well as regional elections in the eastern state of thuringia , raising doubts about the party 's future . sunday 's election results were just the latest in an almost unbroken 18-month run of defeats for the social democrats . exit polls in elections for the european parliament showed a dismal slump to just 21.5 percent for the spd , compared with 44.5 percent for the conservative opposition parties , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- . bildunterschrift : results for germany 's political parties in the european elections at 21:42 utc . the spd also suffered a landslide defeat in thuringia 's regional elections , sliding to 14.5 percent .
despite a slight dip in popularity , the cdu was able to maintain its absolute majority in the eastern german state . capping the spd 's defeat is the fact that the former east german communist party , the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- came in a strong second in thuringia , usurping the spd 's traditional role as the worker 's party .
in the parliamentary elections , the pds also improved its standing from the last european election in 1999 . social democrats concede ' surprise ' although the spd had expected to suffer some losses in the polls , the party 's main candidate for the eu parliament , martin schulz , conceded that he was " surprised " by how heavy the defeats were .
" i did n't think it would hit us so hard , " he told german public broadcaster phoenix .
schulz said that low turnout , particularly for the eu parliamentary elections , which were held on the opening weekend of the euro 2004 soccer championships , was partly to blame . " it 's a bitter result , " said klaus uwe benneter , the spd 's general secretary .
benneter also attributed the painful round of social cuts and economic reforms for the dismal result .
throughout europe , he said , parties have been punished for their reform policies .
" but it would be irresponsible for us to align our policies with election dates and polls . " most political analysts agree that schröder has no option but to carry on with his party 's reform agenda , although they acknowledge that staying the course could force the spd into a downward spiral , and usher in a new period of conservative rule in germany . conservative leaders were understandably gleeful about the outcome , with cdu leader angela merkel calling it a " disaster " for schröder 's government .
" this is a great day for the cdu and a good day for germany , " said cdu general secretary laurenz meyer .
he added that the spd had fallen to a " low point never seen before . " crunch time the spd is hoping to achieve a turnaround in voter sentiment in time for a crucial state election in its stronghold and the country 's industrial heartland - north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- .
the election there is slated for may , 2005 .
if the party loses this core state , the conservatives will have a two-thirds majority in the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , giving them the power to block all government legislation . before the nrw election , the spd faces three more state polls in september .
pressure is mounting from many party insiders to ease the pace of economic reforms in an effort to save the spd 's fading reputation as the people 's party .
there is also speculation about a possible cabinet reshuffle . however , party chief franz müntefering insisted there would be no change in policy and no reshuffle despite what he called a " bitter result . " " i 'm convinced we 're doing the right thing to combine lasting social justice with wealth , " müntefering said . strong gains by greens as the social democrats licked their wounds , their junior coalition partner in berlin , the greens , celebrated their best result yet in a european election . bildunterschrift : gains and losses by party in 2004 compared to the 1999 european election . green party chief reinhard bütikofer described his party as the day 's " true victor . "
the green 's main parliamentary candidate , rebecca harms , said the gains were the result of the environmentally friendly party 's " hard work , " the strong candidates it put forward , and voter affinity with the green 's platforms on human rights , environmental protection , consumer protection , and agricultural policy . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european parliament elections 2004 dw-world 's full coverage of this year 's european parliamentary elections .

in the parliamentary elections , the pds also improved its standing from the last european election in 1999 . social democrats concede ' surprise ' although the spd had expected to suffer some losses in the polls , the party 's main candidate for the eu parliament , martin schulz , conceded that he was " surprised " by how heavy the defeats were .
" i did n't think it would hit us so hard , " he told german public broadcaster phoenix .
schulz said that low turnout , particularly for the eu parliamentary elections , which were held on the opening weekend of the euro 2004 soccer championships , was partly to blame . " it 's a bitter result , " said klaus uwe benneter , the spd 's general secretary .
benneter also attributed the painful round of social cuts and economic reforms for the dismal result .
throughout europe , he said , parties have been punished for their reform policies .
" but it would be irresponsible for us to align our policies with election dates and polls . " most political analysts agree that schröder has no option but to carry on with his party 's reform agenda , although they acknowledge that staying the course could force the spd into a downward spiral , and usher in a new period of conservative rule in germany . conservative leaders were understandably gleeful about the outcome , with cdu leader angela merkel calling it a " disaster " for schröder 's government .
" this is a great day for the cdu and a good day for germany , " said cdu general secretary laurenz meyer .
he added that the spd had fallen to a " low point never seen before . " crunch time the spd is hoping to achieve a turnaround in voter sentiment in time for a crucial state election in its stronghold and the country 's industrial heartland - north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- .
the election there is slated for may , 2005 .
if the party loses this core state , the conservatives will have a two-thirds majority in the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , giving them the power to block all government legislation . before the nrw election , the spd faces three more state polls in september .
pressure is mounting from many party insiders to ease the pace of economic reforms in an effort to save the spd 's fading reputation as the people 's party .
there is also speculation about a possible cabinet reshuffle . however , party chief franz müntefering insisted there would be no change in policy and no reshuffle despite what he called a " bitter result .

time and financial difficulties have eventually caught up with berlin 's legendary tempelhof airport .
the site of the berlin airlift is set to close later this year . if things go according to plan , the airport , a nazi jewel that later became a cold war legend , will close some time in october . officials at the administrative authority that runs berlin 's three airports say tempelhof 's declining passenger numbers combined with a need to trim down the number of airports in the capital , sealed its fate . " the airport has lost money for years , and we do n't think that 's going to change any time soon , " eberhart ellie , a spokesman for the authority told dw-world . two airports too many last year the airport , which is funded by subsidies from city and federal coffers , lost € 15 million , said ellie .
the poor economic performance is a death knell for any business in the capital , which is swimming in a € 30-billion debt . add to that a bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tempelhof is home to mostly regional airlines desire by berlin city officials to turn the now-schoenefeld airport into the berlin-brandenburg international airport -lrb- bbi -rrb- by 2010 , and tempelhof 's closing was predestined . " even if it had survived a few more years , they do n't plan on keeping two city airports open after bbi opens in 2010 , " said ellie . the airport 's advocates , among them city officials and industry heads , have started a grassroots movement to save tempelhof .
the world 's oldest airport is now used primarily by regional and smaller airlines which would be left out in the cold by tempelhof 's closure , said andreas peter . the head of icat , an organization made up of tempelhof supporters , peter says as passenger numbers continue to climb , tegel and schoenefeld will face over-capacity problems .
peter blames the berlin airport authority for not doing enough to try and save it . critics : will is n't there " if -lrb- the airport -rrb- was n't constantly dismissed , if the buildings were n't managed so poorly , they might not be losing all the money , " peter told dw-world .
" it needs to be marketed better . " of the three airports , tempelhof is the largest , most central and most storied .
hitler cast his eye on the building in the 1930s , investing large sums of money to create a fitting airport for his massive capital .
following the end of wwii , the airport became part of the u.s. sector of berlin , where only a few years later it would find a place in history . airlift sealed its place in history it was in west berlin 's tempelhof that american planes landed with much-needed supplies after the soviets sealed off berlin in 1948 .
the ussr eventually relented in 1949 , and tempelhof and the " raisin bombers " that brought food , candy and supplies to thankful berliners became part of the city 's lore . but since the end of the cold war , the airport has suffered from increasing competition and decreasing passenger counts .
lufthansa left in the mid-1990s and moved to tegel airport in the northwest part of the city .
last year , only 400,000 passengers passed through the airport .
elie said 1.5 million were needed for the airport to break even . a home where the buffalo roam ? though airlines dba and germania said last week they would be willing to transfer their business to tempelhof from tegel , elie has yet to see any indication they really mean it . " there are no concrete business plans -lrb- out there -rrb- that look at how tempelhof can be made financially solvent , " said elie . architects are already debating what should be done with the estimated 300,000 square meters of space near the city center .
one group wants to establish a " central park , " another company wants to build a golf course .
the strangest , and most unlikely , is a plan to create a reserve - for buffalo . andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de breakthrough in sight for berlin airport project insiders say project-planning company pps will take a major step towards constructing a new international airport for the german capital .

on monday , eu hearings begin on bmg 's planned merger with sony . the major housecleaning at the german division of bmg is part of the creation of a " fundamental cultural change " at the company , according to the division 's new president , maarten steinkamp , who announced the new policy in a employee newsletter .
according to a spokesman , oliver fahlbusch , in the current situation that record companies find themselves in , having seen sales plummet a fifth since 2000 , bmg has to change the way it does business .
the company does n't want any more one-hit wonders .
last year , 85 percent of the new releases by bmg germany 's national artists sold fewer than 25,000 times , a statistic which according to steinkamp , is not sustainable .
" that brings us market share , but no money , " he said .
the new strategy is to concentrate on a few " career artists , " or on newcomers with potential for more than one hit or one successful cd .
in the past , according to the company , it spread its resources over too many different artists , instead of concentrating on a few promising ones and trying to turn them into " brand names . "
" while we will likely show fewer sales in fiscal year 2004 , our operating profits will double , " said steinkamp according to the financial times deutschland , although bmg germany 's 2003 results have not been published , they are thought to be weak , making steinkamp 's operating profit goal feasible .
bmg is not the only big record company to trying to get a grip on the industry 's financial situation by cleaning its house of poorer-selling artists , but its plan is the most far reaching .
emi records is also culling its ranks , but has thus far dropped 20 percent of its artists .
less choice , more market concentration independent labels have criticized bmg 's actions , saying it will result in a further concentration of the market and fewer artists being represented in record stores .
" it will lead to fewer artists having big marketing budgets to work with , " horst weidenmüller of impala , which represents about 2,000 independents , told the financial times deutschland .
" market access for new music will be harder and consumer choice will suffer . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beyonce knowles is one of sony 's most successful artists .
independent music companies are also critical of the planned merger between bmg and another of the globe 's top five record companies , sony .
on monday , bmg and sony went in front eu 's antitrust commission to try to get the bloc 's approval for a fusion , which would create the world 's second-largest music company .
indie labels have said a sony-bmg tie-up could prove deadly to smaller companies , who are also struggling to survive in the current economic climate .
" it 's much more dangerous to allow market concentration in a weak market , because small companies will find it even harder to survive , " osman eralp , economic advisor to impala , told the associated press . he and other heads of some of europe 's largest independents say a merger would put them in danger of being " marginalized further " by the big players who " manipulate access to music at retail , media and on the internet . "
they called on the eu to block the merger or call on the sony and bmg to put " broad remedies " in place to curb possible abuses of market power .
up to the now , the eu has objected to the deal because the new company would control some 25 percent of the market and reduce the " big five " record companies to four , which would control 80 percent of the market .
however , sony and bmg has said a merger is necessary to sustain long-term viability in a turbulent market and that a partnership would allow them to invest more in artists and repertoire than they could on their own .
silver lining despite the criticism of bmg germany 's contract cancellations , some indies see a bright side .
michael haentjes of germany-based edel music said the less-popular artists suddenly finding themselves without a label could find a new home with the independents .
" artists that only sell midsize numbers will probably become available for companies like us , " haentjes said .

on monday , eu hearings begin on bmg 's planned merger with sony . the major housecleaning at the german division of bmg is part of the creation of a " fundamental cultural change " at the company , according to the division 's new president , maarten steinkamp , who announced the new policy in a employee newsletter .
according to a spokesman , oliver fahlbusch , in the current situation that record companies find themselves in , having seen sales plummet a fifth since 2000 , bmg has to change the way it does business .
the company does n't want any more one-hit wonders .
last year , 85 percent of the new releases by bmg germany 's national artists sold fewer than 25,000 times , a statistic which according to steinkamp , is not sustainable .
" that brings us market share , but no money , " he said .
the new strategy is to concentrate on a few " career artists , " or on newcomers with potential for more than one hit or one successful cd .
in the past , according to the company , it spread its resources over too many different artists , instead of concentrating on a few promising ones and trying to turn them into " brand names . "
" while we will likely show fewer sales in fiscal year 2004 , our operating profits will double , " said steinkamp according to the financial times deutschland , although bmg germany 's 2003 results have not been published , they are thought to be weak , making steinkamp 's operating profit goal feasible .
bmg is not the only big record company to trying to get a grip on the industry 's financial situation by cleaning its house of poorer-selling artists , but its plan is the most far reaching .
emi records is also culling its ranks , but has thus far dropped 20 percent of its artists .
less choice , more market concentration independent labels have criticized bmg 's actions , saying it will result in a further concentration of the market and fewer artists being represented in record stores .
" it will lead to fewer artists having big marketing budgets to work with , " horst weidenmüller of impala , which represents about 2,000 independents , told the financial times deutschland .
" market access for new music will be harder and consumer choice will suffer . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beyonce knowles is one of sony 's most successful artists .
independent music companies are also critical of the planned merger between bmg and another of the globe 's top five record companies , sony .
on monday , bmg and sony went in front eu 's antitrust commission to try to get the bloc 's approval for a fusion , which would create the world 's second-largest music company .
indie labels have said a sony-bmg tie-up could prove deadly to smaller companies , who are also struggling to survive in the current economic climate .
" it 's much more dangerous to allow market concentration in a weak market , because small companies will find it even harder to survive , " osman eralp , economic advisor to impala , told the associated press . he and other heads of some of europe 's largest independents say a merger would put them in danger of being " marginalized further " by the big players who " manipulate access to music at retail , media and on the internet . "
they called on the eu to block the merger or call on the sony and bmg to put " broad remedies " in place to curb possible abuses of market power .
up to the now , the eu has objected to the deal because the new company would control some 25 percent of the market and reduce the " big five " record companies to four , which would control 80 percent of the market .
however , sony and bmg has said a merger is necessary to sustain long-term viability in a turbulent market and that a partnership would allow them to invest more in artists and repertoire than they could on their own .

german chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats took a drubbing in elections for the european parliament , as well as regional elections in the eastern state of thuringia , raising doubts about the party 's future . sunday 's election results were just the latest in an almost unbroken 18-month run of defeats for the social democrats . exit polls in elections for the european parliament showed a dismal slump to just 21.5 percent for the spd , compared with 44.5 percent for the conservative opposition parties , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- . bildunterschrift : results for germany 's political parties in the european elections at 21:42 utc . the spd also suffered a landslide defeat in thuringia 's regional elections , sliding to 14.5 percent .
despite a slight dip in popularity , the cdu was able to maintain its absolute majority in the eastern german state . capping the spd 's defeat is the fact that the former east german communist party , the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- came in a strong second in thuringia , usurping the spd 's traditional role as the worker 's party .
in the parliamentary elections , the pds also improved its standing from the last european election in 1999 . social democrats concede ' surprise ' although the spd had expected to suffer some losses in the polls , the party 's main candidate for the eu parliament , martin schulz , conceded that he was " surprised " by how heavy the defeats were .
" i did n't think it would hit us so hard , " he told german public broadcaster phoenix .
schulz said that low turnout , particularly for the eu parliamentary elections , which were held on the opening weekend of the euro 2004 soccer championships , was partly to blame . " it 's a bitter result , " said klaus uwe benneter , the spd 's general secretary .
benneter also attributed the painful round of social cuts and economic reforms for the dismal result .
throughout europe , he said , parties have been punished for their reform policies .
" but it would be irresponsible for us to align our policies with election dates and polls . " most political analysts agree that schröder has no option but to carry on with his party 's reform agenda , although they acknowledge that staying the course could force the spd into a downward spiral , and usher in a new period of conservative rule in germany . conservative leaders were understandably gleeful about the outcome , with cdu leader angela merkel calling it a " disaster " for schröder 's government .
" this is a great day for the cdu and a good day for germany , " said cdu general secretary laurenz meyer .
he added that the spd had fallen to a " low point never seen before . " crunch time the spd is hoping to achieve a turnaround in voter sentiment in time for a crucial state election in its stronghold and the country 's industrial heartland - north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- .
the election there is slated for may , 2005 .
if the party loses this core state , the conservatives will have a two-thirds majority in the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , giving them the power to block all government legislation . before the nrw election , the spd faces three more state polls in september .
pressure is mounting from many party insiders to ease the pace of economic reforms in an effort to save the spd 's fading reputation as the people 's party .
there is also speculation about a possible cabinet reshuffle . however , party chief franz müntefering insisted there would be no change in policy and no reshuffle despite what he called a " bitter result . " " i 'm convinced we 're doing the right thing to combine lasting social justice with wealth , " müntefering said . strong gains by greens as the social democrats licked their wounds , their junior coalition partner in berlin , the greens , celebrated their best result yet in a european election . bildunterschrift : gains and losses by party in 2004 compared to the 1999 european election . green party chief reinhard bütikofer described his party as the day 's " true victor . "
the green 's main parliamentary candidate , rebecca harms , said the gains were the result of the environmentally friendly party 's " hard work , " the strong candidates it put forward , and voter affinity with the green 's platforms on human rights , environmental protection , consumer protection , and agricultural policy . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european parliament elections 2004 dw-world 's full coverage of this year 's european parliamentary elections .

sweden demolished bulgaria 5-0 in the second group c match on monday , as striker henrik larsson sealed his return to the national team with two goals in rapid succession . the match in the portuguese capital lisbon started with a spirited first half with scoring chances on both sides .
the bulgarians came fast and furious , repeatedly launching attacks .
martin petrov broke free to feed the ball to zoran jankovich and dimitar berbatov , but the swedish defense always managed to ward off the worst . sweden took the lead in the 32nd minute after freddie ljungberg tapped in a pass from zlatan ibrahimovic , who bolted away from bulgarian defenders attempting to leave him offside .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgaria had a chance to level when petrov got past mikael nilsson and chipped it to jankovich who had a clear shot on goal but he headed it past the far post . it was then that henrik larsson buried bulgaria 's hopes early in the second half after scoring two goals within two minutes .
first the striker put one past the keeper with a flying header in the 57th minute and 60 seconds later he returned to the penalty area to use his left foot to score again . it marked an amazing return for larsson , who had retired from international soccer after the 2002 world cup to spend more time with his son .
begged by his coach and politely asked by members of the swedish royal family to return , only after his six-year-old son gave his approval did he decide to don the national jersey again . after ljungberg was downed on the edge of the penalty area , ibrahimovic nailed the coffin shut by converting a penalty in the 76th minute and substitute marcus allbäck added insult to injury by sinking a distance shot after the match had crossed into injury time . the 5-0 win is the highest scoring victory for the swedes at a european championship . lineups : sweden : andreas isaksson ; teddy lucic , olof mellberg , andreas jakobsson , erik edman ; tobias linderoth , mikael nilsson , fredrik ljungberg , anders svensson ; zlatan ibrahimovic , henrik larsson . bulgaria : zdravko zdravkov ; vladimir ivanov , rossen kirilov , ivailo petkov , pedrag pajin ; stilian petrov , marian hristov , georgi peev , martin petrov ; zoran jankovich , dimitar berbatov . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro 2004 : group by group dw-world looks at how the groups match up .

despite blazing hot temperatures in the in the northern city of guimarães , the first match of group c failed to ignite on monday as denmark held favorite italy to a 0-0 draw . in a game punctuated by solid defense and neutralized scoring chances , the squad of italian coach giovanni trapattoni failed to live up to expectations that they would dominate the danish . instead of melting in a blistering 33 degree celsius -lrb- 91 fahrenheit -rrb- heat , the scandinavians came out fighting and showed from the opening minutes of play that they would not be intimidated . the danish held the ball longer than their opponents and thomas helveg and jon dahl tomasson kept attacking throughout the match . denmark even managed to set the pace for large stretches of the game and threatened italian goalkeeper gianluigi buffon on a number of occasions .
buffon could not avoid giving the danish a couple of corner kicks , but he never failed to make the important saves . bildunterschrift : " is that il catenaccio ? " at the other end of the pitch , danish keeper thomas sörensen blunted the attack of italy 's star-studded offense .
as italy tried to increase the pressure at the end of the first half , sörensen managed two quick saves after rapid shots by alessandro del piero and francesco totti . the italians put together a beautiful combination in the 53rd minute but gianluca zambrotta failed to get the goal as his shot rolled just past the post .
after another chance by del piero was pushed over the crossbar by sörensen , play on both sides started to slow . del piero was pulled out in the 64th minute for substitute antonio cassano as trapattoni tried to up italy 's attack , but to no avail . barring a similar result in the other group c matchup of sweden and bulgaria , the draw will force both teams to win their next matches to keep their hopes of advancing alive . lineups : denmark : thomas sörensen ; thomas helveg , martin laursen , rene henriksen , niclas jensen ; dennis rommedahl , danieljensen , christian poulsen , martin jörgensen ; jon dahl tomasson ; ebbe sand . italy : gianluigi buffon ; christian panucci , fabio cannavaro , alessandro nesta , gianluca zambrotta ; simone perrotta , cristiano zanetti ; mauro camoranesi , francesco totti , alessandro del piero ; christian vieri . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro 2004 : group by group www-links euro 2004 official web site information on fc porto 's dragão stadium 9799 dw-tv europe live im focus we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

despite blazing hot temperatures in the in the northern city of guimarães , the first match of group c failed to ignite on monday as denmark held favorite italy to a 0-0 draw . in a game punctuated by solid defense and neutralized scoring chances , the squad of italian coach giovanni trapattoni failed to live up to expectations that they would dominate the danish . instead of melting in a blistering 33 degree celsius -lrb- 91 fahrenheit -rrb- heat , the scandinavians came out fighting and showed from the opening minutes of play that they would not be intimidated . the danish held the ball longer than their opponents and thomas helveg and jon dahl tomasson kept attacking throughout the match . denmark even managed to set the pace for large stretches of the game and threatened italian goalkeeper gianluigi buffon on a number of occasions .
buffon could not avoid giving the danish a couple of corner kicks , but he never failed to make the important saves . bildunterschrift : " is that il catenaccio ? " at the other end of the pitch , danish keeper thomas sörensen blunted the attack of italy 's star-studded offense .
as italy tried to increase the pressure at the end of the first half , sörensen managed two quick saves after rapid shots by alessandro del piero and francesco totti . the italians put together a beautiful combination in the 53rd minute but gianluca zambrotta failed to get the goal as his shot rolled just past the post .
after another chance by del piero was pushed over the crossbar by sörensen , play on both sides started to slow . del piero was pulled out in the 64th minute for substitute antonio cassano as trapattoni tried to up italy 's attack , but to no avail . barring a similar result in the other group c matchup of sweden and bulgaria , the draw will force both teams to win their next matches to keep their hopes of advancing alive . lineups : denmark : thomas sörensen ; thomas helveg , martin laursen , rene henriksen , niclas jensen ; dennis rommedahl , danieljensen , christian poulsen , martin jörgensen ; jon dahl tomasson ; ebbe sand . italy : gianluigi buffon ; christian panucci , fabio cannavaro , alessandro nesta , gianluca zambrotta ; simone perrotta , cristiano zanetti ; mauro camoranesi , francesco totti , alessandro del piero ; christian vieri . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro 2004 : group by group www-links euro 2004 official web site information on fc porto 's dragão stadium 9799 dw-tv europe live journal - nachrichten mit wirtschaftsbilanz we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

although it will never gain power at westminster , it has already managed to get people talking about leaving the eu as a real possibility and thus has shattered 30 years of cozy consensus between the major parties on this issue .
the eu will in any case disintegrate under the weight of its own contradictions , corruption , bureaucracy , waste and fraud , but whether the uk can leave before this happens remains to be seen . - richard sigrist contrary to media reports , most ukip members and supporters are not racist , fascist or mad .

sweden demolished bulgaria 5-0 in the second group c match on monday , as striker henrik larsson sealed his return to the national team with two goals in rapid succession . the match in the portuguese capital lisbon started with a spirited first half with scoring chances on both sides .
the bulgarians came fast and furious , repeatedly launching attacks .
martin petrov broke free to feed the ball to zoran jankovich and dimitar berbatov , but the swedish defense always managed to ward off the worst . sweden took the lead in the 32nd minute after freddie ljungberg tapped in a pass from zlatan ibrahimovic , who bolted away from bulgarian defenders attempting to leave him offside .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgaria had a chance to level when petrov got past mikael nilsson and chipped it to jankovich who had a clear shot on goal but he headed it past the far post . it was then that henrik larsson buried bulgaria 's hopes early in the second half after scoring two goals within two minutes .
first the striker put one past the keeper with a flying header in the 57th minute and 60 seconds later he returned to the penalty area to use his left foot to score again . it marked an amazing return for larsson , who had retired from international soccer after the 2002 world cup to spend more time with his son .
begged by his coach and politely asked by members of the swedish royal family to return , only after his six-year-old son gave his approval did he decide to don the national jersey again . after ljungberg was downed on the edge of the penalty area , ibrahimovic nailed the coffin shut by converting a penalty in the 76th minute and substitute marcus allbäck added insult to injury by sinking a distance shot after the match had crossed into injury time . the 5-0 win is the highest scoring victory for the swedes at a european championship . lineups : sweden : andreas isaksson ; teddy lucic , olof mellberg , andreas jakobsson , erik edman ; tobias linderoth , mikael nilsson , fredrik ljungberg , anders svensson ; zlatan ibrahimovic , henrik larsson . bulgaria : zdravko zdravkov ; vladimir ivanov , rossen kirilov , ivailo petkov , pedrag pajin ; stilian petrov , marian hristov , georgi peev , martin petrov ; zoran jankovich , dimitar berbatov . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro 2004 : group by group dw-world looks at how the groups match up .

german chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats took a drubbing in elections for the european parliament , as well as regional elections in the eastern state of thuringia , raising doubts about the party 's future . sunday 's election results were just the latest in an almost unbroken 18-month run of defeats for the social democrats . exit polls in elections for the european parliament showed a dismal slump to just 21.5 percent for the spd , compared with 44.5 percent for the conservative opposition parties , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- . bildunterschrift : results for germany 's political parties in the european elections at 21:42 utc . the spd also suffered a landslide defeat in thuringia 's regional elections , sliding to 14.5 percent .
despite a slight dip in popularity , the cdu was able to maintain its absolute majority in the eastern german state . capping the spd 's defeat is the fact that the former east german communist party , the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- came in a strong second in thuringia , usurping the spd 's traditional role as the worker 's party .
in the parliamentary elections , the pds also improved its standing from the last european election in 1999 . social democrats concede ' surprise ' although the spd had expected to suffer some losses in the polls , the party 's main candidate for the eu parliament , martin schulz , conceded that he was " surprised " by how heavy the defeats were .
" i did n't think it would hit us so hard , " he told german public broadcaster phoenix .
schulz said that low turnout , particularly for the eu parliamentary elections , which were held on the opening weekend of the euro 2004 soccer championships , was partly to blame . " it 's a bitter result , " said klaus uwe benneter , the spd 's general secretary .
benneter also attributed the painful round of social cuts and economic reforms for the dismal result .
throughout europe , he said , parties have been punished for their reform policies .
" but it would be irresponsible for us to align our policies with election dates and polls . " most political analysts agree that schröder has no option but to carry on with his party 's reform agenda , although they acknowledge that staying the course could force the spd into a downward spiral , and usher in a new period of conservative rule in germany . conservative leaders were understandably gleeful about the outcome , with cdu leader angela merkel calling it a " disaster " for schröder 's government .
" this is a great day for the cdu and a good day for germany , " said cdu general secretary laurenz meyer .
he added that the spd had fallen to a " low point never seen before . " crunch time the spd is hoping to achieve a turnaround in voter sentiment in time for a crucial state election in its stronghold and the country 's industrial heartland - north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- .
the election there is slated for may , 2005 .
if the party loses this core state , the conservatives will have a two-thirds majority in the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , giving them the power to block all government legislation . before the nrw election , the spd faces three more state polls in september .
pressure is mounting from many party insiders to ease the pace of economic reforms in an effort to save the spd 's fading reputation as the people 's party .
there is also speculation about a possible cabinet reshuffle . however , party chief franz müntefering insisted there would be no change in policy and no reshuffle despite what he called a " bitter result . " " i 'm convinced we 're doing the right thing to combine lasting social justice with wealth , " müntefering said . strong gains by greens as the social democrats licked their wounds , their junior coalition partner in berlin , the greens , celebrated their best result yet in a european election . bildunterschrift : gains and losses by party in 2004 compared to the 1999 european election . green party chief reinhard bütikofer described his party as the day 's " true victor . "
the green 's main parliamentary candidate , rebecca harms , said the gains were the result of the environmentally friendly party 's " hard work , " the strong candidates it put forward , and voter affinity with the green 's platforms on human rights , environmental protection , consumer protection , and agricultural policy . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european parliament elections 2004 dw-world 's full coverage of this year 's european parliamentary elections .

german chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats took a drubbing in elections for the european parliament , as well as regional elections in the eastern state of thuringia , raising doubts about the party 's future . sunday 's election results were just the latest in an almost unbroken 18-month run of defeats for the social democrats . exit polls in elections for the european parliament showed a dismal slump to just 21.5 percent for the spd , compared with 44.5 percent for the conservative opposition parties , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- . bildunterschrift : results for germany 's political parties in the european elections at 21:42 utc . the spd also suffered a landslide defeat in thuringia 's regional elections , sliding to 14.5 percent .
despite a slight dip in popularity , the cdu was able to maintain its absolute majority in the eastern german state . capping the spd 's defeat is the fact that the former east german communist party , the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- came in a strong second in thuringia , usurping the spd 's traditional role as the worker 's party .
in the parliamentary elections , the pds also improved its standing from the last european election in 1999 . social democrats concede ' surprise ' although the spd had expected to suffer some losses in the polls , the party 's main candidate for the eu parliament , martin schulz , conceded that he was " surprised " by how heavy the defeats were .
" i did n't think it would hit us so hard , " he told german public broadcaster phoenix .
schulz said that low turnout , particularly for the eu parliamentary elections , which were held on the opening weekend of the euro 2004 soccer championships , was partly to blame . " it 's a bitter result , " said klaus uwe benneter , the spd 's general secretary .
benneter also attributed the painful round of social cuts and economic reforms for the dismal result .
throughout europe , he said , parties have been punished for their reform policies .
" but it would be irresponsible for us to align our policies with election dates and polls . " most political analysts agree that schröder has no option but to carry on with his party 's reform agenda , although they acknowledge that staying the course could force the spd into a downward spiral , and usher in a new period of conservative rule in germany . conservative leaders were understandably gleeful about the outcome , with cdu leader angela merkel calling it a " disaster " for schröder 's government .
" this is a great day for the cdu and a good day for germany , " said cdu general secretary laurenz meyer .
he added that the spd had fallen to a " low point never seen before . " crunch time the spd is hoping to achieve a turnaround in voter sentiment in time for a crucial state election in its stronghold and the country 's industrial heartland - north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- .
the election there is slated for may , 2005 .
if the party loses this core state , the conservatives will have a two-thirds majority in the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , giving them the power to block all government legislation . before the nrw election , the spd faces three more state polls in september .
pressure is mounting from many party insiders to ease the pace of economic reforms in an effort to save the spd 's fading reputation as the people 's party .
there is also speculation about a possible cabinet reshuffle . however , party chief franz müntefering insisted there would be no change in policy and no reshuffle despite what he called a " bitter result . " " i 'm convinced we 're doing the right thing to combine lasting social justice with wealth , " müntefering said . strong gains by greens as the social democrats licked their wounds , their junior coalition partner in berlin , the greens , celebrated their best result yet in a european election . bildunterschrift : gains and losses by party in 2004 compared to the 1999 european election . green party chief reinhard bütikofer described his party as the day 's " true victor . "
the green 's main parliamentary candidate , rebecca harms , said the gains were the result of the environmentally friendly party 's " hard work , " the strong candidates it put forward , and voter affinity with the green 's platforms on human rights , environmental protection , consumer protection , and agricultural policy . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european parliament elections 2004 dw-world 's full coverage of this year 's european parliamentary elections .

sweden demolished bulgaria 5-0 in the second group c match on monday , as striker henrik larsson sealed his return to the national team with two goals in rapid succession . the match in the portuguese capital lisbon started with a spirited first half with scoring chances on both sides .
the bulgarians came fast and furious , repeatedly launching attacks .
martin petrov broke free to feed the ball to zoran jankovich and dimitar berbatov , but the swedish defense always managed to ward off the worst . sweden took the lead in the 32nd minute after freddie ljungberg tapped in a pass from zlatan ibrahimovic , who bolted away from bulgarian defenders attempting to leave him offside .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgaria had a chance to level when petrov got past mikael nilsson and chipped it to jankovich who had a clear shot on goal but he headed it past the far post . it was then that henrik larsson buried bulgaria 's hopes early in the second half after scoring two goals within two minutes .
first the striker put one past the keeper with a flying header in the 57th minute and 60 seconds later he returned to the penalty area to use his left foot to score again . it marked an amazing return for larsson , who had retired from international soccer after the 2002 world cup to spend more time with his son .
begged by his coach and politely asked by members of the swedish royal family to return , only after his six-year-old son gave his approval did he decide to don the national jersey again . after ljungberg was downed on the edge of the penalty area , ibrahimovic nailed the coffin shut by converting a penalty in the 76th minute and substitute marcus allbäck added insult to injury by sinking a distance shot after the match had crossed into injury time . the 5-0 win is the highest scoring victory for the swedes at a european championship . lineups : sweden : andreas isaksson ; teddy lucic , olof mellberg , andreas jakobsson , erik edman ; tobias linderoth , mikael nilsson , fredrik ljungberg , anders svensson ; zlatan ibrahimovic , henrik larsson . bulgaria : zdravko zdravkov ; vladimir ivanov , rossen kirilov , ivailo petkov , pedrag pajin ; stilian petrov , marian hristov , georgi peev , martin petrov ; zoran jankovich , dimitar berbatov . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro 2004 : group by group dw-world looks at how the groups match up .

despite blazing hot temperatures in the in the northern city of guimarães , the first match of group c failed to ignite on monday as denmark held favorite italy to a 0-0 draw . in a game punctuated by solid defense and neutralized scoring chances , the squad of italian coach giovanni trapattoni failed to live up to expectations that they would dominate the danish . instead of melting in a blistering 33 degree celsius -lrb- 91 fahrenheit -rrb- heat , the scandinavians came out fighting and showed from the opening minutes of play that they would not be intimidated . the danish held the ball longer than their opponents and thomas helveg and jon dahl tomasson kept attacking throughout the match . denmark even managed to set the pace for large stretches of the game and threatened italian goalkeeper gianluigi buffon on a number of occasions .
buffon could not avoid giving the danish a couple of corner kicks , but he never failed to make the important saves . bildunterschrift : " is that il catenaccio ? " at the other end of the pitch , danish keeper thomas sörensen blunted the attack of italy 's star-studded offense .
as italy tried to increase the pressure at the end of the first half , sörensen managed two quick saves after rapid shots by alessandro del piero and francesco totti . the italians put together a beautiful combination in the 53rd minute but gianluca zambrotta failed to get the goal as his shot rolled just past the post .
after another chance by del piero was pushed over the crossbar by sörensen , play on both sides started to slow . del piero was pulled out in the 64th minute for substitute antonio cassano as trapattoni tried to up italy 's attack , but to no avail . barring a similar result in the other group c matchup of sweden and bulgaria , the draw will force both teams to win their next matches to keep their hopes of advancing alive . lineups : denmark : thomas sörensen ; thomas helveg , martin laursen , rene henriksen , niclas jensen ; dennis rommedahl , danieljensen , christian poulsen , martin jörgensen ; jon dahl tomasson ; ebbe sand . italy : gianluigi buffon ; christian panucci , fabio cannavaro , alessandro nesta , gianluca zambrotta ; simone perrotta , cristiano zanetti ; mauro camoranesi , francesco totti , alessandro del piero ; christian vieri . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro 2004 : group by group www-links euro 2004 official web site information on fc porto 's dragão stadium 9799 dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

time and financial difficulties have eventually caught up with berlin 's legendary tempelhof airport .
the site of the berlin airlift is set to close later this year . if things go according to plan , the airport , a nazi jewel that later became a cold war legend , will close some time in october . officials at the administrative authority that runs berlin 's three airports say tempelhof 's declining passenger numbers combined with a need to trim down the number of airports in the capital , sealed its fate . " the airport has lost money for years , and we do n't think that 's going to change any time soon , " eberhart ellie , a spokesman for the authority told dw-world . two airports too many last year the airport , which is funded by subsidies from city and federal coffers , lost € 15 million , said ellie .
the poor economic performance is a death knell for any business in the capital , which is swimming in a € 30-billion debt . add to that a bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tempelhof is home to mostly regional airlines desire by berlin city officials to turn the now-schoenefeld airport into the berlin-brandenburg international airport -lrb- bbi -rrb- by 2010 , and tempelhof 's closing was predestined . " even if it had survived a few more years , they do n't plan on keeping two city airports open after bbi opens in 2010 , " said ellie . the airport 's advocates , among them city officials and industry heads , have started a grassroots movement to save tempelhof .
the world 's oldest airport is now used primarily by regional and smaller airlines which would be left out in the cold by tempelhof 's closure , said andreas peter . the head of icat , an organization made up of tempelhof supporters , peter says as passenger numbers continue to climb , tegel and schoenefeld will face over-capacity problems .
peter blames the berlin airport authority for not doing enough to try and save it . critics : will is n't there " if -lrb- the airport -rrb- was n't constantly dismissed , if the buildings were n't managed so poorly , they might not be losing all the money , " peter told dw-world .
" it needs to be marketed better . " of the three airports , tempelhof is the largest , most central and most storied .
hitler cast his eye on the building in the 1930s , investing large sums of money to create a fitting airport for his massive capital .
following the end of wwii , the airport became part of the u.s. sector of berlin , where only a few years later it would find a place in history . airlift sealed its place in history it was in west berlin 's tempelhof that american planes landed with much-needed supplies after the soviets sealed off berlin in 1948 .
the ussr eventually relented in 1949 , and tempelhof and the " raisin bombers " that brought food , candy and supplies to thankful berliners became part of the city 's lore . but since the end of the cold war , the airport has suffered from increasing competition and decreasing passenger counts .
lufthansa left in the mid-1990s and moved to tegel airport in the northwest part of the city .
last year , only 400,000 passengers passed through the airport .
elie said 1.5 million were needed for the airport to break even . a home where the buffalo roam ? though airlines dba and germania said last week they would be willing to transfer their business to tempelhof from tegel , elie has yet to see any indication they really mean it . " there are no concrete business plans -lrb- out there -rrb- that look at how tempelhof can be made financially solvent , " said elie . architects are already debating what should be done with the estimated 300,000 square meters of space near the city center .
one group wants to establish a " central park , " another company wants to build a golf course .
the strangest , and most unlikely , is a plan to create a reserve - for buffalo . andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de breakthrough in sight for berlin airport project insiders say project-planning company pps will take a major step towards constructing a new international airport for the german capital .

the site of the berlin airlift is set to close later this year . if things go according to plan , the airport , a nazi jewel that later became a cold war legend , will close some time in october . officials at the administrative authority that runs berlin 's three airports say tempelhof 's declining passenger numbers combined with a need to trim down the number of airports in the capital , sealed its fate . " the airport has lost money for years , and we do n't think that 's going to change any time soon , " eberhart ellie , a spokesman for the authority told dw-world . two airports too many last year the airport , which is funded by subsidies from city and federal coffers , lost € 15 million , said ellie .
the poor economic performance is a death knell for any business in the capital , which is swimming in a € 30-billion debt . add to that a bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tempelhof is home to mostly regional airlines desire by berlin city officials to turn the now-schoenefeld airport into the berlin-brandenburg international airport -lrb- bbi -rrb- by 2010 , and tempelhof 's closing was predestined . " even if it had survived a few more years , they do n't plan on keeping two city airports open after bbi opens in 2010 , " said ellie . the airport 's advocates , among them city officials and industry heads , have started a grassroots movement to save tempelhof .
the world 's oldest airport is now used primarily by regional and smaller airlines which would be left out in the cold by tempelhof 's closure , said andreas peter . the head of icat , an organization made up of tempelhof supporters , peter says as passenger numbers continue to climb , tegel and schoenefeld will face over-capacity problems .
peter blames the berlin airport authority for not doing enough to try and save it . critics : will is n't there " if -lrb- the airport -rrb- was n't constantly dismissed , if the buildings were n't managed so poorly , they might not be losing all the money , " peter told dw-world .
" it needs to be marketed better . " of the three airports , tempelhof is the largest , most central and most storied .
hitler cast his eye on the building in the 1930s , investing large sums of money to create a fitting airport for his massive capital .
following the end of wwii , the airport became part of the u.s. sector of berlin , where only a few years later it would find a place in history . airlift sealed its place in history it was in west berlin 's tempelhof that american planes landed with much-needed supplies after the soviets sealed off berlin in 1948 .
the ussr eventually relented in 1949 , and tempelhof and the " raisin bombers " that brought food , candy and supplies to thankful berliners became part of the city 's lore . but since the end of the cold war , the airport has suffered from increasing competition and decreasing passenger counts .
lufthansa left in the mid-1990s and moved to tegel airport in the northwest part of the city .
last year , only 400,000 passengers passed through the airport .
elie said 1.5 million were needed for the airport to break even . a home where the buffalo roam ? though airlines dba and germania said last week they would be willing to transfer their business to tempelhof from tegel , elie has yet to see any indication they really mean it . " there are no concrete business plans -lrb- out there -rrb- that look at how tempelhof can be made financially solvent , " said elie . architects are already debating what should be done with the estimated 300,000 square meters of space near the city center .
one group wants to establish a " central park , " another company wants to build a golf course .
the strangest , and most unlikely , is a plan to create a reserve - for buffalo . andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de breakthrough in sight for berlin airport project insiders say project-planning company pps will take a major step towards constructing a new international airport for the german capital .

first the striker put one past the keeper with a flying header in the 57th minute and 60 seconds later he returned to the penalty area to use his left foot to score again . it marked an amazing return for larsson , who had retired from international soccer after the 2002 world cup to spend more time with his son .

german chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats took a drubbing in elections for the european parliament , as well as regional elections in the eastern state of thuringia , raising doubts about the party 's future . sunday 's election results were just the latest in an almost unbroken 18-month run of defeats for the social democrats . exit polls in elections for the european parliament showed a dismal slump to just 21.5 percent for the spd , compared with 44.5 percent for the conservative opposition parties , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- . bildunterschrift : results for germany 's political parties in the european elections at 21:42 utc . the spd also suffered a landslide defeat in thuringia 's regional elections , sliding to 14.5 percent .
despite a slight dip in popularity , the cdu was able to maintain its absolute majority in the eastern german state . capping the spd 's defeat is the fact that the former east german communist party , the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- came in a strong second in thuringia , usurping the spd 's traditional role as the worker 's party .
in the parliamentary elections , the pds also improved its standing from the last european election in 1999 . social democrats concede ' surprise ' although the spd had expected to suffer some losses in the polls , the party 's main candidate for the eu parliament , martin schulz , conceded that he was " surprised " by how heavy the defeats were .
" i did n't think it would hit us so hard , " he told german public broadcaster phoenix .
schulz said that low turnout , particularly for the eu parliamentary elections , which were held on the opening weekend of the euro 2004 soccer championships , was partly to blame . " it 's a bitter result , " said klaus uwe benneter , the spd 's general secretary .
benneter also attributed the painful round of social cuts and economic reforms for the dismal result .
throughout europe , he said , parties have been punished for their reform policies .
" but it would be irresponsible for us to align our policies with election dates and polls . " most political analysts agree that schröder has no option but to carry on with his party 's reform agenda , although they acknowledge that staying the course could force the spd into a downward spiral , and usher in a new period of conservative rule in germany . conservative leaders were understandably gleeful about the outcome , with cdu leader angela merkel calling it a " disaster " for schröder 's government .
" this is a great day for the cdu and a good day for germany , " said cdu general secretary laurenz meyer .
he added that the spd had fallen to a " low point never seen before . " crunch time the spd is hoping to achieve a turnaround in voter sentiment in time for a crucial state election in its stronghold and the country 's industrial heartland - north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- .
the election there is slated for may , 2005 .
if the party loses this core state , the conservatives will have a two-thirds majority in the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , giving them the power to block all government legislation . before the nrw election , the spd faces three more state polls in september .
pressure is mounting from many party insiders to ease the pace of economic reforms in an effort to save the spd 's fading reputation as the people 's party .
there is also speculation about a possible cabinet reshuffle . however , party chief franz müntefering insisted there would be no change in policy and no reshuffle despite what he called a " bitter result . " " i 'm convinced we 're doing the right thing to combine lasting social justice with wealth , " müntefering said . strong gains by greens as the social democrats licked their wounds , their junior coalition partner in berlin , the greens , celebrated their best result yet in a european election . bildunterschrift : gains and losses by party in 2004 compared to the 1999 european election . green party chief reinhard bütikofer described his party as the day 's " true victor .

german chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats took a drubbing in elections for the european parliament , as well as regional elections in the eastern state of thuringia , raising doubts about the party 's future . sunday 's election results were just the latest in an almost unbroken 18-month run of defeats for the social democrats . exit polls in elections for the european parliament showed a dismal slump to just 21.5 percent for the spd , compared with 44.5 percent for the conservative opposition parties , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- . bildunterschrift : results for germany 's political parties in the european elections at 21:42 utc . the spd also suffered a landslide defeat in thuringia 's regional elections , sliding to 14.5 percent .
despite a slight dip in popularity , the cdu was able to maintain its absolute majority in the eastern german state . capping the spd 's defeat is the fact that the former east german communist party , the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- came in a strong second in thuringia , usurping the spd 's traditional role as the worker 's party .
in the parliamentary elections , the pds also improved its standing from the last european election in 1999 . social democrats concede ' surprise ' although the spd had expected to suffer some losses in the polls , the party 's main candidate for the eu parliament , martin schulz , conceded that he was " surprised " by how heavy the defeats were .
" i did n't think it would hit us so hard , " he told german public broadcaster phoenix .
schulz said that low turnout , particularly for the eu parliamentary elections , which were held on the opening weekend of the euro 2004 soccer championships , was partly to blame . " it 's a bitter result , " said klaus uwe benneter , the spd 's general secretary .
benneter also attributed the painful round of social cuts and economic reforms for the dismal result .
throughout europe , he said , parties have been punished for their reform policies .
" but it would be irresponsible for us to align our policies with election dates and polls . " most political analysts agree that schröder has no option but to carry on with his party 's reform agenda , although they acknowledge that staying the course could force the spd into a downward spiral , and usher in a new period of conservative rule in germany . conservative leaders were understandably gleeful about the outcome , with cdu leader angela merkel calling it a " disaster " for schröder 's government .
" this is a great day for the cdu and a good day for germany , " said cdu general secretary laurenz meyer .

the election there is slated for may , 2005 .
if the party loses this core state , the conservatives will have a two-thirds majority in the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , giving them the power to block all government legislation . before the nrw election , the spd faces three more state polls in september .
pressure is mounting from many party insiders to ease the pace of economic reforms in an effort to save the spd 's fading reputation as the people 's party .
there is also speculation about a possible cabinet reshuffle . however , party chief franz müntefering insisted there would be no change in policy and no reshuffle despite what he called a " bitter result .

on monday , eu hearings begin on bmg 's planned merger with sony . the major housecleaning at the german division of bmg is part of the creation of a " fundamental cultural change " at the company , according to the division 's new president , maarten steinkamp , who announced the new policy in a employee newsletter .
according to a spokesman , oliver fahlbusch , in the current situation that record companies find themselves in , having seen sales plummet a fifth since 2000 , bmg has to change the way it does business .
the company does n't want any more one-hit wonders .
last year , 85 percent of the new releases by bmg germany 's national artists sold fewer than 25,000 times , a statistic which according to steinkamp , is not sustainable .
" that brings us market share , but no money , " he said .
the new strategy is to concentrate on a few " career artists , " or on newcomers with potential for more than one hit or one successful cd .
in the past , according to the company , it spread its resources over too many different artists , instead of concentrating on a few promising ones and trying to turn them into " brand names . "
" while we will likely show fewer sales in fiscal year 2004 , our operating profits will double , " said steinkamp according to the financial times deutschland , although bmg germany 's 2003 results have not been published , they are thought to be weak , making steinkamp 's operating profit goal feasible .
bmg is not the only big record company to trying to get a grip on the industry 's financial situation by cleaning its house of poorer-selling artists , but its plan is the most far reaching .
emi records is also culling its ranks , but has thus far dropped 20 percent of its artists .
less choice , more market concentration independent labels have criticized bmg 's actions , saying it will result in a further concentration of the market and fewer artists being represented in record stores .
" it will lead to fewer artists having big marketing budgets to work with , " horst weidenmüller of impala , which represents about 2,000 independents , told the financial times deutschland .
" market access for new music will be harder and consumer choice will suffer . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beyonce knowles is one of sony 's most successful artists .
independent music companies are also critical of the planned merger between bmg and another of the globe 's top five record companies , sony .
on monday , bmg and sony went in front eu 's antitrust commission to try to get the bloc 's approval for a fusion , which would create the world 's second-largest music company .
indie labels have said a sony-bmg tie-up could prove deadly to smaller companies , who are also struggling to survive in the current economic climate .
" it 's much more dangerous to allow market concentration in a weak market , because small companies will find it even harder to survive , " osman eralp , economic advisor to impala , told the associated press . he and other heads of some of europe 's largest independents say a merger would put them in danger of being " marginalized further " by the big players who " manipulate access to music at retail , media and on the internet . "
they called on the eu to block the merger or call on the sony and bmg to put " broad remedies " in place to curb possible abuses of market power .
up to the now , the eu has objected to the deal because the new company would control some 25 percent of the market and reduce the " big five " record companies to four , which would control 80 percent of the market .
however , sony and bmg has said a merger is necessary to sustain long-term viability in a turbulent market and that a partnership would allow them to invest more in artists and repertoire than they could on their own .
silver lining despite the criticism of bmg germany 's contract cancellations , some indies see a bright side .
michael haentjes of germany-based edel music said the less-popular artists suddenly finding themselves without a label could find a new home with the independents .
" artists that only sell midsize numbers will probably become available for companies like us , " haentjes said . " that could be an advantage for the independent sector and make the market more competitive .

on monday , bmg and sony went in front eu 's antitrust commission to try to get the bloc 's approval for a fusion , which would create the world 's second-largest music company .
indie labels have said a sony-bmg tie-up could prove deadly to smaller companies , who are also struggling to survive in the current economic climate .

"
they called on the eu to block the merger or call on the sony and bmg to put " broad remedies " in place to curb possible abuses of market power .
up to the now , the eu has objected to the deal because the new company would control some 25 percent of the market and reduce the " big five " record companies to four , which would control 80 percent of the market .
however , sony and bmg has said a merger is necessary to sustain long-term viability in a turbulent market and that a partnership would allow them to invest more in artists and repertoire than they could on their own .

on monday , eu hearings begin on bmg 's planned merger with sony . the major housecleaning at the german division of bmg is part of the creation of a " fundamental cultural change " at the company , according to the division 's new president , maarten steinkamp , who announced the new policy in a employee newsletter .
according to a spokesman , oliver fahlbusch , in the current situation that record companies find themselves in , having seen sales plummet a fifth since 2000 , bmg has to change the way it does business .
the company does n't want any more one-hit wonders .
last year , 85 percent of the new releases by bmg germany 's national artists sold fewer than 25,000 times , a statistic which according to steinkamp , is not sustainable .
" that brings us market share , but no money , " he said .
the new strategy is to concentrate on a few " career artists , " or on newcomers with potential for more than one hit or one successful cd .
in the past , according to the company , it spread its resources over too many different artists , instead of concentrating on a few promising ones and trying to turn them into " brand names . "
" while we will likely show fewer sales in fiscal year 2004 , our operating profits will double , " said steinkamp according to the financial times deutschland , although bmg germany 's 2003 results have not been published , they are thought to be weak , making steinkamp 's operating profit goal feasible .
bmg is not the only big record company to trying to get a grip on the industry 's financial situation by cleaning its house of poorer-selling artists , but its plan is the most far reaching .
emi records is also culling its ranks , but has thus far dropped 20 percent of its artists .
less choice , more market concentration independent labels have criticized bmg 's actions , saying it will result in a further concentration of the market and fewer artists being represented in record stores .
" it will lead to fewer artists having big marketing budgets to work with , " horst weidenmüller of impala , which represents about 2,000 independents , told the financial times deutschland .
" market access for new music will be harder and consumer choice will suffer . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 14.06.2004 record giant bmg to drop majority of its german artists großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yvonne catterfeld is one of the few german bmg artists safe from cuts bmg , music arm of the bertelsmann group , announced it will dissolve its relationship with 60 percent of its german artists in a radical restructuring plan .
on monday , eu hearings begin on bmg 's planned merger with sony . the major housecleaning at the german division of bmg is part of the creation of a " fundamental cultural change " at the company , according to the division 's new president , maarten steinkamp , who announced the new policy in a employee newsletter .
according to a spokesman , oliver fahlbusch , in the current situation that record companies find themselves in , having seen sales plummet a fifth since 2000 , bmg has to change the way it does business .
the company does n't want any more one-hit wonders .
last year , 85 percent of the new releases by bmg germany 's national artists sold fewer than 25,000 times , a statistic which according to steinkamp , is not sustainable .
" that brings us market share , but no money , " he said .
the new strategy is to concentrate on a few " career artists , " or on newcomers with potential for more than one hit or one successful cd .
in the past , according to the company , it spread its resources over too many different artists , instead of concentrating on a few promising ones and trying to turn them into " brand names . "
" while we will likely show fewer sales in fiscal year 2004 , our operating profits will double , " said steinkamp according to the financial times deutschland , although bmg germany 's 2003 results have not been published , they are thought to be weak , making steinkamp 's operating profit goal feasible .
bmg is not the only big record company to trying to get a grip on the industry 's financial situation by cleaning its house of poorer-selling artists , but its plan is the most far reaching .
emi records is also culling its ranks , but has thus far dropped 20 percent of its artists .
less choice , more market concentration independent labels have criticized bmg 's actions , saying it will result in a further concentration of the market and fewer artists being represented in record stores .
" it will lead to fewer artists having big marketing budgets to work with , " horst weidenmüller of impala , which represents about 2,000 independents , told the financial times deutschland .
" market access for new music will be harder and consumer choice will suffer . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beyonce knowles is one of sony 's most successful artists .
independent music companies are also critical of the planned merger between bmg and another of the globe 's top five record companies , sony .
on monday , bmg and sony went in front eu 's antitrust commission to try to get the bloc 's approval for a fusion , which would create the world 's second-largest music company .
indie labels have said a sony-bmg tie-up could prove deadly to smaller companies , who are also struggling to survive in the current economic climate .
" it 's much more dangerous to allow market concentration in a weak market , because small companies will find it even harder to survive , " osman eralp , economic advisor to impala , told the associated press . he and other heads of some of europe 's largest independents say a merger would put them in danger of being " marginalized further " by the big players who " manipulate access to music at retail , media and on the internet . "
they called on the eu to block the merger or call on the sony and bmg to put " broad remedies " in place to curb possible abuses of market power .
up to the now , the eu has objected to the deal because the new company would control some 25 percent of the market and reduce the " big five " record companies to four , which would control 80 percent of the market .
however , sony and bmg has said a merger is necessary to sustain long-term viability in a turbulent market and that a partnership would allow them to invest more in artists and repertoire than they could on their own .
silver lining despite the criticism of bmg germany 's contract cancellations , some indies see a bright side .
michael haentjes of germany-based edel music said the less-popular artists suddenly finding themselves without a label could find a new home with the independents .
" artists that only sell midsize numbers will probably become available for companies like us , " haentjes said . " that could be an advantage for the independent sector and make the market more competitive .

despite blazing hot temperatures in the in the northern city of guimarães , the first match of group c failed to ignite on monday as denmark held favorite italy to a 0-0 draw . in a game punctuated by solid defense and neutralized scoring chances , the squad of italian coach giovanni trapattoni failed to live up to expectations that they would dominate the danish . instead of melting in a blistering 33 degree celsius -lrb- 91 fahrenheit -rrb- heat , the scandinavians came out fighting and showed from the opening minutes of play that they would not be intimidated . the danish held the ball longer than their opponents and thomas helveg and jon dahl tomasson kept attacking throughout the match . denmark even managed to set the pace for large stretches of the game and threatened italian goalkeeper gianluigi buffon on a number of occasions .
buffon could not avoid giving the danish a couple of corner kicks , but he never failed to make the important saves . bildunterschrift : " is that il catenaccio ? " at the other end of the pitch , danish keeper thomas sörensen blunted the attack of italy 's star-studded offense .
as italy tried to increase the pressure at the end of the first half , sörensen managed two quick saves after rapid shots by alessandro del piero and francesco totti . the italians put together a beautiful combination in the 53rd minute but gianluca zambrotta failed to get the goal as his shot rolled just past the post .
after another chance by del piero was pushed over the crossbar by sörensen , play on both sides started to slow . del piero was pulled out in the 64th minute for substitute antonio cassano as trapattoni tried to up italy 's attack , but to no avail . barring a similar result in the other group c matchup of sweden and bulgaria , the draw will force both teams to win their next matches to keep their hopes of advancing alive . lineups : denmark : thomas sörensen ; thomas helveg , martin laursen , rene henriksen , niclas jensen ; dennis rommedahl , danieljensen , christian poulsen , martin jörgensen ; jon dahl tomasson ; ebbe sand . italy : gianluigi buffon ; christian panucci , fabio cannavaro , alessandro nesta , gianluca zambrotta ; simone perrotta , cristiano zanetti ; mauro camoranesi , francesco totti , alessandro del piero ; christian vieri . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro 2004 : group by group www-links euro 2004 official web site information on fc porto 's dragão stadium 9799 dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

german chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats took a drubbing in elections for the european parliament , as well as regional elections in the eastern state of thuringia , raising doubts about the party 's future . sunday 's election results were just the latest in an almost unbroken 18-month run of defeats for the social democrats . exit polls in elections for the european parliament showed a dismal slump to just 21.5 percent for the spd , compared with 44.5 percent for the conservative opposition parties , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- . bildunterschrift : results for germany 's political parties in the european elections at 21:42 utc . the spd also suffered a landslide defeat in thuringia 's regional elections , sliding to 14.5 percent .
despite a slight dip in popularity , the cdu was able to maintain its absolute majority in the eastern german state . capping the spd 's defeat is the fact that the former east german communist party , the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- came in a strong second in thuringia , usurping the spd 's traditional role as the worker 's party .
in the parliamentary elections , the pds also improved its standing from the last european election in 1999 . social democrats concede ' surprise ' although the spd had expected to suffer some losses in the polls , the party 's main candidate for the eu parliament , martin schulz , conceded that he was " surprised " by how heavy the defeats were .
" i did n't think it would hit us so hard , " he told german public broadcaster phoenix .
schulz said that low turnout , particularly for the eu parliamentary elections , which were held on the opening weekend of the euro 2004 soccer championships , was partly to blame . " it 's a bitter result , " said klaus uwe benneter , the spd 's general secretary .
benneter also attributed the painful round of social cuts and economic reforms for the dismal result .
throughout europe , he said , parties have been punished for their reform policies .
" but it would be irresponsible for us to align our policies with election dates and polls . " most political analysts agree that schröder has no option but to carry on with his party 's reform agenda , although they acknowledge that staying the course could force the spd into a downward spiral , and usher in a new period of conservative rule in germany . conservative leaders were understandably gleeful about the outcome , with cdu leader angela merkel calling it a " disaster " for schröder 's government .
" this is a great day for the cdu and a good day for germany , " said cdu general secretary laurenz meyer .
he added that the spd had fallen to a " low point never seen before . " crunch time the spd is hoping to achieve a turnaround in voter sentiment in time for a crucial state election in its stronghold and the country 's industrial heartland - north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- .
the election there is slated for may , 2005 .
if the party loses this core state , the conservatives will have a two-thirds majority in the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , giving them the power to block all government legislation . before the nrw election , the spd faces three more state polls in september .
pressure is mounting from many party insiders to ease the pace of economic reforms in an effort to save the spd 's fading reputation as the people 's party .
there is also speculation about a possible cabinet reshuffle . however , party chief franz müntefering insisted there would be no change in policy and no reshuffle despite what he called a " bitter result . " " i 'm convinced we 're doing the right thing to combine lasting social justice with wealth , " müntefering said . strong gains by greens as the social democrats licked their wounds , their junior coalition partner in berlin , the greens , celebrated their best result yet in a european election . bildunterschrift : gains and losses by party in 2004 compared to the 1999 european election . green party chief reinhard bütikofer described his party as the day 's " true victor .

german chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats took a drubbing in elections for the european parliament , as well as regional elections in the eastern state of thuringia , raising doubts about the party 's future . sunday 's election results were just the latest in an almost unbroken 18-month run of defeats for the social democrats . exit polls in elections for the european parliament showed a dismal slump to just 21.5 percent for the spd , compared with 44.5 percent for the conservative opposition parties , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- . bildunterschrift : results for germany 's political parties in the european elections at 21:42 utc . the spd also suffered a landslide defeat in thuringia 's regional elections , sliding to 14.5 percent .
despite a slight dip in popularity , the cdu was able to maintain its absolute majority in the eastern german state . capping the spd 's defeat is the fact that the former east german communist party , the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- came in a strong second in thuringia , usurping the spd 's traditional role as the worker 's party .
in the parliamentary elections , the pds also improved its standing from the last european election in 1999 . social democrats concede ' surprise ' although the spd had expected to suffer some losses in the polls , the party 's main candidate for the eu parliament , martin schulz , conceded that he was " surprised " by how heavy the defeats were .
" i did n't think it would hit us so hard , " he told german public broadcaster phoenix .
schulz said that low turnout , particularly for the eu parliamentary elections , which were held on the opening weekend of the euro 2004 soccer championships , was partly to blame . " it 's a bitter result , " said klaus uwe benneter , the spd 's general secretary .
benneter also attributed the painful round of social cuts and economic reforms for the dismal result .
throughout europe , he said , parties have been punished for their reform policies .
" but it would be irresponsible for us to align our policies with election dates and polls . " most political analysts agree that schröder has no option but to carry on with his party 's reform agenda , although they acknowledge that staying the course could force the spd into a downward spiral , and usher in a new period of conservative rule in germany . conservative leaders were understandably gleeful about the outcome , with cdu leader angela merkel calling it a " disaster " for schröder 's government .
" this is a great day for the cdu and a good day for germany , " said cdu general secretary laurenz meyer .
he added that the spd had fallen to a " low point never seen before . " crunch time the spd is hoping to achieve a turnaround in voter sentiment in time for a crucial state election in its stronghold and the country 's industrial heartland - north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- .
the election there is slated for may , 2005 .
if the party loses this core state , the conservatives will have a two-thirds majority in the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , giving them the power to block all government legislation . before the nrw election , the spd faces three more state polls in september .

dw-world readers wrote in : ukip is no threat to the eu itself but to the uk 's membership in it .
most " brits " are not willing to be subsumed into an undemocratic superstate that does n't act in the national interest of member states but seeks to destroy nations and nationhood .
most ukip supporters are freedom-loving individuals with far more experience of mainland europe than the average brit .
we wish to trade with the eu , holiday there , buy property and invest there , but we do not wish to be ruled by others - simple .
we love you as equals but not as our masters . - michael mcgough it appears that ukip is taking a page from the u.s. republican party playbook and promoting the illusion that " going it alone " will somehow help the uk achieve an enhanced " muscular " independence from its euro partners .
but like the u.s. republican party , it will come to regret turning its back on its true friends and partners and come crawling back - when things get rough . - tom ukip is not necessarily right wing ; plenty of its support comes from the left .
although it will never gain power at westminster , it has already managed to get people talking about leaving the eu as a real possibility and thus has shattered 30 years of cozy consensus between the major parties on this issue .
the eu will in any case disintegrate under the weight of its own contradictions , corruption , bureaucracy , waste and fraud , but whether the uk can leave before this happens remains to be seen . - richard sigrist contrary to media reports , most ukip members and supporters are not racist , fascist or mad .
they just look at the arguments about sovereignty , economic advantage etc and draw a logical conclusion - we put in far more than we get back .
why not reverse the net disadvantage and get out ?
we would still trade with other european counties and would maintain cordial and constructive relations with all .
why is it seen as crazy behaviour - is the idea of self government such a frightening concept ? - george roberts send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : eu-skeptics gain momentum in britain elections for the european parliament started thursday as dutch and british voters headed to the polls .

sweden demolished bulgaria 5-0 in the second group c match on monday , as striker henrik larsson sealed his return to the national team with two goals in rapid succession . the match in the portuguese capital lisbon started with a spirited first half with scoring chances on both sides .
the bulgarians came fast and furious , repeatedly launching attacks .
martin petrov broke free to feed the ball to zoran jankovich and dimitar berbatov , but the swedish defense always managed to ward off the worst . sweden took the lead in the 32nd minute after freddie ljungberg tapped in a pass from zlatan ibrahimovic , who bolted away from bulgarian defenders attempting to leave him offside .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgaria had a chance to level when petrov got past mikael nilsson and chipped it to jankovich who had a clear shot on goal but he headed it past the far post . it was then that henrik larsson buried bulgaria 's hopes early in the second half after scoring two goals within two minutes .
first the striker put one past the keeper with a flying header in the 57th minute and 60 seconds later he returned to the penalty area to use his left foot to score again . it marked an amazing return for larsson , who had retired from international soccer after the 2002 world cup to spend more time with his son .
begged by his coach and politely asked by members of the swedish royal family to return , only after his six-year-old son gave his approval did he decide to don the national jersey again . after ljungberg was downed on the edge of the penalty area , ibrahimovic nailed the coffin shut by converting a penalty in the 76th minute and substitute marcus allbäck added insult to injury by sinking a distance shot after the match had crossed into injury time . the 5-0 win is the highest scoring victory for the swedes at a european championship . lineups : sweden : andreas isaksson ; teddy lucic , olof mellberg , andreas jakobsson , erik edman ; tobias linderoth , mikael nilsson , fredrik ljungberg , anders svensson ; zlatan ibrahimovic , henrik larsson . bulgaria : zdravko zdravkov ; vladimir ivanov , rossen kirilov , ivailo petkov , pedrag pajin ; stilian petrov , marian hristov , georgi peev , martin petrov ; zoran jankovich , dimitar berbatov . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : euro 2004 : group by group dw-world looks at how the groups match up .

" the damage inflicted by agent orange is much worse than anybody thought at the end of the war , " said professor nguyen trong nhan , the vice-president of the vietnam victims of agent orange association -lrb- vava -rrb- .
between 1962 and 1970 , millions of gallons of agent orange were sprayed across parts of vietnam .
professor nhan , the former president of the vietnamese red cross , denounced the action as " a massive violation of human rights of the civilian population , and a weapon of mass destruction " .
but since the end of the vietnam war , washington has denied any moral or legal responsibility for the toxic legacy said to have been caused by agent orange in vietnam .
the unresolved legacy and us denials of responsibility triggered three vietnamese to take unprecedented legal action in january 2004 .
the plaintiffs alleged war crimes against monsanto corporation , dow chemicals and eight other companies that manufactured agent orange and other defoliants used in vietnam .
the case has been brought by vava , which was set up to promote an international campaign to gain justice and compensation for agent orange victims .
preliminary hearings began in january at the us federal court in new york , presided over by senior judge jack weinstein .
birth defects agent orange was designed to defoliate the jungle and thus deny cover to vietcong guerrillas .
it contained one of the most virulent poisons known to man , a strain of dioxin called tccd .
first it killed the rainforest , stripping the jungle bare .
in time , the dioxin then spread its toxic reach to the food chain - which some say led to a proliferation of birth deformities .
in a small commune in the heavily sprayed cu chi district , the family of 21-year-old tran anh kiet struggles with the problems of daily living .
his feet , hands and limbs are twisted and deformed .
he writhes in evident frustration , and his attempts at speech are confined to plaintive and pitiful grunts .
kiet has to be spoon-fed .
he is an adult stuck inside the stunted body of a 15-year-old , with a mental age of around six .
he is what the local villagers refer to as an agent orange baby .
in vietnam , there are 150,000 other children like him , whose birth defects - according to vietnamese red cross records - can be readily traced back to their parents ' exposure to agent orange during the war , or the consumption of dioxin-contaminated food and water since 1975 .
vava estimates that three million vietnamese were exposed to the chemical during the war , and at least one million suffer serious health problems today .
professor nhan met bill clinton to press his claims some are war veterans , who were exposed to the chemical clouds .
many are farmers who lived off land that was sprayed .
others are a second and third generation , affected by their parents ' exposure .
some of these victims live in the vicinity of former us military bases such as bien hoa , where agent orange was stored in large quantities .
dr arnold schecter , a leading expert in dioxin contamination in the us , sampled the soil there in 2003 , and found it contained tccd levels that were 180 million times above the safe level set by the us environmental protection agency .
calls for us help professor nhan is sadly disappointed by the us response to calls to help vietnamese sufferers .
" vietnam ca n't solve the problem on its own .
hanoi helped the us military to track down remains of mias -lrb- us servicemen missing in action -rrb- , and we asked them to reciprocate with humanitarian aid for victims of agent orange , " he said .
around 10,000 us war veterans who were exposed to agent orange receive disability benefits for various types of cancer and other serious health problems that have been linked to dioxin .
" american victims of agent orange will get up to $ 1500 a month .
however most vietnamese families affected receive around 80,000 dong a month -lrb- just over $ 5 dollars -rrb- in government support for each disabled child , " professor nhan said .
according to vietnam 's red cross , 150,000 children have problems resulting from agent orange when former us president bill clinton visited hanoi four years ago , vietnamese president tran duc long made an appeal to the us " to acknowledge its responsibility to de-mine , detoxify former military bases and provide assistance to agent orange victims " .
but washington offered nothing beyond funding scientific conferences and further research .
chuck searcy , vice-president of the vietnam veterans memorial fund based in hanoi , said : " i am baffled that the us has not offered even a small gesture of cooperation and assistance to the vietnamese , beyond the endless talk about scientific research .
such a step would eliminate any talk of war crimes liability , or victim lawsuits . "
the vietnamese legal battle against formidable us corporate opponents is being heard in the same court as previous action by american war veterans .
it accuses the us companies of knowingly permitting agent orange to be sprayed for military purposes , in violation of the 1925 geneva protocol banning the use of chemical and biological agents .
but the legal teams representing monsanto and other us companies are hoping to stop the case going to trial .

the legislation is aimed at giving local groups a legal right to take over tracts of land where it is in the community 's interest .
they would have first refusal when the land goes up for sale .
in crofting areas , there will be a new right to force landlords to sell land , although it would have to be proved the move was beneficial to the community .
land reformers have welcomed the strengthening of the right-to-buy .
but landowners said they would be concerned if the new laws led to a distortion in the land market .
sustainable future from monday , groups of rural residents will be able to register an interest in taking over land when it comes on to the market .
this would give them first refusal if the land was put up for sale .
however , they would have to show that such a buyout would contribute towards the sustainable future of their community and was not merely a negative attempt to block new development .
earlier this year the scottish parliament 's justice committee agreed a move which increased the number of areas which will be covered by the legislation .
msps decided to change the definition of a community by increasing the population limit from 3,000 to 10,000 .

a survey , published on monday , revealed that 92 % of carers in scotland wanted their gp to highlight in their medical records that they were carers .
but only 32 % of carers have been asked by gps if they care for someone .
it is estimated that the uk 's six million carers - people who voluntarily look after a partner , friend or relative due to illness , disability or frailty - currently save the treasury £ 57bn every year .

for jack and nancy not a night goes by when they do not need to care for daniel .
they receive small respite when he attends a specialist centre during the day .
they also have a paid carer who comes in two to three hours a day .
their son needs total , constant care .
and the pressure of looking after daniel has left its mark .
the blaiks both have bad backs from lifting and nancy has arm spasms occasionally .
the burden of care is not just in their own home as jack also looks after his mother two hours a day .
heart condition so , it was of no surprise when jack was diagnosed with a heart condition in 1997 which doctors believe may have been stress related .
jack and nancy 's main frustrations are not being able to sleep .
they try to do normal things , such as going to church , but it takes so much effort .
respite care is given one night a week and occasionally they call in an extra paid carer , however , outside help is stressful for daniel .
despite the hard work , the stress and the constant feeling of tiredness , nancy and jack adore daniel .
and nancy even finds time working as a volunteer with children 's hospice movement chas and a charity called climb -lrb- children living with inherited metabolic diseases -rrb- .

from the moment he arrived at a slightly shabby leisure centre on the outskirts of northampton , the ukip 's best known candidate took centre stage .
before he had made it into the building , television crews pulled him to one side for pre-count interviews .
and so it continued all night - with kilroy-silk speaking the anti-europe mantra loud and clear .
the element of star quality he brought to an otherwise unremarkable election hall was unmistakeable .
even speaking to the cameras outside , in the somewhat unlikely setting of a diy superstore car park , he exuded a practised chatshow charm .
i think a very large proportion of the british electorate want their country back robert kilroy-silk kilroy-silk win crowns ukip night conservatively dressed in a dark blue suit and the purple and yellow rosette of his newly adopted party , his trademark silver hair barely quivered in the breeze .
a teenage girl passing with a pram paused to watch the show - perhaps her first brush with the process of european democracy .
as the night wore on , dragged out by delays in concluding the counts in the 44 wards making up the east midlands constituency , the man and his entourage maintained an air of easy confidence .
the former labour mp admitted he had expected it to be a night of success for the ukip - and a warning shot across the government 's bows .
election-winning patter he told bbc news online : " i think it 's a clear message that when tony blair talks about wanting to be at the heart of europe , the people here are saying very clearly ' tone , if you want to be at the heart of europe fine , you go - we do n't want to .
" i think a very large proportion of the british electorate want their country back and they do n't want to be governed by a remote , corrupt bureaucracy in brussels .
" we want good relations and good neighbours but we want to be in charge of our own destiny . "
the ex-chatshow host was supported by a large contingent for a man absent from politics for the best part of two decades , the old election-winning patter seems to have come back easily .
he said : " it does n't seem as if i 've been away from politics .
" i 've obviously attracted a lot of attention and that has been , i hope , good for the profile of the party .
" but it 's about the issue - not me .
people are voting for the issue . "
it was mr kilroy-silk 's claim that his was the only party never to have engaged in " personality politics " which provoked the loudest outburst of heckling from his rivals as he made his acceptance speech .
there 's huge ignorance and my guess is he 's capitalised on that lib dem mep bill dunn having overheard the odd politician mutter " primadonna " as the chatshow host passed , it became clear not everyone appreciated the " kilroy factor " in the run-up to the result .
green party candidate brian fewster said : " what we 've noticed with a certain degree of resentment has been the amount of coverage kilroy has got just by being kilroy . "
and liberal democrat mep bill dunn , who kept his seat , said the publicity surrounding the ukip campaign had simply fed the public 's fear of europe .
he said : " in my opinion - kilroy of course would n't agree at all - the public has no idea about how europe works and what it does .
no ambitions " there 's huge ignorance and my guess is he 's capitalised on that . "
in his acceptance speech , labour mep phillip whitehead warned his new colleague not to " play the demagogue " or work the " politics of paranoia " .
but as for mr kilroy-silk , he denied any hint of political ambition beyond his party 's aim to pull britain out of europe .
he insisted he knew nothing about the rumours suggesting he plans to depose party leader roger knapman - or stand in a by-election this year .
i would be quite happy to get back to my garden and reclaim my herbaceous border robert kilroy-silk he said he would go to brussels " when it 's necessary " to aid ukip 's campaign to win britain 's independence from europe .
" i 'm not getting elected to get bogged down in corridors there , " he said .
" this for me is a single issue .
it 's the biggest single issue there is - we can not have a bigger one than who governs us . "
and should the ukip succeed in its aim of withdrawal from europe , what next for the man who has earned a reputation as the comeback king ?
" i will have done my job , " answers mr kilroy-silk .
" i have lots of things to do .
i would be quite happy to get back to my garden and reclaim my herbaceous border . "
charlie dimmock , diarmuid gavin , be warned - you could be next to feel the kilroy factor .

" i 've obviously attracted a lot of attention and that has been , i hope , good for the profile of the party .
" but it 's about the issue - not me .
people are voting for the issue . "
it was mr kilroy-silk 's claim that his was the only party never to have engaged in " personality politics " which provoked the loudest outburst of heckling from his rivals as he made his acceptance speech .
there 's huge ignorance and my guess is he 's capitalised on that lib dem mep bill dunn having overheard the odd politician mutter " primadonna " as the chatshow host passed , it became clear not everyone appreciated the " kilroy factor " in the run-up to the result .
green party candidate brian fewster said : " what we 've noticed with a certain degree of resentment has been the amount of coverage kilroy has got just by being kilroy . "
and liberal democrat mep bill dunn , who kept his seat , said the publicity surrounding the ukip campaign had simply fed the public 's fear of europe .

no ambitions " there 's huge ignorance and my guess is he 's capitalised on that . "
in his acceptance speech , labour mep phillip whitehead warned his new colleague not to " play the demagogue " or work the " politics of paranoia " .
but as for mr kilroy-silk , he denied any hint of political ambition beyond his party 's aim to pull britain out of europe .
he insisted he knew nothing about the rumours suggesting he plans to depose party leader roger knapman - or stand in a by-election this year .
i would be quite happy to get back to my garden and reclaim my herbaceous border robert kilroy-silk he said he would go to brussels " when it 's necessary " to aid ukip 's campaign to win britain 's independence from europe .
" i 'm not getting elected to get bogged down in corridors there , " he said .
" this for me is a single issue .
it 's the biggest single issue there is - we can not have a bigger one than who governs us . "
and should the ukip succeed in its aim of withdrawal from europe , what next for the man who has earned a reputation as the comeback king ?

olympic cyclist nicole cooke will help launch a drive by the wales tourist board -lrb- wtb -rrb- and partner bodies to make the most of sport-related tourism .
the wtb believes wales has a competitive advantage and is launching plans to maximise the benefits .
wales has secured several major events like the fa cup , the wales rally gb , and british speedway grand prix .
in 2010 , one of the world 's biggest tournaments - golf 's ryder cup - will be staged at the celtic manor resort in newport .
these kind of events bring massive spin-off benefits in economic terms , bringing thousands of spectators , all ready to spend money .
cooke - bbc welsh sports personality of the year and a member of the british team in the 2004 olympics in greece - said continuing to raise the profile of wales was vitally important .
the 21-year-old athlete - from wick in the vale of glamorgan - said : " wales has a wealth of natural assets , top-class sporting events and a successful record in hosting major events - which play a very important part in raising the profile of the host nation . "
" it 's important that we spread the word about what wales has to offer as a sports destination . "
wales tourist board chairman , philip evans said the aim was to put wales on the world map .
" our vision is for wales to be recognised internationally as an icon location offering diverse and exciting opportunities for visitors , based on the quality and variety of our natural environment , facilities and distinct culture , " he said .
" the economic significance of international and national events , increased awareness of health and well-being , have increased interest in this sector over the last decade .
" overall , 89 % of holiday trips by uk residents to wales involve some form of activity and we know that the holiday ' experience ' is now the most important factor in selecting a destination .
this strategy is now placing wales far ahead of its competition . "
phil carling , chairman of the sports council for wales , said partnership was the key to securing wales ' place on the sporting map . "
" we look forward to working in partnership with wtb to help maximise the social and economic benefits of sport-related tourism , " he said .
" it is clear that the new role that sport is being asked to play in advancing the well-being of the nation is not confined to health promotion . "

the final declaration saw the expected result - labour with two seats , and conservatives and plaid cymru one each .
but ukip , which wants britain to pull out of the european union , pushed the pro-eu liberal democrats into fifth place .
the party says it will now use this platform to try to make more gains in wales in the general election .
until this election wales had five meps , but the number has been cut to four after 10 new states joined the eu last month .
when thursday 's votes were counted on sunday , labour finished first , with nearly 300,000 votes , or 32 % of the vote .
but the conservatives overtook plaid cymru in comparison with the last european election in 1999 , and ukip more than trebled its share to take about 10 % .
wales in europe 2004 labour : 297,810 votes -lrb- 32.4 % -rrb- : 2 meps conservative : 177,771 -lrb- 19.3 % -rrb- : 1 mep plaid cymru : 159,888 -lrb- 17.4 % -rrb- : 1 mep ukip : 96,677 -lrb- 10.5 % -rrb- lib dem : 96,116 -lrb- 10.4 % -rrb- green : 32,761 -lrb- 3.5 % -rrb- bnp : 27,135 -lrb- 2.9 % -rrb- forward wales : 17,280 -lrb- 2.8 % -rrb- christian democrats : 6,821 -lrb- 0.7 % -rrb- respect : 5,427 -lrb- 0.5 % -rrb- when the results for the whole of wales were declared in haverfordwest , ukip was next , just over 500 votes ahead of the pro-eu lib dems .
they were followed by the greens , british national party , forwards wales , christian democratic party and respect - the unity coalition .
the meps returning to brussels and strasbourg are labour 's glenys kinnock and eluned morgan , conservative jonathan evans and plaid cymru 's jill evans .
david rowlands , head of ukip in wales , said the party had gained votes in europe from a section of the electorate who would not have otherwise voted .
ukip 's david rowlands said the result gave the party a strong platform and , he claimed , if wales still had a fifth mep - as before european enlargement - ukip would have taken the final seat .
" if we can get our message across to the other 50 % who did not vote , we will have a much larger vote in future , " said mr rowlands .
john williams , the lib dems ' lead candidate , accepted he was disappointed with his party in fifth place .
he accused the media of pursuing an anti-eu agenda which helped ukip make gains at the expense of his party .
europe 's an excellent thing for wales - a lot of our jobs depend on it eluned morgan mep plaid cymru 's re-elected mep jill evans said her party 's vote had held up well in its strongest areas , and denied the party had stabilised after its surge five years ago .
" 1999 was an exceptional year , " she said . "
i think the local election results and the european election results show that we are party that is making gains all the time " .
' ' excelllent thing ' the turnout in wales was its second highest ever at 42 % .turnout had slumped to 28 % five years ago , and it was clearly helped by holding the poll on the same day as the council elections .
despite coming first in wales in the euro elections , labour admitted they had lessons to learn .
mep eluned morgan said : " it 's -lrb- europe 's -rrb- an excellent thing for wales - a lot of our jobs depend on it . "
" the fact that we have 50,000 jobs from european objective one funding means it touches the lives of our people . "
how wales voted in 1999 labour : 199,690 votes -lrb- 31.9 % -rrb- : 2 meps plaid cymru : 185,235 -lrb- 29.6 % -rrb- : 2 meps conservative : 142,631 -lrb- 22.8 % -rrb- : 1 mep lib dem : 51,283 -lrb- 8.2 % -rrb- ukip : 19,702 -lrb- 3.1 % -rrb- green : 16,146 -lrb- 2.6 % -rrb- others : 11,738 -lrb- 1.9 % -rrb- conservative jonathan evans pointed to the tories ' second place and said : " that for my party is the first step towards re-establishing ourselves in wales .

the final declaration saw the expected result - labour with two seats , and conservatives and plaid cymru one each .
but ukip , which wants britain to pull out of the european union , pushed the pro-eu liberal democrats into fifth place .
the party says it will now use this platform to try to make more gains in wales in the general election .
until this election wales had five meps , but the number has been cut to four after 10 new states joined the eu last month .
when thursday 's votes were counted on sunday , labour finished first , with nearly 300,000 votes , or 32 % of the vote .
but the conservatives overtook plaid cymru in comparison with the last european election in 1999 , and ukip more than trebled its share to take about 10 % .
wales in europe 2004 labour : 297,810 votes -lrb- 32.4 % -rrb- : 2 meps conservative : 177,771 -lrb- 19.3 % -rrb- : 1 mep plaid cymru : 159,888 -lrb- 17.4 % -rrb- : 1 mep ukip : 96,677 -lrb- 10.5 % -rrb- lib dem : 96,116 -lrb- 10.4 % -rrb- green : 32,761 -lrb- 3.5 % -rrb- bnp : 27,135 -lrb- 2.9 % -rrb- forward wales : 17,280 -lrb- 2.8 % -rrb- christian democrats : 6,821 -lrb- 0.7 % -rrb- respect : 5,427 -lrb- 0.5 % -rrb- when the results for the whole of wales were declared in haverfordwest , ukip was next , just over 500 votes ahead of the pro-eu lib dems .
they were followed by the greens , british national party , forwards wales , christian democratic party and respect - the unity coalition .
the meps returning to brussels and strasbourg are labour 's glenys kinnock and eluned morgan , conservative jonathan evans and plaid cymru 's jill evans .
david rowlands , head of ukip in wales , said the party had gained votes in europe from a section of the electorate who would not have otherwise voted .
ukip 's david rowlands said the result gave the party a strong platform and , he claimed , if wales still had a fifth mep - as before european enlargement - ukip would have taken the final seat .
" if we can get our message across to the other 50 % who did not vote , we will have a much larger vote in future , " said mr rowlands .
john williams , the lib dems ' lead candidate , accepted he was disappointed with his party in fifth place .
he accused the media of pursuing an anti-eu agenda which helped ukip make gains at the expense of his party .
europe 's an excellent thing for wales - a lot of our jobs depend on it eluned morgan mep plaid cymru 's re-elected mep jill evans said her party 's vote had held up well in its strongest areas , and denied the party had stabilised after its surge five years ago .
" 1999 was an exceptional year , " she said . "
i think the local election results and the european election results show that we are party that is making gains all the time " .
' ' excelllent thing ' the turnout in wales was its second highest ever at 42 % .turnout had slumped to 28 % five years ago , and it was clearly helped by holding the poll on the same day as the council elections .
despite coming first in wales in the euro elections , labour admitted they had lessons to learn .
mep eluned morgan said : " it 's -lrb- europe 's -rrb- an excellent thing for wales - a lot of our jobs depend on it . "

the offer came just days after democracy advocates in the territory also suggested they wanted to resolve differences with the mainland .
tensions have been rising over recent months , with beijing ruling out reforms proposed by hong kong activists .
but both sides are showing signs of compromise in the run-up to an expected pro-democracy demonstration on 1 july .
according to the official xinhua news agency , a beijing official said improving communication between people of different views would be good for hong kong .
" to enhance communications and have sober-minded talks ... will benefit hong kong 's social harmony and stability , " the official was quoted as saying .
the official said his proposal was a response to recent suggestions of " reconciliation " put forward by some of hong kong 's pro-democracy leaders .
last week veteran pro-democracy legislator lau chin-shek appealed for a less combative stance against beijing , while yeung sum , the head of the democratic party , also called for an easing of tensions .

humberside and cleveland police had the most " poor " ratings , the data showed .
lincolnshire and north yorkshire performances were also below average .
but , said inspector of constabulary sir keith povey , no record was so bad that any chief constable needed sacking .
humberside has already been criticised for its role in the soham murder hunt .
it was given a poor rating in six areas , fair in nine , good in two and excellent in just one .
' remarkable achievement ' but the home office report has been slammed as " out of date " by west yorkshire chief constable colin cramphorn .
defending his officers , mr cramphorn said police performance in the county was the most improved in the uk , " outperforming " other areas .
deputy chief constable phil brear said officers had moved " further , or faster " than other police in their improvements .
he pointed to the force 's successful crime reduction initiatives which has recently seen a 27 % drop in robbery victims and 23 % fewer victims of burglary .
" this is a remarkable achievement considering the fact that west yorkshire has fewer officers per 1,000 head of population than the other metropolitan forces , " he said .

members of cardiff council 's labour group met last night to choose a new leader - llandaff councillor greg owens - after they failed to hold on to control of the authority .
politicians across wales have been involved in key talks after the local elections left nine councils with no party in overall control .
they were bridgend , cardiff , ceredigion , carmarthenshire , conwy , swansea , vale of glamorgan , wrexham and denbighshire .
elsewhere , labour lost swansea and bridgend , but won back caerphilly and rhondda cynon taf from plaid cymru .
the conservatives took monmouthshire council while the liberal democrats were the biggest winners in terms of new seats - gaining 48 in all .
labour councillors held a crisis meeting in cardiff on friday night after mr goodway held onto his ely seat by just 62 votes .
the party suffered widescale defeats at the hands of the liberal democrats .
councillor gains and losses labour : - 57 lib dems : + 48 plaid cymru : - 12 conservatives : + 35 independents : + 16 people before politics : + 9 forward wales : + 1 in a statement on saturday , mr goodway likened his situation to that of john major following the outcome of the 1997 general election , borrowing the phrase : " when the curtain falls , it 's time to move off the stage " .
mr goodway served on labour 's front bench for 16 years - the past 12 as council leader .
" during that time cardiff council has been responsible for the transformation of the city into one of europe 's most exciting capitals , providing jobs and opportunities for local people and a level of prosperity not seen for 100 years , " mr goodway said .
" i have enjoyed every single minute , " he added .
new leader mr owens said he was pleased to be taking over , but added : " these are challenging times for us - we have lost seats and valued colleagues , but we are by far the biggest opposition group and the liberal democrats have not got an overall majority .
we shall re-focus and we aim to provide incisive , effective opposition .
the political landscape in local government might have changed considerably but first minister rhodri morgan was not having the blame for labour 's poor showing laid at his door mr goodway held on to his seat with just 62 votes senior party figures said the first minister 's absence from d-day commemorations last weekend was a factor .
describing the results as " patchy and weird " , mr morgan said he would be the " first to put his hand up " if it was shown labour did worse in wales than england .
but he did not believe that was the case .
labour lost 13 councillors in swansea , where the council had faced a barrage of criticism over the closure of the city 's leisure centre .
in wrexham the forward wales party founded by former labour am and mp john marek won its first seat , but failed to make a bigger breakthrough , although labour lost control .

despite labour 's problems in cardiff and swansea , its landslide performance in rct may have been one of its best throughout the uk .
welsh secretary peter hain said labour had " taken a hit " , and accepted that mr morgan 's d-day absence was an issue .
but mr hain also blamed other factors - among them iraq and council taxes .
with figures in from 17 of the 22 councils , turnout was 45 % - higher than expected with thursday 's fine weather thought to have played a part .
in ceredigion , plaid gained three seats , and the result will mean weekend negotiations about possible coalitions to take control of the council .
the independent group and the liberal democrats had run ceredigion , and the new result follows a turbulent few months which saw campaigners lose their battle for a directly-elected mayor in the county .

members of cardiff council 's labour group met last night to choose a new leader - llandaff councillor greg owens - after they failed to hold on to control of the authority .
politicians across wales have been involved in key talks after the local elections left nine councils with no party in overall control .
they were bridgend , cardiff , ceredigion , carmarthenshire , conwy , swansea , vale of glamorgan , wrexham and denbighshire .
elsewhere , labour lost swansea and bridgend , but won back caerphilly and rhondda cynon taf from plaid cymru .
the conservatives took monmouthshire council while the liberal democrats were the biggest winners in terms of new seats - gaining 48 in all .
labour councillors held a crisis meeting in cardiff on friday night after mr goodway held onto his ely seat by just 62 votes .
the party suffered widescale defeats at the hands of the liberal democrats .
councillor gains and losses labour : - 57 lib dems : + 48 plaid cymru : - 12 conservatives : + 35 independents : + 16 people before politics : + 9 forward wales : + 1 in a statement on saturday , mr goodway likened his situation to that of john major following the outcome of the 1997 general election , borrowing the phrase : " when the curtain falls , it 's time to move off the stage " .
mr goodway served on labour 's front bench for 16 years - the past 12 as council leader .
" during that time cardiff council has been responsible for the transformation of the city into one of europe 's most exciting capitals , providing jobs and opportunities for local people and a level of prosperity not seen for 100 years , " mr goodway said .
" i have enjoyed every single minute , " he added .
new leader mr owens said he was pleased to be taking over , but added : " these are challenging times for us - we have lost seats and valued colleagues , but we are by far the biggest opposition group and the liberal democrats have not got an overall majority .
we shall re-focus and we aim to provide incisive , effective opposition .
the political landscape in local government might have changed considerably but first minister rhodri morgan was not having the blame for labour 's poor showing laid at his door mr goodway held on to his seat with just 62 votes senior party figures said the first minister 's absence from d-day commemorations last weekend was a factor .
describing the results as " patchy and weird " , mr morgan said he would be the " first to put his hand up " if it was shown labour did worse in wales than england .
but he did not believe that was the case .
labour lost 13 councillors in swansea , where the council had faced a barrage of criticism over the closure of the city 's leisure centre .

mr wen said moves to curb bank lending were starting to prove successful in checking inflation and other " unhealthy factors " in china 's booming economy .
however , data showed foreign direct investment - a major contributor to inflation - is continuing to pour in .
fdi rose 11.3 % in the first five months of 2004 against a year ago .
the level of fdi during the first five months totalled $ 25.9bn -lrb- £ 14.2bn -rrb- , figures from the ministry of commerce showed .
early signs of progress but since beijing began its crack-down on reckless spending by local governments on new factories and office blocks , the pace of growth in fixed asset investment has slowed down .
foreign investment is rising it grew by 18.3 % in may to 439bn yuan -lrb- $ 59.5bn ; £ 29.2bn -rrb- , compared to 34.7 % in april , the national bureau of statistics said .
mr wen said " macroeconomic control remains an extremely arduous task " , the people 's daily newspaper reported on monday .
local officials must " understand and implement the central authorities ' decisions . in a comprehensive , correct and positive manner " , he said .
he was speaking during a tour of the central chinese province of hubei last week to explain the policy to local officials .
' correct policy ' mr wen said the central government 's macroeconomic control policies were proving " timely , correct and effective " .
too-rapid growth in investment had been curbed and increases in money supply and credit had slowed , which was beginning to lower production prices , he said .
but some economists remain wary , pointing out that it is too soon to judge the impact of a policy drive which had only begun in earnest during april .
" there is no conclusive evidence that a landing has been initiated or that the touchdown will be soft , " wrote carl weinberg of high frequency economics in a note commenting on the chinese leader 's speech .
rapid growth is inflating prices for raw materials he noted that the chinese authorities have failed to release figures for the growth in international currency reserves for april and may .
although vital to china 's growth , foreign investment pouring into china 's manufacturing sector has also helped to fuel inflation in factory gate prices for industrial raw materials such as cement , steel , and aluminium .
the authorities have tried to crack-down on unnecessary new projects by domestic firms and those with bad debts .
china 's rapid growth has led to other problems too , with surging demand for energy causing black outs .
shanghai 's mayor on monday assured big foreign investors in the city that they would be " priority targets " to receive electricity .
contracted fdi , which monitors pledges to investment which have not yet been implemented and acts as a barometer of future trends , leapt nearly 50 % in the first five months of 2004 .
