program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : turkey 's eu moment of truth verheugen : no more obstacles to talks with turkey capturing turkish culture 's changing face waiting for eu erdogan : " we have done our homework " europe -pipe- 18.09.2004 " a change in mentality is needed " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister erdogan says turkey is doing its best to meet entry criteria the eu commission is to publish a key report on october 6 on whether ankara is ready to open talks on joining the eu .
in an interview with deutsche welle , turkish pm tayyip erdogan said the country was on track . dw : on october 6th the european union commission is due to announce when and if membership talks with your country can take place .
what do you think brussels will decide ? recep tayyip erdogan : we are doing everything we can to influence this process in a positive way and to fulfill the criteria issued in copenhagen for accession talks .
at this point there are no problems with legislation on reforms .
when i asked mr. verheugen -lrb- eu enlargement commissioner -rrb- during his last visit here what we had to do to complete this legislation , he answered that turkey had already done everything , but that there were still problems with implementation .
we know that too , because implementation requires a change in mentality .
that 's part of a process and we are making every effort to push this process forward as fast as possible . while the eu commissioner was here , he was presented with reports from human rights organizations that say systematic torture continues in turkey .
is that charge baseless or unfair ? these allegations are completely unjustified .
they are totally groundless charges .
our ministry launched an immediate investigation .
and we have also been conducting inquiries into who initiated these accusations .
unfortunately , it is charges of this nature which are hindering turkey 's attempts to integrate into europe .
and i have the impression that 's something verheugen is all too aware of .
we have a zero-tolerance policy on the issue of torture .
systematic torture is unthinkable in a democratic system . up until now it 's been viewed as an open secret in brussels that on october 6th the eu commission would say yes to opening membership talks .
now a dispute has unfolded concerning proposed reforms to the turkish penal code which have since been put on hold .
where do things stand now ?
will the penal code be reformed , and when will the reforms become law ? turkey 's new criminal law is not part of the copenhagen criteria .
just as the draft legislation for reforms to the regional courts of appeal , or the new code for criminal procedure or the penal code , are not part of the copenhagen criteria .
these are steps we are taking as preparatory measures for moving towards the european union .
and it should not be forgotten that at this point there is only a common european constitution , but the eu has no common code of criminal law .
we are undertaking this reform of criminal law on our own initiative .
and i 'm convinced that 's something our european friends will appreciate . even so , the section which would make adultery a criminal offence is especially controversial .
is that something that is essential for you , or could you take that section out of the reform package if brussels were to insist on it ? this new law comprises a total of 346 paragraphs - and as such it is not necessarily so easy to appraise from a distance .
it would be unwise to restrict the discussion to the issue of adultery .
for us in the justice and development party , traditions are very important .
we stand for conservative values .
these principles are written in our party political program and are part of my government 's stated policy goals .
that is the aim of this article of law .
it 's intended to protect and strengthen the family .
the family is the most dynamic factor in turkish society .
moreover , this article of law was on the statutes between 1926 and 1996 at which time it was directed against women .
however , the new law foresees that if anyone brings a charge on grounds of infidelity and it comes to a court judgment , men and women shall be treated equally and the punishment shall be appropriate . is brussels exerting too much pressure ? no-one has raised that issue with me .
when mr. verheugen was here , i put the following question to him : does turkey need to do more ?
he answered ' no ' , but he did say that there were clear failings in the implementation of the reforms .
we 're aware of that too .
and we also discussed the issue of adultery .
mr verheugen said that this issue had nothing to do with the commission 's progress report .
he did , however , say that the topic of adultery could influence the decisions on when to begin talks .
i think we should now end this debate .
there are 25 eu members , not all of which fulfill the copenhagen criteria .
nonetheless , they are members of the european union . german conservative opposition leader angela merkel has written a letter to political leaders across europe in which she lobbied against full membership for turkey and instead pushed for a ' privileged partnership ' for your country .
you and your akp party are also members of the conservative camp - are you disappointed in miss merkel ? i find it hard to understand miss merkel .
and she is calling for understanding in our discussions . a privileged partnership is unthinkable in the eu . any nation that fulfills the copenhagen criteria can start membership talks . but we are not yet talking about full membership here , rather commencing negotiations on terms of entry . therefore we need a fair decision to set the process of negotiations in motion . if this process does not get underway , we will draw our own conclusions from this and take the necessary steps . i would like to stress that we are pushing for the fulfillment of the copenhagen criteria in the interests of our own people . but if there were really to be a negative decision , which i do n't believe there will be , then we will call this the ankara criteria and continue on our own path . the interview was conducted by alexander kudascheff send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu wants turkey to explain withdrawal of bill european union enlargement commissioner guenter verheugen on saturday called on turkey to clarify its decision to withdraw a key bill reforming its penal code , during talks with turkey 's eu ambassador .

france and belgium have raised doubts over the project 's funding and its relationship to the wider us mission in the country . disagreement overshadowed a nato defense ministers meeting in the dutch seaside resort of noordwijk on friday aimed at discussing launching a training academy for senior iraqi military officers in iraq . the crucial deal on the training mission has the potential of settling almost two years of tension between the united states and some of its european partners over nato 's role in iraq .
the organization had already agreed to launch the training mission back in june . the major stumbling block had been opposition from paris , which had previously objected to operations inside iraq under a nato flag .
diplomats say france , which refuses to send any forces into iraq itself , has no problems with the technical aspects of the mission but wants to know what the added value of it would be . french defense minister michele alliot-marie said the foreign ministry in paris was still considering its options .
" we in france continue to believe that this training should be done outside iraq , " alliot-marie told reporters .
" iraq has to find its own sense of identity and i do n't think the addition of more foreigners in uniform will help that . "
if they were going in , she said the mission should remain " as low-profile as possible . " under a deal worked out among nato 's 26 member nations , it ’ s been suggested that the mission would report to the us officer in command of training operations in iraq .
a french diplomat said france wanted more assurances , however , that the officer would be answerable to the alliance .
in other words , there are fears that the alliance will end up being subordinate to the us-led coalition .
nato already has some 40 soldiers in iraq who began training army officers in collaboration with the defense ministry in baghdad .
the issue of the command structure led to a stormy debate in july . de hoop scheffer hopeful of deal nato general secretary jaap de hoop scheffer admitted friday that member states could n't see eye to eye on the issue .
" as it stands now , all 26 allies are n't completely satisfied , " de hoop scheffer said on the sidelines of the meeting . at the same time de hoop scheffer played down the differences and said he was optimistic that a compromise could be reached soon .
he insisted the differences were not " substantial " and included details of the training mission 's relationship with the much wider us mission to rebuild a new 260,000-strong iraqi army , and the question of protection for the alliance instructors . the north atlantic council , nato 's top decision-making body , will meet monday to re-examine the proposals .
british defense secretary geoff hoon was of the opinion that an agreement on the iraq issue was virtually in the bag .
and other officials insisted that the alliance “ is nearing agreement ” . doubts over funding but french reservations over the question of nato 's allegiance in iraq is n't the only issue causing argument among nato 's ranks . officials say that belgium balked at agreement because of problems it has with the project ’ s funding structure .
a belgian foreign ministry spokesman said they wanted to know who ’ s paying for what .
the operation is likely to be paid for from a mix of common nato funding and national financing . as plans stand now , around 300 nato instructors are to be sent to iraq to set up a training center for iraqi officers outside baghdad .
germany , france , belgium and now also spain have agreed that they will not send soldiers to iraq , but rather support the training of iraqi military and officials outside the country . although several of the nato allies have individually sent troops to join the us-led coalition , objections from france and germany had previously prevented the alliance taking a collective role in iraq , apart from offering logistical support to a polish-led multinational force of 6,000 troops operating in the center of the country . however , france , germany and the other allies agreed in june at a nato summit in istanbul to the creation of an alliance training mission for iraq . driving instructors and vehicle maintenance units german defense minister peter struck told reporters friday that the german army would train iraqis in the united arab emirates -lrb- uae -rrb- as driving instructors and also teach them how to carry out vehicle maintenance .
germany would also provide the vehicles needed for the purpose .
further training on mine-clearance would likely be carried out in germany , he said . germany had previously limited its training to iraqi police units .
struck told reporters german officials had drawn up the training plan after talks with iraqi counterparts in the uae . " for germany , this still means that there will be no single german soldier on the ground in iraq , " struck stressed . ben fajzullin -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de training role for nato troops in baghdad after meeting for the sixth time in three days , nato members finally agreed to send a small contingent of troops to iraq to train the country 's armed forces and help rebuild its military infrastructure .
-lrb- august 1 , 2004 -rrb- germany to help train iraqi military germany will help train the iraqi military - but not on iraqi soil .
the announcement comes just days before a nato summit , leading some to wonder what role the alliance will play in the region .

but where was germany , a country famed throughout the world for doing things by the book ? german procedures take twice as long it takes a businessman in finland three simple procedures and two weeks to turn his idea into a company .
german competitors , however , have to spend 45 days wading through nine procedures , twice as long as the world average .
that kind of bureaucratic hassle meant germany was n't among the top twenty . gabi beermeister , a young woman who runs a small kiosk in berlin , told dw-world german bureaucracy was getting worse .

although germany ranked only slightly better than mediocre in the " doing business in 2005 " report , germany ’ s minister of commerce wolfgang clement told the handelsblatt newspaper that the report didn ’ t do germany justice .
he pointed out 2003 reforms , like the " hours of trading act " , which simplified trade guild rules and improved workplace regulations . meanwhile , the german ministry of justice has been searching the german law books for unnecessary regulations in a bid to streamline procedures .

he believes that the easier it is to start a new company , the higher the chances of reducing unemployment and spurring the economy . " we find that 25 percent of the countries that have the most complicated and bureaucratic regulations tend to grow roughly 2 percent less per year than the countries that have easy and well-structured regulations , " klein said . this knowledge has certainly prompted many european nations , not just germany , to tackle reform .
" most of the reform-stimulus has come from the eu , " said klein .

now it 's the nation 's highest court that tops the list . german interior minister otto schily on friday blamed a 2003 ruling by the federal constitutional court for contributing to the popularity of radical right-wing parties . its decision not to ban the parties ultimately led to their ascent , he told the financial times deutschland .
that a party using " clear anti-foreigner and anti-semitic propaganda " could receive enough votes to enter the state legislature is a result of the high court 's problematic decision , schily said . it poses a threat to germany 's political and legal structure and damages the country 's image as a destination for international investment , schily -lrb- photo -rrb- , a member of the social democrats , added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily officials in saxony expect the german national party -lrb- npd -rrb- to re-enter parliament and possibly increase their share of the vote in elections on sunday .
polls show the far-right german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- getting between 5 percent and 6 percent of the vote next door in the state of brandenburg .
politician spar over guilt the minister 's comments were " premature and panicked " former constitutional court justice berthold sommer told the tagespiegel newspaper .
other spd members also said it was wrong to hold the court responsible for german extremists .
" it 's not the judges that vote for the npd , " said dieter wiefelspütz , the spd 's spokesman for domestic affairs .
" it 's adult people . "
radical parties are seen to be taking advantage of chancellor gerhard schröder 's labor reforms to lure voters away from mainstream parties , christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- leader angela merkel said last week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : campaign posters appeal to voters upset with the government 's reforms green party head reinhard bütikofer said anyone looking for the reason why voters are losing interest in mainstream parties should look farther to the left at the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- .
typically strongest in eastern germany , the pds , which was the communist party of former east germany , has seen great improvements because hardly anyone could tell the difference between their campaign slogans and those of the npd and dvu , bütikofer said .
radicals stop hurting each other another reason for the far-right parties ' success is their agreement to stop poaching each other 's supporters .
since a political party needs at least 5 percent of the vote to be awarded seats in parliament , infighting kept all of them from clearing the barrier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : radical parties no longer fight each other for votes this sunday the npd will be on the ballot in saxony , where it 's typically stronger , leaving the dvu to get all the right-wing votes in brandenburg .
how to fight the far-right " go vote ! " was the message politicians from all parties carried through saxony and brandenburg during the past weeks .
the parties that dominate germany 's political middle , and even the protestant church , hope high voter turnout will minimize the percent of votes that go to radical parties , keeping them out of parliament .
" in difficult years we need a stable government , " said matthias platzeck -lrb- spd -rrb- , brandenburg 's incumbent premier .
" to get a stable government we need high voter turnout , because that 's the only guarantor that the extreme right wo n't be able to shape the state .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.09.2004 schröder says germans abuse state system großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under fire again over controversial reform comments amid continuing protests over benefit cuts , chancellor schröder has sharply criticized his countrymen who he says take more than their fair share of state allowances .
the comments have raised the ire of social groups . german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s interview in the guter rat consumer magazine on friday echoes statements he ’ s made throughout the summer as he tries to hammer through controversial reforms to the country ’ s cumbersome social welfare state . " in both the east and the west , there 's a mentality which extends well into the middle class that you should claim state allowances wherever you can get them , even when there 's an adequate income in the family , " schröder told the magazine .
“ no welfare state can reasonably expect to manage such a burden , ” he added . the chancellor underlined that the public at large realizes that the social system has to change , but that it has balked when confronted with concrete changes that impact them directly , and called for citizens to accept what he said was the inevitable . chancellor far removed from reality ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of protestors march against reforms in leipzig his comments follow weeks of protests , particularly in former communist eastern germany , over tough welfare cuts that will introduce stringent means testing on those claiming unemployment benefits and will make people with a certain level of savings ineligible for welfare . popular anger has arisen in the country with as many as 80,000 people taking to the streets across the country in weekly protests every monday . schröder has been greeted by eggs and heckles as much as by cheers since announcing the reforms . predictably , the chancellor 's comments on friday triggered a heated discussion and drove another wedge between schröder and social support groups who have largely denounced the reforms as being " socially unfair " and " forcing people into poverty . " ulrich schneider , head of the paritätisch wohlfahrtsverband , a leading german social welfare support group , told berlin daily tagesspiegel that schröder 's comments " indicate how far the chancellor is removed from the reality of these people , ” who he says have to count every euro and pinch every penny .
thomas broch , who heads german caritas , also lashed out at the chancellor . “ schröder belittles the people who are already on the losing side of society , ” he said . schröder : " bitter reproaches from our children " government spokesman bela anda acted quickly to point out that schröder was only referring to those who don ’ t need government support , but get it anyway .
he stressed that applied as much to higher upper income groups who claim more than their share from government as it does to middle-income and lower-income people . the negative reactions seem to have caught the government and supporters of reform off-guard , especially since the chancellor had made similar comments throughout his fight to trim the welfare state and loosen labor laws . several influential social democratic politicians have come to the chancellor ’ s defense .
rainer wend , chairman of the bundestag ’ s committee for economics and labor , said the chancellor ’ s remarks were “ dead on ” and derided the outcry as " good old fashioned feigned fury " , noting that the critique applies just as well to wealthy citizens who exploit tax loopholes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- chairwoman angela merkel support for the chancellor has also poured in from the opposition camp .
“ there is certainly a tendency that some people have found they can live fairly well by relying on the social system and doing a bit of undocumented work on the side , ” angela merkel , head of the conservative christian democratic union party told a television station .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 18.09.2004 cutting through the red tape großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paperwork and red tape hinders economic growth , says the report the world bank 's " doing business in 2005 " report on business practices and bureaucracy shows many countries , germany included , are stifling growth and enterprise by wrapping simple procedures in masses of red tape . the world bank 's report , “ doing business in 2005 : removing obstacles to growth , ” looked at the levels of bureaucracy businesses face in 145 countries .
the report showed which countries have the least red-tape and where it 's easiest to become an entrepreneur . this is the second year the world bank has issued rankings on business environment indicators : more than 3,000 local experts investigated practices in 145 nations , asking whether it was easy or difficult to start a small or medium-size business and whether administrations made it hard to hire and fire . among the other things compared were hiring and firing practices , how easy it was to register property , the ease of contract enforcement , and - for the first time in 2003 - the property registration process and to what extent investors were protected . of the industrial countries , new zealand , australia and norway came out on top .
but where was germany , a country famed throughout the world for doing things by the book ? german procedures take twice as long it takes a businessman in finland three simple procedures and two weeks to turn his idea into a company .
german competitors , however , have to spend 45 days wading through nine procedures , twice as long as the world average .
that kind of bureaucratic hassle meant germany was n't among the top twenty . gabi beermeister , a young woman who runs a small kiosk in berlin , told dw-world german bureaucracy was getting worse . " selling bread rolls , cigarettes and sweets required a special catering permit , so i applied to the health authorities , " she said .
" but they asked for so many things - architect drawings of the business premises , a permit from the building authorities , letters of approval from banks … i simply gave up . " german government claims successes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement .
although germany ranked only slightly better than mediocre in the " doing business in 2005 " report , germany ’ s minister of commerce wolfgang clement told the handelsblatt newspaper that the report didn ’ t do germany justice .
he pointed out 2003 reforms , like the " hours of trading act " , which simplified trade guild rules and improved workplace regulations . meanwhile , the german ministry of justice has been searching the german law books for unnecessary regulations in a bid to streamline procedures .
two hundred laws and by-laws need to be abolished , found the ministry . bureaucratic countries pay a high price an easy business climate has many benefits , michael klein told dw-world .

the comments have raised the ire of social groups . german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s interview in the guter rat consumer magazine on friday echoes statements he ’ s made throughout the summer as he tries to hammer through controversial reforms to the country ’ s cumbersome social welfare state . " in both the east and the west , there 's a mentality which extends well into the middle class that you should claim state allowances wherever you can get them , even when there 's an adequate income in the family , " schröder told the magazine .
“ no welfare state can reasonably expect to manage such a burden , ” he added . the chancellor underlined that the public at large realizes that the social system has to change , but that it has balked when confronted with concrete changes that impact them directly , and called for citizens to accept what he said was the inevitable . chancellor far removed from reality ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of protestors march against reforms in leipzig his comments follow weeks of protests , particularly in former communist eastern germany , over tough welfare cuts that will introduce stringent means testing on those claiming unemployment benefits and will make people with a certain level of savings ineligible for welfare . popular anger has arisen in the country with as many as 80,000 people taking to the streets across the country in weekly protests every monday . schröder has been greeted by eggs and heckles as much as by cheers since announcing the reforms . predictably , the chancellor 's comments on friday triggered a heated discussion and drove another wedge between schröder and social support groups who have largely denounced the reforms as being " socially unfair " and " forcing people into poverty . " ulrich schneider , head of the paritätisch wohlfahrtsverband , a leading german social welfare support group , told berlin daily tagesspiegel that schröder 's comments " indicate how far the chancellor is removed from the reality of these people , ” who he says have to count every euro and pinch every penny .
thomas broch , who heads german caritas , also lashed out at the chancellor . “ schröder belittles the people who are already on the losing side of society , ” he said . schröder : " bitter reproaches from our children " government spokesman bela anda acted quickly to point out that schröder was only referring to those who don ’ t need government support , but get it anyway .

rainer wend , chairman of the bundestag ’ s committee for economics and labor , said the chancellor ’ s remarks were “ dead on ” and derided the outcry as " good old fashioned feigned fury " , noting that the critique applies just as well to wealthy citizens who exploit tax loopholes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- chairwoman angela merkel support for the chancellor has also poured in from the opposition camp .

france and belgium have raised doubts over the project 's funding and its relationship to the wider us mission in the country . disagreement overshadowed a nato defense ministers meeting in the dutch seaside resort of noordwijk on friday aimed at discussing launching a training academy for senior iraqi military officers in iraq . the crucial deal on the training mission has the potential of settling almost two years of tension between the united states and some of its european partners over nato 's role in iraq .
the organization had already agreed to launch the training mission back in june . the major stumbling block had been opposition from paris , which had previously objected to operations inside iraq under a nato flag .
diplomats say france , which refuses to send any forces into iraq itself , has no problems with the technical aspects of the mission but wants to know what the added value of it would be . french defense minister michele alliot-marie said the foreign ministry in paris was still considering its options .
" we in france continue to believe that this training should be done outside iraq , " alliot-marie told reporters .
" iraq has to find its own sense of identity and i do n't think the addition of more foreigners in uniform will help that . "
if they were going in , she said the mission should remain " as low-profile as possible . " under a deal worked out among nato 's 26 member nations , it ’ s been suggested that the mission would report to the us officer in command of training operations in iraq .
a french diplomat said france wanted more assurances , however , that the officer would be answerable to the alliance .
in other words , there are fears that the alliance will end up being subordinate to the us-led coalition .
nato already has some 40 soldiers in iraq who began training army officers in collaboration with the defense ministry in baghdad .
the issue of the command structure led to a stormy debate in july . de hoop scheffer hopeful of deal nato general secretary jaap de hoop scheffer admitted friday that member states could n't see eye to eye on the issue .
" as it stands now , all 26 allies are n't completely satisfied , " de hoop scheffer said on the sidelines of the meeting . at the same time de hoop scheffer played down the differences and said he was optimistic that a compromise could be reached soon .
he insisted the differences were not " substantial " and included details of the training mission 's relationship with the much wider us mission to rebuild a new 260,000-strong iraqi army , and the question of protection for the alliance instructors . the north atlantic council , nato 's top decision-making body , will meet monday to re-examine the proposals .
british defense secretary geoff hoon was of the opinion that an agreement on the iraq issue was virtually in the bag .
and other officials insisted that the alliance “ is nearing agreement ” . doubts over funding but french reservations over the question of nato 's allegiance in iraq is n't the only issue causing argument among nato 's ranks . officials say that belgium balked at agreement because of problems it has with the project ’ s funding structure .
a belgian foreign ministry spokesman said they wanted to know who ’ s paying for what .
the operation is likely to be paid for from a mix of common nato funding and national financing . as plans stand now , around 300 nato instructors are to be sent to iraq to set up a training center for iraqi officers outside baghdad .
germany , france , belgium and now also spain have agreed that they will not send soldiers to iraq , but rather support the training of iraqi military and officials outside the country . although several of the nato allies have individually sent troops to join the us-led coalition , objections from france and germany had previously prevented the alliance taking a collective role in iraq , apart from offering logistical support to a polish-led multinational force of 6,000 troops operating in the center of the country . however , france , germany and the other allies agreed in june at a nato summit in istanbul to the creation of an alliance training mission for iraq . driving instructors and vehicle maintenance units german defense minister peter struck told reporters friday that the german army would train iraqis in the united arab emirates -lrb- uae -rrb- as driving instructors and also teach them how to carry out vehicle maintenance .
germany would also provide the vehicles needed for the purpose .
further training on mine-clearance would likely be carried out in germany , he said . germany had previously limited its training to iraqi police units .
struck told reporters german officials had drawn up the training plan after talks with iraqi counterparts in the uae . " for germany , this still means that there will be no single german soldier on the ground in iraq , " struck stressed . ben fajzullin -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de training role for nato troops in baghdad after meeting for the sixth time in three days , nato members finally agreed to send a small contingent of troops to iraq to train the country 's armed forces and help rebuild its military infrastructure .

the announcement comes just days before a nato summit , leading some to wonder what role the alliance will play in the region .

germany , france , belgium and now also spain have agreed that they will not send soldiers to iraq , but rather support the training of iraqi military and officials outside the country . although several of the nato allies have individually sent troops to join the us-led coalition , objections from france and germany had previously prevented the alliance taking a collective role in iraq , apart from offering logistical support to a polish-led multinational force of 6,000 troops operating in the center of the country . however , france , germany and the other allies agreed in june at a nato summit in istanbul to the creation of an alliance training mission for iraq . driving instructors and vehicle maintenance units german defense minister peter struck told reporters friday that the german army would train iraqis in the united arab emirates -lrb- uae -rrb- as driving instructors and also teach them how to carry out vehicle maintenance .

france and belgium have raised doubts over the project 's funding and its relationship to the wider us mission in the country . disagreement overshadowed a nato defense ministers meeting in the dutch seaside resort of noordwijk on friday aimed at discussing launching a training academy for senior iraqi military officers in iraq . the crucial deal on the training mission has the potential of settling almost two years of tension between the united states and some of its european partners over nato 's role in iraq .
the organization had already agreed to launch the training mission back in june . the major stumbling block had been opposition from paris , which had previously objected to operations inside iraq under a nato flag .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 18.09.2004 cutting through the red tape großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paperwork and red tape hinders economic growth , says the report the world bank 's " doing business in 2005 " report on business practices and bureaucracy shows many countries , germany included , are stifling growth and enterprise by wrapping simple procedures in masses of red tape . the world bank 's report , “ doing business in 2005 : removing obstacles to growth , ” looked at the levels of bureaucracy businesses face in 145 countries .
the report showed which countries have the least red-tape and where it 's easiest to become an entrepreneur . this is the second year the world bank has issued rankings on business environment indicators : more than 3,000 local experts investigated practices in 145 nations , asking whether it was easy or difficult to start a small or medium-size business and whether administrations made it hard to hire and fire . among the other things compared were hiring and firing practices , how easy it was to register property , the ease of contract enforcement , and - for the first time in 2003 - the property registration process and to what extent investors were protected . of the industrial countries , new zealand , australia and norway came out on top .
but where was germany , a country famed throughout the world for doing things by the book ? german procedures take twice as long it takes a businessman in finland three simple procedures and two weeks to turn his idea into a company .
german competitors , however , have to spend 45 days wading through nine procedures , twice as long as the world average .
that kind of bureaucratic hassle meant germany was n't among the top twenty . gabi beermeister , a young woman who runs a small kiosk in berlin , told dw-world german bureaucracy was getting worse . " selling bread rolls , cigarettes and sweets required a special catering permit , so i applied to the health authorities , " she said .
" but they asked for so many things - architect drawings of the business premises , a permit from the building authorities , letters of approval from banks … i simply gave up . " german government claims successes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement .
although germany ranked only slightly better than mediocre in the " doing business in 2005 " report , germany ’ s minister of commerce wolfgang clement told the handelsblatt newspaper that the report didn ’ t do germany justice .
he pointed out 2003 reforms , like the " hours of trading act " , which simplified trade guild rules and improved workplace regulations . meanwhile , the german ministry of justice has been searching the german law books for unnecessary regulations in a bid to streamline procedures .
two hundred laws and by-laws need to be abolished , found the ministry . bureaucratic countries pay a high price an easy business climate has many benefits , michael klein told dw-world .
he believes that the easier it is to start a new company , the higher the chances of reducing unemployment and spurring the economy . " we find that 25 percent of the countries that have the most complicated and bureaucratic regulations tend to grow roughly 2 percent less per year than the countries that have easy and well-structured regulations , " klein said . this knowledge has certainly prompted many european nations , not just germany , to tackle reform .
" most of the reform-stimulus has come from the eu , " said klein .
" the accession countries felt they should improve their business environment , slovakia ahead of all of them .
but also within the eu , a number of countries - spain , portugal , finland and belgium - have improved business regulations . " move to botswana ? the " doing business in 2005 " report follows the standard world bank line : economic liberalization and the opening of local markets comes with large payoffs .
as proof of that , michael klein pointed to turkey and france , both of which saw new business registration increase by 18 percent after the governments reduced the time and cost of starting a business . in the end , the report does , indirectly , offer a solution to german businessmen and women interested in a business friendly investment climate : they should move … to botswana . peter zimmerman -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german egovernment initiative off to a slow start the eu would like its citizens to use personal computers to do taxes and complete bureacratic formalities .
but apart from a successful egovernment project in bremen , germany still lags behind on an eu level .

the report showed which countries have the least red-tape and where it 's easiest to become an entrepreneur . this is the second year the world bank has issued rankings on business environment indicators : more than 3,000 local experts investigated practices in 145 nations , asking whether it was easy or difficult to start a small or medium-size business and whether administrations made it hard to hire and fire . among the other things compared were hiring and firing practices , how easy it was to register property , the ease of contract enforcement , and - for the first time in 2003 - the property registration process and to what extent investors were protected . of the industrial countries , new zealand , australia and norway came out on top .
but where was germany , a country famed throughout the world for doing things by the book ? german procedures take twice as long it takes a businessman in finland three simple procedures and two weeks to turn his idea into a company .
german competitors , however , have to spend 45 days wading through nine procedures , twice as long as the world average .
that kind of bureaucratic hassle meant germany was n't among the top twenty . gabi beermeister , a young woman who runs a small kiosk in berlin , told dw-world german bureaucracy was getting worse . " selling bread rolls , cigarettes and sweets required a special catering permit , so i applied to the health authorities , " she said .
" but they asked for so many things - architect drawings of the business premises , a permit from the building authorities , letters of approval from banks … i simply gave up . " german government claims successes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement .
although germany ranked only slightly better than mediocre in the " doing business in 2005 " report , germany ’ s minister of commerce wolfgang clement told the handelsblatt newspaper that the report didn ’ t do germany justice .
he pointed out 2003 reforms , like the " hours of trading act " , which simplified trade guild rules and improved workplace regulations . meanwhile , the german ministry of justice has been searching the german law books for unnecessary regulations in a bid to streamline procedures .
two hundred laws and by-laws need to be abolished , found the ministry . bureaucratic countries pay a high price an easy business climate has many benefits , michael klein told dw-world .
he believes that the easier it is to start a new company , the higher the chances of reducing unemployment and spurring the economy . " we find that 25 percent of the countries that have the most complicated and bureaucratic regulations tend to grow roughly 2 percent less per year than the countries that have easy and well-structured regulations , " klein said . this knowledge has certainly prompted many european nations , not just germany , to tackle reform .
" most of the reform-stimulus has come from the eu , " said klein .
" the accession countries felt they should improve their business environment , slovakia ahead of all of them .
but also within the eu , a number of countries - spain , portugal , finland and belgium - have improved business regulations . " move to botswana ? the " doing business in 2005 " report follows the standard world bank line : economic liberalization and the opening of local markets comes with large payoffs .
as proof of that , michael klein pointed to turkey and france , both of which saw new business registration increase by 18 percent after the governments reduced the time and cost of starting a business . in the end , the report does , indirectly , offer a solution to german businessmen and women interested in a business friendly investment climate : they should move … to botswana . peter zimmerman -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german egovernment initiative off to a slow start the eu would like its citizens to use personal computers to do taxes and complete bureacratic formalities .
but apart from a successful egovernment project in bremen , germany still lags behind on an eu level .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 18.09.2004 paris , brussels put brakes on nato mission in iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's training of iraqi military officers remains uncertain nato ’ s plans to expand its training mission in iraq have met with resistance .
france and belgium have raised doubts over the project 's funding and its relationship to the wider us mission in the country . disagreement overshadowed a nato defense ministers meeting in the dutch seaside resort of noordwijk on friday aimed at discussing launching a training academy for senior iraqi military officers in iraq . the crucial deal on the training mission has the potential of settling almost two years of tension between the united states and some of its european partners over nato 's role in iraq .
the organization had already agreed to launch the training mission back in june . the major stumbling block had been opposition from paris , which had previously objected to operations inside iraq under a nato flag .
diplomats say france , which refuses to send any forces into iraq itself , has no problems with the technical aspects of the mission but wants to know what the added value of it would be . french defense minister michele alliot-marie said the foreign ministry in paris was still considering its options .
" we in france continue to believe that this training should be done outside iraq , " alliot-marie told reporters .
" iraq has to find its own sense of identity and i do n't think the addition of more foreigners in uniform will help that . "
if they were going in , she said the mission should remain " as low-profile as possible . " under a deal worked out among nato 's 26 member nations , it ’ s been suggested that the mission would report to the us officer in command of training operations in iraq .
a french diplomat said france wanted more assurances , however , that the officer would be answerable to the alliance .
in other words , there are fears that the alliance will end up being subordinate to the us-led coalition .
nato already has some 40 soldiers in iraq who began training army officers in collaboration with the defense ministry in baghdad .
the issue of the command structure led to a stormy debate in july . de hoop scheffer hopeful of deal nato general secretary jaap de hoop scheffer admitted friday that member states could n't see eye to eye on the issue .
" as it stands now , all 26 allies are n't completely satisfied , " de hoop scheffer said on the sidelines of the meeting . at the same time de hoop scheffer played down the differences and said he was optimistic that a compromise could be reached soon .
he insisted the differences were not " substantial " and included details of the training mission 's relationship with the much wider us mission to rebuild a new 260,000-strong iraqi army , and the question of protection for the alliance instructors . the north atlantic council , nato 's top decision-making body , will meet monday to re-examine the proposals .
british defense secretary geoff hoon was of the opinion that an agreement on the iraq issue was virtually in the bag .
and other officials insisted that the alliance “ is nearing agreement ” . doubts over funding but french reservations over the question of nato 's allegiance in iraq is n't the only issue causing argument among nato 's ranks . officials say that belgium balked at agreement because of problems it has with the project ’ s funding structure .
a belgian foreign ministry spokesman said they wanted to know who ’ s paying for what .
the operation is likely to be paid for from a mix of common nato funding and national financing . as plans stand now , around 300 nato instructors are to be sent to iraq to set up a training center for iraqi officers outside baghdad .
germany , france , belgium and now also spain have agreed that they will not send soldiers to iraq , but rather support the training of iraqi military and officials outside the country . although several of the nato allies have individually sent troops to join the us-led coalition , objections from france and germany had previously prevented the alliance taking a collective role in iraq , apart from offering logistical support to a polish-led multinational force of 6,000 troops operating in the center of the country . however , france , germany and the other allies agreed in june at a nato summit in istanbul to the creation of an alliance training mission for iraq . driving instructors and vehicle maintenance units german defense minister peter struck told reporters friday that the german army would train iraqis in the united arab emirates -lrb- uae -rrb- as driving instructors and also teach them how to carry out vehicle maintenance .
germany would also provide the vehicles needed for the purpose .
further training on mine-clearance would likely be carried out in germany , he said . germany had previously limited its training to iraqi police units .
struck told reporters german officials had drawn up the training plan after talks with iraqi counterparts in the uae . " for germany , this still means that there will be no single german soldier on the ground in iraq , " struck stressed . ben fajzullin -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de training role for nato troops in baghdad after meeting for the sixth time in three days , nato members finally agreed to send a small contingent of troops to iraq to train the country 's armed forces and help rebuild its military infrastructure .

now it 's the nation 's highest court that tops the list . german interior minister otto schily on friday blamed a 2003 ruling by the federal constitutional court for contributing to the popularity of radical right-wing parties . its decision not to ban the parties ultimately led to their ascent , he told the financial times deutschland .
that a party using " clear anti-foreigner and anti-semitic propaganda " could receive enough votes to enter the state legislature is a result of the high court 's problematic decision , schily said . it poses a threat to germany 's political and legal structure and damages the country 's image as a destination for international investment , schily -lrb- photo -rrb- , a member of the social democrats , added .

the comments have raised the ire of social groups . german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s interview in the guter rat consumer magazine on friday echoes statements he ’ s made throughout the summer as he tries to hammer through controversial reforms to the country ’ s cumbersome social welfare state . " in both the east and the west , there 's a mentality which extends well into the middle class that you should claim state allowances wherever you can get them , even when there 's an adequate income in the family , " schröder told the magazine .
“ no welfare state can reasonably expect to manage such a burden , ” he added . the chancellor underlined that the public at large realizes that the social system has to change , but that it has balked when confronted with concrete changes that impact them directly , and called for citizens to accept what he said was the inevitable . chancellor far removed from reality ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of protestors march against reforms in leipzig his comments follow weeks of protests , particularly in former communist eastern germany , over tough welfare cuts that will introduce stringent means testing on those claiming unemployment benefits and will make people with a certain level of savings ineligible for welfare . popular anger has arisen in the country with as many as 80,000 people taking to the streets across the country in weekly protests every monday . schröder has been greeted by eggs and heckles as much as by cheers since announcing the reforms . predictably , the chancellor 's comments on friday triggered a heated discussion and drove another wedge between schröder and social support groups who have largely denounced the reforms as being " socially unfair " and " forcing people into poverty . " ulrich schneider , head of the paritätisch wohlfahrtsverband , a leading german social welfare support group , told berlin daily tagesspiegel that schröder 's comments " indicate how far the chancellor is removed from the reality of these people , ” who he says have to count every euro and pinch every penny .
thomas broch , who heads german caritas , also lashed out at the chancellor . “ schröder belittles the people who are already on the losing side of society , ” he said . schröder : " bitter reproaches from our children " government spokesman bela anda acted quickly to point out that schröder was only referring to those who don ’ t need government support , but get it anyway .
he stressed that applied as much to higher upper income groups who claim more than their share from government as it does to middle-income and lower-income people . the negative reactions seem to have caught the government and supporters of reform off-guard , especially since the chancellor had made similar comments throughout his fight to trim the welfare state and loosen labor laws . several influential social democratic politicians have come to the chancellor ’ s defense .
rainer wend , chairman of the bundestag ’ s committee for economics and labor , said the chancellor ’ s remarks were “ dead on ” and derided the outcry as " good old fashioned feigned fury " , noting that the critique applies just as well to wealthy citizens who exploit tax loopholes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- chairwoman angela merkel support for the chancellor has also poured in from the opposition camp .

she added that people who truly need help often don ’ t apply for welfare . for his part , schröder again defended labor market reforms on friday , saying they were necessary if germany was to deal with the challenges of an ageing population and high labor costs , without imposing an excessive burden on future generations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 18.09.2004 paris , brussels put brakes on nato mission in iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's training of iraqi military officers remains uncertain nato ’ s plans to expand its training mission in iraq have met with resistance .
france and belgium have raised doubts over the project 's funding and its relationship to the wider us mission in the country . disagreement overshadowed a nato defense ministers meeting in the dutch seaside resort of noordwijk on friday aimed at discussing launching a training academy for senior iraqi military officers in iraq . the crucial deal on the training mission has the potential of settling almost two years of tension between the united states and some of its european partners over nato 's role in iraq .
the organization had already agreed to launch the training mission back in june . the major stumbling block had been opposition from paris , which had previously objected to operations inside iraq under a nato flag .
diplomats say france , which refuses to send any forces into iraq itself , has no problems with the technical aspects of the mission but wants to know what the added value of it would be . french defense minister michele alliot-marie said the foreign ministry in paris was still considering its options .
" we in france continue to believe that this training should be done outside iraq , " alliot-marie told reporters .
" iraq has to find its own sense of identity and i do n't think the addition of more foreigners in uniform will help that . "
if they were going in , she said the mission should remain " as low-profile as possible . " under a deal worked out among nato 's 26 member nations , it ’ s been suggested that the mission would report to the us officer in command of training operations in iraq .
a french diplomat said france wanted more assurances , however , that the officer would be answerable to the alliance .
in other words , there are fears that the alliance will end up being subordinate to the us-led coalition .
nato already has some 40 soldiers in iraq who began training army officers in collaboration with the defense ministry in baghdad .
the issue of the command structure led to a stormy debate in july . de hoop scheffer hopeful of deal nato general secretary jaap de hoop scheffer admitted friday that member states could n't see eye to eye on the issue .
" as it stands now , all 26 allies are n't completely satisfied , " de hoop scheffer said on the sidelines of the meeting . at the same time de hoop scheffer played down the differences and said he was optimistic that a compromise could be reached soon .
he insisted the differences were not " substantial " and included details of the training mission 's relationship with the much wider us mission to rebuild a new 260,000-strong iraqi army , and the question of protection for the alliance instructors . the north atlantic council , nato 's top decision-making body , will meet monday to re-examine the proposals .
british defense secretary geoff hoon was of the opinion that an agreement on the iraq issue was virtually in the bag .
and other officials insisted that the alliance “ is nearing agreement ” . doubts over funding but french reservations over the question of nato 's allegiance in iraq is n't the only issue causing argument among nato 's ranks . officials say that belgium balked at agreement because of problems it has with the project ’ s funding structure .
a belgian foreign ministry spokesman said they wanted to know who ’ s paying for what .
the operation is likely to be paid for from a mix of common nato funding and national financing . as plans stand now , around 300 nato instructors are to be sent to iraq to set up a training center for iraqi officers outside baghdad .
germany , france , belgium and now also spain have agreed that they will not send soldiers to iraq , but rather support the training of iraqi military and officials outside the country . although several of the nato allies have individually sent troops to join the us-led coalition , objections from france and germany had previously prevented the alliance taking a collective role in iraq , apart from offering logistical support to a polish-led multinational force of 6,000 troops operating in the center of the country . however , france , germany and the other allies agreed in june at a nato summit in istanbul to the creation of an alliance training mission for iraq . driving instructors and vehicle maintenance units german defense minister peter struck told reporters friday that the german army would train iraqis in the united arab emirates -lrb- uae -rrb- as driving instructors and also teach them how to carry out vehicle maintenance .
germany would also provide the vehicles needed for the purpose .
further training on mine-clearance would likely be carried out in germany , he said . germany had previously limited its training to iraqi police units .
struck told reporters german officials had drawn up the training plan after talks with iraqi counterparts in the uae . " for germany , this still means that there will be no single german soldier on the ground in iraq , " struck stressed . ben fajzullin -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de training role for nato troops in baghdad after meeting for the sixth time in three days , nato members finally agreed to send a small contingent of troops to iraq to train the country 's armed forces and help rebuild its military infrastructure .
-lrb- august 1 , 2004 -rrb- germany to help train iraqi military germany will help train the iraqi military - but not on iraqi soil .
the announcement comes just days before a nato summit , leading some to wonder what role the alliance will play in the region .

france and belgium have raised doubts over the project 's funding and its relationship to the wider us mission in the country . disagreement overshadowed a nato defense ministers meeting in the dutch seaside resort of noordwijk on friday aimed at discussing launching a training academy for senior iraqi military officers in iraq . the crucial deal on the training mission has the potential of settling almost two years of tension between the united states and some of its european partners over nato 's role in iraq .
the organization had already agreed to launch the training mission back in june . the major stumbling block had been opposition from paris , which had previously objected to operations inside iraq under a nato flag .
diplomats say france , which refuses to send any forces into iraq itself , has no problems with the technical aspects of the mission but wants to know what the added value of it would be . french defense minister michele alliot-marie said the foreign ministry in paris was still considering its options .
" we in france continue to believe that this training should be done outside iraq , " alliot-marie told reporters .
" iraq has to find its own sense of identity and i do n't think the addition of more foreigners in uniform will help that . "
if they were going in , she said the mission should remain " as low-profile as possible . " under a deal worked out among nato 's 26 member nations , it ’ s been suggested that the mission would report to the us officer in command of training operations in iraq .
a french diplomat said france wanted more assurances , however , that the officer would be answerable to the alliance .
in other words , there are fears that the alliance will end up being subordinate to the us-led coalition .
nato already has some 40 soldiers in iraq who began training army officers in collaboration with the defense ministry in baghdad .
the issue of the command structure led to a stormy debate in july . de hoop scheffer hopeful of deal nato general secretary jaap de hoop scheffer admitted friday that member states could n't see eye to eye on the issue .
" as it stands now , all 26 allies are n't completely satisfied , " de hoop scheffer said on the sidelines of the meeting . at the same time de hoop scheffer played down the differences and said he was optimistic that a compromise could be reached soon .
he insisted the differences were not " substantial " and included details of the training mission 's relationship with the much wider us mission to rebuild a new 260,000-strong iraqi army , and the question of protection for the alliance instructors . the north atlantic council , nato 's top decision-making body , will meet monday to re-examine the proposals .
british defense secretary geoff hoon was of the opinion that an agreement on the iraq issue was virtually in the bag .
and other officials insisted that the alliance “ is nearing agreement ” . doubts over funding but french reservations over the question of nato 's allegiance in iraq is n't the only issue causing argument among nato 's ranks . officials say that belgium balked at agreement because of problems it has with the project ’ s funding structure .
a belgian foreign ministry spokesman said they wanted to know who ’ s paying for what .
the operation is likely to be paid for from a mix of common nato funding and national financing . as plans stand now , around 300 nato instructors are to be sent to iraq to set up a training center for iraqi officers outside baghdad .
germany , france , belgium and now also spain have agreed that they will not send soldiers to iraq , but rather support the training of iraqi military and officials outside the country . although several of the nato allies have individually sent troops to join the us-led coalition , objections from france and germany had previously prevented the alliance taking a collective role in iraq , apart from offering logistical support to a polish-led multinational force of 6,000 troops operating in the center of the country . however , france , germany and the other allies agreed in june at a nato summit in istanbul to the creation of an alliance training mission for iraq . driving instructors and vehicle maintenance units german defense minister peter struck told reporters friday that the german army would train iraqis in the united arab emirates -lrb- uae -rrb- as driving instructors and also teach them how to carry out vehicle maintenance .
germany would also provide the vehicles needed for the purpose .
further training on mine-clearance would likely be carried out in germany , he said . germany had previously limited its training to iraqi police units .
struck told reporters german officials had drawn up the training plan after talks with iraqi counterparts in the uae . " for germany , this still means that there will be no single german soldier on the ground in iraq , " struck stressed . ben fajzullin -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de training role for nato troops in baghdad after meeting for the sixth time in three days , nato members finally agreed to send a small contingent of troops to iraq to train the country 's armed forces and help rebuild its military infrastructure .

in an interview with deutsche welle , turkish pm tayyip erdogan said the country was on track . dw : on october 6th the european union commission is due to announce when and if membership talks with your country can take place .
what do you think brussels will decide ? recep tayyip erdogan : we are doing everything we can to influence this process in a positive way and to fulfill the criteria issued in copenhagen for accession talks .
at this point there are no problems with legislation on reforms .
when i asked mr. verheugen -lrb- eu enlargement commissioner -rrb- during his last visit here what we had to do to complete this legislation , he answered that turkey had already done everything , but that there were still problems with implementation .
we know that too , because implementation requires a change in mentality .
that 's part of a process and we are making every effort to push this process forward as fast as possible . while the eu commissioner was here , he was presented with reports from human rights organizations that say systematic torture continues in turkey .
is that charge baseless or unfair ? these allegations are completely unjustified .
they are totally groundless charges .
our ministry launched an immediate investigation .
and we have also been conducting inquiries into who initiated these accusations .
unfortunately , it is charges of this nature which are hindering turkey 's attempts to integrate into europe .
and i have the impression that 's something verheugen is all too aware of .
we have a zero-tolerance policy on the issue of torture .
systematic torture is unthinkable in a democratic system . up until now it 's been viewed as an open secret in brussels that on october 6th the eu commission would say yes to opening membership talks .
now a dispute has unfolded concerning proposed reforms to the turkish penal code which have since been put on hold .
where do things stand now ?
will the penal code be reformed , and when will the reforms become law ? turkey 's new criminal law is not part of the copenhagen criteria .
just as the draft legislation for reforms to the regional courts of appeal , or the new code for criminal procedure or the penal code , are not part of the copenhagen criteria .
these are steps we are taking as preparatory measures for moving towards the european union .
and it should not be forgotten that at this point there is only a common european constitution , but the eu has no common code of criminal law .
we are undertaking this reform of criminal law on our own initiative .
and i 'm convinced that 's something our european friends will appreciate . even so , the section which would make adultery a criminal offence is especially controversial .
is that something that is essential for you , or could you take that section out of the reform package if brussels were to insist on it ? this new law comprises a total of 346 paragraphs - and as such it is not necessarily so easy to appraise from a distance .
it would be unwise to restrict the discussion to the issue of adultery .
for us in the justice and development party , traditions are very important .
we stand for conservative values .
these principles are written in our party political program and are part of my government 's stated policy goals .
that is the aim of this article of law .
it 's intended to protect and strengthen the family .
the family is the most dynamic factor in turkish society .
moreover , this article of law was on the statutes between 1926 and 1996 at which time it was directed against women .
however , the new law foresees that if anyone brings a charge on grounds of infidelity and it comes to a court judgment , men and women shall be treated equally and the punishment shall be appropriate . is brussels exerting too much pressure ? no-one has raised that issue with me .
when mr. verheugen was here , i put the following question to him : does turkey need to do more ?
he answered ' no ' , but he did say that there were clear failings in the implementation of the reforms .
we 're aware of that too .
and we also discussed the issue of adultery .
mr verheugen said that this issue had nothing to do with the commission 's progress report .

in an interview with deutsche welle , turkish pm tayyip erdogan said the country was on track . dw : on october 6th the european union commission is due to announce when and if membership talks with your country can take place .
what do you think brussels will decide ? recep tayyip erdogan : we are doing everything we can to influence this process in a positive way and to fulfill the criteria issued in copenhagen for accession talks .
at this point there are no problems with legislation on reforms .
when i asked mr. verheugen -lrb- eu enlargement commissioner -rrb- during his last visit here what we had to do to complete this legislation , he answered that turkey had already done everything , but that there were still problems with implementation .
we know that too , because implementation requires a change in mentality .
that 's part of a process and we are making every effort to push this process forward as fast as possible . while the eu commissioner was here , he was presented with reports from human rights organizations that say systematic torture continues in turkey .
is that charge baseless or unfair ? these allegations are completely unjustified .
they are totally groundless charges .
our ministry launched an immediate investigation .
and we have also been conducting inquiries into who initiated these accusations .
unfortunately , it is charges of this nature which are hindering turkey 's attempts to integrate into europe .
and i have the impression that 's something verheugen is all too aware of .
we have a zero-tolerance policy on the issue of torture .
systematic torture is unthinkable in a democratic system . up until now it 's been viewed as an open secret in brussels that on october 6th the eu commission would say yes to opening membership talks .
now a dispute has unfolded concerning proposed reforms to the turkish penal code which have since been put on hold .
where do things stand now ?
will the penal code be reformed , and when will the reforms become law ? turkey 's new criminal law is not part of the copenhagen criteria .
just as the draft legislation for reforms to the regional courts of appeal , or the new code for criminal procedure or the penal code , are not part of the copenhagen criteria .
these are steps we are taking as preparatory measures for moving towards the european union .
and it should not be forgotten that at this point there is only a common european constitution , but the eu has no common code of criminal law .
we are undertaking this reform of criminal law on our own initiative .
and i 'm convinced that 's something our european friends will appreciate . even so , the section which would make adultery a criminal offence is especially controversial .
is that something that is essential for you , or could you take that section out of the reform package if brussels were to insist on it ? this new law comprises a total of 346 paragraphs - and as such it is not necessarily so easy to appraise from a distance .
it would be unwise to restrict the discussion to the issue of adultery .
for us in the justice and development party , traditions are very important .
we stand for conservative values .
these principles are written in our party political program and are part of my government 's stated policy goals .
that is the aim of this article of law .
it 's intended to protect and strengthen the family .
the family is the most dynamic factor in turkish society .
moreover , this article of law was on the statutes between 1926 and 1996 at which time it was directed against women .
however , the new law foresees that if anyone brings a charge on grounds of infidelity and it comes to a court judgment , men and women shall be treated equally and the punishment shall be appropriate . is brussels exerting too much pressure ? no-one has raised that issue with me .
when mr. verheugen was here , i put the following question to him : does turkey need to do more ?
he answered ' no ' , but he did say that there were clear failings in the implementation of the reforms .
we 're aware of that too .
and we also discussed the issue of adultery .
mr verheugen said that this issue had nothing to do with the commission 's progress report .
he did , however , say that the topic of adultery could influence the decisions on when to begin talks .
i think we should now end this debate .
there are 25 eu members , not all of which fulfill the copenhagen criteria .
nonetheless , they are members of the european union . german conservative opposition leader angela merkel has written a letter to political leaders across europe in which she lobbied against full membership for turkey and instead pushed for a ' privileged partnership ' for your country .

" that requires clarification , " verheugen said , warning that failure to pass the bill by october 6 " will have an impact " on a crucial report from the european commission due out that date on whether to start accession talks with ankara . verheugen strictly ruled out the possibility of delaying next month 's report , which is to serve as a basis for eu leaders to decide on december 17 on whether to set a date for the start of eu membership talks with turkey . " i have no intention , i am strictly against , i do n't see any reason why we should delay the report " , he told reporters . bill a key element of reform process the turkish parliament went into recess saturday until october 1 , leaving the crucial penal code reform package in limbo and unlikely to be enacted before the report 's release . eu officials have warned that the bill aimed at overhauling the country 's 78-year-old criminal code was a key element of turkey 's efforts to meet european democracy and human rights standards .
" so far our assessment was based on the assumption that the penal code would be adopted before the commission makes its decision , " verheugen told reporters .
" i have asked the ambassador to get clarification from his government whether and when the penal code will be adopted and whether it will be substantially changed . " the eu will notably seek reassurances that the final text will not include a controversial proposal to criminalize adultery , which was floated by the government this month but later withdrawn amid sharp protests from brussels .
the squabble over the legal status of adultery paralyzed debates on the reform package in the turkish parliament and left turkey-eu ties badly shaken . " it now depends on the answer i will get from ankara ...
in any case , that will have an impact , i have to make it very clear , " the commissioner stressed . however , verheugen refused to say whether a failure to adopt the penal reforms would necessarily lead to a negative recommendation from brussels .
" that , i will tell the commission .
i will not tell it today , " he said . turkey committed to reforms turkey 's ambassador , oguz demiralp , meanwhile insisted that ankara , an eu candidate since 1999 , remained committed to its eu-minded reform program . the " turkish government and turkish parliament are very much committed to the continuation of the reform process .
of course all the reforms will be adopted , " demiralp told reporters . verheugen , who is a strong supporter of turkey 's eu bid , emphasized that " the problem of the adoption of the penal code ranks prominent " in the debate over ankara 's readiness to join the bloc .
" it has to do with the question whether turkey has already established a rule of law sufficiently and in accordance with european standards and ... whether fundamental rights and freedoms are properly implemented and respected in turkey .

in an interview with deutsche welle , turkish pm tayyip erdogan said the country was on track . dw : on october 6th the european union commission is due to announce when and if membership talks with your country can take place .
what do you think brussels will decide ? recep tayyip erdogan : we are doing everything we can to influence this process in a positive way and to fulfill the criteria issued in copenhagen for accession talks .
at this point there are no problems with legislation on reforms .
when i asked mr. verheugen -lrb- eu enlargement commissioner -rrb- during his last visit here what we had to do to complete this legislation , he answered that turkey had already done everything , but that there were still problems with implementation .
we know that too , because implementation requires a change in mentality .
that 's part of a process and we are making every effort to push this process forward as fast as possible . while the eu commissioner was here , he was presented with reports from human rights organizations that say systematic torture continues in turkey .
is that charge baseless or unfair ? these allegations are completely unjustified .
they are totally groundless charges .
our ministry launched an immediate investigation .
and we have also been conducting inquiries into who initiated these accusations .
unfortunately , it is charges of this nature which are hindering turkey 's attempts to integrate into europe .
and i have the impression that 's something verheugen is all too aware of .
we have a zero-tolerance policy on the issue of torture .
systematic torture is unthinkable in a democratic system . up until now it 's been viewed as an open secret in brussels that on october 6th the eu commission would say yes to opening membership talks .
now a dispute has unfolded concerning proposed reforms to the turkish penal code which have since been put on hold .
where do things stand now ?
will the penal code be reformed , and when will the reforms become law ? turkey 's new criminal law is not part of the copenhagen criteria .
just as the draft legislation for reforms to the regional courts of appeal , or the new code for criminal procedure or the penal code , are not part of the copenhagen criteria .
these are steps we are taking as preparatory measures for moving towards the european union .
and it should not be forgotten that at this point there is only a common european constitution , but the eu has no common code of criminal law .
we are undertaking this reform of criminal law on our own initiative .
and i 'm convinced that 's something our european friends will appreciate . even so , the section which would make adultery a criminal offence is especially controversial .
is that something that is essential for you , or could you take that section out of the reform package if brussels were to insist on it ? this new law comprises a total of 346 paragraphs - and as such it is not necessarily so easy to appraise from a distance .
it would be unwise to restrict the discussion to the issue of adultery .
for us in the justice and development party , traditions are very important .
we stand for conservative values .
these principles are written in our party political program and are part of my government 's stated policy goals .
that is the aim of this article of law .
it 's intended to protect and strengthen the family .
the family is the most dynamic factor in turkish society .
moreover , this article of law was on the statutes between 1926 and 1996 at which time it was directed against women .
however , the new law foresees that if anyone brings a charge on grounds of infidelity and it comes to a court judgment , men and women shall be treated equally and the punishment shall be appropriate . is brussels exerting too much pressure ? no-one has raised that issue with me .
when mr. verheugen was here , i put the following question to him : does turkey need to do more ?
he answered ' no ' , but he did say that there were clear failings in the implementation of the reforms .
we 're aware of that too .
and we also discussed the issue of adultery .
mr verheugen said that this issue had nothing to do with the commission 's progress report .
he did , however , say that the topic of adultery could influence the decisions on when to begin talks .
i think we should now end this debate .
there are 25 eu members , not all of which fulfill the copenhagen criteria .
nonetheless , they are members of the european union . german conservative opposition leader angela merkel has written a letter to political leaders across europe in which she lobbied against full membership for turkey and instead pushed for a ' privileged partnership ' for your country .
you and your akp party are also members of the conservative camp - are you disappointed in miss merkel ? i find it hard to understand miss merkel .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 18.09.2004 paris , brussels put brakes on nato mission in iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's training of iraqi military officers remains uncertain nato ’ s plans to expand its training mission in iraq have met with resistance .
france and belgium have raised doubts over the project 's funding and its relationship to the wider us mission in the country . disagreement overshadowed a nato defense ministers meeting in the dutch seaside resort of noordwijk on friday aimed at discussing launching a training academy for senior iraqi military officers in iraq . the crucial deal on the training mission has the potential of settling almost two years of tension between the united states and some of its european partners over nato 's role in iraq .
the organization had already agreed to launch the training mission back in june . the major stumbling block had been opposition from paris , which had previously objected to operations inside iraq under a nato flag .
diplomats say france , which refuses to send any forces into iraq itself , has no problems with the technical aspects of the mission but wants to know what the added value of it would be . french defense minister michele alliot-marie said the foreign ministry in paris was still considering its options .
" we in france continue to believe that this training should be done outside iraq , " alliot-marie told reporters .
" iraq has to find its own sense of identity and i do n't think the addition of more foreigners in uniform will help that . "
if they were going in , she said the mission should remain " as low-profile as possible . " under a deal worked out among nato 's 26 member nations , it ’ s been suggested that the mission would report to the us officer in command of training operations in iraq .
a french diplomat said france wanted more assurances , however , that the officer would be answerable to the alliance .
in other words , there are fears that the alliance will end up being subordinate to the us-led coalition .
nato already has some 40 soldiers in iraq who began training army officers in collaboration with the defense ministry in baghdad .
the issue of the command structure led to a stormy debate in july . de hoop scheffer hopeful of deal nato general secretary jaap de hoop scheffer admitted friday that member states could n't see eye to eye on the issue .
" as it stands now , all 26 allies are n't completely satisfied , " de hoop scheffer said on the sidelines of the meeting . at the same time de hoop scheffer played down the differences and said he was optimistic that a compromise could be reached soon .
he insisted the differences were not " substantial " and included details of the training mission 's relationship with the much wider us mission to rebuild a new 260,000-strong iraqi army , and the question of protection for the alliance instructors . the north atlantic council , nato 's top decision-making body , will meet monday to re-examine the proposals .
british defense secretary geoff hoon was of the opinion that an agreement on the iraq issue was virtually in the bag .
and other officials insisted that the alliance “ is nearing agreement ” . doubts over funding but french reservations over the question of nato 's allegiance in iraq is n't the only issue causing argument among nato 's ranks . officials say that belgium balked at agreement because of problems it has with the project ’ s funding structure .
a belgian foreign ministry spokesman said they wanted to know who ’ s paying for what .
the operation is likely to be paid for from a mix of common nato funding and national financing . as plans stand now , around 300 nato instructors are to be sent to iraq to set up a training center for iraqi officers outside baghdad .
germany , france , belgium and now also spain have agreed that they will not send soldiers to iraq , but rather support the training of iraqi military and officials outside the country . although several of the nato allies have individually sent troops to join the us-led coalition , objections from france and germany had previously prevented the alliance taking a collective role in iraq , apart from offering logistical support to a polish-led multinational force of 6,000 troops operating in the center of the country . however , france , germany and the other allies agreed in june at a nato summit in istanbul to the creation of an alliance training mission for iraq . driving instructors and vehicle maintenance units german defense minister peter struck told reporters friday that the german army would train iraqis in the united arab emirates -lrb- uae -rrb- as driving instructors and also teach them how to carry out vehicle maintenance .
germany would also provide the vehicles needed for the purpose .
further training on mine-clearance would likely be carried out in germany , he said . germany had previously limited its training to iraqi police units .
struck told reporters german officials had drawn up the training plan after talks with iraqi counterparts in the uae . " for germany , this still means that there will be no single german soldier on the ground in iraq , " struck stressed . ben fajzullin -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de training role for nato troops in baghdad after meeting for the sixth time in three days , nato members finally agreed to send a small contingent of troops to iraq to train the country 's armed forces and help rebuild its military infrastructure .

the report showed which countries have the least red-tape and where it 's easiest to become an entrepreneur . this is the second year the world bank has issued rankings on business environment indicators : more than 3,000 local experts investigated practices in 145 nations , asking whether it was easy or difficult to start a small or medium-size business and whether administrations made it hard to hire and fire . among the other things compared were hiring and firing practices , how easy it was to register property , the ease of contract enforcement , and - for the first time in 2003 - the property registration process and to what extent investors were protected . of the industrial countries , new zealand , australia and norway came out on top .
but where was germany , a country famed throughout the world for doing things by the book ? german procedures take twice as long it takes a businessman in finland three simple procedures and two weeks to turn his idea into a company .
german competitors , however , have to spend 45 days wading through nine procedures , twice as long as the world average .
that kind of bureaucratic hassle meant germany was n't among the top twenty . gabi beermeister , a young woman who runs a small kiosk in berlin , told dw-world german bureaucracy was getting worse . " selling bread rolls , cigarettes and sweets required a special catering permit , so i applied to the health authorities , " she said .
" but they asked for so many things - architect drawings of the business premises , a permit from the building authorities , letters of approval from banks … i simply gave up . " german government claims successes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement .
although germany ranked only slightly better than mediocre in the " doing business in 2005 " report , germany ’ s minister of commerce wolfgang clement told the handelsblatt newspaper that the report didn ’ t do germany justice .
he pointed out 2003 reforms , like the " hours of trading act " , which simplified trade guild rules and improved workplace regulations . meanwhile , the german ministry of justice has been searching the german law books for unnecessary regulations in a bid to streamline procedures .
two hundred laws and by-laws need to be abolished , found the ministry . bureaucratic countries pay a high price an easy business climate has many benefits , michael klein told dw-world .
he believes that the easier it is to start a new company , the higher the chances of reducing unemployment and spurring the economy . " we find that 25 percent of the countries that have the most complicated and bureaucratic regulations tend to grow roughly 2 percent less per year than the countries that have easy and well-structured regulations , " klein said . this knowledge has certainly prompted many european nations , not just germany , to tackle reform .
" most of the reform-stimulus has come from the eu , " said klein .
" the accession countries felt they should improve their business environment , slovakia ahead of all of them .
but also within the eu , a number of countries - spain , portugal , finland and belgium - have improved business regulations . " move to botswana ? the " doing business in 2005 " report follows the standard world bank line : economic liberalization and the opening of local markets comes with large payoffs .
as proof of that , michael klein pointed to turkey and france , both of which saw new business registration increase by 18 percent after the governments reduced the time and cost of starting a business . in the end , the report does , indirectly , offer a solution to german businessmen and women interested in a business friendly investment climate : they should move … to botswana . peter zimmerman -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german egovernment initiative off to a slow start the eu would like its citizens to use personal computers to do taxes and complete bureacratic formalities .

the report showed which countries have the least red-tape and where it 's easiest to become an entrepreneur . this is the second year the world bank has issued rankings on business environment indicators : more than 3,000 local experts investigated practices in 145 nations , asking whether it was easy or difficult to start a small or medium-size business and whether administrations made it hard to hire and fire . among the other things compared were hiring and firing practices , how easy it was to register property , the ease of contract enforcement , and - for the first time in 2003 - the property registration process and to what extent investors were protected . of the industrial countries , new zealand , australia and norway came out on top .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 18.09.2004 paris , brussels put brakes on nato mission in iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's training of iraqi military officers remains uncertain nato ’ s plans to expand its training mission in iraq have met with resistance .
france and belgium have raised doubts over the project 's funding and its relationship to the wider us mission in the country . disagreement overshadowed a nato defense ministers meeting in the dutch seaside resort of noordwijk on friday aimed at discussing launching a training academy for senior iraqi military officers in iraq . the crucial deal on the training mission has the potential of settling almost two years of tension between the united states and some of its european partners over nato 's role in iraq .
the organization had already agreed to launch the training mission back in june . the major stumbling block had been opposition from paris , which had previously objected to operations inside iraq under a nato flag .
diplomats say france , which refuses to send any forces into iraq itself , has no problems with the technical aspects of the mission but wants to know what the added value of it would be . french defense minister michele alliot-marie said the foreign ministry in paris was still considering its options .
" we in france continue to believe that this training should be done outside iraq , " alliot-marie told reporters .
" iraq has to find its own sense of identity and i do n't think the addition of more foreigners in uniform will help that . "
if they were going in , she said the mission should remain " as low-profile as possible . " under a deal worked out among nato 's 26 member nations , it ’ s been suggested that the mission would report to the us officer in command of training operations in iraq .
a french diplomat said france wanted more assurances , however , that the officer would be answerable to the alliance .
in other words , there are fears that the alliance will end up being subordinate to the us-led coalition .
nato already has some 40 soldiers in iraq who began training army officers in collaboration with the defense ministry in baghdad .
the issue of the command structure led to a stormy debate in july . de hoop scheffer hopeful of deal nato general secretary jaap de hoop scheffer admitted friday that member states could n't see eye to eye on the issue .
" as it stands now , all 26 allies are n't completely satisfied , " de hoop scheffer said on the sidelines of the meeting . at the same time de hoop scheffer played down the differences and said he was optimistic that a compromise could be reached soon .
he insisted the differences were not " substantial " and included details of the training mission 's relationship with the much wider us mission to rebuild a new 260,000-strong iraqi army , and the question of protection for the alliance instructors . the north atlantic council , nato 's top decision-making body , will meet monday to re-examine the proposals .
british defense secretary geoff hoon was of the opinion that an agreement on the iraq issue was virtually in the bag .
and other officials insisted that the alliance “ is nearing agreement ” . doubts over funding but french reservations over the question of nato 's allegiance in iraq is n't the only issue causing argument among nato 's ranks . officials say that belgium balked at agreement because of problems it has with the project ’ s funding structure .
a belgian foreign ministry spokesman said they wanted to know who ’ s paying for what .
the operation is likely to be paid for from a mix of common nato funding and national financing . as plans stand now , around 300 nato instructors are to be sent to iraq to set up a training center for iraqi officers outside baghdad .
germany , france , belgium and now also spain have agreed that they will not send soldiers to iraq , but rather support the training of iraqi military and officials outside the country . although several of the nato allies have individually sent troops to join the us-led coalition , objections from france and germany had previously prevented the alliance taking a collective role in iraq , apart from offering logistical support to a polish-led multinational force of 6,000 troops operating in the center of the country . however , france , germany and the other allies agreed in june at a nato summit in istanbul to the creation of an alliance training mission for iraq . driving instructors and vehicle maintenance units german defense minister peter struck told reporters friday that the german army would train iraqis in the united arab emirates -lrb- uae -rrb- as driving instructors and also teach them how to carry out vehicle maintenance .
germany would also provide the vehicles needed for the purpose .
further training on mine-clearance would likely be carried out in germany , he said . germany had previously limited its training to iraqi police units .
struck told reporters german officials had drawn up the training plan after talks with iraqi counterparts in the uae . " for germany , this still means that there will be no single german soldier on the ground in iraq , " struck stressed . ben fajzullin -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de training role for nato troops in baghdad after meeting for the sixth time in three days , nato members finally agreed to send a small contingent of troops to iraq to train the country 's armed forces and help rebuild its military infrastructure .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : turkey 's eu moment of truth verheugen : no more obstacles to talks with turkey capturing turkish culture 's changing face waiting for eu erdogan : " we have done our homework " europe -pipe- 18.09.2004 " a change in mentality is needed " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister erdogan says turkey is doing its best to meet entry criteria the eu commission is to publish a key report on october 6 on whether ankara is ready to open talks on joining the eu .
in an interview with deutsche welle , turkish pm tayyip erdogan said the country was on track . dw : on october 6th the european union commission is due to announce when and if membership talks with your country can take place .
what do you think brussels will decide ? recep tayyip erdogan : we are doing everything we can to influence this process in a positive way and to fulfill the criteria issued in copenhagen for accession talks .
at this point there are no problems with legislation on reforms .
when i asked mr. verheugen -lrb- eu enlargement commissioner -rrb- during his last visit here what we had to do to complete this legislation , he answered that turkey had already done everything , but that there were still problems with implementation .
we know that too , because implementation requires a change in mentality .
that 's part of a process and we are making every effort to push this process forward as fast as possible . while the eu commissioner was here , he was presented with reports from human rights organizations that say systematic torture continues in turkey .
is that charge baseless or unfair ? these allegations are completely unjustified .
they are totally groundless charges .
our ministry launched an immediate investigation .
and we have also been conducting inquiries into who initiated these accusations .
unfortunately , it is charges of this nature which are hindering turkey 's attempts to integrate into europe .
and i have the impression that 's something verheugen is all too aware of .
we have a zero-tolerance policy on the issue of torture .
systematic torture is unthinkable in a democratic system . up until now it 's been viewed as an open secret in brussels that on october 6th the eu commission would say yes to opening membership talks .
now a dispute has unfolded concerning proposed reforms to the turkish penal code which have since been put on hold .
where do things stand now ?
will the penal code be reformed , and when will the reforms become law ? turkey 's new criminal law is not part of the copenhagen criteria .
just as the draft legislation for reforms to the regional courts of appeal , or the new code for criminal procedure or the penal code , are not part of the copenhagen criteria .
these are steps we are taking as preparatory measures for moving towards the european union .
and it should not be forgotten that at this point there is only a common european constitution , but the eu has no common code of criminal law .
we are undertaking this reform of criminal law on our own initiative .
and i 'm convinced that 's something our european friends will appreciate . even so , the section which would make adultery a criminal offence is especially controversial .
is that something that is essential for you , or could you take that section out of the reform package if brussels were to insist on it ? this new law comprises a total of 346 paragraphs - and as such it is not necessarily so easy to appraise from a distance .
it would be unwise to restrict the discussion to the issue of adultery .
for us in the justice and development party , traditions are very important .
we stand for conservative values .
these principles are written in our party political program and are part of my government 's stated policy goals .
that is the aim of this article of law .
it 's intended to protect and strengthen the family .
the family is the most dynamic factor in turkish society .
moreover , this article of law was on the statutes between 1926 and 1996 at which time it was directed against women .
however , the new law foresees that if anyone brings a charge on grounds of infidelity and it comes to a court judgment , men and women shall be treated equally and the punishment shall be appropriate . is brussels exerting too much pressure ? no-one has raised that issue with me .
when mr. verheugen was here , i put the following question to him : does turkey need to do more ?
he answered ' no ' , but he did say that there were clear failings in the implementation of the reforms .
we 're aware of that too .
and we also discussed the issue of adultery .
mr verheugen said that this issue had nothing to do with the commission 's progress report .
he did , however , say that the topic of adultery could influence the decisions on when to begin talks .
i think we should now end this debate .
there are 25 eu members , not all of which fulfill the copenhagen criteria .
nonetheless , they are members of the european union . german conservative opposition leader angela merkel has written a letter to political leaders across europe in which she lobbied against full membership for turkey and instead pushed for a ' privileged partnership ' for your country .
you and your akp party are also members of the conservative camp - are you disappointed in miss merkel ? i find it hard to understand miss merkel .
and she is calling for understanding in our discussions . a privileged partnership is unthinkable in the eu . any nation that fulfills the copenhagen criteria can start membership talks . but we are not yet talking about full membership here , rather commencing negotiations on terms of entry . therefore we need a fair decision to set the process of negotiations in motion . if this process does not get underway , we will draw our own conclusions from this and take the necessary steps . i would like to stress that we are pushing for the fulfillment of the copenhagen criteria in the interests of our own people . but if there were really to be a negative decision , which i do n't believe there will be , then we will call this the ankara criteria and continue on our own path . the interview was conducted by alexander kudascheff send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu wants turkey to explain withdrawal of bill european union enlargement commissioner guenter verheugen on saturday called on turkey to clarify its decision to withdraw a key bill reforming its penal code , during talks with turkey 's eu ambassador .

now it 's the nation 's highest court that tops the list . german interior minister otto schily on friday blamed a 2003 ruling by the federal constitutional court for contributing to the popularity of radical right-wing parties . its decision not to ban the parties ultimately led to their ascent , he told the financial times deutschland .
that a party using " clear anti-foreigner and anti-semitic propaganda " could receive enough votes to enter the state legislature is a result of the high court 's problematic decision , schily said . it poses a threat to germany 's political and legal structure and damages the country 's image as a destination for international investment , schily -lrb- photo -rrb- , a member of the social democrats , added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily officials in saxony expect the german national party -lrb- npd -rrb- to re-enter parliament and possibly increase their share of the vote in elections on sunday .
polls show the far-right german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- getting between 5 percent and 6 percent of the vote next door in the state of brandenburg .
politician spar over guilt the minister 's comments were " premature and panicked " former constitutional court justice berthold sommer told the tagespiegel newspaper .
other spd members also said it was wrong to hold the court responsible for german extremists .
" it 's not the judges that vote for the npd , " said dieter wiefelspütz , the spd 's spokesman for domestic affairs .
" it 's adult people . "
radical parties are seen to be taking advantage of chancellor gerhard schröder 's labor reforms to lure voters away from mainstream parties , christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- leader angela merkel said last week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : campaign posters appeal to voters upset with the government 's reforms green party head reinhard bütikofer said anyone looking for the reason why voters are losing interest in mainstream parties should look farther to the left at the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- .

now it 's the nation 's highest court that tops the list . german interior minister otto schily on friday blamed a 2003 ruling by the federal constitutional court for contributing to the popularity of radical right-wing parties . its decision not to ban the parties ultimately led to their ascent , he told the financial times deutschland .
that a party using " clear anti-foreigner and anti-semitic propaganda " could receive enough votes to enter the state legislature is a result of the high court 's problematic decision , schily said . it poses a threat to germany 's political and legal structure and damages the country 's image as a destination for international investment , schily -lrb- photo -rrb- , a member of the social democrats , added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily officials in saxony expect the german national party -lrb- npd -rrb- to re-enter parliament and possibly increase their share of the vote in elections on sunday .
polls show the far-right german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- getting between 5 percent and 6 percent of the vote next door in the state of brandenburg .
politician spar over guilt the minister 's comments were " premature and panicked " former constitutional court justice berthold sommer told the tagespiegel newspaper .
other spd members also said it was wrong to hold the court responsible for german extremists .
" it 's not the judges that vote for the npd , " said dieter wiefelspütz , the spd 's spokesman for domestic affairs .
" it 's adult people . "

the comments have raised the ire of social groups . german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s interview in the guter rat consumer magazine on friday echoes statements he ’ s made throughout the summer as he tries to hammer through controversial reforms to the country ’ s cumbersome social welfare state . " in both the east and the west , there 's a mentality which extends well into the middle class that you should claim state allowances wherever you can get them , even when there 's an adequate income in the family , " schröder told the magazine .
“ no welfare state can reasonably expect to manage such a burden , ” he added . the chancellor underlined that the public at large realizes that the social system has to change , but that it has balked when confronted with concrete changes that impact them directly , and called for citizens to accept what he said was the inevitable . chancellor far removed from reality ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of protestors march against reforms in leipzig his comments follow weeks of protests , particularly in former communist eastern germany , over tough welfare cuts that will introduce stringent means testing on those claiming unemployment benefits and will make people with a certain level of savings ineligible for welfare . popular anger has arisen in the country with as many as 80,000 people taking to the streets across the country in weekly protests every monday . schröder has been greeted by eggs and heckles as much as by cheers since announcing the reforms . predictably , the chancellor 's comments on friday triggered a heated discussion and drove another wedge between schröder and social support groups who have largely denounced the reforms as being " socially unfair " and " forcing people into poverty . " ulrich schneider , head of the paritätisch wohlfahrtsverband , a leading german social welfare support group , told berlin daily tagesspiegel that schröder 's comments " indicate how far the chancellor is removed from the reality of these people , ” who he says have to count every euro and pinch every penny .
thomas broch , who heads german caritas , also lashed out at the chancellor . “ schröder belittles the people who are already on the losing side of society , ” he said . schröder : " bitter reproaches from our children " government spokesman bela anda acted quickly to point out that schröder was only referring to those who don ’ t need government support , but get it anyway .
he stressed that applied as much to higher upper income groups who claim more than their share from government as it does to middle-income and lower-income people . the negative reactions seem to have caught the government and supporters of reform off-guard , especially since the chancellor had made similar comments throughout his fight to trim the welfare state and loosen labor laws . several influential social democratic politicians have come to the chancellor ’ s defense .
rainer wend , chairman of the bundestag ’ s committee for economics and labor , said the chancellor ’ s remarks were “ dead on ” and derided the outcry as " good old fashioned feigned fury " , noting that the critique applies just as well to wealthy citizens who exploit tax loopholes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- chairwoman angela merkel support for the chancellor has also poured in from the opposition camp .
“ there is certainly a tendency that some people have found they can live fairly well by relying on the social system and doing a bit of undocumented work on the side , ” angela merkel , head of the conservative christian democratic union party told a television station .
she added that people who truly need help often don ’ t apply for welfare . for his part , schröder again defended labor market reforms on friday , saying they were necessary if germany was to deal with the challenges of an ageing population and high labor costs , without imposing an excessive burden on future generations .

“ no welfare state can reasonably expect to manage such a burden , ” he added . the chancellor underlined that the public at large realizes that the social system has to change , but that it has balked when confronted with concrete changes that impact them directly , and called for citizens to accept what he said was the inevitable . chancellor far removed from reality ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of protestors march against reforms in leipzig his comments follow weeks of protests , particularly in former communist eastern germany , over tough welfare cuts that will introduce stringent means testing on those claiming unemployment benefits and will make people with a certain level of savings ineligible for welfare . popular anger has arisen in the country with as many as 80,000 people taking to the streets across the country in weekly protests every monday . schröder has been greeted by eggs and heckles as much as by cheers since announcing the reforms . predictably , the chancellor 's comments on friday triggered a heated discussion and drove another wedge between schröder and social support groups who have largely denounced the reforms as being " socially unfair " and " forcing people into poverty .

rainer wend , chairman of the bundestag ’ s committee for economics and labor , said the chancellor ’ s remarks were “ dead on ” and derided the outcry as " good old fashioned feigned fury " , noting that the critique applies just as well to wealthy citizens who exploit tax loopholes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- chairwoman angela merkel support for the chancellor has also poured in from the opposition camp .

the report showed which countries have the least red-tape and where it 's easiest to become an entrepreneur . this is the second year the world bank has issued rankings on business environment indicators : more than 3,000 local experts investigated practices in 145 nations , asking whether it was easy or difficult to start a small or medium-size business and whether administrations made it hard to hire and fire . among the other things compared were hiring and firing practices , how easy it was to register property , the ease of contract enforcement , and - for the first time in 2003 - the property registration process and to what extent investors were protected . of the industrial countries , new zealand , australia and norway came out on top .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 18.09.2004 cutting through the red tape großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paperwork and red tape hinders economic growth , says the report the world bank 's " doing business in 2005 " report on business practices and bureaucracy shows many countries , germany included , are stifling growth and enterprise by wrapping simple procedures in masses of red tape . the world bank 's report , “ doing business in 2005 : removing obstacles to growth , ” looked at the levels of bureaucracy businesses face in 145 countries .
the report showed which countries have the least red-tape and where it 's easiest to become an entrepreneur . this is the second year the world bank has issued rankings on business environment indicators : more than 3,000 local experts investigated practices in 145 nations , asking whether it was easy or difficult to start a small or medium-size business and whether administrations made it hard to hire and fire . among the other things compared were hiring and firing practices , how easy it was to register property , the ease of contract enforcement , and - for the first time in 2003 - the property registration process and to what extent investors were protected . of the industrial countries , new zealand , australia and norway came out on top .
but where was germany , a country famed throughout the world for doing things by the book ? german procedures take twice as long it takes a businessman in finland three simple procedures and two weeks to turn his idea into a company .
german competitors , however , have to spend 45 days wading through nine procedures , twice as long as the world average .
that kind of bureaucratic hassle meant germany was n't among the top twenty . gabi beermeister , a young woman who runs a small kiosk in berlin , told dw-world german bureaucracy was getting worse . " selling bread rolls , cigarettes and sweets required a special catering permit , so i applied to the health authorities , " she said .
" but they asked for so many things - architect drawings of the business premises , a permit from the building authorities , letters of approval from banks … i simply gave up . " german government claims successes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement .
although germany ranked only slightly better than mediocre in the " doing business in 2005 " report , germany ’ s minister of commerce wolfgang clement told the handelsblatt newspaper that the report didn ’ t do germany justice .
he pointed out 2003 reforms , like the " hours of trading act " , which simplified trade guild rules and improved workplace regulations . meanwhile , the german ministry of justice has been searching the german law books for unnecessary regulations in a bid to streamline procedures .
two hundred laws and by-laws need to be abolished , found the ministry . bureaucratic countries pay a high price an easy business climate has many benefits , michael klein told dw-world .
he believes that the easier it is to start a new company , the higher the chances of reducing unemployment and spurring the economy . " we find that 25 percent of the countries that have the most complicated and bureaucratic regulations tend to grow roughly 2 percent less per year than the countries that have easy and well-structured regulations , " klein said . this knowledge has certainly prompted many european nations , not just germany , to tackle reform .
" most of the reform-stimulus has come from the eu , " said klein .
" the accession countries felt they should improve their business environment , slovakia ahead of all of them .
but also within the eu , a number of countries - spain , portugal , finland and belgium - have improved business regulations . " move to botswana ? the " doing business in 2005 " report follows the standard world bank line : economic liberalization and the opening of local markets comes with large payoffs .
as proof of that , michael klein pointed to turkey and france , both of which saw new business registration increase by 18 percent after the governments reduced the time and cost of starting a business . in the end , the report does , indirectly , offer a solution to german businessmen and women interested in a business friendly investment climate : they should move … to botswana . peter zimmerman -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german egovernment initiative off to a slow start the eu would like its citizens to use personal computers to do taxes and complete bureacratic formalities .
but apart from a successful egovernment project in bremen , germany still lags behind on an eu level .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.09.2004 schröder says germans abuse state system großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under fire again over controversial reform comments amid continuing protests over benefit cuts , chancellor schröder has sharply criticized his countrymen who he says take more than their fair share of state allowances .
the comments have raised the ire of social groups . german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s interview in the guter rat consumer magazine on friday echoes statements he ’ s made throughout the summer as he tries to hammer through controversial reforms to the country ’ s cumbersome social welfare state . " in both the east and the west , there 's a mentality which extends well into the middle class that you should claim state allowances wherever you can get them , even when there 's an adequate income in the family , " schröder told the magazine .
“ no welfare state can reasonably expect to manage such a burden , ” he added . the chancellor underlined that the public at large realizes that the social system has to change , but that it has balked when confronted with concrete changes that impact them directly , and called for citizens to accept what he said was the inevitable . chancellor far removed from reality ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of protestors march against reforms in leipzig his comments follow weeks of protests , particularly in former communist eastern germany , over tough welfare cuts that will introduce stringent means testing on those claiming unemployment benefits and will make people with a certain level of savings ineligible for welfare . popular anger has arisen in the country with as many as 80,000 people taking to the streets across the country in weekly protests every monday . schröder has been greeted by eggs and heckles as much as by cheers since announcing the reforms . predictably , the chancellor 's comments on friday triggered a heated discussion and drove another wedge between schröder and social support groups who have largely denounced the reforms as being " socially unfair " and " forcing people into poverty . " ulrich schneider , head of the paritätisch wohlfahrtsverband , a leading german social welfare support group , told berlin daily tagesspiegel that schröder 's comments " indicate how far the chancellor is removed from the reality of these people , ” who he says have to count every euro and pinch every penny .
thomas broch , who heads german caritas , also lashed out at the chancellor . “ schröder belittles the people who are already on the losing side of society , ” he said . schröder : " bitter reproaches from our children " government spokesman bela anda acted quickly to point out that schröder was only referring to those who don ’ t need government support , but get it anyway .
he stressed that applied as much to higher upper income groups who claim more than their share from government as it does to middle-income and lower-income people . the negative reactions seem to have caught the government and supporters of reform off-guard , especially since the chancellor had made similar comments throughout his fight to trim the welfare state and loosen labor laws . several influential social democratic politicians have come to the chancellor ’ s defense .
rainer wend , chairman of the bundestag ’ s committee for economics and labor , said the chancellor ’ s remarks were “ dead on ” and derided the outcry as " good old fashioned feigned fury " , noting that the critique applies just as well to wealthy citizens who exploit tax loopholes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- chairwoman angela merkel support for the chancellor has also poured in from the opposition camp .
“ there is certainly a tendency that some people have found they can live fairly well by relying on the social system and doing a bit of undocumented work on the side , ” angela merkel , head of the conservative christian democratic union party told a television station .
she added that people who truly need help often don ’ t apply for welfare . for his part , schröder again defended labor market reforms on friday , saying they were necessary if germany was to deal with the challenges of an ageing population and high labor costs , without imposing an excessive burden on future generations . " i am convinced that if we do n't start the reform process and conclude it within a decade , we will have to face bitter reproaches from our children and grandchildren , " he said . steve zwick -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reform anger could turn violent a series of violent incidents related to anger at the german government 's welfare reforms have some worried that widespread discontent among the populace could lead a surge in aggressive and illegal behavior .
-lrb- august 28 , 2004 -rrb- protests turn ugly as eggs and insults fly the wave of protests against the german government 's proposed welfare and job market reforms took a nasty turn on tuesday as chancellor gerhard schröder ran the gauntlet of public unrest in the east of the country .

" the eu will notably seek reassurances that the final text will not include a controversial proposal to criminalize adultery , which was floated by the government this month but later withdrawn amid sharp protests from brussels .
the squabble over the legal status of adultery paralyzed debates on the reform package in the turkish parliament and left turkey-eu ties badly shaken . " it now depends on the answer i will get from ankara ...
in any case , that will have an impact , i have to make it very clear , " the commissioner stressed . however , verheugen refused to say whether a failure to adopt the penal reforms would necessarily lead to a negative recommendation from brussels .
" that , i will tell the commission .
i will not tell it today , " he said . turkey committed to reforms turkey 's ambassador , oguz demiralp , meanwhile insisted that ankara , an eu candidate since 1999 , remained committed to its eu-minded reform program . the " turkish government and turkish parliament are very much committed to the continuation of the reform process .
of course all the reforms will be adopted , " demiralp told reporters . verheugen , who is a strong supporter of turkey 's eu bid , emphasized that " the problem of the adoption of the penal code ranks prominent " in the debate over ankara 's readiness to join the bloc .
" it has to do with the question whether turkey has already established a rule of law sufficiently and in accordance with european standards and ... whether fundamental rights and freedoms are properly implemented and respected in turkey .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 18.09.2004 paris , brussels put brakes on nato mission in iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's training of iraqi military officers remains uncertain nato ’ s plans to expand its training mission in iraq have met with resistance .
france and belgium have raised doubts over the project 's funding and its relationship to the wider us mission in the country . disagreement overshadowed a nato defense ministers meeting in the dutch seaside resort of noordwijk on friday aimed at discussing launching a training academy for senior iraqi military officers in iraq . the crucial deal on the training mission has the potential of settling almost two years of tension between the united states and some of its european partners over nato 's role in iraq .
the organization had already agreed to launch the training mission back in june . the major stumbling block had been opposition from paris , which had previously objected to operations inside iraq under a nato flag .
diplomats say france , which refuses to send any forces into iraq itself , has no problems with the technical aspects of the mission but wants to know what the added value of it would be . french defense minister michele alliot-marie said the foreign ministry in paris was still considering its options .
" we in france continue to believe that this training should be done outside iraq , " alliot-marie told reporters .
" iraq has to find its own sense of identity and i do n't think the addition of more foreigners in uniform will help that . "
if they were going in , she said the mission should remain " as low-profile as possible . " under a deal worked out among nato 's 26 member nations , it ’ s been suggested that the mission would report to the us officer in command of training operations in iraq .
a french diplomat said france wanted more assurances , however , that the officer would be answerable to the alliance .
in other words , there are fears that the alliance will end up being subordinate to the us-led coalition .
nato already has some 40 soldiers in iraq who began training army officers in collaboration with the defense ministry in baghdad .
the issue of the command structure led to a stormy debate in july . de hoop scheffer hopeful of deal nato general secretary jaap de hoop scheffer admitted friday that member states could n't see eye to eye on the issue .
" as it stands now , all 26 allies are n't completely satisfied , " de hoop scheffer said on the sidelines of the meeting . at the same time de hoop scheffer played down the differences and said he was optimistic that a compromise could be reached soon .
he insisted the differences were not " substantial " and included details of the training mission 's relationship with the much wider us mission to rebuild a new 260,000-strong iraqi army , and the question of protection for the alliance instructors . the north atlantic council , nato 's top decision-making body , will meet monday to re-examine the proposals .
british defense secretary geoff hoon was of the opinion that an agreement on the iraq issue was virtually in the bag .
and other officials insisted that the alliance “ is nearing agreement ” . doubts over funding but french reservations over the question of nato 's allegiance in iraq is n't the only issue causing argument among nato 's ranks . officials say that belgium balked at agreement because of problems it has with the project ’ s funding structure .
a belgian foreign ministry spokesman said they wanted to know who ’ s paying for what .
the operation is likely to be paid for from a mix of common nato funding and national financing . as plans stand now , around 300 nato instructors are to be sent to iraq to set up a training center for iraqi officers outside baghdad .
germany , france , belgium and now also spain have agreed that they will not send soldiers to iraq , but rather support the training of iraqi military and officials outside the country . although several of the nato allies have individually sent troops to join the us-led coalition , objections from france and germany had previously prevented the alliance taking a collective role in iraq , apart from offering logistical support to a polish-led multinational force of 6,000 troops operating in the center of the country . however , france , germany and the other allies agreed in june at a nato summit in istanbul to the creation of an alliance training mission for iraq . driving instructors and vehicle maintenance units german defense minister peter struck told reporters friday that the german army would train iraqis in the united arab emirates -lrb- uae -rrb- as driving instructors and also teach them how to carry out vehicle maintenance .
germany would also provide the vehicles needed for the purpose .
further training on mine-clearance would likely be carried out in germany , he said . germany had previously limited its training to iraqi police units .
struck told reporters german officials had drawn up the training plan after talks with iraqi counterparts in the uae . " for germany , this still means that there will be no single german soldier on the ground in iraq , " struck stressed . ben fajzullin -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de training role for nato troops in baghdad after meeting for the sixth time in three days , nato members finally agreed to send a small contingent of troops to iraq to train the country 's armed forces and help rebuild its military infrastructure .

france and belgium have raised doubts over the project 's funding and its relationship to the wider us mission in the country . disagreement overshadowed a nato defense ministers meeting in the dutch seaside resort of noordwijk on friday aimed at discussing launching a training academy for senior iraqi military officers in iraq . the crucial deal on the training mission has the potential of settling almost two years of tension between the united states and some of its european partners over nato 's role in iraq .
the organization had already agreed to launch the training mission back in june . the major stumbling block had been opposition from paris , which had previously objected to operations inside iraq under a nato flag .
diplomats say france , which refuses to send any forces into iraq itself , has no problems with the technical aspects of the mission but wants to know what the added value of it would be . french defense minister michele alliot-marie said the foreign ministry in paris was still considering its options .
" we in france continue to believe that this training should be done outside iraq , " alliot-marie told reporters .
" iraq has to find its own sense of identity and i do n't think the addition of more foreigners in uniform will help that . "
if they were going in , she said the mission should remain " as low-profile as possible . " under a deal worked out among nato 's 26 member nations , it ’ s been suggested that the mission would report to the us officer in command of training operations in iraq .
a french diplomat said france wanted more assurances , however , that the officer would be answerable to the alliance .
in other words , there are fears that the alliance will end up being subordinate to the us-led coalition .
nato already has some 40 soldiers in iraq who began training army officers in collaboration with the defense ministry in baghdad .
the issue of the command structure led to a stormy debate in july . de hoop scheffer hopeful of deal nato general secretary jaap de hoop scheffer admitted friday that member states could n't see eye to eye on the issue .
" as it stands now , all 26 allies are n't completely satisfied , " de hoop scheffer said on the sidelines of the meeting . at the same time de hoop scheffer played down the differences and said he was optimistic that a compromise could be reached soon .
he insisted the differences were not " substantial " and included details of the training mission 's relationship with the much wider us mission to rebuild a new 260,000-strong iraqi army , and the question of protection for the alliance instructors . the north atlantic council , nato 's top decision-making body , will meet monday to re-examine the proposals .
british defense secretary geoff hoon was of the opinion that an agreement on the iraq issue was virtually in the bag .
and other officials insisted that the alliance “ is nearing agreement ” . doubts over funding but french reservations over the question of nato 's allegiance in iraq is n't the only issue causing argument among nato 's ranks . officials say that belgium balked at agreement because of problems it has with the project ’ s funding structure .
a belgian foreign ministry spokesman said they wanted to know who ’ s paying for what .
the operation is likely to be paid for from a mix of common nato funding and national financing . as plans stand now , around 300 nato instructors are to be sent to iraq to set up a training center for iraqi officers outside baghdad .
germany , france , belgium and now also spain have agreed that they will not send soldiers to iraq , but rather support the training of iraqi military and officials outside the country . although several of the nato allies have individually sent troops to join the us-led coalition , objections from france and germany had previously prevented the alliance taking a collective role in iraq , apart from offering logistical support to a polish-led multinational force of 6,000 troops operating in the center of the country . however , france , germany and the other allies agreed in june at a nato summit in istanbul to the creation of an alliance training mission for iraq . driving instructors and vehicle maintenance units german defense minister peter struck told reporters friday that the german army would train iraqis in the united arab emirates -lrb- uae -rrb- as driving instructors and also teach them how to carry out vehicle maintenance .
germany would also provide the vehicles needed for the purpose .

" that requires clarification , " verheugen said , warning that failure to pass the bill by october 6 " will have an impact " on a crucial report from the european commission due out that date on whether to start accession talks with ankara . verheugen strictly ruled out the possibility of delaying next month 's report , which is to serve as a basis for eu leaders to decide on december 17 on whether to set a date for the start of eu membership talks with turkey . " i have no intention , i am strictly against , i do n't see any reason why we should delay the report " , he told reporters . bill a key element of reform process the turkish parliament went into recess saturday until october 1 , leaving the crucial penal code reform package in limbo and unlikely to be enacted before the report 's release . eu officials have warned that the bill aimed at overhauling the country 's 78-year-old criminal code was a key element of turkey 's efforts to meet european democracy and human rights standards .
" so far our assessment was based on the assumption that the penal code would be adopted before the commission makes its decision , " verheugen told reporters .
" i have asked the ambassador to get clarification from his government whether and when the penal code will be adopted and whether it will be substantially changed . " the eu will notably seek reassurances that the final text will not include a controversial proposal to criminalize adultery , which was floated by the government this month but later withdrawn amid sharp protests from brussels .
the squabble over the legal status of adultery paralyzed debates on the reform package in the turkish parliament and left turkey-eu ties badly shaken . " it now depends on the answer i will get from ankara ...
in any case , that will have an impact , i have to make it very clear , " the commissioner stressed . however , verheugen refused to say whether a failure to adopt the penal reforms would necessarily lead to a negative recommendation from brussels .
" that , i will tell the commission .
i will not tell it today , " he said . turkey committed to reforms turkey 's ambassador , oguz demiralp , meanwhile insisted that ankara , an eu candidate since 1999 , remained committed to its eu-minded reform program . the " turkish government and turkish parliament are very much committed to the continuation of the reform process .
of course all the reforms will be adopted , " demiralp told reporters . verheugen , who is a strong supporter of turkey 's eu bid , emphasized that " the problem of the adoption of the penal code ranks prominent " in the debate over ankara 's readiness to join the bloc .
" it has to do with the question whether turkey has already established a rule of law sufficiently and in accordance with european standards and ... whether fundamental rights and freedoms are properly implemented and respected in turkey . " " therefore the penal code is really an essential part of the process of political reforms in turkey , " verheugen added . afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de waiting for eu many members of the turkish-german community are n't exactly sure what turkey 's membership in the eu would mean for them personally .

in an interview with deutsche welle , turkish pm tayyip erdogan said the country was on track . dw : on october 6th the european union commission is due to announce when and if membership talks with your country can take place .
what do you think brussels will decide ? recep tayyip erdogan : we are doing everything we can to influence this process in a positive way and to fulfill the criteria issued in copenhagen for accession talks .
at this point there are no problems with legislation on reforms .
when i asked mr. verheugen -lrb- eu enlargement commissioner -rrb- during his last visit here what we had to do to complete this legislation , he answered that turkey had already done everything , but that there were still problems with implementation .
we know that too , because implementation requires a change in mentality .
that 's part of a process and we are making every effort to push this process forward as fast as possible . while the eu commissioner was here , he was presented with reports from human rights organizations that say systematic torture continues in turkey .
is that charge baseless or unfair ? these allegations are completely unjustified .
they are totally groundless charges .
our ministry launched an immediate investigation .
and we have also been conducting inquiries into who initiated these accusations .
unfortunately , it is charges of this nature which are hindering turkey 's attempts to integrate into europe .
and i have the impression that 's something verheugen is all too aware of .
we have a zero-tolerance policy on the issue of torture .
systematic torture is unthinkable in a democratic system . up until now it 's been viewed as an open secret in brussels that on october 6th the eu commission would say yes to opening membership talks .
now a dispute has unfolded concerning proposed reforms to the turkish penal code which have since been put on hold .
where do things stand now ?
will the penal code be reformed , and when will the reforms become law ? turkey 's new criminal law is not part of the copenhagen criteria .
just as the draft legislation for reforms to the regional courts of appeal , or the new code for criminal procedure or the penal code , are not part of the copenhagen criteria .
these are steps we are taking as preparatory measures for moving towards the european union .
and it should not be forgotten that at this point there is only a common european constitution , but the eu has no common code of criminal law .
we are undertaking this reform of criminal law on our own initiative .
and i 'm convinced that 's something our european friends will appreciate . even so , the section which would make adultery a criminal offence is especially controversial .
is that something that is essential for you , or could you take that section out of the reform package if brussels were to insist on it ? this new law comprises a total of 346 paragraphs - and as such it is not necessarily so easy to appraise from a distance .
it would be unwise to restrict the discussion to the issue of adultery .
for us in the justice and development party , traditions are very important .
we stand for conservative values .
these principles are written in our party political program and are part of my government 's stated policy goals .
that is the aim of this article of law .
it 's intended to protect and strengthen the family .
the family is the most dynamic factor in turkish society .
moreover , this article of law was on the statutes between 1926 and 1996 at which time it was directed against women .
however , the new law foresees that if anyone brings a charge on grounds of infidelity and it comes to a court judgment , men and women shall be treated equally and the punishment shall be appropriate . is brussels exerting too much pressure ? no-one has raised that issue with me .

france and belgium have raised doubts over the project 's funding and its relationship to the wider us mission in the country . disagreement overshadowed a nato defense ministers meeting in the dutch seaside resort of noordwijk on friday aimed at discussing launching a training academy for senior iraqi military officers in iraq . the crucial deal on the training mission has the potential of settling almost two years of tension between the united states and some of its european partners over nato 's role in iraq .
the organization had already agreed to launch the training mission back in june . the major stumbling block had been opposition from paris , which had previously objected to operations inside iraq under a nato flag .
diplomats say france , which refuses to send any forces into iraq itself , has no problems with the technical aspects of the mission but wants to know what the added value of it would be . french defense minister michele alliot-marie said the foreign ministry in paris was still considering its options .
" we in france continue to believe that this training should be done outside iraq , " alliot-marie told reporters .
" iraq has to find its own sense of identity and i do n't think the addition of more foreigners in uniform will help that . "
if they were going in , she said the mission should remain " as low-profile as possible . " under a deal worked out among nato 's 26 member nations , it ’ s been suggested that the mission would report to the us officer in command of training operations in iraq .
a french diplomat said france wanted more assurances , however , that the officer would be answerable to the alliance .
in other words , there are fears that the alliance will end up being subordinate to the us-led coalition .
nato already has some 40 soldiers in iraq who began training army officers in collaboration with the defense ministry in baghdad .
the issue of the command structure led to a stormy debate in july . de hoop scheffer hopeful of deal nato general secretary jaap de hoop scheffer admitted friday that member states could n't see eye to eye on the issue .
" as it stands now , all 26 allies are n't completely satisfied , " de hoop scheffer said on the sidelines of the meeting . at the same time de hoop scheffer played down the differences and said he was optimistic that a compromise could be reached soon .
he insisted the differences were not " substantial " and included details of the training mission 's relationship with the much wider us mission to rebuild a new 260,000-strong iraqi army , and the question of protection for the alliance instructors . the north atlantic council , nato 's top decision-making body , will meet monday to re-examine the proposals .
british defense secretary geoff hoon was of the opinion that an agreement on the iraq issue was virtually in the bag .
and other officials insisted that the alliance “ is nearing agreement ” . doubts over funding but french reservations over the question of nato 's allegiance in iraq is n't the only issue causing argument among nato 's ranks . officials say that belgium balked at agreement because of problems it has with the project ’ s funding structure .
a belgian foreign ministry spokesman said they wanted to know who ’ s paying for what .
the operation is likely to be paid for from a mix of common nato funding and national financing . as plans stand now , around 300 nato instructors are to be sent to iraq to set up a training center for iraqi officers outside baghdad .
germany , france , belgium and now also spain have agreed that they will not send soldiers to iraq , but rather support the training of iraqi military and officials outside the country . although several of the nato allies have individually sent troops to join the us-led coalition , objections from france and germany had previously prevented the alliance taking a collective role in iraq , apart from offering logistical support to a polish-led multinational force of 6,000 troops operating in the center of the country . however , france , germany and the other allies agreed in june at a nato summit in istanbul to the creation of an alliance training mission for iraq . driving instructors and vehicle maintenance units german defense minister peter struck told reporters friday that the german army would train iraqis in the united arab emirates -lrb- uae -rrb- as driving instructors and also teach them how to carry out vehicle maintenance .
germany would also provide the vehicles needed for the purpose .
further training on mine-clearance would likely be carried out in germany , he said . germany had previously limited its training to iraqi police units .
struck told reporters german officials had drawn up the training plan after talks with iraqi counterparts in the uae .

in an interview with deutsche welle , turkish pm tayyip erdogan said the country was on track . dw : on october 6th the european union commission is due to announce when and if membership talks with your country can take place .
what do you think brussels will decide ? recep tayyip erdogan : we are doing everything we can to influence this process in a positive way and to fulfill the criteria issued in copenhagen for accession talks .
at this point there are no problems with legislation on reforms .
when i asked mr. verheugen -lrb- eu enlargement commissioner -rrb- during his last visit here what we had to do to complete this legislation , he answered that turkey had already done everything , but that there were still problems with implementation .
we know that too , because implementation requires a change in mentality .
that 's part of a process and we are making every effort to push this process forward as fast as possible . while the eu commissioner was here , he was presented with reports from human rights organizations that say systematic torture continues in turkey .
is that charge baseless or unfair ? these allegations are completely unjustified .
they are totally groundless charges .
our ministry launched an immediate investigation .
and we have also been conducting inquiries into who initiated these accusations .
unfortunately , it is charges of this nature which are hindering turkey 's attempts to integrate into europe .
and i have the impression that 's something verheugen is all too aware of .
we have a zero-tolerance policy on the issue of torture .
systematic torture is unthinkable in a democratic system . up until now it 's been viewed as an open secret in brussels that on october 6th the eu commission would say yes to opening membership talks .
now a dispute has unfolded concerning proposed reforms to the turkish penal code which have since been put on hold .
where do things stand now ?
will the penal code be reformed , and when will the reforms become law ? turkey 's new criminal law is not part of the copenhagen criteria .
just as the draft legislation for reforms to the regional courts of appeal , or the new code for criminal procedure or the penal code , are not part of the copenhagen criteria .
these are steps we are taking as preparatory measures for moving towards the european union .
and it should not be forgotten that at this point there is only a common european constitution , but the eu has no common code of criminal law .
we are undertaking this reform of criminal law on our own initiative .
and i 'm convinced that 's something our european friends will appreciate . even so , the section which would make adultery a criminal offence is especially controversial .
is that something that is essential for you , or could you take that section out of the reform package if brussels were to insist on it ? this new law comprises a total of 346 paragraphs - and as such it is not necessarily so easy to appraise from a distance .
it would be unwise to restrict the discussion to the issue of adultery .
for us in the justice and development party , traditions are very important .
we stand for conservative values .
these principles are written in our party political program and are part of my government 's stated policy goals .
that is the aim of this article of law .
it 's intended to protect and strengthen the family .
the family is the most dynamic factor in turkish society .
moreover , this article of law was on the statutes between 1926 and 1996 at which time it was directed against women .
however , the new law foresees that if anyone brings a charge on grounds of infidelity and it comes to a court judgment , men and women shall be treated equally and the punishment shall be appropriate . is brussels exerting too much pressure ? no-one has raised that issue with me .
when mr. verheugen was here , i put the following question to him : does turkey need to do more ?
he answered ' no ' , but he did say that there were clear failings in the implementation of the reforms .
we 're aware of that too .
and we also discussed the issue of adultery .
mr verheugen said that this issue had nothing to do with the commission 's progress report .
he did , however , say that the topic of adultery could influence the decisions on when to begin talks .
i think we should now end this debate .
there are 25 eu members , not all of which fulfill the copenhagen criteria .
nonetheless , they are members of the european union . german conservative opposition leader angela merkel has written a letter to political leaders across europe in which she lobbied against full membership for turkey and instead pushed for a ' privileged partnership ' for your country .
you and your akp party are also members of the conservative camp - are you disappointed in miss merkel ? i find it hard to understand miss merkel .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : turkey 's eu moment of truth verheugen : no more obstacles to talks with turkey capturing turkish culture 's changing face waiting for eu erdogan : " we have done our homework " europe -pipe- 18.09.2004 " a change in mentality is needed " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister erdogan says turkey is doing its best to meet entry criteria the eu commission is to publish a key report on october 6 on whether ankara is ready to open talks on joining the eu .
in an interview with deutsche welle , turkish pm tayyip erdogan said the country was on track . dw : on october 6th the european union commission is due to announce when and if membership talks with your country can take place .
what do you think brussels will decide ? recep tayyip erdogan : we are doing everything we can to influence this process in a positive way and to fulfill the criteria issued in copenhagen for accession talks .
at this point there are no problems with legislation on reforms .
when i asked mr. verheugen -lrb- eu enlargement commissioner -rrb- during his last visit here what we had to do to complete this legislation , he answered that turkey had already done everything , but that there were still problems with implementation .
we know that too , because implementation requires a change in mentality .
that 's part of a process and we are making every effort to push this process forward as fast as possible . while the eu commissioner was here , he was presented with reports from human rights organizations that say systematic torture continues in turkey .
is that charge baseless or unfair ? these allegations are completely unjustified .
they are totally groundless charges .
our ministry launched an immediate investigation .
and we have also been conducting inquiries into who initiated these accusations .
unfortunately , it is charges of this nature which are hindering turkey 's attempts to integrate into europe .
and i have the impression that 's something verheugen is all too aware of .
we have a zero-tolerance policy on the issue of torture .
systematic torture is unthinkable in a democratic system . up until now it 's been viewed as an open secret in brussels that on october 6th the eu commission would say yes to opening membership talks .
now a dispute has unfolded concerning proposed reforms to the turkish penal code which have since been put on hold .
where do things stand now ?
will the penal code be reformed , and when will the reforms become law ? turkey 's new criminal law is not part of the copenhagen criteria .
just as the draft legislation for reforms to the regional courts of appeal , or the new code for criminal procedure or the penal code , are not part of the copenhagen criteria .
these are steps we are taking as preparatory measures for moving towards the european union .
and it should not be forgotten that at this point there is only a common european constitution , but the eu has no common code of criminal law .
we are undertaking this reform of criminal law on our own initiative .
and i 'm convinced that 's something our european friends will appreciate . even so , the section which would make adultery a criminal offence is especially controversial .
is that something that is essential for you , or could you take that section out of the reform package if brussels were to insist on it ? this new law comprises a total of 346 paragraphs - and as such it is not necessarily so easy to appraise from a distance .
it would be unwise to restrict the discussion to the issue of adultery .
for us in the justice and development party , traditions are very important .
we stand for conservative values .
these principles are written in our party political program and are part of my government 's stated policy goals .
that is the aim of this article of law .
it 's intended to protect and strengthen the family .
the family is the most dynamic factor in turkish society .
moreover , this article of law was on the statutes between 1926 and 1996 at which time it was directed against women .
however , the new law foresees that if anyone brings a charge on grounds of infidelity and it comes to a court judgment , men and women shall be treated equally and the punishment shall be appropriate . is brussels exerting too much pressure ? no-one has raised that issue with me .
when mr. verheugen was here , i put the following question to him : does turkey need to do more ?
he answered ' no ' , but he did say that there were clear failings in the implementation of the reforms .
we 're aware of that too .
and we also discussed the issue of adultery .
mr verheugen said that this issue had nothing to do with the commission 's progress report .
he did , however , say that the topic of adultery could influence the decisions on when to begin talks .
i think we should now end this debate .
there are 25 eu members , not all of which fulfill the copenhagen criteria .
nonetheless , they are members of the european union . german conservative opposition leader angela merkel has written a letter to political leaders across europe in which she lobbied against full membership for turkey and instead pushed for a ' privileged partnership ' for your country .
you and your akp party are also members of the conservative camp - are you disappointed in miss merkel ? i find it hard to understand miss merkel .
and she is calling for understanding in our discussions . a privileged partnership is unthinkable in the eu . any nation that fulfills the copenhagen criteria can start membership talks . but we are not yet talking about full membership here , rather commencing negotiations on terms of entry . therefore we need a fair decision to set the process of negotiations in motion . if this process does not get underway , we will draw our own conclusions from this and take the necessary steps . i would like to stress that we are pushing for the fulfillment of the copenhagen criteria in the interests of our own people . but if there were really to be a negative decision , which i do n't believe there will be , then we will call this the ankara criteria and continue on our own path . the interview was conducted by alexander kudascheff send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu wants turkey to explain withdrawal of bill european union enlargement commissioner guenter verheugen on saturday called on turkey to clarify its decision to withdraw a key bill reforming its penal code , during talks with turkey 's eu ambassador .

" that requires clarification , " verheugen said , warning that failure to pass the bill by october 6 " will have an impact " on a crucial report from the european commission due out that date on whether to start accession talks with ankara . verheugen strictly ruled out the possibility of delaying next month 's report , which is to serve as a basis for eu leaders to decide on december 17 on whether to set a date for the start of eu membership talks with turkey . " i have no intention , i am strictly against , i do n't see any reason why we should delay the report " , he told reporters . bill a key element of reform process the turkish parliament went into recess saturday until october 1 , leaving the crucial penal code reform package in limbo and unlikely to be enacted before the report 's release . eu officials have warned that the bill aimed at overhauling the country 's 78-year-old criminal code was a key element of turkey 's efforts to meet european democracy and human rights standards .
" so far our assessment was based on the assumption that the penal code would be adopted before the commission makes its decision , " verheugen told reporters .
" i have asked the ambassador to get clarification from his government whether and when the penal code will be adopted and whether it will be substantially changed . " the eu will notably seek reassurances that the final text will not include a controversial proposal to criminalize adultery , which was floated by the government this month but later withdrawn amid sharp protests from brussels .
the squabble over the legal status of adultery paralyzed debates on the reform package in the turkish parliament and left turkey-eu ties badly shaken . " it now depends on the answer i will get from ankara ...
in any case , that will have an impact , i have to make it very clear , " the commissioner stressed . however , verheugen refused to say whether a failure to adopt the penal reforms would necessarily lead to a negative recommendation from brussels .
" that , i will tell the commission .
i will not tell it today , " he said . turkey committed to reforms turkey 's ambassador , oguz demiralp , meanwhile insisted that ankara , an eu candidate since 1999 , remained committed to its eu-minded reform program . the " turkish government and turkish parliament are very much committed to the continuation of the reform process .
of course all the reforms will be adopted , " demiralp told reporters . verheugen , who is a strong supporter of turkey 's eu bid , emphasized that " the problem of the adoption of the penal code ranks prominent " in the debate over ankara 's readiness to join the bloc .
" it has to do with the question whether turkey has already established a rule of law sufficiently and in accordance with european standards and ... whether fundamental rights and freedoms are properly implemented and respected in turkey . " " therefore the penal code is really an essential part of the process of political reforms in turkey , " verheugen added . afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de waiting for eu many members of the turkish-german community are n't exactly sure what turkey 's membership in the eu would mean for them personally .

" that requires clarification , " verheugen said , warning that failure to pass the bill by october 6 " will have an impact " on a crucial report from the european commission due out that date on whether to start accession talks with ankara . verheugen strictly ruled out the possibility of delaying next month 's report , which is to serve as a basis for eu leaders to decide on december 17 on whether to set a date for the start of eu membership talks with turkey . " i have no intention , i am strictly against , i do n't see any reason why we should delay the report " , he told reporters . bill a key element of reform process the turkish parliament went into recess saturday until october 1 , leaving the crucial penal code reform package in limbo and unlikely to be enacted before the report 's release . eu officials have warned that the bill aimed at overhauling the country 's 78-year-old criminal code was a key element of turkey 's efforts to meet european democracy and human rights standards .
" so far our assessment was based on the assumption that the penal code would be adopted before the commission makes its decision , " verheugen told reporters .
" i have asked the ambassador to get clarification from his government whether and when the penal code will be adopted and whether it will be substantially changed . " the eu will notably seek reassurances that the final text will not include a controversial proposal to criminalize adultery , which was floated by the government this month but later withdrawn amid sharp protests from brussels .
the squabble over the legal status of adultery paralyzed debates on the reform package in the turkish parliament and left turkey-eu ties badly shaken . " it now depends on the answer i will get from ankara ...
in any case , that will have an impact , i have to make it very clear , " the commissioner stressed . however , verheugen refused to say whether a failure to adopt the penal reforms would necessarily lead to a negative recommendation from brussels .
" that , i will tell the commission .
i will not tell it today , " he said . turkey committed to reforms turkey 's ambassador , oguz demiralp , meanwhile insisted that ankara , an eu candidate since 1999 , remained committed to its eu-minded reform program . the " turkish government and turkish parliament are very much committed to the continuation of the reform process .
of course all the reforms will be adopted , " demiralp told reporters . verheugen , who is a strong supporter of turkey 's eu bid , emphasized that " the problem of the adoption of the penal code ranks prominent " in the debate over ankara 's readiness to join the bloc .
" it has to do with the question whether turkey has already established a rule of law sufficiently and in accordance with european standards and ... whether fundamental rights and freedoms are properly implemented and respected in turkey . " " therefore the penal code is really an essential part of the process of political reforms in turkey , " verheugen added . afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de waiting for eu many members of the turkish-german community are n't exactly sure what turkey 's membership in the eu would mean for them personally .

the report showed which countries have the least red-tape and where it 's easiest to become an entrepreneur . this is the second year the world bank has issued rankings on business environment indicators : more than 3,000 local experts investigated practices in 145 nations , asking whether it was easy or difficult to start a small or medium-size business and whether administrations made it hard to hire and fire . among the other things compared were hiring and firing practices , how easy it was to register property , the ease of contract enforcement , and - for the first time in 2003 - the property registration process and to what extent investors were protected . of the industrial countries , new zealand , australia and norway came out on top .
but where was germany , a country famed throughout the world for doing things by the book ? german procedures take twice as long it takes a businessman in finland three simple procedures and two weeks to turn his idea into a company .
german competitors , however , have to spend 45 days wading through nine procedures , twice as long as the world average .
that kind of bureaucratic hassle meant germany was n't among the top twenty . gabi beermeister , a young woman who runs a small kiosk in berlin , told dw-world german bureaucracy was getting worse . " selling bread rolls , cigarettes and sweets required a special catering permit , so i applied to the health authorities , " she said .
" but they asked for so many things - architect drawings of the business premises , a permit from the building authorities , letters of approval from banks … i simply gave up . " german government claims successes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement .
although germany ranked only slightly better than mediocre in the " doing business in 2005 " report , germany ’ s minister of commerce wolfgang clement told the handelsblatt newspaper that the report didn ’ t do germany justice .
he pointed out 2003 reforms , like the " hours of trading act " , which simplified trade guild rules and improved workplace regulations . meanwhile , the german ministry of justice has been searching the german law books for unnecessary regulations in a bid to streamline procedures .
two hundred laws and by-laws need to be abolished , found the ministry . bureaucratic countries pay a high price an easy business climate has many benefits , michael klein told dw-world .
he believes that the easier it is to start a new company , the higher the chances of reducing unemployment and spurring the economy . " we find that 25 percent of the countries that have the most complicated and bureaucratic regulations tend to grow roughly 2 percent less per year than the countries that have easy and well-structured regulations , " klein said . this knowledge has certainly prompted many european nations , not just germany , to tackle reform .
" most of the reform-stimulus has come from the eu , " said klein .
" the accession countries felt they should improve their business environment , slovakia ahead of all of them .
but also within the eu , a number of countries - spain , portugal , finland and belgium - have improved business regulations . " move to botswana ? the " doing business in 2005 " report follows the standard world bank line : economic liberalization and the opening of local markets comes with large payoffs .
as proof of that , michael klein pointed to turkey and france , both of which saw new business registration increase by 18 percent after the governments reduced the time and cost of starting a business . in the end , the report does , indirectly , offer a solution to german businessmen and women interested in a business friendly investment climate : they should move … to botswana . peter zimmerman -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german egovernment initiative off to a slow start the eu would like its citizens to use personal computers to do taxes and complete bureacratic formalities .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : turkey 's eu moment of truth verheugen : no more obstacles to talks with turkey capturing turkish culture 's changing face waiting for eu erdogan : " we have done our homework " europe -pipe- 18.09.2004 " a change in mentality is needed " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister erdogan says turkey is doing its best to meet entry criteria the eu commission is to publish a key report on october 6 on whether ankara is ready to open talks on joining the eu .
in an interview with deutsche welle , turkish pm tayyip erdogan said the country was on track . dw : on october 6th the european union commission is due to announce when and if membership talks with your country can take place .
what do you think brussels will decide ? recep tayyip erdogan : we are doing everything we can to influence this process in a positive way and to fulfill the criteria issued in copenhagen for accession talks .
at this point there are no problems with legislation on reforms .
when i asked mr. verheugen -lrb- eu enlargement commissioner -rrb- during his last visit here what we had to do to complete this legislation , he answered that turkey had already done everything , but that there were still problems with implementation .
we know that too , because implementation requires a change in mentality .
that 's part of a process and we are making every effort to push this process forward as fast as possible . while the eu commissioner was here , he was presented with reports from human rights organizations that say systematic torture continues in turkey .
is that charge baseless or unfair ? these allegations are completely unjustified .
they are totally groundless charges .
our ministry launched an immediate investigation .
and we have also been conducting inquiries into who initiated these accusations .
unfortunately , it is charges of this nature which are hindering turkey 's attempts to integrate into europe .
and i have the impression that 's something verheugen is all too aware of .
we have a zero-tolerance policy on the issue of torture .
systematic torture is unthinkable in a democratic system . up until now it 's been viewed as an open secret in brussels that on october 6th the eu commission would say yes to opening membership talks .
now a dispute has unfolded concerning proposed reforms to the turkish penal code which have since been put on hold .
where do things stand now ?
will the penal code be reformed , and when will the reforms become law ? turkey 's new criminal law is not part of the copenhagen criteria .
just as the draft legislation for reforms to the regional courts of appeal , or the new code for criminal procedure or the penal code , are not part of the copenhagen criteria .
these are steps we are taking as preparatory measures for moving towards the european union .
and it should not be forgotten that at this point there is only a common european constitution , but the eu has no common code of criminal law .
we are undertaking this reform of criminal law on our own initiative .
and i 'm convinced that 's something our european friends will appreciate . even so , the section which would make adultery a criminal offence is especially controversial .
is that something that is essential for you , or could you take that section out of the reform package if brussels were to insist on it ? this new law comprises a total of 346 paragraphs - and as such it is not necessarily so easy to appraise from a distance .
it would be unwise to restrict the discussion to the issue of adultery .
for us in the justice and development party , traditions are very important .
we stand for conservative values .
these principles are written in our party political program and are part of my government 's stated policy goals .
that is the aim of this article of law .
it 's intended to protect and strengthen the family .
the family is the most dynamic factor in turkish society .
moreover , this article of law was on the statutes between 1926 and 1996 at which time it was directed against women .
however , the new law foresees that if anyone brings a charge on grounds of infidelity and it comes to a court judgment , men and women shall be treated equally and the punishment shall be appropriate . is brussels exerting too much pressure ? no-one has raised that issue with me .
when mr. verheugen was here , i put the following question to him : does turkey need to do more ?
he answered ' no ' , but he did say that there were clear failings in the implementation of the reforms .
we 're aware of that too .
and we also discussed the issue of adultery .
mr verheugen said that this issue had nothing to do with the commission 's progress report .
he did , however , say that the topic of adultery could influence the decisions on when to begin talks .
i think we should now end this debate .
there are 25 eu members , not all of which fulfill the copenhagen criteria .
nonetheless , they are members of the european union . german conservative opposition leader angela merkel has written a letter to political leaders across europe in which she lobbied against full membership for turkey and instead pushed for a ' privileged partnership ' for your country .
you and your akp party are also members of the conservative camp - are you disappointed in miss merkel ? i find it hard to understand miss merkel .
and she is calling for understanding in our discussions . a privileged partnership is unthinkable in the eu . any nation that fulfills the copenhagen criteria can start membership talks . but we are not yet talking about full membership here , rather commencing negotiations on terms of entry . therefore we need a fair decision to set the process of negotiations in motion . if this process does not get underway , we will draw our own conclusions from this and take the necessary steps . i would like to stress that we are pushing for the fulfillment of the copenhagen criteria in the interests of our own people . but if there were really to be a negative decision , which i do n't believe there will be , then we will call this the ankara criteria and continue on our own path . the interview was conducted by alexander kudascheff send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu wants turkey to explain withdrawal of bill european union enlargement commissioner guenter verheugen on saturday called on turkey to clarify its decision to withdraw a key bill reforming its penal code , during talks with turkey 's eu ambassador .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.09.2004 schröder says germans abuse state system großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under fire again over controversial reform comments amid continuing protests over benefit cuts , chancellor schröder has sharply criticized his countrymen who he says take more than their fair share of state allowances .
the comments have raised the ire of social groups . german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s interview in the guter rat consumer magazine on friday echoes statements he ’ s made throughout the summer as he tries to hammer through controversial reforms to the country ’ s cumbersome social welfare state . " in both the east and the west , there 's a mentality which extends well into the middle class that you should claim state allowances wherever you can get them , even when there 's an adequate income in the family , " schröder told the magazine .
“ no welfare state can reasonably expect to manage such a burden , ” he added . the chancellor underlined that the public at large realizes that the social system has to change , but that it has balked when confronted with concrete changes that impact them directly , and called for citizens to accept what he said was the inevitable . chancellor far removed from reality ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of protestors march against reforms in leipzig his comments follow weeks of protests , particularly in former communist eastern germany , over tough welfare cuts that will introduce stringent means testing on those claiming unemployment benefits and will make people with a certain level of savings ineligible for welfare . popular anger has arisen in the country with as many as 80,000 people taking to the streets across the country in weekly protests every monday . schröder has been greeted by eggs and heckles as much as by cheers since announcing the reforms . predictably , the chancellor 's comments on friday triggered a heated discussion and drove another wedge between schröder and social support groups who have largely denounced the reforms as being " socially unfair " and " forcing people into poverty . " ulrich schneider , head of the paritätisch wohlfahrtsverband , a leading german social welfare support group , told berlin daily tagesspiegel that schröder 's comments " indicate how far the chancellor is removed from the reality of these people , ” who he says have to count every euro and pinch every penny .
thomas broch , who heads german caritas , also lashed out at the chancellor . “ schröder belittles the people who are already on the losing side of society , ” he said . schröder : " bitter reproaches from our children " government spokesman bela anda acted quickly to point out that schröder was only referring to those who don ’ t need government support , but get it anyway .
he stressed that applied as much to higher upper income groups who claim more than their share from government as it does to middle-income and lower-income people . the negative reactions seem to have caught the government and supporters of reform off-guard , especially since the chancellor had made similar comments throughout his fight to trim the welfare state and loosen labor laws . several influential social democratic politicians have come to the chancellor ’ s defense .
rainer wend , chairman of the bundestag ’ s committee for economics and labor , said the chancellor ’ s remarks were “ dead on ” and derided the outcry as " good old fashioned feigned fury " , noting that the critique applies just as well to wealthy citizens who exploit tax loopholes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- chairwoman angela merkel support for the chancellor has also poured in from the opposition camp .
“ there is certainly a tendency that some people have found they can live fairly well by relying on the social system and doing a bit of undocumented work on the side , ” angela merkel , head of the conservative christian democratic union party told a television station .
she added that people who truly need help often don ’ t apply for welfare . for his part , schröder again defended labor market reforms on friday , saying they were necessary if germany was to deal with the challenges of an ageing population and high labor costs , without imposing an excessive burden on future generations . " i am convinced that if we do n't start the reform process and conclude it within a decade , we will have to face bitter reproaches from our children and grandchildren , " he said . steve zwick -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reform anger could turn violent a series of violent incidents related to anger at the german government 's welfare reforms have some worried that widespread discontent among the populace could lead a surge in aggressive and illegal behavior .
-lrb- august 28 , 2004 -rrb- protests turn ugly as eggs and insults fly the wave of protests against the german government 's proposed welfare and job market reforms took a nasty turn on tuesday as chancellor gerhard schröder ran the gauntlet of public unrest in the east of the country .

the comments have raised the ire of social groups . german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s interview in the guter rat consumer magazine on friday echoes statements he ’ s made throughout the summer as he tries to hammer through controversial reforms to the country ’ s cumbersome social welfare state . " in both the east and the west , there 's a mentality which extends well into the middle class that you should claim state allowances wherever you can get them , even when there 's an adequate income in the family , " schröder told the magazine .
“ no welfare state can reasonably expect to manage such a burden , ” he added . the chancellor underlined that the public at large realizes that the social system has to change , but that it has balked when confronted with concrete changes that impact them directly , and called for citizens to accept what he said was the inevitable . chancellor far removed from reality ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of protestors march against reforms in leipzig his comments follow weeks of protests , particularly in former communist eastern germany , over tough welfare cuts that will introduce stringent means testing on those claiming unemployment benefits and will make people with a certain level of savings ineligible for welfare . popular anger has arisen in the country with as many as 80,000 people taking to the streets across the country in weekly protests every monday . schröder has been greeted by eggs and heckles as much as by cheers since announcing the reforms . predictably , the chancellor 's comments on friday triggered a heated discussion and drove another wedge between schröder and social support groups who have largely denounced the reforms as being " socially unfair " and " forcing people into poverty . " ulrich schneider , head of the paritätisch wohlfahrtsverband , a leading german social welfare support group , told berlin daily tagesspiegel that schröder 's comments " indicate how far the chancellor is removed from the reality of these people , ” who he says have to count every euro and pinch every penny .
thomas broch , who heads german caritas , also lashed out at the chancellor . “ schröder belittles the people who are already on the losing side of society , ” he said . schröder : " bitter reproaches from our children " government spokesman bela anda acted quickly to point out that schröder was only referring to those who don ’ t need government support , but get it anyway .
he stressed that applied as much to higher upper income groups who claim more than their share from government as it does to middle-income and lower-income people . the negative reactions seem to have caught the government and supporters of reform off-guard , especially since the chancellor had made similar comments throughout his fight to trim the welfare state and loosen labor laws . several influential social democratic politicians have come to the chancellor ’ s defense .
rainer wend , chairman of the bundestag ’ s committee for economics and labor , said the chancellor ’ s remarks were “ dead on ” and derided the outcry as " good old fashioned feigned fury " , noting that the critique applies just as well to wealthy citizens who exploit tax loopholes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- chairwoman angela merkel support for the chancellor has also poured in from the opposition camp .
“ there is certainly a tendency that some people have found they can live fairly well by relying on the social system and doing a bit of undocumented work on the side , ” angela merkel , head of the conservative christian democratic union party told a television station .
she added that people who truly need help often don ’ t apply for welfare . for his part , schröder again defended labor market reforms on friday , saying they were necessary if germany was to deal with the challenges of an ageing population and high labor costs , without imposing an excessive burden on future generations .

france and belgium have raised doubts over the project 's funding and its relationship to the wider us mission in the country . disagreement overshadowed a nato defense ministers meeting in the dutch seaside resort of noordwijk on friday aimed at discussing launching a training academy for senior iraqi military officers in iraq . the crucial deal on the training mission has the potential of settling almost two years of tension between the united states and some of its european partners over nato 's role in iraq .
the organization had already agreed to launch the training mission back in june . the major stumbling block had been opposition from paris , which had previously objected to operations inside iraq under a nato flag .
diplomats say france , which refuses to send any forces into iraq itself , has no problems with the technical aspects of the mission but wants to know what the added value of it would be . french defense minister michele alliot-marie said the foreign ministry in paris was still considering its options .
" we in france continue to believe that this training should be done outside iraq , " alliot-marie told reporters .
" iraq has to find its own sense of identity and i do n't think the addition of more foreigners in uniform will help that . "
if they were going in , she said the mission should remain " as low-profile as possible . " under a deal worked out among nato 's 26 member nations , it ’ s been suggested that the mission would report to the us officer in command of training operations in iraq .
a french diplomat said france wanted more assurances , however , that the officer would be answerable to the alliance .
in other words , there are fears that the alliance will end up being subordinate to the us-led coalition .
nato already has some 40 soldiers in iraq who began training army officers in collaboration with the defense ministry in baghdad .
the issue of the command structure led to a stormy debate in july . de hoop scheffer hopeful of deal nato general secretary jaap de hoop scheffer admitted friday that member states could n't see eye to eye on the issue .
" as it stands now , all 26 allies are n't completely satisfied , " de hoop scheffer said on the sidelines of the meeting . at the same time de hoop scheffer played down the differences and said he was optimistic that a compromise could be reached soon .
he insisted the differences were not " substantial " and included details of the training mission 's relationship with the much wider us mission to rebuild a new 260,000-strong iraqi army , and the question of protection for the alliance instructors . the north atlantic council , nato 's top decision-making body , will meet monday to re-examine the proposals .
british defense secretary geoff hoon was of the opinion that an agreement on the iraq issue was virtually in the bag .
and other officials insisted that the alliance “ is nearing agreement ” . doubts over funding but french reservations over the question of nato 's allegiance in iraq is n't the only issue causing argument among nato 's ranks . officials say that belgium balked at agreement because of problems it has with the project ’ s funding structure .
a belgian foreign ministry spokesman said they wanted to know who ’ s paying for what .
the operation is likely to be paid for from a mix of common nato funding and national financing . as plans stand now , around 300 nato instructors are to be sent to iraq to set up a training center for iraqi officers outside baghdad .
germany , france , belgium and now also spain have agreed that they will not send soldiers to iraq , but rather support the training of iraqi military and officials outside the country . although several of the nato allies have individually sent troops to join the us-led coalition , objections from france and germany had previously prevented the alliance taking a collective role in iraq , apart from offering logistical support to a polish-led multinational force of 6,000 troops operating in the center of the country . however , france , germany and the other allies agreed in june at a nato summit in istanbul to the creation of an alliance training mission for iraq . driving instructors and vehicle maintenance units german defense minister peter struck told reporters friday that the german army would train iraqis in the united arab emirates -lrb- uae -rrb- as driving instructors and also teach them how to carry out vehicle maintenance .
germany would also provide the vehicles needed for the purpose .
further training on mine-clearance would likely be carried out in germany , he said . germany had previously limited its training to iraqi police units .
struck told reporters german officials had drawn up the training plan after talks with iraqi counterparts in the uae . " for germany , this still means that there will be no single german soldier on the ground in iraq , " struck stressed . ben fajzullin -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de training role for nato troops in baghdad after meeting for the sixth time in three days , nato members finally agreed to send a small contingent of troops to iraq to train the country 's armed forces and help rebuild its military infrastructure .

france and belgium have raised doubts over the project 's funding and its relationship to the wider us mission in the country . disagreement overshadowed a nato defense ministers meeting in the dutch seaside resort of noordwijk on friday aimed at discussing launching a training academy for senior iraqi military officers in iraq . the crucial deal on the training mission has the potential of settling almost two years of tension between the united states and some of its european partners over nato 's role in iraq .
the organization had already agreed to launch the training mission back in june . the major stumbling block had been opposition from paris , which had previously objected to operations inside iraq under a nato flag .
diplomats say france , which refuses to send any forces into iraq itself , has no problems with the technical aspects of the mission but wants to know what the added value of it would be . french defense minister michele alliot-marie said the foreign ministry in paris was still considering its options .
" we in france continue to believe that this training should be done outside iraq , " alliot-marie told reporters .
" iraq has to find its own sense of identity and i do n't think the addition of more foreigners in uniform will help that . "
if they were going in , she said the mission should remain " as low-profile as possible . " under a deal worked out among nato 's 26 member nations , it ’ s been suggested that the mission would report to the us officer in command of training operations in iraq .
a french diplomat said france wanted more assurances , however , that the officer would be answerable to the alliance .
in other words , there are fears that the alliance will end up being subordinate to the us-led coalition .
nato already has some 40 soldiers in iraq who began training army officers in collaboration with the defense ministry in baghdad .
the issue of the command structure led to a stormy debate in july . de hoop scheffer hopeful of deal nato general secretary jaap de hoop scheffer admitted friday that member states could n't see eye to eye on the issue .
" as it stands now , all 26 allies are n't completely satisfied , " de hoop scheffer said on the sidelines of the meeting . at the same time de hoop scheffer played down the differences and said he was optimistic that a compromise could be reached soon .
he insisted the differences were not " substantial " and included details of the training mission 's relationship with the much wider us mission to rebuild a new 260,000-strong iraqi army , and the question of protection for the alliance instructors . the north atlantic council , nato 's top decision-making body , will meet monday to re-examine the proposals .
british defense secretary geoff hoon was of the opinion that an agreement on the iraq issue was virtually in the bag .
and other officials insisted that the alliance “ is nearing agreement ” . doubts over funding but french reservations over the question of nato 's allegiance in iraq is n't the only issue causing argument among nato 's ranks . officials say that belgium balked at agreement because of problems it has with the project ’ s funding structure .
a belgian foreign ministry spokesman said they wanted to know who ’ s paying for what .
the operation is likely to be paid for from a mix of common nato funding and national financing . as plans stand now , around 300 nato instructors are to be sent to iraq to set up a training center for iraqi officers outside baghdad .
germany , france , belgium and now also spain have agreed that they will not send soldiers to iraq , but rather support the training of iraqi military and officials outside the country . although several of the nato allies have individually sent troops to join the us-led coalition , objections from france and germany had previously prevented the alliance taking a collective role in iraq , apart from offering logistical support to a polish-led multinational force of 6,000 troops operating in the center of the country . however , france , germany and the other allies agreed in june at a nato summit in istanbul to the creation of an alliance training mission for iraq . driving instructors and vehicle maintenance units german defense minister peter struck told reporters friday that the german army would train iraqis in the united arab emirates -lrb- uae -rrb- as driving instructors and also teach them how to carry out vehicle maintenance .
germany would also provide the vehicles needed for the purpose .
further training on mine-clearance would likely be carried out in germany , he said . germany had previously limited its training to iraqi police units .
struck told reporters german officials had drawn up the training plan after talks with iraqi counterparts in the uae .

in an interview with deutsche welle , turkish pm tayyip erdogan said the country was on track . dw : on october 6th the european union commission is due to announce when and if membership talks with your country can take place .
what do you think brussels will decide ? recep tayyip erdogan : we are doing everything we can to influence this process in a positive way and to fulfill the criteria issued in copenhagen for accession talks .
at this point there are no problems with legislation on reforms .
when i asked mr. verheugen -lrb- eu enlargement commissioner -rrb- during his last visit here what we had to do to complete this legislation , he answered that turkey had already done everything , but that there were still problems with implementation .
we know that too , because implementation requires a change in mentality .
that 's part of a process and we are making every effort to push this process forward as fast as possible . while the eu commissioner was here , he was presented with reports from human rights organizations that say systematic torture continues in turkey .
is that charge baseless or unfair ? these allegations are completely unjustified .
they are totally groundless charges .
our ministry launched an immediate investigation .
and we have also been conducting inquiries into who initiated these accusations .
unfortunately , it is charges of this nature which are hindering turkey 's attempts to integrate into europe .
and i have the impression that 's something verheugen is all too aware of .
we have a zero-tolerance policy on the issue of torture .
systematic torture is unthinkable in a democratic system . up until now it 's been viewed as an open secret in brussels that on october 6th the eu commission would say yes to opening membership talks .
now a dispute has unfolded concerning proposed reforms to the turkish penal code which have since been put on hold .
where do things stand now ?
will the penal code be reformed , and when will the reforms become law ? turkey 's new criminal law is not part of the copenhagen criteria .
just as the draft legislation for reforms to the regional courts of appeal , or the new code for criminal procedure or the penal code , are not part of the copenhagen criteria .
these are steps we are taking as preparatory measures for moving towards the european union .
and it should not be forgotten that at this point there is only a common european constitution , but the eu has no common code of criminal law .
we are undertaking this reform of criminal law on our own initiative .
and i 'm convinced that 's something our european friends will appreciate . even so , the section which would make adultery a criminal offence is especially controversial .
is that something that is essential for you , or could you take that section out of the reform package if brussels were to insist on it ? this new law comprises a total of 346 paragraphs - and as such it is not necessarily so easy to appraise from a distance .
it would be unwise to restrict the discussion to the issue of adultery .
for us in the justice and development party , traditions are very important .
we stand for conservative values .
these principles are written in our party political program and are part of my government 's stated policy goals .
that is the aim of this article of law .
it 's intended to protect and strengthen the family .
the family is the most dynamic factor in turkish society .
moreover , this article of law was on the statutes between 1926 and 1996 at which time it was directed against women .
however , the new law foresees that if anyone brings a charge on grounds of infidelity and it comes to a court judgment , men and women shall be treated equally and the punishment shall be appropriate . is brussels exerting too much pressure ? no-one has raised that issue with me .
when mr. verheugen was here , i put the following question to him : does turkey need to do more ?
he answered ' no ' , but he did say that there were clear failings in the implementation of the reforms .
we 're aware of that too .
and we also discussed the issue of adultery .
mr verheugen said that this issue had nothing to do with the commission 's progress report .
he did , however , say that the topic of adultery could influence the decisions on when to begin talks .
i think we should now end this debate .
there are 25 eu members , not all of which fulfill the copenhagen criteria .
nonetheless , they are members of the european union . german conservative opposition leader angela merkel has written a letter to political leaders across europe in which she lobbied against full membership for turkey and instead pushed for a ' privileged partnership ' for your country .
you and your akp party are also members of the conservative camp - are you disappointed in miss merkel ? i find it hard to understand miss merkel .

the report showed which countries have the least red-tape and where it 's easiest to become an entrepreneur . this is the second year the world bank has issued rankings on business environment indicators : more than 3,000 local experts investigated practices in 145 nations , asking whether it was easy or difficult to start a small or medium-size business and whether administrations made it hard to hire and fire . among the other things compared were hiring and firing practices , how easy it was to register property , the ease of contract enforcement , and - for the first time in 2003 - the property registration process and to what extent investors were protected . of the industrial countries , new zealand , australia and norway came out on top .
but where was germany , a country famed throughout the world for doing things by the book ? german procedures take twice as long it takes a businessman in finland three simple procedures and two weeks to turn his idea into a company .
german competitors , however , have to spend 45 days wading through nine procedures , twice as long as the world average .
that kind of bureaucratic hassle meant germany was n't among the top twenty . gabi beermeister , a young woman who runs a small kiosk in berlin , told dw-world german bureaucracy was getting worse . " selling bread rolls , cigarettes and sweets required a special catering permit , so i applied to the health authorities , " she said .
" but they asked for so many things - architect drawings of the business premises , a permit from the building authorities , letters of approval from banks … i simply gave up . " german government claims successes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement .
although germany ranked only slightly better than mediocre in the " doing business in 2005 " report , germany ’ s minister of commerce wolfgang clement told the handelsblatt newspaper that the report didn ’ t do germany justice .
he pointed out 2003 reforms , like the " hours of trading act " , which simplified trade guild rules and improved workplace regulations . meanwhile , the german ministry of justice has been searching the german law books for unnecessary regulations in a bid to streamline procedures .
two hundred laws and by-laws need to be abolished , found the ministry . bureaucratic countries pay a high price an easy business climate has many benefits , michael klein told dw-world .
he believes that the easier it is to start a new company , the higher the chances of reducing unemployment and spurring the economy . " we find that 25 percent of the countries that have the most complicated and bureaucratic regulations tend to grow roughly 2 percent less per year than the countries that have easy and well-structured regulations , " klein said . this knowledge has certainly prompted many european nations , not just germany , to tackle reform .
" most of the reform-stimulus has come from the eu , " said klein .
" the accession countries felt they should improve their business environment , slovakia ahead of all of them .
but also within the eu , a number of countries - spain , portugal , finland and belgium - have improved business regulations . " move to botswana ? the " doing business in 2005 " report follows the standard world bank line : economic liberalization and the opening of local markets comes with large payoffs .
as proof of that , michael klein pointed to turkey and france , both of which saw new business registration increase by 18 percent after the governments reduced the time and cost of starting a business . in the end , the report does , indirectly , offer a solution to german businessmen and women interested in a business friendly investment climate : they should move … to botswana . peter zimmerman -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german egovernment initiative off to a slow start the eu would like its citizens to use personal computers to do taxes and complete bureacratic formalities .

in an interview with deutsche welle , turkish pm tayyip erdogan said the country was on track . dw : on october 6th the european union commission is due to announce when and if membership talks with your country can take place .
what do you think brussels will decide ? recep tayyip erdogan : we are doing everything we can to influence this process in a positive way and to fulfill the criteria issued in copenhagen for accession talks .
at this point there are no problems with legislation on reforms .
when i asked mr. verheugen -lrb- eu enlargement commissioner -rrb- during his last visit here what we had to do to complete this legislation , he answered that turkey had already done everything , but that there were still problems with implementation .
we know that too , because implementation requires a change in mentality .
that 's part of a process and we are making every effort to push this process forward as fast as possible . while the eu commissioner was here , he was presented with reports from human rights organizations that say systematic torture continues in turkey .
is that charge baseless or unfair ? these allegations are completely unjustified .
they are totally groundless charges .
our ministry launched an immediate investigation .
and we have also been conducting inquiries into who initiated these accusations .
unfortunately , it is charges of this nature which are hindering turkey 's attempts to integrate into europe .
and i have the impression that 's something verheugen is all too aware of .
we have a zero-tolerance policy on the issue of torture .
systematic torture is unthinkable in a democratic system . up until now it 's been viewed as an open secret in brussels that on october 6th the eu commission would say yes to opening membership talks .
now a dispute has unfolded concerning proposed reforms to the turkish penal code which have since been put on hold .
where do things stand now ?
will the penal code be reformed , and when will the reforms become law ? turkey 's new criminal law is not part of the copenhagen criteria .
just as the draft legislation for reforms to the regional courts of appeal , or the new code for criminal procedure or the penal code , are not part of the copenhagen criteria .
these are steps we are taking as preparatory measures for moving towards the european union .
and it should not be forgotten that at this point there is only a common european constitution , but the eu has no common code of criminal law .
we are undertaking this reform of criminal law on our own initiative .
and i 'm convinced that 's something our european friends will appreciate . even so , the section which would make adultery a criminal offence is especially controversial .
is that something that is essential for you , or could you take that section out of the reform package if brussels were to insist on it ? this new law comprises a total of 346 paragraphs - and as such it is not necessarily so easy to appraise from a distance .
it would be unwise to restrict the discussion to the issue of adultery .
for us in the justice and development party , traditions are very important .
we stand for conservative values .
these principles are written in our party political program and are part of my government 's stated policy goals .
that is the aim of this article of law .
it 's intended to protect and strengthen the family .
the family is the most dynamic factor in turkish society .
moreover , this article of law was on the statutes between 1926 and 1996 at which time it was directed against women .
however , the new law foresees that if anyone brings a charge on grounds of infidelity and it comes to a court judgment , men and women shall be treated equally and the punishment shall be appropriate . is brussels exerting too much pressure ? no-one has raised that issue with me .
when mr. verheugen was here , i put the following question to him : does turkey need to do more ?
he answered ' no ' , but he did say that there were clear failings in the implementation of the reforms .
we 're aware of that too .
and we also discussed the issue of adultery .
mr verheugen said that this issue had nothing to do with the commission 's progress report .
he did , however , say that the topic of adultery could influence the decisions on when to begin talks .
i think we should now end this debate .
there are 25 eu members , not all of which fulfill the copenhagen criteria .
nonetheless , they are members of the european union . german conservative opposition leader angela merkel has written a letter to political leaders across europe in which she lobbied against full membership for turkey and instead pushed for a ' privileged partnership ' for your country .
you and your akp party are also members of the conservative camp - are you disappointed in miss merkel ? i find it hard to understand miss merkel .
and she is calling for understanding in our discussions . a privileged partnership is unthinkable in the eu . any nation that fulfills the copenhagen criteria can start membership talks . but we are not yet talking about full membership here , rather commencing negotiations on terms of entry . therefore we need a fair decision to set the process of negotiations in motion . if this process does not get underway , we will draw our own conclusions from this and take the necessary steps . i would like to stress that we are pushing for the fulfillment of the copenhagen criteria in the interests of our own people . but if there were really to be a negative decision , which i do n't believe there will be , then we will call this the ankara criteria and continue on our own path . the interview was conducted by alexander kudascheff send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu wants turkey to explain withdrawal of bill european union enlargement commissioner guenter verheugen on saturday called on turkey to clarify its decision to withdraw a key bill reforming its penal code , during talks with turkey 's eu ambassador .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 18.09.2004 paris , brussels put brakes on nato mission in iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's training of iraqi military officers remains uncertain nato ’ s plans to expand its training mission in iraq have met with resistance .
france and belgium have raised doubts over the project 's funding and its relationship to the wider us mission in the country . disagreement overshadowed a nato defense ministers meeting in the dutch seaside resort of noordwijk on friday aimed at discussing launching a training academy for senior iraqi military officers in iraq . the crucial deal on the training mission has the potential of settling almost two years of tension between the united states and some of its european partners over nato 's role in iraq .
the organization had already agreed to launch the training mission back in june . the major stumbling block had been opposition from paris , which had previously objected to operations inside iraq under a nato flag .
diplomats say france , which refuses to send any forces into iraq itself , has no problems with the technical aspects of the mission but wants to know what the added value of it would be . french defense minister michele alliot-marie said the foreign ministry in paris was still considering its options .
" we in france continue to believe that this training should be done outside iraq , " alliot-marie told reporters .
" iraq has to find its own sense of identity and i do n't think the addition of more foreigners in uniform will help that . "
if they were going in , she said the mission should remain " as low-profile as possible . " under a deal worked out among nato 's 26 member nations , it ’ s been suggested that the mission would report to the us officer in command of training operations in iraq .
a french diplomat said france wanted more assurances , however , that the officer would be answerable to the alliance .
in other words , there are fears that the alliance will end up being subordinate to the us-led coalition .
nato already has some 40 soldiers in iraq who began training army officers in collaboration with the defense ministry in baghdad .
the issue of the command structure led to a stormy debate in july . de hoop scheffer hopeful of deal nato general secretary jaap de hoop scheffer admitted friday that member states could n't see eye to eye on the issue .
" as it stands now , all 26 allies are n't completely satisfied , " de hoop scheffer said on the sidelines of the meeting . at the same time de hoop scheffer played down the differences and said he was optimistic that a compromise could be reached soon .
he insisted the differences were not " substantial " and included details of the training mission 's relationship with the much wider us mission to rebuild a new 260,000-strong iraqi army , and the question of protection for the alliance instructors . the north atlantic council , nato 's top decision-making body , will meet monday to re-examine the proposals .
british defense secretary geoff hoon was of the opinion that an agreement on the iraq issue was virtually in the bag .
and other officials insisted that the alliance “ is nearing agreement ” . doubts over funding but french reservations over the question of nato 's allegiance in iraq is n't the only issue causing argument among nato 's ranks . officials say that belgium balked at agreement because of problems it has with the project ’ s funding structure .
a belgian foreign ministry spokesman said they wanted to know who ’ s paying for what .
the operation is likely to be paid for from a mix of common nato funding and national financing . as plans stand now , around 300 nato instructors are to be sent to iraq to set up a training center for iraqi officers outside baghdad .
germany , france , belgium and now also spain have agreed that they will not send soldiers to iraq , but rather support the training of iraqi military and officials outside the country . although several of the nato allies have individually sent troops to join the us-led coalition , objections from france and germany had previously prevented the alliance taking a collective role in iraq , apart from offering logistical support to a polish-led multinational force of 6,000 troops operating in the center of the country . however , france , germany and the other allies agreed in june at a nato summit in istanbul to the creation of an alliance training mission for iraq . driving instructors and vehicle maintenance units german defense minister peter struck told reporters friday that the german army would train iraqis in the united arab emirates -lrb- uae -rrb- as driving instructors and also teach them how to carry out vehicle maintenance .
germany would also provide the vehicles needed for the purpose .
further training on mine-clearance would likely be carried out in germany , he said . germany had previously limited its training to iraqi police units .
struck told reporters german officials had drawn up the training plan after talks with iraqi counterparts in the uae . " for germany , this still means that there will be no single german soldier on the ground in iraq , " struck stressed . ben fajzullin -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de training role for nato troops in baghdad after meeting for the sixth time in three days , nato members finally agreed to send a small contingent of troops to iraq to train the country 's armed forces and help rebuild its military infrastructure .

france and belgium have raised doubts over the project 's funding and its relationship to the wider us mission in the country . disagreement overshadowed a nato defense ministers meeting in the dutch seaside resort of noordwijk on friday aimed at discussing launching a training academy for senior iraqi military officers in iraq . the crucial deal on the training mission has the potential of settling almost two years of tension between the united states and some of its european partners over nato 's role in iraq .
the organization had already agreed to launch the training mission back in june . the major stumbling block had been opposition from paris , which had previously objected to operations inside iraq under a nato flag .
diplomats say france , which refuses to send any forces into iraq itself , has no problems with the technical aspects of the mission but wants to know what the added value of it would be . french defense minister michele alliot-marie said the foreign ministry in paris was still considering its options .
" we in france continue to believe that this training should be done outside iraq , " alliot-marie told reporters .
" iraq has to find its own sense of identity and i do n't think the addition of more foreigners in uniform will help that . "
if they were going in , she said the mission should remain " as low-profile as possible . " under a deal worked out among nato 's 26 member nations , it ’ s been suggested that the mission would report to the us officer in command of training operations in iraq .
a french diplomat said france wanted more assurances , however , that the officer would be answerable to the alliance .
in other words , there are fears that the alliance will end up being subordinate to the us-led coalition .
nato already has some 40 soldiers in iraq who began training army officers in collaboration with the defense ministry in baghdad .
the issue of the command structure led to a stormy debate in july . de hoop scheffer hopeful of deal nato general secretary jaap de hoop scheffer admitted friday that member states could n't see eye to eye on the issue .
" as it stands now , all 26 allies are n't completely satisfied , " de hoop scheffer said on the sidelines of the meeting . at the same time de hoop scheffer played down the differences and said he was optimistic that a compromise could be reached soon .
he insisted the differences were not " substantial " and included details of the training mission 's relationship with the much wider us mission to rebuild a new 260,000-strong iraqi army , and the question of protection for the alliance instructors . the north atlantic council , nato 's top decision-making body , will meet monday to re-examine the proposals .
british defense secretary geoff hoon was of the opinion that an agreement on the iraq issue was virtually in the bag .
and other officials insisted that the alliance “ is nearing agreement ” . doubts over funding but french reservations over the question of nato 's allegiance in iraq is n't the only issue causing argument among nato 's ranks . officials say that belgium balked at agreement because of problems it has with the project ’ s funding structure .
a belgian foreign ministry spokesman said they wanted to know who ’ s paying for what .
the operation is likely to be paid for from a mix of common nato funding and national financing . as plans stand now , around 300 nato instructors are to be sent to iraq to set up a training center for iraqi officers outside baghdad .
germany , france , belgium and now also spain have agreed that they will not send soldiers to iraq , but rather support the training of iraqi military and officials outside the country . although several of the nato allies have individually sent troops to join the us-led coalition , objections from france and germany had previously prevented the alliance taking a collective role in iraq , apart from offering logistical support to a polish-led multinational force of 6,000 troops operating in the center of the country . however , france , germany and the other allies agreed in june at a nato summit in istanbul to the creation of an alliance training mission for iraq . driving instructors and vehicle maintenance units german defense minister peter struck told reporters friday that the german army would train iraqis in the united arab emirates -lrb- uae -rrb- as driving instructors and also teach them how to carry out vehicle maintenance .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : turkey 's eu moment of truth verheugen : no more obstacles to talks with turkey capturing turkish culture 's changing face waiting for eu erdogan : " we have done our homework " europe -pipe- 18.09.2004 " a change in mentality is needed " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister erdogan says turkey is doing its best to meet entry criteria the eu commission is to publish a key report on october 6 on whether ankara is ready to open talks on joining the eu .
in an interview with deutsche welle , turkish pm tayyip erdogan said the country was on track . dw : on october 6th the european union commission is due to announce when and if membership talks with your country can take place .
what do you think brussels will decide ? recep tayyip erdogan : we are doing everything we can to influence this process in a positive way and to fulfill the criteria issued in copenhagen for accession talks .
at this point there are no problems with legislation on reforms .
when i asked mr. verheugen -lrb- eu enlargement commissioner -rrb- during his last visit here what we had to do to complete this legislation , he answered that turkey had already done everything , but that there were still problems with implementation .
we know that too , because implementation requires a change in mentality .
that 's part of a process and we are making every effort to push this process forward as fast as possible . while the eu commissioner was here , he was presented with reports from human rights organizations that say systematic torture continues in turkey .
is that charge baseless or unfair ? these allegations are completely unjustified .
they are totally groundless charges .
our ministry launched an immediate investigation .
and we have also been conducting inquiries into who initiated these accusations .
unfortunately , it is charges of this nature which are hindering turkey 's attempts to integrate into europe .
and i have the impression that 's something verheugen is all too aware of .
we have a zero-tolerance policy on the issue of torture .
systematic torture is unthinkable in a democratic system . up until now it 's been viewed as an open secret in brussels that on october 6th the eu commission would say yes to opening membership talks .
now a dispute has unfolded concerning proposed reforms to the turkish penal code which have since been put on hold .
where do things stand now ?
will the penal code be reformed , and when will the reforms become law ? turkey 's new criminal law is not part of the copenhagen criteria .
just as the draft legislation for reforms to the regional courts of appeal , or the new code for criminal procedure or the penal code , are not part of the copenhagen criteria .
these are steps we are taking as preparatory measures for moving towards the european union .
and it should not be forgotten that at this point there is only a common european constitution , but the eu has no common code of criminal law .
we are undertaking this reform of criminal law on our own initiative .
and i 'm convinced that 's something our european friends will appreciate . even so , the section which would make adultery a criminal offence is especially controversial .
is that something that is essential for you , or could you take that section out of the reform package if brussels were to insist on it ? this new law comprises a total of 346 paragraphs - and as such it is not necessarily so easy to appraise from a distance .
it would be unwise to restrict the discussion to the issue of adultery .
for us in the justice and development party , traditions are very important .
we stand for conservative values .
these principles are written in our party political program and are part of my government 's stated policy goals .
that is the aim of this article of law .
it 's intended to protect and strengthen the family .
the family is the most dynamic factor in turkish society .
moreover , this article of law was on the statutes between 1926 and 1996 at which time it was directed against women .
however , the new law foresees that if anyone brings a charge on grounds of infidelity and it comes to a court judgment , men and women shall be treated equally and the punishment shall be appropriate . is brussels exerting too much pressure ? no-one has raised that issue with me .
when mr. verheugen was here , i put the following question to him : does turkey need to do more ?
he answered ' no ' , but he did say that there were clear failings in the implementation of the reforms .
we 're aware of that too .
and we also discussed the issue of adultery .
mr verheugen said that this issue had nothing to do with the commission 's progress report .
he did , however , say that the topic of adultery could influence the decisions on when to begin talks .
i think we should now end this debate .
there are 25 eu members , not all of which fulfill the copenhagen criteria .
nonetheless , they are members of the european union . german conservative opposition leader angela merkel has written a letter to political leaders across europe in which she lobbied against full membership for turkey and instead pushed for a ' privileged partnership ' for your country .
you and your akp party are also members of the conservative camp - are you disappointed in miss merkel ? i find it hard to understand miss merkel .
and she is calling for understanding in our discussions . a privileged partnership is unthinkable in the eu . any nation that fulfills the copenhagen criteria can start membership talks . but we are not yet talking about full membership here , rather commencing negotiations on terms of entry . therefore we need a fair decision to set the process of negotiations in motion . if this process does not get underway , we will draw our own conclusions from this and take the necessary steps . i would like to stress that we are pushing for the fulfillment of the copenhagen criteria in the interests of our own people . but if there were really to be a negative decision , which i do n't believe there will be , then we will call this the ankara criteria and continue on our own path . the interview was conducted by alexander kudascheff send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu wants turkey to explain withdrawal of bill european union enlargement commissioner guenter verheugen on saturday called on turkey to clarify its decision to withdraw a key bill reforming its penal code , during talks with turkey 's eu ambassador .

systematic torture is unthinkable in a democratic system . up until now it 's been viewed as an open secret in brussels that on october 6th the eu commission would say yes to opening membership talks .
now a dispute has unfolded concerning proposed reforms to the turkish penal code which have since been put on hold .
where do things stand now ?
will the penal code be reformed , and when will the reforms become law ? turkey 's new criminal law is not part of the copenhagen criteria .
just as the draft legislation for reforms to the regional courts of appeal , or the new code for criminal procedure or the penal code , are not part of the copenhagen criteria .
these are steps we are taking as preparatory measures for moving towards the european union .
and it should not be forgotten that at this point there is only a common european constitution , but the eu has no common code of criminal law .
we are undertaking this reform of criminal law on our own initiative .
and i 'm convinced that 's something our european friends will appreciate . even so , the section which would make adultery a criminal offence is especially controversial .
is that something that is essential for you , or could you take that section out of the reform package if brussels were to insist on it ? this new law comprises a total of 346 paragraphs - and as such it is not necessarily so easy to appraise from a distance .
it would be unwise to restrict the discussion to the issue of adultery .
for us in the justice and development party , traditions are very important .
we stand for conservative values .
these principles are written in our party political program and are part of my government 's stated policy goals .
that is the aim of this article of law .
it 's intended to protect and strengthen the family .
the family is the most dynamic factor in turkish society .
moreover , this article of law was on the statutes between 1926 and 1996 at which time it was directed against women .
however , the new law foresees that if anyone brings a charge on grounds of infidelity and it comes to a court judgment , men and women shall be treated equally and the punishment shall be appropriate . is brussels exerting too much pressure ? no-one has raised that issue with me .
when mr. verheugen was here , i put the following question to him : does turkey need to do more ?
he answered ' no ' , but he did say that there were clear failings in the implementation of the reforms .
we 're aware of that too .
and we also discussed the issue of adultery .
mr verheugen said that this issue had nothing to do with the commission 's progress report .
he did , however , say that the topic of adultery could influence the decisions on when to begin talks .
i think we should now end this debate .
there are 25 eu members , not all of which fulfill the copenhagen criteria .
nonetheless , they are members of the european union . german conservative opposition leader angela merkel has written a letter to political leaders across europe in which she lobbied against full membership for turkey and instead pushed for a ' privileged partnership ' for your country .
you and your akp party are also members of the conservative camp - are you disappointed in miss merkel ? i find it hard to understand miss merkel .
and she is calling for understanding in our discussions . a privileged partnership is unthinkable in the eu . any nation that fulfills the copenhagen criteria can start membership talks . but we are not yet talking about full membership here , rather commencing negotiations on terms of entry . therefore we need a fair decision to set the process of negotiations in motion . if this process does not get underway , we will draw our own conclusions from this and take the necessary steps . i would like to stress that we are pushing for the fulfillment of the copenhagen criteria in the interests of our own people . but if there were really to be a negative decision , which i do n't believe there will be , then we will call this the ankara criteria and continue on our own path . the interview was conducted by alexander kudascheff send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu wants turkey to explain withdrawal of bill european union enlargement commissioner guenter verheugen on saturday called on turkey to clarify its decision to withdraw a key bill reforming its penal code , during talks with turkey 's eu ambassador .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 18.09.2004 cutting through the red tape großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paperwork and red tape hinders economic growth , says the report the world bank 's " doing business in 2005 " report on business practices and bureaucracy shows many countries , germany included , are stifling growth and enterprise by wrapping simple procedures in masses of red tape . the world bank 's report , “ doing business in 2005 : removing obstacles to growth , ” looked at the levels of bureaucracy businesses face in 145 countries .
the report showed which countries have the least red-tape and where it 's easiest to become an entrepreneur . this is the second year the world bank has issued rankings on business environment indicators : more than 3,000 local experts investigated practices in 145 nations , asking whether it was easy or difficult to start a small or medium-size business and whether administrations made it hard to hire and fire . among the other things compared were hiring and firing practices , how easy it was to register property , the ease of contract enforcement , and - for the first time in 2003 - the property registration process and to what extent investors were protected . of the industrial countries , new zealand , australia and norway came out on top .
but where was germany , a country famed throughout the world for doing things by the book ? german procedures take twice as long it takes a businessman in finland three simple procedures and two weeks to turn his idea into a company .
german competitors , however , have to spend 45 days wading through nine procedures , twice as long as the world average .
that kind of bureaucratic hassle meant germany was n't among the top twenty . gabi beermeister , a young woman who runs a small kiosk in berlin , told dw-world german bureaucracy was getting worse . " selling bread rolls , cigarettes and sweets required a special catering permit , so i applied to the health authorities , " she said .
" but they asked for so many things - architect drawings of the business premises , a permit from the building authorities , letters of approval from banks … i simply gave up . " german government claims successes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement .
although germany ranked only slightly better than mediocre in the " doing business in 2005 " report , germany ’ s minister of commerce wolfgang clement told the handelsblatt newspaper that the report didn ’ t do germany justice .
he pointed out 2003 reforms , like the " hours of trading act " , which simplified trade guild rules and improved workplace regulations . meanwhile , the german ministry of justice has been searching the german law books for unnecessary regulations in a bid to streamline procedures .
two hundred laws and by-laws need to be abolished , found the ministry . bureaucratic countries pay a high price an easy business climate has many benefits , michael klein told dw-world .
he believes that the easier it is to start a new company , the higher the chances of reducing unemployment and spurring the economy . " we find that 25 percent of the countries that have the most complicated and bureaucratic regulations tend to grow roughly 2 percent less per year than the countries that have easy and well-structured regulations , " klein said . this knowledge has certainly prompted many european nations , not just germany , to tackle reform .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 18.09.2004 cutting through the red tape großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paperwork and red tape hinders economic growth , says the report the world bank 's " doing business in 2005 " report on business practices and bureaucracy shows many countries , germany included , are stifling growth and enterprise by wrapping simple procedures in masses of red tape . the world bank 's report , “ doing business in 2005 : removing obstacles to growth , ” looked at the levels of bureaucracy businesses face in 145 countries .
the report showed which countries have the least red-tape and where it 's easiest to become an entrepreneur . this is the second year the world bank has issued rankings on business environment indicators : more than 3,000 local experts investigated practices in 145 nations , asking whether it was easy or difficult to start a small or medium-size business and whether administrations made it hard to hire and fire . among the other things compared were hiring and firing practices , how easy it was to register property , the ease of contract enforcement , and - for the first time in 2003 - the property registration process and to what extent investors were protected . of the industrial countries , new zealand , australia and norway came out on top .
but where was germany , a country famed throughout the world for doing things by the book ? german procedures take twice as long it takes a businessman in finland three simple procedures and two weeks to turn his idea into a company .
german competitors , however , have to spend 45 days wading through nine procedures , twice as long as the world average .
that kind of bureaucratic hassle meant germany was n't among the top twenty . gabi beermeister , a young woman who runs a small kiosk in berlin , told dw-world german bureaucracy was getting worse . " selling bread rolls , cigarettes and sweets required a special catering permit , so i applied to the health authorities , " she said .
" but they asked for so many things - architect drawings of the business premises , a permit from the building authorities , letters of approval from banks … i simply gave up . " german government claims successes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement .
although germany ranked only slightly better than mediocre in the " doing business in 2005 " report , germany ’ s minister of commerce wolfgang clement told the handelsblatt newspaper that the report didn ’ t do germany justice .
he pointed out 2003 reforms , like the " hours of trading act " , which simplified trade guild rules and improved workplace regulations . meanwhile , the german ministry of justice has been searching the german law books for unnecessary regulations in a bid to streamline procedures .
two hundred laws and by-laws need to be abolished , found the ministry . bureaucratic countries pay a high price an easy business climate has many benefits , michael klein told dw-world .
he believes that the easier it is to start a new company , the higher the chances of reducing unemployment and spurring the economy . " we find that 25 percent of the countries that have the most complicated and bureaucratic regulations tend to grow roughly 2 percent less per year than the countries that have easy and well-structured regulations , " klein said . this knowledge has certainly prompted many european nations , not just germany , to tackle reform .
" most of the reform-stimulus has come from the eu , " said klein .
" the accession countries felt they should improve their business environment , slovakia ahead of all of them .
but also within the eu , a number of countries - spain , portugal , finland and belgium - have improved business regulations . " move to botswana ? the " doing business in 2005 " report follows the standard world bank line : economic liberalization and the opening of local markets comes with large payoffs .

the comments have raised the ire of social groups . german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s interview in the guter rat consumer magazine on friday echoes statements he ’ s made throughout the summer as he tries to hammer through controversial reforms to the country ’ s cumbersome social welfare state . " in both the east and the west , there 's a mentality which extends well into the middle class that you should claim state allowances wherever you can get them , even when there 's an adequate income in the family , " schröder told the magazine .
“ no welfare state can reasonably expect to manage such a burden , ” he added . the chancellor underlined that the public at large realizes that the social system has to change , but that it has balked when confronted with concrete changes that impact them directly , and called for citizens to accept what he said was the inevitable . chancellor far removed from reality ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of protestors march against reforms in leipzig his comments follow weeks of protests , particularly in former communist eastern germany , over tough welfare cuts that will introduce stringent means testing on those claiming unemployment benefits and will make people with a certain level of savings ineligible for welfare . popular anger has arisen in the country with as many as 80,000 people taking to the streets across the country in weekly protests every monday . schröder has been greeted by eggs and heckles as much as by cheers since announcing the reforms . predictably , the chancellor 's comments on friday triggered a heated discussion and drove another wedge between schröder and social support groups who have largely denounced the reforms as being " socially unfair " and " forcing people into poverty . " ulrich schneider , head of the paritätisch wohlfahrtsverband , a leading german social welfare support group , told berlin daily tagesspiegel that schröder 's comments " indicate how far the chancellor is removed from the reality of these people , ” who he says have to count every euro and pinch every penny .
thomas broch , who heads german caritas , also lashed out at the chancellor . “ schröder belittles the people who are already on the losing side of society , ” he said . schröder : " bitter reproaches from our children " government spokesman bela anda acted quickly to point out that schröder was only referring to those who don ’ t need government support , but get it anyway .
he stressed that applied as much to higher upper income groups who claim more than their share from government as it does to middle-income and lower-income people . the negative reactions seem to have caught the government and supporters of reform off-guard , especially since the chancellor had made similar comments throughout his fight to trim the welfare state and loosen labor laws . several influential social democratic politicians have come to the chancellor ’ s defense .
rainer wend , chairman of the bundestag ’ s committee for economics and labor , said the chancellor ’ s remarks were “ dead on ” and derided the outcry as " good old fashioned feigned fury " , noting that the critique applies just as well to wealthy citizens who exploit tax loopholes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- chairwoman angela merkel support for the chancellor has also poured in from the opposition camp .
“ there is certainly a tendency that some people have found they can live fairly well by relying on the social system and doing a bit of undocumented work on the side , ” angela merkel , head of the conservative christian democratic union party told a television station .
she added that people who truly need help often don ’ t apply for welfare . for his part , schröder again defended labor market reforms on friday , saying they were necessary if germany was to deal with the challenges of an ageing population and high labor costs , without imposing an excessive burden on future generations .

the comments have raised the ire of social groups . german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s interview in the guter rat consumer magazine on friday echoes statements he ’ s made throughout the summer as he tries to hammer through controversial reforms to the country ’ s cumbersome social welfare state . " in both the east and the west , there 's a mentality which extends well into the middle class that you should claim state allowances wherever you can get them , even when there 's an adequate income in the family , " schröder told the magazine .
“ no welfare state can reasonably expect to manage such a burden , ” he added . the chancellor underlined that the public at large realizes that the social system has to change , but that it has balked when confronted with concrete changes that impact them directly , and called for citizens to accept what he said was the inevitable . chancellor far removed from reality ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of protestors march against reforms in leipzig his comments follow weeks of protests , particularly in former communist eastern germany , over tough welfare cuts that will introduce stringent means testing on those claiming unemployment benefits and will make people with a certain level of savings ineligible for welfare . popular anger has arisen in the country with as many as 80,000 people taking to the streets across the country in weekly protests every monday . schröder has been greeted by eggs and heckles as much as by cheers since announcing the reforms . predictably , the chancellor 's comments on friday triggered a heated discussion and drove another wedge between schröder and social support groups who have largely denounced the reforms as being " socially unfair " and " forcing people into poverty .

the report showed which countries have the least red-tape and where it 's easiest to become an entrepreneur . this is the second year the world bank has issued rankings on business environment indicators : more than 3,000 local experts investigated practices in 145 nations , asking whether it was easy or difficult to start a small or medium-size business and whether administrations made it hard to hire and fire . among the other things compared were hiring and firing practices , how easy it was to register property , the ease of contract enforcement , and - for the first time in 2003 - the property registration process and to what extent investors were protected . of the industrial countries , new zealand , australia and norway came out on top .
but where was germany , a country famed throughout the world for doing things by the book ? german procedures take twice as long it takes a businessman in finland three simple procedures and two weeks to turn his idea into a company .

he believes that the easier it is to start a new company , the higher the chances of reducing unemployment and spurring the economy . " we find that 25 percent of the countries that have the most complicated and bureaucratic regulations tend to grow roughly 2 percent less per year than the countries that have easy and well-structured regulations , " klein said . this knowledge has certainly prompted many european nations , not just germany , to tackle reform .
" most of the reform-stimulus has come from the eu , " said klein .

" but they asked for so many things - architect drawings of the business premises , a permit from the building authorities , letters of approval from banks … i simply gave up . " german government claims successes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement .
although germany ranked only slightly better than mediocre in the " doing business in 2005 " report , germany ’ s minister of commerce wolfgang clement told the handelsblatt newspaper that the report didn ’ t do germany justice .
he pointed out 2003 reforms , like the " hours of trading act " , which simplified trade guild rules and improved workplace regulations . meanwhile , the german ministry of justice has been searching the german law books for unnecessary regulations in a bid to streamline procedures .
two hundred laws and by-laws need to be abolished , found the ministry . bureaucratic countries pay a high price an easy business climate has many benefits , michael klein told dw-world .
he believes that the easier it is to start a new company , the higher the chances of reducing unemployment and spurring the economy . " we find that 25 percent of the countries that have the most complicated and bureaucratic regulations tend to grow roughly 2 percent less per year than the countries that have easy and well-structured regulations , " klein said . this knowledge has certainly prompted many european nations , not just germany , to tackle reform .
" most of the reform-stimulus has come from the eu , " said klein .
" the accession countries felt they should improve their business environment , slovakia ahead of all of them .
but also within the eu , a number of countries - spain , portugal , finland and belgium - have improved business regulations . " move to botswana ? the " doing business in 2005 " report follows the standard world bank line : economic liberalization and the opening of local markets comes with large payoffs .
as proof of that , michael klein pointed to turkey and france , both of which saw new business registration increase by 18 percent after the governments reduced the time and cost of starting a business . in the end , the report does , indirectly , offer a solution to german businessmen and women interested in a business friendly investment climate : they should move … to botswana . peter zimmerman -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german egovernment initiative off to a slow start the eu would like its citizens to use personal computers to do taxes and complete bureacratic formalities .

france and belgium have raised doubts over the project 's funding and its relationship to the wider us mission in the country . disagreement overshadowed a nato defense ministers meeting in the dutch seaside resort of noordwijk on friday aimed at discussing launching a training academy for senior iraqi military officers in iraq . the crucial deal on the training mission has the potential of settling almost two years of tension between the united states and some of its european partners over nato 's role in iraq .
the organization had already agreed to launch the training mission back in june . the major stumbling block had been opposition from paris , which had previously objected to operations inside iraq under a nato flag .
diplomats say france , which refuses to send any forces into iraq itself , has no problems with the technical aspects of the mission but wants to know what the added value of it would be . french defense minister michele alliot-marie said the foreign ministry in paris was still considering its options .
" we in france continue to believe that this training should be done outside iraq , " alliot-marie told reporters .
" iraq has to find its own sense of identity and i do n't think the addition of more foreigners in uniform will help that . "
if they were going in , she said the mission should remain " as low-profile as possible . " under a deal worked out among nato 's 26 member nations , it ’ s been suggested that the mission would report to the us officer in command of training operations in iraq .
a french diplomat said france wanted more assurances , however , that the officer would be answerable to the alliance .
in other words , there are fears that the alliance will end up being subordinate to the us-led coalition .
nato already has some 40 soldiers in iraq who began training army officers in collaboration with the defense ministry in baghdad .
the issue of the command structure led to a stormy debate in july . de hoop scheffer hopeful of deal nato general secretary jaap de hoop scheffer admitted friday that member states could n't see eye to eye on the issue .
" as it stands now , all 26 allies are n't completely satisfied , " de hoop scheffer said on the sidelines of the meeting . at the same time de hoop scheffer played down the differences and said he was optimistic that a compromise could be reached soon .
he insisted the differences were not " substantial " and included details of the training mission 's relationship with the much wider us mission to rebuild a new 260,000-strong iraqi army , and the question of protection for the alliance instructors . the north atlantic council , nato 's top decision-making body , will meet monday to re-examine the proposals .
british defense secretary geoff hoon was of the opinion that an agreement on the iraq issue was virtually in the bag .
and other officials insisted that the alliance “ is nearing agreement ” . doubts over funding but french reservations over the question of nato 's allegiance in iraq is n't the only issue causing argument among nato 's ranks . officials say that belgium balked at agreement because of problems it has with the project ’ s funding structure .
a belgian foreign ministry spokesman said they wanted to know who ’ s paying for what .
the operation is likely to be paid for from a mix of common nato funding and national financing . as plans stand now , around 300 nato instructors are to be sent to iraq to set up a training center for iraqi officers outside baghdad .
germany , france , belgium and now also spain have agreed that they will not send soldiers to iraq , but rather support the training of iraqi military and officials outside the country . although several of the nato allies have individually sent troops to join the us-led coalition , objections from france and germany had previously prevented the alliance taking a collective role in iraq , apart from offering logistical support to a polish-led multinational force of 6,000 troops operating in the center of the country . however , france , germany and the other allies agreed in june at a nato summit in istanbul to the creation of an alliance training mission for iraq . driving instructors and vehicle maintenance units german defense minister peter struck told reporters friday that the german army would train iraqis in the united arab emirates -lrb- uae -rrb- as driving instructors and also teach them how to carry out vehicle maintenance .
germany would also provide the vehicles needed for the purpose .
further training on mine-clearance would likely be carried out in germany , he said . germany had previously limited its training to iraqi police units .
struck told reporters german officials had drawn up the training plan after talks with iraqi counterparts in the uae . " for germany , this still means that there will be no single german soldier on the ground in iraq , " struck stressed . ben fajzullin -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de training role for nato troops in baghdad after meeting for the sixth time in three days , nato members finally agreed to send a small contingent of troops to iraq to train the country 's armed forces and help rebuild its military infrastructure .

the announcement comes just days before a nato summit , leading some to wonder what role the alliance will play in the region .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : turkey 's eu moment of truth verheugen : no more obstacles to talks with turkey capturing turkish culture 's changing face waiting for eu erdogan : " we have done our homework " europe -pipe- 18.09.2004 " a change in mentality is needed " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister erdogan says turkey is doing its best to meet entry criteria the eu commission is to publish a key report on october 6 on whether ankara is ready to open talks on joining the eu .
in an interview with deutsche welle , turkish pm tayyip erdogan said the country was on track . dw : on october 6th the european union commission is due to announce when and if membership talks with your country can take place .
what do you think brussels will decide ? recep tayyip erdogan : we are doing everything we can to influence this process in a positive way and to fulfill the criteria issued in copenhagen for accession talks .
at this point there are no problems with legislation on reforms .
when i asked mr. verheugen -lrb- eu enlargement commissioner -rrb- during his last visit here what we had to do to complete this legislation , he answered that turkey had already done everything , but that there were still problems with implementation .
we know that too , because implementation requires a change in mentality .
that 's part of a process and we are making every effort to push this process forward as fast as possible . while the eu commissioner was here , he was presented with reports from human rights organizations that say systematic torture continues in turkey .
is that charge baseless or unfair ? these allegations are completely unjustified .
they are totally groundless charges .
our ministry launched an immediate investigation .
and we have also been conducting inquiries into who initiated these accusations .
unfortunately , it is charges of this nature which are hindering turkey 's attempts to integrate into europe .
and i have the impression that 's something verheugen is all too aware of .
we have a zero-tolerance policy on the issue of torture .
systematic torture is unthinkable in a democratic system . up until now it 's been viewed as an open secret in brussels that on october 6th the eu commission would say yes to opening membership talks .
now a dispute has unfolded concerning proposed reforms to the turkish penal code which have since been put on hold .
where do things stand now ?
will the penal code be reformed , and when will the reforms become law ? turkey 's new criminal law is not part of the copenhagen criteria .
just as the draft legislation for reforms to the regional courts of appeal , or the new code for criminal procedure or the penal code , are not part of the copenhagen criteria .
these are steps we are taking as preparatory measures for moving towards the european union .
and it should not be forgotten that at this point there is only a common european constitution , but the eu has no common code of criminal law .
we are undertaking this reform of criminal law on our own initiative .
and i 'm convinced that 's something our european friends will appreciate . even so , the section which would make adultery a criminal offence is especially controversial .
is that something that is essential for you , or could you take that section out of the reform package if brussels were to insist on it ? this new law comprises a total of 346 paragraphs - and as such it is not necessarily so easy to appraise from a distance .
it would be unwise to restrict the discussion to the issue of adultery .
for us in the justice and development party , traditions are very important .
we stand for conservative values .
these principles are written in our party political program and are part of my government 's stated policy goals .
that is the aim of this article of law .
it 's intended to protect and strengthen the family .
the family is the most dynamic factor in turkish society .
moreover , this article of law was on the statutes between 1926 and 1996 at which time it was directed against women .
however , the new law foresees that if anyone brings a charge on grounds of infidelity and it comes to a court judgment , men and women shall be treated equally and the punishment shall be appropriate . is brussels exerting too much pressure ? no-one has raised that issue with me .
when mr. verheugen was here , i put the following question to him : does turkey need to do more ?
he answered ' no ' , but he did say that there were clear failings in the implementation of the reforms .
we 're aware of that too .
and we also discussed the issue of adultery .
mr verheugen said that this issue had nothing to do with the commission 's progress report .
he did , however , say that the topic of adultery could influence the decisions on when to begin talks .
i think we should now end this debate .
there are 25 eu members , not all of which fulfill the copenhagen criteria .
nonetheless , they are members of the european union . german conservative opposition leader angela merkel has written a letter to political leaders across europe in which she lobbied against full membership for turkey and instead pushed for a ' privileged partnership ' for your country .
you and your akp party are also members of the conservative camp - are you disappointed in miss merkel ? i find it hard to understand miss merkel .
and she is calling for understanding in our discussions . a privileged partnership is unthinkable in the eu . any nation that fulfills the copenhagen criteria can start membership talks . but we are not yet talking about full membership here , rather commencing negotiations on terms of entry . therefore we need a fair decision to set the process of negotiations in motion . if this process does not get underway , we will draw our own conclusions from this and take the necessary steps . i would like to stress that we are pushing for the fulfillment of the copenhagen criteria in the interests of our own people . but if there were really to be a negative decision , which i do n't believe there will be , then we will call this the ankara criteria and continue on our own path . the interview was conducted by alexander kudascheff send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu wants turkey to explain withdrawal of bill european union enlargement commissioner guenter verheugen on saturday called on turkey to clarify its decision to withdraw a key bill reforming its penal code , during talks with turkey 's eu ambassador .

18 , 2004 -rrb- waiting for eu many members of the turkish-german community are n't exactly sure what turkey 's membership in the eu would mean for them personally .

now it 's the nation 's highest court that tops the list . german interior minister otto schily on friday blamed a 2003 ruling by the federal constitutional court for contributing to the popularity of radical right-wing parties . its decision not to ban the parties ultimately led to their ascent , he told the financial times deutschland .
that a party using " clear anti-foreigner and anti-semitic propaganda " could receive enough votes to enter the state legislature is a result of the high court 's problematic decision , schily said . it poses a threat to germany 's political and legal structure and damages the country 's image as a destination for international investment , schily -lrb- photo -rrb- , a member of the social democrats , added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily officials in saxony expect the german national party -lrb- npd -rrb- to re-enter parliament and possibly increase their share of the vote in elections on sunday .
polls show the far-right german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- getting between 5 percent and 6 percent of the vote next door in the state of brandenburg .
politician spar over guilt the minister 's comments were " premature and panicked " former constitutional court justice berthold sommer told the tagespiegel newspaper .
other spd members also said it was wrong to hold the court responsible for german extremists .
" it 's not the judges that vote for the npd , " said dieter wiefelspütz , the spd 's spokesman for domestic affairs .
" it 's adult people . "
radical parties are seen to be taking advantage of chancellor gerhard schröder 's labor reforms to lure voters away from mainstream parties , christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- leader angela merkel said last week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : campaign posters appeal to voters upset with the government 's reforms green party head reinhard bütikofer said anyone looking for the reason why voters are losing interest in mainstream parties should look farther to the left at the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- .
typically strongest in eastern germany , the pds , which was the communist party of former east germany , has seen great improvements because hardly anyone could tell the difference between their campaign slogans and those of the npd and dvu , bütikofer said .
radicals stop hurting each other another reason for the far-right parties ' success is their agreement to stop poaching each other 's supporters .
since a political party needs at least 5 percent of the vote to be awarded seats in parliament , infighting kept all of them from clearing the barrier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : radical parties no longer fight each other for votes this sunday the npd will be on the ballot in saxony , where it 's typically stronger , leaving the dvu to get all the right-wing votes in brandenburg .
how to fight the far-right " go vote ! " was the message politicians from all parties carried through saxony and brandenburg during the past weeks .
the parties that dominate germany 's political middle , and even the protestant church , hope high voter turnout will minimize the percent of votes that go to radical parties , keeping them out of parliament .
" in difficult years we need a stable government , " said matthias platzeck -lrb- spd -rrb- , brandenburg 's incumbent premier .
" to get a stable government we need high voter turnout , because that 's the only guarantor that the extreme right wo n't be able to shape the state .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : turkey 's eu moment of truth verheugen : no more obstacles to talks with turkey capturing turkish culture 's changing face waiting for eu erdogan : " we have done our homework " europe -pipe- 18.09.2004 " a change in mentality is needed " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister erdogan says turkey is doing its best to meet entry criteria the eu commission is to publish a key report on october 6 on whether ankara is ready to open talks on joining the eu .
in an interview with deutsche welle , turkish pm tayyip erdogan said the country was on track . dw : on october 6th the european union commission is due to announce when and if membership talks with your country can take place .
what do you think brussels will decide ? recep tayyip erdogan : we are doing everything we can to influence this process in a positive way and to fulfill the criteria issued in copenhagen for accession talks .
at this point there are no problems with legislation on reforms .
when i asked mr. verheugen -lrb- eu enlargement commissioner -rrb- during his last visit here what we had to do to complete this legislation , he answered that turkey had already done everything , but that there were still problems with implementation .
we know that too , because implementation requires a change in mentality .
that 's part of a process and we are making every effort to push this process forward as fast as possible . while the eu commissioner was here , he was presented with reports from human rights organizations that say systematic torture continues in turkey .
is that charge baseless or unfair ? these allegations are completely unjustified .
they are totally groundless charges .
our ministry launched an immediate investigation .
and we have also been conducting inquiries into who initiated these accusations .
unfortunately , it is charges of this nature which are hindering turkey 's attempts to integrate into europe .
and i have the impression that 's something verheugen is all too aware of .
we have a zero-tolerance policy on the issue of torture .
systematic torture is unthinkable in a democratic system . up until now it 's been viewed as an open secret in brussels that on october 6th the eu commission would say yes to opening membership talks .
now a dispute has unfolded concerning proposed reforms to the turkish penal code which have since been put on hold .
where do things stand now ?
will the penal code be reformed , and when will the reforms become law ? turkey 's new criminal law is not part of the copenhagen criteria .
just as the draft legislation for reforms to the regional courts of appeal , or the new code for criminal procedure or the penal code , are not part of the copenhagen criteria .
these are steps we are taking as preparatory measures for moving towards the european union .
and it should not be forgotten that at this point there is only a common european constitution , but the eu has no common code of criminal law .
we are undertaking this reform of criminal law on our own initiative .
and i 'm convinced that 's something our european friends will appreciate . even so , the section which would make adultery a criminal offence is especially controversial .
is that something that is essential for you , or could you take that section out of the reform package if brussels were to insist on it ? this new law comprises a total of 346 paragraphs - and as such it is not necessarily so easy to appraise from a distance .
it would be unwise to restrict the discussion to the issue of adultery .
for us in the justice and development party , traditions are very important .
we stand for conservative values .
these principles are written in our party political program and are part of my government 's stated policy goals .
that is the aim of this article of law .
it 's intended to protect and strengthen the family .
the family is the most dynamic factor in turkish society .
moreover , this article of law was on the statutes between 1926 and 1996 at which time it was directed against women .
however , the new law foresees that if anyone brings a charge on grounds of infidelity and it comes to a court judgment , men and women shall be treated equally and the punishment shall be appropriate . is brussels exerting too much pressure ? no-one has raised that issue with me .
when mr. verheugen was here , i put the following question to him : does turkey need to do more ?
he answered ' no ' , but he did say that there were clear failings in the implementation of the reforms .
we 're aware of that too .
and we also discussed the issue of adultery .
mr verheugen said that this issue had nothing to do with the commission 's progress report .
he did , however , say that the topic of adultery could influence the decisions on when to begin talks .
i think we should now end this debate .
there are 25 eu members , not all of which fulfill the copenhagen criteria .
nonetheless , they are members of the european union . german conservative opposition leader angela merkel has written a letter to political leaders across europe in which she lobbied against full membership for turkey and instead pushed for a ' privileged partnership ' for your country .
you and your akp party are also members of the conservative camp - are you disappointed in miss merkel ? i find it hard to understand miss merkel .
and she is calling for understanding in our discussions . a privileged partnership is unthinkable in the eu . any nation that fulfills the copenhagen criteria can start membership talks . but we are not yet talking about full membership here , rather commencing negotiations on terms of entry . therefore we need a fair decision to set the process of negotiations in motion . if this process does not get underway , we will draw our own conclusions from this and take the necessary steps . i would like to stress that we are pushing for the fulfillment of the copenhagen criteria in the interests of our own people . but if there were really to be a negative decision , which i do n't believe there will be , then we will call this the ankara criteria and continue on our own path . the interview was conducted by alexander kudascheff send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu wants turkey to explain withdrawal of bill european union enlargement commissioner guenter verheugen on saturday called on turkey to clarify its decision to withdraw a key bill reforming its penal code , during talks with turkey 's eu ambassador .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 18.09.2004 cutting through the red tape großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paperwork and red tape hinders economic growth , says the report the world bank 's " doing business in 2005 " report on business practices and bureaucracy shows many countries , germany included , are stifling growth and enterprise by wrapping simple procedures in masses of red tape . the world bank 's report , “ doing business in 2005 : removing obstacles to growth , ” looked at the levels of bureaucracy businesses face in 145 countries .
the report showed which countries have the least red-tape and where it 's easiest to become an entrepreneur . this is the second year the world bank has issued rankings on business environment indicators : more than 3,000 local experts investigated practices in 145 nations , asking whether it was easy or difficult to start a small or medium-size business and whether administrations made it hard to hire and fire . among the other things compared were hiring and firing practices , how easy it was to register property , the ease of contract enforcement , and - for the first time in 2003 - the property registration process and to what extent investors were protected . of the industrial countries , new zealand , australia and norway came out on top .
but where was germany , a country famed throughout the world for doing things by the book ? german procedures take twice as long it takes a businessman in finland three simple procedures and two weeks to turn his idea into a company .
german competitors , however , have to spend 45 days wading through nine procedures , twice as long as the world average .
that kind of bureaucratic hassle meant germany was n't among the top twenty . gabi beermeister , a young woman who runs a small kiosk in berlin , told dw-world german bureaucracy was getting worse . " selling bread rolls , cigarettes and sweets required a special catering permit , so i applied to the health authorities , " she said .
" but they asked for so many things - architect drawings of the business premises , a permit from the building authorities , letters of approval from banks … i simply gave up . " german government claims successes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement .
although germany ranked only slightly better than mediocre in the " doing business in 2005 " report , germany ’ s minister of commerce wolfgang clement told the handelsblatt newspaper that the report didn ’ t do germany justice .
he pointed out 2003 reforms , like the " hours of trading act " , which simplified trade guild rules and improved workplace regulations . meanwhile , the german ministry of justice has been searching the german law books for unnecessary regulations in a bid to streamline procedures .
two hundred laws and by-laws need to be abolished , found the ministry . bureaucratic countries pay a high price an easy business climate has many benefits , michael klein told dw-world .
he believes that the easier it is to start a new company , the higher the chances of reducing unemployment and spurring the economy . " we find that 25 percent of the countries that have the most complicated and bureaucratic regulations tend to grow roughly 2 percent less per year than the countries that have easy and well-structured regulations , " klein said . this knowledge has certainly prompted many european nations , not just germany , to tackle reform .
" most of the reform-stimulus has come from the eu , " said klein .
" the accession countries felt they should improve their business environment , slovakia ahead of all of them .
but also within the eu , a number of countries - spain , portugal , finland and belgium - have improved business regulations . " move to botswana ? the " doing business in 2005 " report follows the standard world bank line : economic liberalization and the opening of local markets comes with large payoffs .

the comments have raised the ire of social groups . german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s interview in the guter rat consumer magazine on friday echoes statements he ’ s made throughout the summer as he tries to hammer through controversial reforms to the country ’ s cumbersome social welfare state . " in both the east and the west , there 's a mentality which extends well into the middle class that you should claim state allowances wherever you can get them , even when there 's an adequate income in the family , " schröder told the magazine .
“ no welfare state can reasonably expect to manage such a burden , ” he added . the chancellor underlined that the public at large realizes that the social system has to change , but that it has balked when confronted with concrete changes that impact them directly , and called for citizens to accept what he said was the inevitable . chancellor far removed from reality ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of protestors march against reforms in leipzig his comments follow weeks of protests , particularly in former communist eastern germany , over tough welfare cuts that will introduce stringent means testing on those claiming unemployment benefits and will make people with a certain level of savings ineligible for welfare . popular anger has arisen in the country with as many as 80,000 people taking to the streets across the country in weekly protests every monday . schröder has been greeted by eggs and heckles as much as by cheers since announcing the reforms . predictably , the chancellor 's comments on friday triggered a heated discussion and drove another wedge between schröder and social support groups who have largely denounced the reforms as being " socially unfair " and " forcing people into poverty . " ulrich schneider , head of the paritätisch wohlfahrtsverband , a leading german social welfare support group , told berlin daily tagesspiegel that schröder 's comments " indicate how far the chancellor is removed from the reality of these people , ” who he says have to count every euro and pinch every penny .
thomas broch , who heads german caritas , also lashed out at the chancellor . “ schröder belittles the people who are already on the losing side of society , ” he said . schröder : " bitter reproaches from our children " government spokesman bela anda acted quickly to point out that schröder was only referring to those who don ’ t need government support , but get it anyway .
he stressed that applied as much to higher upper income groups who claim more than their share from government as it does to middle-income and lower-income people . the negative reactions seem to have caught the government and supporters of reform off-guard , especially since the chancellor had made similar comments throughout his fight to trim the welfare state and loosen labor laws . several influential social democratic politicians have come to the chancellor ’ s defense .
rainer wend , chairman of the bundestag ’ s committee for economics and labor , said the chancellor ’ s remarks were “ dead on ” and derided the outcry as " good old fashioned feigned fury " , noting that the critique applies just as well to wealthy citizens who exploit tax loopholes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- chairwoman angela merkel support for the chancellor has also poured in from the opposition camp .
“ there is certainly a tendency that some people have found they can live fairly well by relying on the social system and doing a bit of undocumented work on the side , ” angela merkel , head of the conservative christian democratic union party told a television station .
she added that people who truly need help often don ’ t apply for welfare . for his part , schröder again defended labor market reforms on friday , saying they were necessary if germany was to deal with the challenges of an ageing population and high labor costs , without imposing an excessive burden on future generations . " i am convinced that if we do n't start the reform process and conclude it within a decade , we will have to face bitter reproaches from our children and grandchildren , " he said . steve zwick -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reform anger could turn violent a series of violent incidents related to anger at the german government 's welfare reforms have some worried that widespread discontent among the populace could lead a surge in aggressive and illegal behavior .

“ there is certainly a tendency that some people have found they can live fairly well by relying on the social system and doing a bit of undocumented work on the side , ” angela merkel , head of the conservative christian democratic union party told a television station .
she added that people who truly need help often don ’ t apply for welfare . for his part , schröder again defended labor market reforms on friday , saying they were necessary if germany was to deal with the challenges of an ageing population and high labor costs , without imposing an excessive burden on future generations . " i am convinced that if we do n't start the reform process and conclude it within a decade , we will have to face bitter reproaches from our children and grandchildren , " he said . steve zwick -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reform anger could turn violent a series of violent incidents related to anger at the german government 's welfare reforms have some worried that widespread discontent among the populace could lead a surge in aggressive and illegal behavior .
-lrb- august 28 , 2004 -rrb- protests turn ugly as eggs and insults fly the wave of protests against the german government 's proposed welfare and job market reforms took a nasty turn on tuesday as chancellor gerhard schröder ran the gauntlet of public unrest in the east of the country .

france and belgium have raised doubts over the project 's funding and its relationship to the wider us mission in the country . disagreement overshadowed a nato defense ministers meeting in the dutch seaside resort of noordwijk on friday aimed at discussing launching a training academy for senior iraqi military officers in iraq . the crucial deal on the training mission has the potential of settling almost two years of tension between the united states and some of its european partners over nato 's role in iraq .
the organization had already agreed to launch the training mission back in june . the major stumbling block had been opposition from paris , which had previously objected to operations inside iraq under a nato flag .
diplomats say france , which refuses to send any forces into iraq itself , has no problems with the technical aspects of the mission but wants to know what the added value of it would be . french defense minister michele alliot-marie said the foreign ministry in paris was still considering its options .
" we in france continue to believe that this training should be done outside iraq , " alliot-marie told reporters .
" iraq has to find its own sense of identity and i do n't think the addition of more foreigners in uniform will help that . "
if they were going in , she said the mission should remain " as low-profile as possible . " under a deal worked out among nato 's 26 member nations , it ’ s been suggested that the mission would report to the us officer in command of training operations in iraq .
a french diplomat said france wanted more assurances , however , that the officer would be answerable to the alliance .
in other words , there are fears that the alliance will end up being subordinate to the us-led coalition .
nato already has some 40 soldiers in iraq who began training army officers in collaboration with the defense ministry in baghdad .
the issue of the command structure led to a stormy debate in july . de hoop scheffer hopeful of deal nato general secretary jaap de hoop scheffer admitted friday that member states could n't see eye to eye on the issue .
" as it stands now , all 26 allies are n't completely satisfied , " de hoop scheffer said on the sidelines of the meeting . at the same time de hoop scheffer played down the differences and said he was optimistic that a compromise could be reached soon .
he insisted the differences were not " substantial " and included details of the training mission 's relationship with the much wider us mission to rebuild a new 260,000-strong iraqi army , and the question of protection for the alliance instructors . the north atlantic council , nato 's top decision-making body , will meet monday to re-examine the proposals .
british defense secretary geoff hoon was of the opinion that an agreement on the iraq issue was virtually in the bag .
and other officials insisted that the alliance “ is nearing agreement ” . doubts over funding but french reservations over the question of nato 's allegiance in iraq is n't the only issue causing argument among nato 's ranks . officials say that belgium balked at agreement because of problems it has with the project ’ s funding structure .
a belgian foreign ministry spokesman said they wanted to know who ’ s paying for what .
the operation is likely to be paid for from a mix of common nato funding and national financing . as plans stand now , around 300 nato instructors are to be sent to iraq to set up a training center for iraqi officers outside baghdad .
germany , france , belgium and now also spain have agreed that they will not send soldiers to iraq , but rather support the training of iraqi military and officials outside the country . although several of the nato allies have individually sent troops to join the us-led coalition , objections from france and germany had previously prevented the alliance taking a collective role in iraq , apart from offering logistical support to a polish-led multinational force of 6,000 troops operating in the center of the country . however , france , germany and the other allies agreed in june at a nato summit in istanbul to the creation of an alliance training mission for iraq . driving instructors and vehicle maintenance units german defense minister peter struck told reporters friday that the german army would train iraqis in the united arab emirates -lrb- uae -rrb- as driving instructors and also teach them how to carry out vehicle maintenance .
germany would also provide the vehicles needed for the purpose .
further training on mine-clearance would likely be carried out in germany , he said . germany had previously limited its training to iraqi police units .
struck told reporters german officials had drawn up the training plan after talks with iraqi counterparts in the uae . " for germany , this still means that there will be no single german soldier on the ground in iraq , " struck stressed . ben fajzullin -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de training role for nato troops in baghdad after meeting for the sixth time in three days , nato members finally agreed to send a small contingent of troops to iraq to train the country 's armed forces and help rebuild its military infrastructure .

france and belgium have raised doubts over the project 's funding and its relationship to the wider us mission in the country . disagreement overshadowed a nato defense ministers meeting in the dutch seaside resort of noordwijk on friday aimed at discussing launching a training academy for senior iraqi military officers in iraq . the crucial deal on the training mission has the potential of settling almost two years of tension between the united states and some of its european partners over nato 's role in iraq .
the organization had already agreed to launch the training mission back in june . the major stumbling block had been opposition from paris , which had previously objected to operations inside iraq under a nato flag .
diplomats say france , which refuses to send any forces into iraq itself , has no problems with the technical aspects of the mission but wants to know what the added value of it would be . french defense minister michele alliot-marie said the foreign ministry in paris was still considering its options .
" we in france continue to believe that this training should be done outside iraq , " alliot-marie told reporters .
" iraq has to find its own sense of identity and i do n't think the addition of more foreigners in uniform will help that . "
if they were going in , she said the mission should remain " as low-profile as possible . " under a deal worked out among nato 's 26 member nations , it ’ s been suggested that the mission would report to the us officer in command of training operations in iraq .
a french diplomat said france wanted more assurances , however , that the officer would be answerable to the alliance .
in other words , there are fears that the alliance will end up being subordinate to the us-led coalition .
nato already has some 40 soldiers in iraq who began training army officers in collaboration with the defense ministry in baghdad .
the issue of the command structure led to a stormy debate in july . de hoop scheffer hopeful of deal nato general secretary jaap de hoop scheffer admitted friday that member states could n't see eye to eye on the issue .
" as it stands now , all 26 allies are n't completely satisfied , " de hoop scheffer said on the sidelines of the meeting . at the same time de hoop scheffer played down the differences and said he was optimistic that a compromise could be reached soon .
he insisted the differences were not " substantial " and included details of the training mission 's relationship with the much wider us mission to rebuild a new 260,000-strong iraqi army , and the question of protection for the alliance instructors . the north atlantic council , nato 's top decision-making body , will meet monday to re-examine the proposals .
british defense secretary geoff hoon was of the opinion that an agreement on the iraq issue was virtually in the bag .
and other officials insisted that the alliance “ is nearing agreement ” . doubts over funding but french reservations over the question of nato 's allegiance in iraq is n't the only issue causing argument among nato 's ranks . officials say that belgium balked at agreement because of problems it has with the project ’ s funding structure .
a belgian foreign ministry spokesman said they wanted to know who ’ s paying for what .
the operation is likely to be paid for from a mix of common nato funding and national financing . as plans stand now , around 300 nato instructors are to be sent to iraq to set up a training center for iraqi officers outside baghdad .
germany , france , belgium and now also spain have agreed that they will not send soldiers to iraq , but rather support the training of iraqi military and officials outside the country . although several of the nato allies have individually sent troops to join the us-led coalition , objections from france and germany had previously prevented the alliance taking a collective role in iraq , apart from offering logistical support to a polish-led multinational force of 6,000 troops operating in the center of the country . however , france , germany and the other allies agreed in june at a nato summit in istanbul to the creation of an alliance training mission for iraq . driving instructors and vehicle maintenance units german defense minister peter struck told reporters friday that the german army would train iraqis in the united arab emirates -lrb- uae -rrb- as driving instructors and also teach them how to carry out vehicle maintenance .
germany would also provide the vehicles needed for the purpose .
further training on mine-clearance would likely be carried out in germany , he said . germany had previously limited its training to iraqi police units .
struck told reporters german officials had drawn up the training plan after talks with iraqi counterparts in the uae . " for germany , this still means that there will be no single german soldier on the ground in iraq , " struck stressed . ben fajzullin -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de training role for nato troops in baghdad after meeting for the sixth time in three days , nato members finally agreed to send a small contingent of troops to iraq to train the country 's armed forces and help rebuild its military infrastructure .

the announcement comes just days before a nato summit , leading some to wonder what role the alliance will play in the region .

now it 's the nation 's highest court that tops the list . german interior minister otto schily on friday blamed a 2003 ruling by the federal constitutional court for contributing to the popularity of radical right-wing parties . its decision not to ban the parties ultimately led to their ascent , he told the financial times deutschland .
that a party using " clear anti-foreigner and anti-semitic propaganda " could receive enough votes to enter the state legislature is a result of the high court 's problematic decision , schily said . it poses a threat to germany 's political and legal structure and damages the country 's image as a destination for international investment , schily -lrb- photo -rrb- , a member of the social democrats , added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily officials in saxony expect the german national party -lrb- npd -rrb- to re-enter parliament and possibly increase their share of the vote in elections on sunday .
polls show the far-right german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- getting between 5 percent and 6 percent of the vote next door in the state of brandenburg .
politician spar over guilt the minister 's comments were " premature and panicked " former constitutional court justice berthold sommer told the tagespiegel newspaper .
other spd members also said it was wrong to hold the court responsible for german extremists .
" it 's not the judges that vote for the npd , " said dieter wiefelspütz , the spd 's spokesman for domestic affairs .
" it 's adult people . "
radical parties are seen to be taking advantage of chancellor gerhard schröder 's labor reforms to lure voters away from mainstream parties , christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- leader angela merkel said last week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : campaign posters appeal to voters upset with the government 's reforms green party head reinhard bütikofer said anyone looking for the reason why voters are losing interest in mainstream parties should look farther to the left at the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- .
typically strongest in eastern germany , the pds , which was the communist party of former east germany , has seen great improvements because hardly anyone could tell the difference between their campaign slogans and those of the npd and dvu , bütikofer said .
radicals stop hurting each other another reason for the far-right parties ' success is their agreement to stop poaching each other 's supporters .
since a political party needs at least 5 percent of the vote to be awarded seats in parliament , infighting kept all of them from clearing the barrier .

france and belgium have raised doubts over the project 's funding and its relationship to the wider us mission in the country . disagreement overshadowed a nato defense ministers meeting in the dutch seaside resort of noordwijk on friday aimed at discussing launching a training academy for senior iraqi military officers in iraq . the crucial deal on the training mission has the potential of settling almost two years of tension between the united states and some of its european partners over nato 's role in iraq .
the organization had already agreed to launch the training mission back in june . the major stumbling block had been opposition from paris , which had previously objected to operations inside iraq under a nato flag .
diplomats say france , which refuses to send any forces into iraq itself , has no problems with the technical aspects of the mission but wants to know what the added value of it would be . french defense minister michele alliot-marie said the foreign ministry in paris was still considering its options .
" we in france continue to believe that this training should be done outside iraq , " alliot-marie told reporters .
" iraq has to find its own sense of identity and i do n't think the addition of more foreigners in uniform will help that . "
if they were going in , she said the mission should remain " as low-profile as possible . " under a deal worked out among nato 's 26 member nations , it ’ s been suggested that the mission would report to the us officer in command of training operations in iraq .
a french diplomat said france wanted more assurances , however , that the officer would be answerable to the alliance .
in other words , there are fears that the alliance will end up being subordinate to the us-led coalition .
nato already has some 40 soldiers in iraq who began training army officers in collaboration with the defense ministry in baghdad .
the issue of the command structure led to a stormy debate in july . de hoop scheffer hopeful of deal nato general secretary jaap de hoop scheffer admitted friday that member states could n't see eye to eye on the issue .
" as it stands now , all 26 allies are n't completely satisfied , " de hoop scheffer said on the sidelines of the meeting . at the same time de hoop scheffer played down the differences and said he was optimistic that a compromise could be reached soon .
he insisted the differences were not " substantial " and included details of the training mission 's relationship with the much wider us mission to rebuild a new 260,000-strong iraqi army , and the question of protection for the alliance instructors . the north atlantic council , nato 's top decision-making body , will meet monday to re-examine the proposals .
british defense secretary geoff hoon was of the opinion that an agreement on the iraq issue was virtually in the bag .
and other officials insisted that the alliance “ is nearing agreement ” . doubts over funding but french reservations over the question of nato 's allegiance in iraq is n't the only issue causing argument among nato 's ranks . officials say that belgium balked at agreement because of problems it has with the project ’ s funding structure .
a belgian foreign ministry spokesman said they wanted to know who ’ s paying for what .
the operation is likely to be paid for from a mix of common nato funding and national financing . as plans stand now , around 300 nato instructors are to be sent to iraq to set up a training center for iraqi officers outside baghdad .
germany , france , belgium and now also spain have agreed that they will not send soldiers to iraq , but rather support the training of iraqi military and officials outside the country . although several of the nato allies have individually sent troops to join the us-led coalition , objections from france and germany had previously prevented the alliance taking a collective role in iraq , apart from offering logistical support to a polish-led multinational force of 6,000 troops operating in the center of the country . however , france , germany and the other allies agreed in june at a nato summit in istanbul to the creation of an alliance training mission for iraq . driving instructors and vehicle maintenance units german defense minister peter struck told reporters friday that the german army would train iraqis in the united arab emirates -lrb- uae -rrb- as driving instructors and also teach them how to carry out vehicle maintenance .
germany would also provide the vehicles needed for the purpose .
further training on mine-clearance would likely be carried out in germany , he said . germany had previously limited its training to iraqi police units .
struck told reporters german officials had drawn up the training plan after talks with iraqi counterparts in the uae . " for germany , this still means that there will be no single german soldier on the ground in iraq , " struck stressed . ben fajzullin -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de training role for nato troops in baghdad after meeting for the sixth time in three days , nato members finally agreed to send a small contingent of troops to iraq to train the country 's armed forces and help rebuild its military infrastructure .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : turkey 's eu moment of truth verheugen : no more obstacles to talks with turkey capturing turkish culture 's changing face waiting for eu erdogan : " we have done our homework " europe -pipe- 18.09.2004 " a change in mentality is needed " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister erdogan says turkey is doing its best to meet entry criteria the eu commission is to publish a key report on october 6 on whether ankara is ready to open talks on joining the eu .
in an interview with deutsche welle , turkish pm tayyip erdogan said the country was on track . dw : on october 6th the european union commission is due to announce when and if membership talks with your country can take place .
what do you think brussels will decide ? recep tayyip erdogan : we are doing everything we can to influence this process in a positive way and to fulfill the criteria issued in copenhagen for accession talks .
at this point there are no problems with legislation on reforms .
when i asked mr. verheugen -lrb- eu enlargement commissioner -rrb- during his last visit here what we had to do to complete this legislation , he answered that turkey had already done everything , but that there were still problems with implementation .
we know that too , because implementation requires a change in mentality .
that 's part of a process and we are making every effort to push this process forward as fast as possible . while the eu commissioner was here , he was presented with reports from human rights organizations that say systematic torture continues in turkey .
is that charge baseless or unfair ? these allegations are completely unjustified .
they are totally groundless charges .
our ministry launched an immediate investigation .
and we have also been conducting inquiries into who initiated these accusations .
unfortunately , it is charges of this nature which are hindering turkey 's attempts to integrate into europe .
and i have the impression that 's something verheugen is all too aware of .
we have a zero-tolerance policy on the issue of torture .
systematic torture is unthinkable in a democratic system . up until now it 's been viewed as an open secret in brussels that on october 6th the eu commission would say yes to opening membership talks .
now a dispute has unfolded concerning proposed reforms to the turkish penal code which have since been put on hold .
where do things stand now ?
will the penal code be reformed , and when will the reforms become law ? turkey 's new criminal law is not part of the copenhagen criteria .
just as the draft legislation for reforms to the regional courts of appeal , or the new code for criminal procedure or the penal code , are not part of the copenhagen criteria .
these are steps we are taking as preparatory measures for moving towards the european union .
and it should not be forgotten that at this point there is only a common european constitution , but the eu has no common code of criminal law .
we are undertaking this reform of criminal law on our own initiative .
and i 'm convinced that 's something our european friends will appreciate . even so , the section which would make adultery a criminal offence is especially controversial .
is that something that is essential for you , or could you take that section out of the reform package if brussels were to insist on it ? this new law comprises a total of 346 paragraphs - and as such it is not necessarily so easy to appraise from a distance .
it would be unwise to restrict the discussion to the issue of adultery .
for us in the justice and development party , traditions are very important .
we stand for conservative values .
these principles are written in our party political program and are part of my government 's stated policy goals .
that is the aim of this article of law .
it 's intended to protect and strengthen the family .
the family is the most dynamic factor in turkish society .
moreover , this article of law was on the statutes between 1926 and 1996 at which time it was directed against women .
however , the new law foresees that if anyone brings a charge on grounds of infidelity and it comes to a court judgment , men and women shall be treated equally and the punishment shall be appropriate . is brussels exerting too much pressure ? no-one has raised that issue with me .
when mr. verheugen was here , i put the following question to him : does turkey need to do more ?
he answered ' no ' , but he did say that there were clear failings in the implementation of the reforms .
we 're aware of that too .
and we also discussed the issue of adultery .
mr verheugen said that this issue had nothing to do with the commission 's progress report .
he did , however , say that the topic of adultery could influence the decisions on when to begin talks .
i think we should now end this debate .
there are 25 eu members , not all of which fulfill the copenhagen criteria .
nonetheless , they are members of the european union . german conservative opposition leader angela merkel has written a letter to political leaders across europe in which she lobbied against full membership for turkey and instead pushed for a ' privileged partnership ' for your country .
you and your akp party are also members of the conservative camp - are you disappointed in miss merkel ? i find it hard to understand miss merkel .
and she is calling for understanding in our discussions . a privileged partnership is unthinkable in the eu . any nation that fulfills the copenhagen criteria can start membership talks . but we are not yet talking about full membership here , rather commencing negotiations on terms of entry . therefore we need a fair decision to set the process of negotiations in motion . if this process does not get underway , we will draw our own conclusions from this and take the necessary steps . i would like to stress that we are pushing for the fulfillment of the copenhagen criteria in the interests of our own people . but if there were really to be a negative decision , which i do n't believe there will be , then we will call this the ankara criteria and continue on our own path . the interview was conducted by alexander kudascheff send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu wants turkey to explain withdrawal of bill european union enlargement commissioner guenter verheugen on saturday called on turkey to clarify its decision to withdraw a key bill reforming its penal code , during talks with turkey 's eu ambassador .

the report showed which countries have the least red-tape and where it 's easiest to become an entrepreneur . this is the second year the world bank has issued rankings on business environment indicators : more than 3,000 local experts investigated practices in 145 nations , asking whether it was easy or difficult to start a small or medium-size business and whether administrations made it hard to hire and fire . among the other things compared were hiring and firing practices , how easy it was to register property , the ease of contract enforcement , and - for the first time in 2003 - the property registration process and to what extent investors were protected . of the industrial countries , new zealand , australia and norway came out on top .
but where was germany , a country famed throughout the world for doing things by the book ? german procedures take twice as long it takes a businessman in finland three simple procedures and two weeks to turn his idea into a company .
german competitors , however , have to spend 45 days wading through nine procedures , twice as long as the world average .
that kind of bureaucratic hassle meant germany was n't among the top twenty . gabi beermeister , a young woman who runs a small kiosk in berlin , told dw-world german bureaucracy was getting worse . " selling bread rolls , cigarettes and sweets required a special catering permit , so i applied to the health authorities , " she said .
" but they asked for so many things - architect drawings of the business premises , a permit from the building authorities , letters of approval from banks … i simply gave up . " german government claims successes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement .
although germany ranked only slightly better than mediocre in the " doing business in 2005 " report , germany ’ s minister of commerce wolfgang clement told the handelsblatt newspaper that the report didn ’ t do germany justice .
he pointed out 2003 reforms , like the " hours of trading act " , which simplified trade guild rules and improved workplace regulations . meanwhile , the german ministry of justice has been searching the german law books for unnecessary regulations in a bid to streamline procedures .
two hundred laws and by-laws need to be abolished , found the ministry . bureaucratic countries pay a high price an easy business climate has many benefits , michael klein told dw-world .
he believes that the easier it is to start a new company , the higher the chances of reducing unemployment and spurring the economy . " we find that 25 percent of the countries that have the most complicated and bureaucratic regulations tend to grow roughly 2 percent less per year than the countries that have easy and well-structured regulations , " klein said . this knowledge has certainly prompted many european nations , not just germany , to tackle reform .
" most of the reform-stimulus has come from the eu , " said klein .
" the accession countries felt they should improve their business environment , slovakia ahead of all of them .
but also within the eu , a number of countries - spain , portugal , finland and belgium - have improved business regulations . " move to botswana ? the " doing business in 2005 " report follows the standard world bank line : economic liberalization and the opening of local markets comes with large payoffs .
as proof of that , michael klein pointed to turkey and france , both of which saw new business registration increase by 18 percent after the governments reduced the time and cost of starting a business . in the end , the report does , indirectly , offer a solution to german businessmen and women interested in a business friendly investment climate : they should move … to botswana . peter zimmerman -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german egovernment initiative off to a slow start the eu would like its citizens to use personal computers to do taxes and complete bureacratic formalities .

in an interview with deutsche welle , turkish pm tayyip erdogan said the country was on track . dw : on october 6th the european union commission is due to announce when and if membership talks with your country can take place .
what do you think brussels will decide ? recep tayyip erdogan : we are doing everything we can to influence this process in a positive way and to fulfill the criteria issued in copenhagen for accession talks .
at this point there are no problems with legislation on reforms .
when i asked mr. verheugen -lrb- eu enlargement commissioner -rrb- during his last visit here what we had to do to complete this legislation , he answered that turkey had already done everything , but that there were still problems with implementation .
we know that too , because implementation requires a change in mentality .
that 's part of a process and we are making every effort to push this process forward as fast as possible . while the eu commissioner was here , he was presented with reports from human rights organizations that say systematic torture continues in turkey .
is that charge baseless or unfair ? these allegations are completely unjustified .
they are totally groundless charges .
our ministry launched an immediate investigation .
and we have also been conducting inquiries into who initiated these accusations .
unfortunately , it is charges of this nature which are hindering turkey 's attempts to integrate into europe .
and i have the impression that 's something verheugen is all too aware of .
we have a zero-tolerance policy on the issue of torture .
systematic torture is unthinkable in a democratic system . up until now it 's been viewed as an open secret in brussels that on october 6th the eu commission would say yes to opening membership talks .
now a dispute has unfolded concerning proposed reforms to the turkish penal code which have since been put on hold .
where do things stand now ?
will the penal code be reformed , and when will the reforms become law ? turkey 's new criminal law is not part of the copenhagen criteria .
just as the draft legislation for reforms to the regional courts of appeal , or the new code for criminal procedure or the penal code , are not part of the copenhagen criteria .
these are steps we are taking as preparatory measures for moving towards the european union .
and it should not be forgotten that at this point there is only a common european constitution , but the eu has no common code of criminal law .
we are undertaking this reform of criminal law on our own initiative .
and i 'm convinced that 's something our european friends will appreciate . even so , the section which would make adultery a criminal offence is especially controversial .
is that something that is essential for you , or could you take that section out of the reform package if brussels were to insist on it ? this new law comprises a total of 346 paragraphs - and as such it is not necessarily so easy to appraise from a distance .
it would be unwise to restrict the discussion to the issue of adultery .
for us in the justice and development party , traditions are very important .
we stand for conservative values .
these principles are written in our party political program and are part of my government 's stated policy goals .
that is the aim of this article of law .
it 's intended to protect and strengthen the family .
the family is the most dynamic factor in turkish society .
moreover , this article of law was on the statutes between 1926 and 1996 at which time it was directed against women .
however , the new law foresees that if anyone brings a charge on grounds of infidelity and it comes to a court judgment , men and women shall be treated equally and the punishment shall be appropriate . is brussels exerting too much pressure ? no-one has raised that issue with me .
when mr. verheugen was here , i put the following question to him : does turkey need to do more ?
he answered ' no ' , but he did say that there were clear failings in the implementation of the reforms .
we 're aware of that too .
and we also discussed the issue of adultery .
mr verheugen said that this issue had nothing to do with the commission 's progress report .
he did , however , say that the topic of adultery could influence the decisions on when to begin talks .
i think we should now end this debate .
there are 25 eu members , not all of which fulfill the copenhagen criteria .
nonetheless , they are members of the european union . german conservative opposition leader angela merkel has written a letter to political leaders across europe in which she lobbied against full membership for turkey and instead pushed for a ' privileged partnership ' for your country .
you and your akp party are also members of the conservative camp - are you disappointed in miss merkel ? i find it hard to understand miss merkel .
and she is calling for understanding in our discussions . a privileged partnership is unthinkable in the eu . any nation that fulfills the copenhagen criteria can start membership talks . but we are not yet talking about full membership here , rather commencing negotiations on terms of entry . therefore we need a fair decision to set the process of negotiations in motion . if this process does not get underway , we will draw our own conclusions from this and take the necessary steps . i would like to stress that we are pushing for the fulfillment of the copenhagen criteria in the interests of our own people . but if there were really to be a negative decision , which i do n't believe there will be , then we will call this the ankara criteria and continue on our own path . the interview was conducted by alexander kudascheff send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu wants turkey to explain withdrawal of bill european union enlargement commissioner guenter verheugen on saturday called on turkey to clarify its decision to withdraw a key bill reforming its penal code , during talks with turkey 's eu ambassador .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.09.2004 who 's to blame for far-right extremism ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german minister thinks these judges helped the rise of the right there 's plenty to blame for the rise of extremists in germany : ex-communists , unemployment and social reforms all had their turn .
now it 's the nation 's highest court that tops the list . german interior minister otto schily on friday blamed a 2003 ruling by the federal constitutional court for contributing to the popularity of radical right-wing parties . its decision not to ban the parties ultimately led to their ascent , he told the financial times deutschland .
that a party using " clear anti-foreigner and anti-semitic propaganda " could receive enough votes to enter the state legislature is a result of the high court 's problematic decision , schily said . it poses a threat to germany 's political and legal structure and damages the country 's image as a destination for international investment , schily -lrb- photo -rrb- , a member of the social democrats , added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily officials in saxony expect the german national party -lrb- npd -rrb- to re-enter parliament and possibly increase their share of the vote in elections on sunday .
polls show the far-right german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- getting between 5 percent and 6 percent of the vote next door in the state of brandenburg .
politician spar over guilt the minister 's comments were " premature and panicked " former constitutional court justice berthold sommer told the tagespiegel newspaper .
other spd members also said it was wrong to hold the court responsible for german extremists .
" it 's not the judges that vote for the npd , " said dieter wiefelspütz , the spd 's spokesman for domestic affairs .
" it 's adult people . "
radical parties are seen to be taking advantage of chancellor gerhard schröder 's labor reforms to lure voters away from mainstream parties , christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- leader angela merkel said last week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : campaign posters appeal to voters upset with the government 's reforms green party head reinhard bütikofer said anyone looking for the reason why voters are losing interest in mainstream parties should look farther to the left at the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- .
typically strongest in eastern germany , the pds , which was the communist party of former east germany , has seen great improvements because hardly anyone could tell the difference between their campaign slogans and those of the npd and dvu , bütikofer said .
radicals stop hurting each other another reason for the far-right parties ' success is their agreement to stop poaching each other 's supporters .
since a political party needs at least 5 percent of the vote to be awarded seats in parliament , infighting kept all of them from clearing the barrier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : radical parties no longer fight each other for votes this sunday the npd will be on the ballot in saxony , where it 's typically stronger , leaving the dvu to get all the right-wing votes in brandenburg .
how to fight the far-right " go vote ! " was the message politicians from all parties carried through saxony and brandenburg during the past weeks .
the parties that dominate germany 's political middle , and even the protestant church , hope high voter turnout will minimize the percent of votes that go to radical parties , keeping them out of parliament .
" in difficult years we need a stable government , " said matthias platzeck -lrb- spd -rrb- , brandenburg 's incumbent premier .
" to get a stable government we need high voter turnout , because that 's the only guarantor that the extreme right wo n't be able to shape the state .

high unemployment and the eu 's expansion have boosted extremist views in parts of the region .
-lrb- sept .
17 , 2004 -rrb- spd braces for tough state polls members of chancellor schröder 's spd party in the german states of saxony and brandenburg fear voters are planning to vent their anger at federal government 's economic reforms during this sunday 's local elections .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : turkey 's eu moment of truth verheugen : no more obstacles to talks with turkey capturing turkish culture 's changing face waiting for eu erdogan : " we have done our homework " europe -pipe- 18.09.2004 " a change in mentality is needed " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister erdogan says turkey is doing its best to meet entry criteria the eu commission is to publish a key report on october 6 on whether ankara is ready to open talks on joining the eu .
in an interview with deutsche welle , turkish pm tayyip erdogan said the country was on track . dw : on october 6th the european union commission is due to announce when and if membership talks with your country can take place .
what do you think brussels will decide ? recep tayyip erdogan : we are doing everything we can to influence this process in a positive way and to fulfill the criteria issued in copenhagen for accession talks .
at this point there are no problems with legislation on reforms .
when i asked mr. verheugen -lrb- eu enlargement commissioner -rrb- during his last visit here what we had to do to complete this legislation , he answered that turkey had already done everything , but that there were still problems with implementation .
we know that too , because implementation requires a change in mentality .
that 's part of a process and we are making every effort to push this process forward as fast as possible . while the eu commissioner was here , he was presented with reports from human rights organizations that say systematic torture continues in turkey .
is that charge baseless or unfair ? these allegations are completely unjustified .
they are totally groundless charges .
our ministry launched an immediate investigation .
and we have also been conducting inquiries into who initiated these accusations .
unfortunately , it is charges of this nature which are hindering turkey 's attempts to integrate into europe .
and i have the impression that 's something verheugen is all too aware of .
we have a zero-tolerance policy on the issue of torture .
systematic torture is unthinkable in a democratic system . up until now it 's been viewed as an open secret in brussels that on october 6th the eu commission would say yes to opening membership talks .
now a dispute has unfolded concerning proposed reforms to the turkish penal code which have since been put on hold .
where do things stand now ?
will the penal code be reformed , and when will the reforms become law ? turkey 's new criminal law is not part of the copenhagen criteria .
just as the draft legislation for reforms to the regional courts of appeal , or the new code for criminal procedure or the penal code , are not part of the copenhagen criteria .
these are steps we are taking as preparatory measures for moving towards the european union .
and it should not be forgotten that at this point there is only a common european constitution , but the eu has no common code of criminal law .
we are undertaking this reform of criminal law on our own initiative .
and i 'm convinced that 's something our european friends will appreciate . even so , the section which would make adultery a criminal offence is especially controversial .
is that something that is essential for you , or could you take that section out of the reform package if brussels were to insist on it ? this new law comprises a total of 346 paragraphs - and as such it is not necessarily so easy to appraise from a distance .
it would be unwise to restrict the discussion to the issue of adultery .
for us in the justice and development party , traditions are very important .
we stand for conservative values .
these principles are written in our party political program and are part of my government 's stated policy goals .
that is the aim of this article of law .
it 's intended to protect and strengthen the family .
the family is the most dynamic factor in turkish society .
moreover , this article of law was on the statutes between 1926 and 1996 at which time it was directed against women .
however , the new law foresees that if anyone brings a charge on grounds of infidelity and it comes to a court judgment , men and women shall be treated equally and the punishment shall be appropriate . is brussels exerting too much pressure ? no-one has raised that issue with me .
when mr. verheugen was here , i put the following question to him : does turkey need to do more ?
he answered ' no ' , but he did say that there were clear failings in the implementation of the reforms .
we 're aware of that too .
and we also discussed the issue of adultery .
mr verheugen said that this issue had nothing to do with the commission 's progress report .
he did , however , say that the topic of adultery could influence the decisions on when to begin talks .
i think we should now end this debate .
there are 25 eu members , not all of which fulfill the copenhagen criteria .
nonetheless , they are members of the european union . german conservative opposition leader angela merkel has written a letter to political leaders across europe in which she lobbied against full membership for turkey and instead pushed for a ' privileged partnership ' for your country .
you and your akp party are also members of the conservative camp - are you disappointed in miss merkel ? i find it hard to understand miss merkel .
and she is calling for understanding in our discussions . a privileged partnership is unthinkable in the eu . any nation that fulfills the copenhagen criteria can start membership talks . but we are not yet talking about full membership here , rather commencing negotiations on terms of entry . therefore we need a fair decision to set the process of negotiations in motion . if this process does not get underway , we will draw our own conclusions from this and take the necessary steps . i would like to stress that we are pushing for the fulfillment of the copenhagen criteria in the interests of our own people . but if there were really to be a negative decision , which i do n't believe there will be , then we will call this the ankara criteria and continue on our own path . the interview was conducted by alexander kudascheff send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu wants turkey to explain withdrawal of bill european union enlargement commissioner guenter verheugen on saturday called on turkey to clarify its decision to withdraw a key bill reforming its penal code , during talks with turkey 's eu ambassador .

the comments have raised the ire of social groups . german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s interview in the guter rat consumer magazine on friday echoes statements he ’ s made throughout the summer as he tries to hammer through controversial reforms to the country ’ s cumbersome social welfare state . " in both the east and the west , there 's a mentality which extends well into the middle class that you should claim state allowances wherever you can get them , even when there 's an adequate income in the family , " schröder told the magazine .
“ no welfare state can reasonably expect to manage such a burden , ” he added . the chancellor underlined that the public at large realizes that the social system has to change , but that it has balked when confronted with concrete changes that impact them directly , and called for citizens to accept what he said was the inevitable . chancellor far removed from reality ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of protestors march against reforms in leipzig his comments follow weeks of protests , particularly in former communist eastern germany , over tough welfare cuts that will introduce stringent means testing on those claiming unemployment benefits and will make people with a certain level of savings ineligible for welfare . popular anger has arisen in the country with as many as 80,000 people taking to the streets across the country in weekly protests every monday . schröder has been greeted by eggs and heckles as much as by cheers since announcing the reforms . predictably , the chancellor 's comments on friday triggered a heated discussion and drove another wedge between schröder and social support groups who have largely denounced the reforms as being " socially unfair " and " forcing people into poverty . " ulrich schneider , head of the paritätisch wohlfahrtsverband , a leading german social welfare support group , told berlin daily tagesspiegel that schröder 's comments " indicate how far the chancellor is removed from the reality of these people , ” who he says have to count every euro and pinch every penny .
thomas broch , who heads german caritas , also lashed out at the chancellor . “ schröder belittles the people who are already on the losing side of society , ” he said . schröder : " bitter reproaches from our children " government spokesman bela anda acted quickly to point out that schröder was only referring to those who don ’ t need government support , but get it anyway .
he stressed that applied as much to higher upper income groups who claim more than their share from government as it does to middle-income and lower-income people . the negative reactions seem to have caught the government and supporters of reform off-guard , especially since the chancellor had made similar comments throughout his fight to trim the welfare state and loosen labor laws . several influential social democratic politicians have come to the chancellor ’ s defense .
rainer wend , chairman of the bundestag ’ s committee for economics and labor , said the chancellor ’ s remarks were “ dead on ” and derided the outcry as " good old fashioned feigned fury " , noting that the critique applies just as well to wealthy citizens who exploit tax loopholes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- chairwoman angela merkel support for the chancellor has also poured in from the opposition camp .
“ there is certainly a tendency that some people have found they can live fairly well by relying on the social system and doing a bit of undocumented work on the side , ” angela merkel , head of the conservative christian democratic union party told a television station .
she added that people who truly need help often don ’ t apply for welfare . for his part , schröder again defended labor market reforms on friday , saying they were necessary if germany was to deal with the challenges of an ageing population and high labor costs , without imposing an excessive burden on future generations . " i am convinced that if we do n't start the reform process and conclude it within a decade , we will have to face bitter reproaches from our children and grandchildren , " he said . steve zwick -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reform anger could turn violent a series of violent incidents related to anger at the german government 's welfare reforms have some worried that widespread discontent among the populace could lead a surge in aggressive and illegal behavior .
-lrb- august 28 , 2004 -rrb- protests turn ugly as eggs and insults fly the wave of protests against the german government 's proposed welfare and job market reforms took a nasty turn on tuesday as chancellor gerhard schröder ran the gauntlet of public unrest in the east of the country .

the comments have raised the ire of social groups . german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s interview in the guter rat consumer magazine on friday echoes statements he ’ s made throughout the summer as he tries to hammer through controversial reforms to the country ’ s cumbersome social welfare state . " in both the east and the west , there 's a mentality which extends well into the middle class that you should claim state allowances wherever you can get them , even when there 's an adequate income in the family , " schröder told the magazine .
“ no welfare state can reasonably expect to manage such a burden , ” he added . the chancellor underlined that the public at large realizes that the social system has to change , but that it has balked when confronted with concrete changes that impact them directly , and called for citizens to accept what he said was the inevitable . chancellor far removed from reality ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of protestors march against reforms in leipzig his comments follow weeks of protests , particularly in former communist eastern germany , over tough welfare cuts that will introduce stringent means testing on those claiming unemployment benefits and will make people with a certain level of savings ineligible for welfare . popular anger has arisen in the country with as many as 80,000 people taking to the streets across the country in weekly protests every monday . schröder has been greeted by eggs and heckles as much as by cheers since announcing the reforms . predictably , the chancellor 's comments on friday triggered a heated discussion and drove another wedge between schröder and social support groups who have largely denounced the reforms as being " socially unfair " and " forcing people into poverty . " ulrich schneider , head of the paritätisch wohlfahrtsverband , a leading german social welfare support group , told berlin daily tagesspiegel that schröder 's comments " indicate how far the chancellor is removed from the reality of these people , ” who he says have to count every euro and pinch every penny .
thomas broch , who heads german caritas , also lashed out at the chancellor . “ schröder belittles the people who are already on the losing side of society , ” he said . schröder : " bitter reproaches from our children " government spokesman bela anda acted quickly to point out that schröder was only referring to those who don ’ t need government support , but get it anyway .
he stressed that applied as much to higher upper income groups who claim more than their share from government as it does to middle-income and lower-income people . the negative reactions seem to have caught the government and supporters of reform off-guard , especially since the chancellor had made similar comments throughout his fight to trim the welfare state and loosen labor laws . several influential social democratic politicians have come to the chancellor ’ s defense .
rainer wend , chairman of the bundestag ’ s committee for economics and labor , said the chancellor ’ s remarks were “ dead on ” and derided the outcry as " good old fashioned feigned fury " , noting that the critique applies just as well to wealthy citizens who exploit tax loopholes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- chairwoman angela merkel support for the chancellor has also poured in from the opposition camp .
“ there is certainly a tendency that some people have found they can live fairly well by relying on the social system and doing a bit of undocumented work on the side , ” angela merkel , head of the conservative christian democratic union party told a television station .
she added that people who truly need help often don ’ t apply for welfare . for his part , schröder again defended labor market reforms on friday , saying they were necessary if germany was to deal with the challenges of an ageing population and high labor costs , without imposing an excessive burden on future generations . " i am convinced that if we do n't start the reform process and conclude it within a decade , we will have to face bitter reproaches from our children and grandchildren , " he said . steve zwick -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reform anger could turn violent a series of violent incidents related to anger at the german government 's welfare reforms have some worried that widespread discontent among the populace could lead a surge in aggressive and illegal behavior .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 18.09.2004 eu wants turkey to explain withdrawal of bill großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verheugen has ruled out delaying a crucial eu report on turkey 's progress european union enlargement commissioner guenter verheugen on saturday called on turkey to clarify its decision to withdraw a key bill reforming its penal code , during talks with turkey 's eu ambassador . " that requires clarification , " verheugen said , warning that failure to pass the bill by october 6 " will have an impact " on a crucial report from the european commission due out that date on whether to start accession talks with ankara . verheugen strictly ruled out the possibility of delaying next month 's report , which is to serve as a basis for eu leaders to decide on december 17 on whether to set a date for the start of eu membership talks with turkey . " i have no intention , i am strictly against , i do n't see any reason why we should delay the report " , he told reporters . bill a key element of reform process the turkish parliament went into recess saturday until october 1 , leaving the crucial penal code reform package in limbo and unlikely to be enacted before the report 's release . eu officials have warned that the bill aimed at overhauling the country 's 78-year-old criminal code was a key element of turkey 's efforts to meet european democracy and human rights standards .
" so far our assessment was based on the assumption that the penal code would be adopted before the commission makes its decision , " verheugen told reporters .
" i have asked the ambassador to get clarification from his government whether and when the penal code will be adopted and whether it will be substantially changed . " the eu will notably seek reassurances that the final text will not include a controversial proposal to criminalize adultery , which was floated by the government this month but later withdrawn amid sharp protests from brussels .
the squabble over the legal status of adultery paralyzed debates on the reform package in the turkish parliament and left turkey-eu ties badly shaken . " it now depends on the answer i will get from ankara ...
in any case , that will have an impact , i have to make it very clear , " the commissioner stressed . however , verheugen refused to say whether a failure to adopt the penal reforms would necessarily lead to a negative recommendation from brussels .
" that , i will tell the commission .
i will not tell it today , " he said . turkey committed to reforms turkey 's ambassador , oguz demiralp , meanwhile insisted that ankara , an eu candidate since 1999 , remained committed to its eu-minded reform program . the " turkish government and turkish parliament are very much committed to the continuation of the reform process .
of course all the reforms will be adopted , " demiralp told reporters . verheugen , who is a strong supporter of turkey 's eu bid , emphasized that " the problem of the adoption of the penal code ranks prominent " in the debate over ankara 's readiness to join the bloc .
" it has to do with the question whether turkey has already established a rule of law sufficiently and in accordance with european standards and ... whether fundamental rights and freedoms are properly implemented and respected in turkey . " " therefore the penal code is really an essential part of the process of political reforms in turkey , " verheugen added . afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de waiting for eu many members of the turkish-german community are n't exactly sure what turkey 's membership in the eu would mean for them personally .
but that does n't keep them from hoping it will eventually happen .

" that requires clarification , " verheugen said , warning that failure to pass the bill by october 6 " will have an impact " on a crucial report from the european commission due out that date on whether to start accession talks with ankara . verheugen strictly ruled out the possibility of delaying next month 's report , which is to serve as a basis for eu leaders to decide on december 17 on whether to set a date for the start of eu membership talks with turkey . " i have no intention , i am strictly against , i do n't see any reason why we should delay the report " , he told reporters . bill a key element of reform process the turkish parliament went into recess saturday until october 1 , leaving the crucial penal code reform package in limbo and unlikely to be enacted before the report 's release . eu officials have warned that the bill aimed at overhauling the country 's 78-year-old criminal code was a key element of turkey 's efforts to meet european democracy and human rights standards .
" so far our assessment was based on the assumption that the penal code would be adopted before the commission makes its decision , " verheugen told reporters .
" i have asked the ambassador to get clarification from his government whether and when the penal code will be adopted and whether it will be substantially changed . " the eu will notably seek reassurances that the final text will not include a controversial proposal to criminalize adultery , which was floated by the government this month but later withdrawn amid sharp protests from brussels .
the squabble over the legal status of adultery paralyzed debates on the reform package in the turkish parliament and left turkey-eu ties badly shaken . " it now depends on the answer i will get from ankara ...
in any case , that will have an impact , i have to make it very clear , " the commissioner stressed . however , verheugen refused to say whether a failure to adopt the penal reforms would necessarily lead to a negative recommendation from brussels .
" that , i will tell the commission .
i will not tell it today , " he said . turkey committed to reforms turkey 's ambassador , oguz demiralp , meanwhile insisted that ankara , an eu candidate since 1999 , remained committed to its eu-minded reform program . the " turkish government and turkish parliament are very much committed to the continuation of the reform process .
of course all the reforms will be adopted , " demiralp told reporters . verheugen , who is a strong supporter of turkey 's eu bid , emphasized that " the problem of the adoption of the penal code ranks prominent " in the debate over ankara 's readiness to join the bloc .
" it has to do with the question whether turkey has already established a rule of law sufficiently and in accordance with european standards and ... whether fundamental rights and freedoms are properly implemented and respected in turkey . " " therefore the penal code is really an essential part of the process of political reforms in turkey , " verheugen added . afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de waiting for eu many members of the turkish-german community are n't exactly sure what turkey 's membership in the eu would mean for them personally .

the comments have raised the ire of social groups . german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s interview in the guter rat consumer magazine on friday echoes statements he ’ s made throughout the summer as he tries to hammer through controversial reforms to the country ’ s cumbersome social welfare state . " in both the east and the west , there 's a mentality which extends well into the middle class that you should claim state allowances wherever you can get them , even when there 's an adequate income in the family , " schröder told the magazine .
“ no welfare state can reasonably expect to manage such a burden , ” he added . the chancellor underlined that the public at large realizes that the social system has to change , but that it has balked when confronted with concrete changes that impact them directly , and called for citizens to accept what he said was the inevitable . chancellor far removed from reality ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of protestors march against reforms in leipzig his comments follow weeks of protests , particularly in former communist eastern germany , over tough welfare cuts that will introduce stringent means testing on those claiming unemployment benefits and will make people with a certain level of savings ineligible for welfare . popular anger has arisen in the country with as many as 80,000 people taking to the streets across the country in weekly protests every monday . schröder has been greeted by eggs and heckles as much as by cheers since announcing the reforms . predictably , the chancellor 's comments on friday triggered a heated discussion and drove another wedge between schröder and social support groups who have largely denounced the reforms as being " socially unfair " and " forcing people into poverty . " ulrich schneider , head of the paritätisch wohlfahrtsverband , a leading german social welfare support group , told berlin daily tagesspiegel that schröder 's comments " indicate how far the chancellor is removed from the reality of these people , ” who he says have to count every euro and pinch every penny .
thomas broch , who heads german caritas , also lashed out at the chancellor . “ schröder belittles the people who are already on the losing side of society , ” he said . schröder : " bitter reproaches from our children " government spokesman bela anda acted quickly to point out that schröder was only referring to those who don ’ t need government support , but get it anyway .
he stressed that applied as much to higher upper income groups who claim more than their share from government as it does to middle-income and lower-income people . the negative reactions seem to have caught the government and supporters of reform off-guard , especially since the chancellor had made similar comments throughout his fight to trim the welfare state and loosen labor laws . several influential social democratic politicians have come to the chancellor ’ s defense .
rainer wend , chairman of the bundestag ’ s committee for economics and labor , said the chancellor ’ s remarks were “ dead on ” and derided the outcry as " good old fashioned feigned fury " , noting that the critique applies just as well to wealthy citizens who exploit tax loopholes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- chairwoman angela merkel support for the chancellor has also poured in from the opposition camp .
“ there is certainly a tendency that some people have found they can live fairly well by relying on the social system and doing a bit of undocumented work on the side , ” angela merkel , head of the conservative christian democratic union party told a television station .
she added that people who truly need help often don ’ t apply for welfare . for his part , schröder again defended labor market reforms on friday , saying they were necessary if germany was to deal with the challenges of an ageing population and high labor costs , without imposing an excessive burden on future generations . " i am convinced that if we do n't start the reform process and conclude it within a decade , we will have to face bitter reproaches from our children and grandchildren , " he said . steve zwick -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reform anger could turn violent a series of violent incidents related to anger at the german government 's welfare reforms have some worried that widespread discontent among the populace could lead a surge in aggressive and illegal behavior .

the comments have raised the ire of social groups . german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s interview in the guter rat consumer magazine on friday echoes statements he ’ s made throughout the summer as he tries to hammer through controversial reforms to the country ’ s cumbersome social welfare state . " in both the east and the west , there 's a mentality which extends well into the middle class that you should claim state allowances wherever you can get them , even when there 's an adequate income in the family , " schröder told the magazine .
“ no welfare state can reasonably expect to manage such a burden , ” he added . the chancellor underlined that the public at large realizes that the social system has to change , but that it has balked when confronted with concrete changes that impact them directly , and called for citizens to accept what he said was the inevitable . chancellor far removed from reality ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of protestors march against reforms in leipzig his comments follow weeks of protests , particularly in former communist eastern germany , over tough welfare cuts that will introduce stringent means testing on those claiming unemployment benefits and will make people with a certain level of savings ineligible for welfare . popular anger has arisen in the country with as many as 80,000 people taking to the streets across the country in weekly protests every monday . schröder has been greeted by eggs and heckles as much as by cheers since announcing the reforms . predictably , the chancellor 's comments on friday triggered a heated discussion and drove another wedge between schröder and social support groups who have largely denounced the reforms as being " socially unfair " and " forcing people into poverty . " ulrich schneider , head of the paritätisch wohlfahrtsverband , a leading german social welfare support group , told berlin daily tagesspiegel that schröder 's comments " indicate how far the chancellor is removed from the reality of these people , ” who he says have to count every euro and pinch every penny .
thomas broch , who heads german caritas , also lashed out at the chancellor . “ schröder belittles the people who are already on the losing side of society , ” he said . schröder : " bitter reproaches from our children " government spokesman bela anda acted quickly to point out that schröder was only referring to those who don ’ t need government support , but get it anyway .
he stressed that applied as much to higher upper income groups who claim more than their share from government as it does to middle-income and lower-income people . the negative reactions seem to have caught the government and supporters of reform off-guard , especially since the chancellor had made similar comments throughout his fight to trim the welfare state and loosen labor laws . several influential social democratic politicians have come to the chancellor ’ s defense .
rainer wend , chairman of the bundestag ’ s committee for economics and labor , said the chancellor ’ s remarks were “ dead on ” and derided the outcry as " good old fashioned feigned fury " , noting that the critique applies just as well to wealthy citizens who exploit tax loopholes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- chairwoman angela merkel support for the chancellor has also poured in from the opposition camp .
“ there is certainly a tendency that some people have found they can live fairly well by relying on the social system and doing a bit of undocumented work on the side , ” angela merkel , head of the conservative christian democratic union party told a television station .
she added that people who truly need help often don ’ t apply for welfare . for his part , schröder again defended labor market reforms on friday , saying they were necessary if germany was to deal with the challenges of an ageing population and high labor costs , without imposing an excessive burden on future generations . " i am convinced that if we do n't start the reform process and conclude it within a decade , we will have to face bitter reproaches from our children and grandchildren , " he said . steve zwick -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reform anger could turn violent a series of violent incidents related to anger at the german government 's welfare reforms have some worried that widespread discontent among the populace could lead a surge in aggressive and illegal behavior .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 18.09.2004 cutting through the red tape großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paperwork and red tape hinders economic growth , says the report the world bank 's " doing business in 2005 " report on business practices and bureaucracy shows many countries , germany included , are stifling growth and enterprise by wrapping simple procedures in masses of red tape . the world bank 's report , “ doing business in 2005 : removing obstacles to growth , ” looked at the levels of bureaucracy businesses face in 145 countries .
the report showed which countries have the least red-tape and where it 's easiest to become an entrepreneur . this is the second year the world bank has issued rankings on business environment indicators : more than 3,000 local experts investigated practices in 145 nations , asking whether it was easy or difficult to start a small or medium-size business and whether administrations made it hard to hire and fire . among the other things compared were hiring and firing practices , how easy it was to register property , the ease of contract enforcement , and - for the first time in 2003 - the property registration process and to what extent investors were protected . of the industrial countries , new zealand , australia and norway came out on top .
but where was germany , a country famed throughout the world for doing things by the book ? german procedures take twice as long it takes a businessman in finland three simple procedures and two weeks to turn his idea into a company .
german competitors , however , have to spend 45 days wading through nine procedures , twice as long as the world average .
that kind of bureaucratic hassle meant germany was n't among the top twenty . gabi beermeister , a young woman who runs a small kiosk in berlin , told dw-world german bureaucracy was getting worse . " selling bread rolls , cigarettes and sweets required a special catering permit , so i applied to the health authorities , " she said .
" but they asked for so many things - architect drawings of the business premises , a permit from the building authorities , letters of approval from banks … i simply gave up . " german government claims successes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement .
although germany ranked only slightly better than mediocre in the " doing business in 2005 " report , germany ’ s minister of commerce wolfgang clement told the handelsblatt newspaper that the report didn ’ t do germany justice .
he pointed out 2003 reforms , like the " hours of trading act " , which simplified trade guild rules and improved workplace regulations . meanwhile , the german ministry of justice has been searching the german law books for unnecessary regulations in a bid to streamline procedures .
two hundred laws and by-laws need to be abolished , found the ministry . bureaucratic countries pay a high price an easy business climate has many benefits , michael klein told dw-world .
he believes that the easier it is to start a new company , the higher the chances of reducing unemployment and spurring the economy . " we find that 25 percent of the countries that have the most complicated and bureaucratic regulations tend to grow roughly 2 percent less per year than the countries that have easy and well-structured regulations , " klein said . this knowledge has certainly prompted many european nations , not just germany , to tackle reform .
" most of the reform-stimulus has come from the eu , " said klein .
" the accession countries felt they should improve their business environment , slovakia ahead of all of them .
but also within the eu , a number of countries - spain , portugal , finland and belgium - have improved business regulations . " move to botswana ? the " doing business in 2005 " report follows the standard world bank line : economic liberalization and the opening of local markets comes with large payoffs .
as proof of that , michael klein pointed to turkey and france , both of which saw new business registration increase by 18 percent after the governments reduced the time and cost of starting a business . in the end , the report does , indirectly , offer a solution to german businessmen and women interested in a business friendly investment climate : they should move … to botswana . peter zimmerman -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german egovernment initiative off to a slow start the eu would like its citizens to use personal computers to do taxes and complete bureacratic formalities .
but apart from a successful egovernment project in bremen , germany still lags behind on an eu level .

the comments have raised the ire of social groups . german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s interview in the guter rat consumer magazine on friday echoes statements he ’ s made throughout the summer as he tries to hammer through controversial reforms to the country ’ s cumbersome social welfare state . " in both the east and the west , there 's a mentality which extends well into the middle class that you should claim state allowances wherever you can get them , even when there 's an adequate income in the family , " schröder told the magazine .
“ no welfare state can reasonably expect to manage such a burden , ” he added . the chancellor underlined that the public at large realizes that the social system has to change , but that it has balked when confronted with concrete changes that impact them directly , and called for citizens to accept what he said was the inevitable . chancellor far removed from reality ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of protestors march against reforms in leipzig his comments follow weeks of protests , particularly in former communist eastern germany , over tough welfare cuts that will introduce stringent means testing on those claiming unemployment benefits and will make people with a certain level of savings ineligible for welfare . popular anger has arisen in the country with as many as 80,000 people taking to the streets across the country in weekly protests every monday . schröder has been greeted by eggs and heckles as much as by cheers since announcing the reforms . predictably , the chancellor 's comments on friday triggered a heated discussion and drove another wedge between schröder and social support groups who have largely denounced the reforms as being " socially unfair " and " forcing people into poverty . " ulrich schneider , head of the paritätisch wohlfahrtsverband , a leading german social welfare support group , told berlin daily tagesspiegel that schröder 's comments " indicate how far the chancellor is removed from the reality of these people , ” who he says have to count every euro and pinch every penny .
thomas broch , who heads german caritas , also lashed out at the chancellor . “ schröder belittles the people who are already on the losing side of society , ” he said . schröder : " bitter reproaches from our children " government spokesman bela anda acted quickly to point out that schröder was only referring to those who don ’ t need government support , but get it anyway .
he stressed that applied as much to higher upper income groups who claim more than their share from government as it does to middle-income and lower-income people . the negative reactions seem to have caught the government and supporters of reform off-guard , especially since the chancellor had made similar comments throughout his fight to trim the welfare state and loosen labor laws . several influential social democratic politicians have come to the chancellor ’ s defense .
rainer wend , chairman of the bundestag ’ s committee for economics and labor , said the chancellor ’ s remarks were “ dead on ” and derided the outcry as " good old fashioned feigned fury " , noting that the critique applies just as well to wealthy citizens who exploit tax loopholes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- chairwoman angela merkel support for the chancellor has also poured in from the opposition camp .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : turkey 's eu moment of truth verheugen : no more obstacles to talks with turkey capturing turkish culture 's changing face waiting for eu erdogan : " we have done our homework " europe -pipe- 18.09.2004 " a change in mentality is needed " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister erdogan says turkey is doing its best to meet entry criteria the eu commission is to publish a key report on october 6 on whether ankara is ready to open talks on joining the eu .
in an interview with deutsche welle , turkish pm tayyip erdogan said the country was on track . dw : on october 6th the european union commission is due to announce when and if membership talks with your country can take place .
what do you think brussels will decide ? recep tayyip erdogan : we are doing everything we can to influence this process in a positive way and to fulfill the criteria issued in copenhagen for accession talks .
at this point there are no problems with legislation on reforms .
when i asked mr. verheugen -lrb- eu enlargement commissioner -rrb- during his last visit here what we had to do to complete this legislation , he answered that turkey had already done everything , but that there were still problems with implementation .
we know that too , because implementation requires a change in mentality .
that 's part of a process and we are making every effort to push this process forward as fast as possible . while the eu commissioner was here , he was presented with reports from human rights organizations that say systematic torture continues in turkey .
is that charge baseless or unfair ? these allegations are completely unjustified .
they are totally groundless charges .
our ministry launched an immediate investigation .
and we have also been conducting inquiries into who initiated these accusations .
unfortunately , it is charges of this nature which are hindering turkey 's attempts to integrate into europe .
and i have the impression that 's something verheugen is all too aware of .
we have a zero-tolerance policy on the issue of torture .
systematic torture is unthinkable in a democratic system . up until now it 's been viewed as an open secret in brussels that on october 6th the eu commission would say yes to opening membership talks .
now a dispute has unfolded concerning proposed reforms to the turkish penal code which have since been put on hold .
where do things stand now ?
will the penal code be reformed , and when will the reforms become law ? turkey 's new criminal law is not part of the copenhagen criteria .
just as the draft legislation for reforms to the regional courts of appeal , or the new code for criminal procedure or the penal code , are not part of the copenhagen criteria .
these are steps we are taking as preparatory measures for moving towards the european union .
and it should not be forgotten that at this point there is only a common european constitution , but the eu has no common code of criminal law .
we are undertaking this reform of criminal law on our own initiative .
and i 'm convinced that 's something our european friends will appreciate . even so , the section which would make adultery a criminal offence is especially controversial .
is that something that is essential for you , or could you take that section out of the reform package if brussels were to insist on it ? this new law comprises a total of 346 paragraphs - and as such it is not necessarily so easy to appraise from a distance .
it would be unwise to restrict the discussion to the issue of adultery .
for us in the justice and development party , traditions are very important .
we stand for conservative values .
these principles are written in our party political program and are part of my government 's stated policy goals .
that is the aim of this article of law .
it 's intended to protect and strengthen the family .
the family is the most dynamic factor in turkish society .
moreover , this article of law was on the statutes between 1926 and 1996 at which time it was directed against women .
however , the new law foresees that if anyone brings a charge on grounds of infidelity and it comes to a court judgment , men and women shall be treated equally and the punishment shall be appropriate . is brussels exerting too much pressure ? no-one has raised that issue with me .
when mr. verheugen was here , i put the following question to him : does turkey need to do more ?
he answered ' no ' , but he did say that there were clear failings in the implementation of the reforms .
we 're aware of that too .
and we also discussed the issue of adultery .
mr verheugen said that this issue had nothing to do with the commission 's progress report .
he did , however , say that the topic of adultery could influence the decisions on when to begin talks .
i think we should now end this debate .
there are 25 eu members , not all of which fulfill the copenhagen criteria .
nonetheless , they are members of the european union . german conservative opposition leader angela merkel has written a letter to political leaders across europe in which she lobbied against full membership for turkey and instead pushed for a ' privileged partnership ' for your country .
you and your akp party are also members of the conservative camp - are you disappointed in miss merkel ? i find it hard to understand miss merkel .
and she is calling for understanding in our discussions . a privileged partnership is unthinkable in the eu . any nation that fulfills the copenhagen criteria can start membership talks . but we are not yet talking about full membership here , rather commencing negotiations on terms of entry . therefore we need a fair decision to set the process of negotiations in motion . if this process does not get underway , we will draw our own conclusions from this and take the necessary steps . i would like to stress that we are pushing for the fulfillment of the copenhagen criteria in the interests of our own people . but if there were really to be a negative decision , which i do n't believe there will be , then we will call this the ankara criteria and continue on our own path . the interview was conducted by alexander kudascheff send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu wants turkey to explain withdrawal of bill european union enlargement commissioner guenter verheugen on saturday called on turkey to clarify its decision to withdraw a key bill reforming its penal code , during talks with turkey 's eu ambassador .
-lrb- sept .
18 , 2004 -rrb- waiting for eu many members of the turkish-german community are n't exactly sure what turkey 's membership in the eu would mean for them personally .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 18.09.2004 cutting through the red tape großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paperwork and red tape hinders economic growth , says the report the world bank 's " doing business in 2005 " report on business practices and bureaucracy shows many countries , germany included , are stifling growth and enterprise by wrapping simple procedures in masses of red tape . the world bank 's report , “ doing business in 2005 : removing obstacles to growth , ” looked at the levels of bureaucracy businesses face in 145 countries .
the report showed which countries have the least red-tape and where it 's easiest to become an entrepreneur . this is the second year the world bank has issued rankings on business environment indicators : more than 3,000 local experts investigated practices in 145 nations , asking whether it was easy or difficult to start a small or medium-size business and whether administrations made it hard to hire and fire . among the other things compared were hiring and firing practices , how easy it was to register property , the ease of contract enforcement , and - for the first time in 2003 - the property registration process and to what extent investors were protected . of the industrial countries , new zealand , australia and norway came out on top .
but where was germany , a country famed throughout the world for doing things by the book ? german procedures take twice as long it takes a businessman in finland three simple procedures and two weeks to turn his idea into a company .
german competitors , however , have to spend 45 days wading through nine procedures , twice as long as the world average .
that kind of bureaucratic hassle meant germany was n't among the top twenty . gabi beermeister , a young woman who runs a small kiosk in berlin , told dw-world german bureaucracy was getting worse . " selling bread rolls , cigarettes and sweets required a special catering permit , so i applied to the health authorities , " she said .
" but they asked for so many things - architect drawings of the business premises , a permit from the building authorities , letters of approval from banks … i simply gave up . " german government claims successes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement .
although germany ranked only slightly better than mediocre in the " doing business in 2005 " report , germany ’ s minister of commerce wolfgang clement told the handelsblatt newspaper that the report didn ’ t do germany justice .
he pointed out 2003 reforms , like the " hours of trading act " , which simplified trade guild rules and improved workplace regulations . meanwhile , the german ministry of justice has been searching the german law books for unnecessary regulations in a bid to streamline procedures .
two hundred laws and by-laws need to be abolished , found the ministry . bureaucratic countries pay a high price an easy business climate has many benefits , michael klein told dw-world .
he believes that the easier it is to start a new company , the higher the chances of reducing unemployment and spurring the economy . " we find that 25 percent of the countries that have the most complicated and bureaucratic regulations tend to grow roughly 2 percent less per year than the countries that have easy and well-structured regulations , " klein said . this knowledge has certainly prompted many european nations , not just germany , to tackle reform .
" most of the reform-stimulus has come from the eu , " said klein .
" the accession countries felt they should improve their business environment , slovakia ahead of all of them .
but also within the eu , a number of countries - spain , portugal , finland and belgium - have improved business regulations . " move to botswana ? the " doing business in 2005 " report follows the standard world bank line : economic liberalization and the opening of local markets comes with large payoffs .
as proof of that , michael klein pointed to turkey and france , both of which saw new business registration increase by 18 percent after the governments reduced the time and cost of starting a business . in the end , the report does , indirectly , offer a solution to german businessmen and women interested in a business friendly investment climate : they should move … to botswana . peter zimmerman -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german egovernment initiative off to a slow start the eu would like its citizens to use personal computers to do taxes and complete bureacratic formalities .

these are steps we are taking as preparatory measures for moving towards the european union .
and it should not be forgotten that at this point there is only a common european constitution , but the eu has no common code of criminal law .
we are undertaking this reform of criminal law on our own initiative .
and i 'm convinced that 's something our european friends will appreciate . even so , the section which would make adultery a criminal offence is especially controversial .
is that something that is essential for you , or could you take that section out of the reform package if brussels were to insist on it ? this new law comprises a total of 346 paragraphs - and as such it is not necessarily so easy to appraise from a distance .
it would be unwise to restrict the discussion to the issue of adultery .
for us in the justice and development party , traditions are very important .
we stand for conservative values .
these principles are written in our party political program and are part of my government 's stated policy goals .
that is the aim of this article of law .
it 's intended to protect and strengthen the family .
the family is the most dynamic factor in turkish society .
moreover , this article of law was on the statutes between 1926 and 1996 at which time it was directed against women .
however , the new law foresees that if anyone brings a charge on grounds of infidelity and it comes to a court judgment , men and women shall be treated equally and the punishment shall be appropriate . is brussels exerting too much pressure ? no-one has raised that issue with me .
when mr. verheugen was here , i put the following question to him : does turkey need to do more ?
he answered ' no ' , but he did say that there were clear failings in the implementation of the reforms .
we 're aware of that too .
and we also discussed the issue of adultery .
mr verheugen said that this issue had nothing to do with the commission 's progress report .
he did , however , say that the topic of adultery could influence the decisions on when to begin talks .
i think we should now end this debate .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : turkey 's eu moment of truth verheugen : no more obstacles to talks with turkey capturing turkish culture 's changing face waiting for eu erdogan : " we have done our homework " europe -pipe- 18.09.2004 " a change in mentality is needed " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister erdogan says turkey is doing its best to meet entry criteria the eu commission is to publish a key report on october 6 on whether ankara is ready to open talks on joining the eu .
in an interview with deutsche welle , turkish pm tayyip erdogan said the country was on track . dw : on october 6th the european union commission is due to announce when and if membership talks with your country can take place .
what do you think brussels will decide ? recep tayyip erdogan : we are doing everything we can to influence this process in a positive way and to fulfill the criteria issued in copenhagen for accession talks .
at this point there are no problems with legislation on reforms .
when i asked mr. verheugen -lrb- eu enlargement commissioner -rrb- during his last visit here what we had to do to complete this legislation , he answered that turkey had already done everything , but that there were still problems with implementation .
we know that too , because implementation requires a change in mentality .
that 's part of a process and we are making every effort to push this process forward as fast as possible . while the eu commissioner was here , he was presented with reports from human rights organizations that say systematic torture continues in turkey .
is that charge baseless or unfair ? these allegations are completely unjustified .
they are totally groundless charges .
our ministry launched an immediate investigation .
and we have also been conducting inquiries into who initiated these accusations .
unfortunately , it is charges of this nature which are hindering turkey 's attempts to integrate into europe .
and i have the impression that 's something verheugen is all too aware of .
we have a zero-tolerance policy on the issue of torture .
systematic torture is unthinkable in a democratic system . up until now it 's been viewed as an open secret in brussels that on october 6th the eu commission would say yes to opening membership talks .
now a dispute has unfolded concerning proposed reforms to the turkish penal code which have since been put on hold .
where do things stand now ?
will the penal code be reformed , and when will the reforms become law ? turkey 's new criminal law is not part of the copenhagen criteria .
just as the draft legislation for reforms to the regional courts of appeal , or the new code for criminal procedure or the penal code , are not part of the copenhagen criteria .
these are steps we are taking as preparatory measures for moving towards the european union .
and it should not be forgotten that at this point there is only a common european constitution , but the eu has no common code of criminal law .

" that requires clarification , " verheugen said , warning that failure to pass the bill by october 6 " will have an impact " on a crucial report from the european commission due out that date on whether to start accession talks with ankara . verheugen strictly ruled out the possibility of delaying next month 's report , which is to serve as a basis for eu leaders to decide on december 17 on whether to set a date for the start of eu membership talks with turkey . " i have no intention , i am strictly against , i do n't see any reason why we should delay the report " , he told reporters . bill a key element of reform process the turkish parliament went into recess saturday until october 1 , leaving the crucial penal code reform package in limbo and unlikely to be enacted before the report 's release . eu officials have warned that the bill aimed at overhauling the country 's 78-year-old criminal code was a key element of turkey 's efforts to meet european democracy and human rights standards .
" so far our assessment was based on the assumption that the penal code would be adopted before the commission makes its decision , " verheugen told reporters .
" i have asked the ambassador to get clarification from his government whether and when the penal code will be adopted and whether it will be substantially changed . " the eu will notably seek reassurances that the final text will not include a controversial proposal to criminalize adultery , which was floated by the government this month but later withdrawn amid sharp protests from brussels .
the squabble over the legal status of adultery paralyzed debates on the reform package in the turkish parliament and left turkey-eu ties badly shaken . " it now depends on the answer i will get from ankara ...
in any case , that will have an impact , i have to make it very clear , " the commissioner stressed . however , verheugen refused to say whether a failure to adopt the penal reforms would necessarily lead to a negative recommendation from brussels .
" that , i will tell the commission .
i will not tell it today , " he said . turkey committed to reforms turkey 's ambassador , oguz demiralp , meanwhile insisted that ankara , an eu candidate since 1999 , remained committed to its eu-minded reform program . the " turkish government and turkish parliament are very much committed to the continuation of the reform process .
of course all the reforms will be adopted , " demiralp told reporters . verheugen , who is a strong supporter of turkey 's eu bid , emphasized that " the problem of the adoption of the penal code ranks prominent " in the debate over ankara 's readiness to join the bloc .
" it has to do with the question whether turkey has already established a rule of law sufficiently and in accordance with european standards and ... whether fundamental rights and freedoms are properly implemented and respected in turkey . " " therefore the penal code is really an essential part of the process of political reforms in turkey , " verheugen added . afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de waiting for eu many members of the turkish-german community are n't exactly sure what turkey 's membership in the eu would mean for them personally .

in an interview with deutsche welle , turkish pm tayyip erdogan said the country was on track . dw : on october 6th the european union commission is due to announce when and if membership talks with your country can take place .
what do you think brussels will decide ? recep tayyip erdogan : we are doing everything we can to influence this process in a positive way and to fulfill the criteria issued in copenhagen for accession talks .
at this point there are no problems with legislation on reforms .
when i asked mr. verheugen -lrb- eu enlargement commissioner -rrb- during his last visit here what we had to do to complete this legislation , he answered that turkey had already done everything , but that there were still problems with implementation .
we know that too , because implementation requires a change in mentality .
that 's part of a process and we are making every effort to push this process forward as fast as possible . while the eu commissioner was here , he was presented with reports from human rights organizations that say systematic torture continues in turkey .
is that charge baseless or unfair ? these allegations are completely unjustified .
they are totally groundless charges .
our ministry launched an immediate investigation .
and we have also been conducting inquiries into who initiated these accusations .
unfortunately , it is charges of this nature which are hindering turkey 's attempts to integrate into europe .
and i have the impression that 's something verheugen is all too aware of .
we have a zero-tolerance policy on the issue of torture .
systematic torture is unthinkable in a democratic system . up until now it 's been viewed as an open secret in brussels that on october 6th the eu commission would say yes to opening membership talks .
now a dispute has unfolded concerning proposed reforms to the turkish penal code which have since been put on hold .
where do things stand now ?
will the penal code be reformed , and when will the reforms become law ? turkey 's new criminal law is not part of the copenhagen criteria .
just as the draft legislation for reforms to the regional courts of appeal , or the new code for criminal procedure or the penal code , are not part of the copenhagen criteria .
these are steps we are taking as preparatory measures for moving towards the european union .
and it should not be forgotten that at this point there is only a common european constitution , but the eu has no common code of criminal law .
we are undertaking this reform of criminal law on our own initiative .
and i 'm convinced that 's something our european friends will appreciate . even so , the section which would make adultery a criminal offence is especially controversial .
is that something that is essential for you , or could you take that section out of the reform package if brussels were to insist on it ? this new law comprises a total of 346 paragraphs - and as such it is not necessarily so easy to appraise from a distance .
it would be unwise to restrict the discussion to the issue of adultery .
for us in the justice and development party , traditions are very important .
we stand for conservative values .
these principles are written in our party political program and are part of my government 's stated policy goals .
that is the aim of this article of law .
it 's intended to protect and strengthen the family .
the family is the most dynamic factor in turkish society .
moreover , this article of law was on the statutes between 1926 and 1996 at which time it was directed against women .
however , the new law foresees that if anyone brings a charge on grounds of infidelity and it comes to a court judgment , men and women shall be treated equally and the punishment shall be appropriate . is brussels exerting too much pressure ? no-one has raised that issue with me .
when mr. verheugen was here , i put the following question to him : does turkey need to do more ?
he answered ' no ' , but he did say that there were clear failings in the implementation of the reforms .
we 're aware of that too .
and we also discussed the issue of adultery .
mr verheugen said that this issue had nothing to do with the commission 's progress report .
he did , however , say that the topic of adultery could influence the decisions on when to begin talks .
i think we should now end this debate .
there are 25 eu members , not all of which fulfill the copenhagen criteria .
nonetheless , they are members of the european union . german conservative opposition leader angela merkel has written a letter to political leaders across europe in which she lobbied against full membership for turkey and instead pushed for a ' privileged partnership ' for your country .
you and your akp party are also members of the conservative camp - are you disappointed in miss merkel ? i find it hard to understand miss merkel .
and she is calling for understanding in our discussions . a privileged partnership is unthinkable in the eu . any nation that fulfills the copenhagen criteria can start membership talks . but we are not yet talking about full membership here , rather commencing negotiations on terms of entry . therefore we need a fair decision to set the process of negotiations in motion . if this process does not get underway , we will draw our own conclusions from this and take the necessary steps . i would like to stress that we are pushing for the fulfillment of the copenhagen criteria in the interests of our own people . but if there were really to be a negative decision , which i do n't believe there will be , then we will call this the ankara criteria and continue on our own path . the interview was conducted by alexander kudascheff send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu wants turkey to explain withdrawal of bill european union enlargement commissioner guenter verheugen on saturday called on turkey to clarify its decision to withdraw a key bill reforming its penal code , during talks with turkey 's eu ambassador .

the nerve-sparing laparoscopic surgery , only needs a 10cm incision - rather than open surgery , risking infection .
barry thomas , 48 , from bristol , is thought to have been the first person in the uk treated with this procedure .
the technique means it is no longer necessary to move the bowel out the way to get to the bladder .
previously the procedure involved lots of blood loss , a risk of infection and a long stay in hospital .
the new method does away with the need for blood transfusions and less pain relief is required so the patient recovers more quickly .
as the nerves are not damaged , sexual function is maintained .
the operation was carried out by mr mark wright and dr raj persad .
mr wright trained in cleveland in the us where this surgery was first done .

an expert will be on hand , to help identify artefacts , on saturday .
local archaeologist lesley smith and the friends of windmill gardens jointly organised the project .

not very much .
" lambeth does n't have a museum or heritage centre , so if local people want to find out about their past they have to do it for themselves and what better way than digging it up for themselves . "
pre-excavation workshops have been delivered by ms smith at the local schools and at after school clubs .
the excavation continues between 20 - 24 september when the children will visit the excavation .
they will have the chance to dig , identify artefacts and carry out environmental sampling .

plaid cymru president dafydd iwan said owners of ex-council homes in gwynedd were expected to sell below market value .
he spoke out after the bbc wales news website reported how a £ 240,000 sale was halted .
it hit problems because of a rule aimed at making rural housing affordable to locals .
mr iwan , who is also a gwynedd councillor , said that , if he owned an ex-council property , he would be willing to sell it for as much as £ 100,000 below the market value .
he said it was " part and parcel " of the bargain .
on thursday , the bbc wales news website revealed how gill and zuhair chalabi sold their home in hampshire to buy a house in pennal , near machynlleth , for £ 240,000 .
mrs connor says she is being forced against her will to stay in her home the sale fell through as they were close to exchanging contracts - because gwynedd council invoked a clause stating that the old school house could only be sold to someone who had lived or worked in the area for three years .
the chalabis , who are in their 60s , are now living in bed-and-breakfast accommodation .
cilla connor bought the house with her husband in 1982 , when it was valued at just over £ 15,000 .
they had already rented it for four years .
the council said the connors were given a 15 % discount because of the locality clause .
however , mrs connor 's solicitors confirmed on friday that they may challenge the council directive and apply for a judicial review .
the dilemma of how to make rural housing affordable for local people is an issue for parts of rural wales , where prices have risen steeply .
there are concerns in welsh-speaking areas that the survival of the language is threatened if there are too many incomers .
gill and zuhair chalabi are now living in a bed-and-breakfast mr iwan admitted that the rule operated in gwynedd could seem " a bit of a nuisance , " but strongly defended the policy .
" about 95 % of the houses are sold on the open market , but this regulation is designed to help people with local connections , " he said .
" it can seem a bit of a nuisance , because after buying a house people say they should have the right to sell their house to anyone .
" but people with ex-council homes will have to sell for a slightly lower price .
" this is part and parcel of the bargain of owning an ex-council home and this would have been made quite clear to the owner . "
when asked whether he would be happy selling his property for £ 50,000 to £ 100,000 lower than its market value , mr iwan replied " yes " .
" we are trying to create a secondary market that is in reach of local people , " he added .
" there 's good reason why a few houses should be pegged back . "
mr iwan agreed that the council 's policy was partly designed to stop incomers buying up properties .
however , he said he was not aware of mrs connor 's case .
other houses mrs connor said mr iwan was talking " rubbish . "
" i think he 's -lrb- mr iwan -rrb- got a cheek .
i do n't think he would sell his home for lower than the asking price for a minute .
" i 'd rather let the place rot than sell it below the market value .
" if gwynedd council and plaid cymru want derelict houses in wales then that 's what 's going to happen . "
meanwhile , the people who had wanted to buy the house , the chalabis , are being supported by the local rector , geraint ap iorwerth , who said on friday that the couple were viewing other properties in the area .
we asked for your comments on this story .
a selection of responses are published below : do not agree with the council 's policy .
if the council can come up with a local buyer fair enough ; if they can not then the sale should go ahead to mr & mrs chalabi. e.reade , cardiff uk i had to laugh at mike from cardiff . £ 240,000 makes you rich enough to buy almost any house in the uk , does it mike ?
i live an hour outside london and £ 240,000 gets you a two-bedroom house if you 're lucky .
go into the city proper and it buys you a flat , as long as you do n't want anything too fancy .
in many areas you wo n't even get two bedrooms for that - in the uk property market £ 240,000 does n't make someone even remotely rich .
john b , uk the selling restriction is no secret .

right to make a huge profit - more like !
paul , n. wales it is a breach of my human rights not to be able to live in the new forest village i grew up in .

people who buy local homes should be local people !

i think it should be adopted by more local authorities , not just in wales , but in other areas such as cornwall , where there is a huge disparity between the spending power of rich outsiders and local people .
as someone for whom getting on the property ladder is virtually impossible , i think its about time that social justice prevailed over individual greed .
mrs connor talks of her " human rights " .
if that tired old phrase must be bandied about , what about the " human right " of local people to be able to live in their own home towns ?
rhiannon knight , swansea i 've been looking to buy a house in west wales -lrb- to live in full time -rrb- for several years and often come up against this unjust council system .
why ca n't i buy these houses ?
i was born in wales , have never lived anywhere else and yet i 'm not eligible to buy certain properties in my own country .
as for the welsh language issue , if the nationalists were a bit more welcoming and less hung up with the whole welsh for it 's own sake rubbish , " incomers " would feel more welcome and would be more likely to get involved .
my local tesco has a sign saying " fac car " next to " car vac " - enough said , loony .
james , cardiff wales congratulations , gwynedd council , as a local i found it extremely difficult to find suitable affordable housing in the area , even though i 've lived and worked here all my life - if only we had more rules like this .
karen hughes , aberffraw , sir fon if the council had n't sold off the local housing for a cheap buck then this situation would never have arisen .
perhaps they should consider building some houses rather than prevent what seems to be a perfectly reasonable transaction .
as for the lawyers - well .
david tivey , cheshire this clearly demonstrates that council properties should not be sold at a major discount only to be sold at a vastly increased price a few years later j , bristol just goes to show that the convayancing solictors on both sides have failed to find something as basic as a covenant on a property .
i hope the chalabis sue sucessfully jon , uk seems as if the solicitors have made the mistake .
is n't it their responsibility to check on such things i.e restrictions before advising on the sale .
although l feel sorry for the chalabis , do n't blame the council for this one .
wayne , brisbane , australia as a guy originating from gwynedd i applaud the council for sticking to their guns .
the village where i grew up the populous now consists of around 25 % ' local ' people and the rest are either second homes or homes of ' outsiders ' .
this has to be stopped if wales has any hope of retaining it 's young people for industry or safe gaurding the welsh language .
cymru am byth !
jc , london mrs connor is not being forced to stay in her home .

even if the price was £ 150,000 she would still have made a huge proft on the house .
ian , london , uk looking at the human rights act in greater detail , the council are definately in breach of this .
i would advise all parties involved to get their solicitors to take action with the council .
everyone has a right to purchase a property where they like .

jon , uk mrs connor has been at the very least disingenuous in this affair .

' breach of my human rights ' ?
give me a break .
the tragedy here is for the chalabis - as someone who has endured several moves in the past few years my heart goes out to them .
gary chubb , ogmore , wales it would be better to subsidise locals than to penalise incomers .

good luck on this one .

with many small local schools closing and areas such as newport -lrb- pembs -rrb- being almost empty when the ' season is over ' i can well understand the local authority stand on this issue .
with 240k i am sure there are many areas that they could still look at which are not already ghost / retirement villages .
t.jacob , penarth , vale of glamorgan i 'm shocked by the decision of the council .
although i think it is important to protect the welsh language and culture this should not be used as and excuse to discriminate against others .
we are supposed to be a multi-cultural society , and the chalabis are evidently buying the house as a home , not as a holiday cottage .
gary slegg , wrexham , wales surely it 's the responsibility of the solicitors to identify such restrictions before the sale is in such an advanced stage .
do n't blame the council for following procedures .
but all sympathy to the chalabis , i hope they do find a suitable property in wales .
brian cardiff .
even if mrs connor returns the 15 % discount to the council , how can any local on low income afford £ 206,000 for a house ?
robert marshall , carmarthen , carms .
i am against state interference of this sort on principle , but if the sellers had agreed to the restriction and got a price discount in return for accepting it , it seems only fair they should be held to their bargain .
another avenue of challenge would be that this is a restriction on the eu citizens ' right of freedom of movement .
the uk would have to justify the rule to the european court of justice .
i think the point is at least arguable .
bruce manford , monte carlo , monaco i can understand the reasoning of gwynedd council , and there is much to merit the approach in preventing second home buyers .
however , i do n't think stopping someone from moving to the area permanently is a particularly good idea .
it would be better to subsidise locals than to penalise incomers .
martyn winters , cardiff , wales a clear case of discrimination on grounds of national origin .

adrian hardhand , london , uk this unfettered property profiteering is genuinely damaging people 's lives and it 's good to see some limits applied .

royston vasey 's truer than we thought ...
colin , exeter , uk i support gwynedd - and this rule or similar should n't just be applicable to council houses .
consider denmark : in an area designated as ' holiday ' , people can buy 2nd homes .
if they buy a home in a non-holiday area , it has to be occupied 9months of the year , or the local council can cause it to be rented out to people of their choice .
rural communities have to be protected to keep them a community kit kilgour , cambridge , uk congratulations gwynedd council , you 've made the right decision - llongyfarchiadau gan cymry i gyd .
richard evans , abertawe , cymru the seller was in full knowledge of the discount she received when purchasing the house and therefore cognisant of the terms .
the local council should take back the discount on the house sale if they have no local person to purchase and use the money towards affordable housing .
as for the buyers , they should have first completed teh purchase of a new home prior to completing the sale of the existing home .
they have only themselves to blame for being homeless .
affordable homes is crucial to young and older people .
annette goyette , florida , usa you would have expected a lawyer to pick that up when search title and history of the property .
martin , canada to be fair to the chalabis , the restriction on local housing would run with the title to the property and this should have been pointed out the them by their solicitor before they exchanged contracts on their own property .
if they have any complaint it should be directed towards their own legal advisor .
you can not blame the council for sticking to a contract willingly entered into in 1982 by mrs connor .
david , denbigh , wales this demonstrates a part of the policy , missed by many , that prohibits not just the purchase of houses in certain areas , but also , in certain circumstances , prohibits the sale of a property .
what next , prohibiting the sale of properties to non-welsh speakers , or to pakistanis ?
peter , swansea this decision by gwynedd council seems completely fair .
if mrs connor bought the house at a reduced price because of this clause , then it seems that she has no grounds for complaint now .
it is a shame that the chalabis have been inconvenienced by this , but that should not affect the decision of gwynedd council .
there is a crisis in rural housing for locals in many parts of wales .
cumbria and cornwall have locality clauses , it is not insular of welsh councils to adopt similar measures .
in the absence of centrally directed laws or guidelines , councils like gwynedd are left to make decisions that they feel will best protect the heritage and character of their areas .
i feel it would be unfair and unrealistic to accuse gwynedd council of having made their decision with anything put the best interests of gwynedd at the forefront of their minds .
anyone who believes they took their decision to spite people not originally from the area would seem to be missing the wider picture and only focusing on a sensationalist element of the story .
this would not be an issue if there were measures protecting these fragile rural communities and it would seem that until there are such rules in place , that this story will sadly become more and more common .
g j brough -lrb- non-welsh speaker , non-gwynedd resident -rrb- g j brough , paris , france surely if no locals have come forward wanting to buy this house then the owner can sell it to whoever she likes ?
susan hughes , ruthin it 's not gwynedd being parochial .
the locality rules are contained in the housing act 1985 which creates the right to buy .
locality rules are available to any rural area designated as such by the office of the deputy prime minister .
such designations are found in england as well as wales .
to those who claim wales is insular i say stop being so paranoid .
i 'm welsh but not from pennal so i could n't buy the house .
david davies , ellesmere port cheshire i definitely support the council on this one - i wish we had similar local covenants in scotland .
i 've lived in rural perthshire for 5 years where there is virtually no affordable social housing to rent or buy ... this forces my family into the private sector with insecure and overpriced rentals .
without security of tenure , every new month means we could be just 30 days from homelessness - not an ideal way to bring up a family ...
i did have a council home for a while but with 3 kids a bedsit was n't really practical ! !
eddie smith , crieff , scotland good for gwynedd council for making far sighted regulations to try and stem the out of control housing market .
the freedom to live where you want should not be limited to those with the most money .
it is easy to make glib statements about insularity and isolationism .
the real scandal and the issue that must be addressed , is the thousands of families in wales and the rest of the uk who can not afford a home , not the plight of a rich couple who can afford to buy almost any house in the uk .
mike , cardiff in 1982 , a £ 15,000 house would be a real bargain . $ 240,000 in 2004 is anything but a bargain .
i am sure many people , like me , are fed up with ex- council tenants making outrageous profits on the sale of property .
how many locals in rural machynlleth can afford £ 240,000 ?
precious few ... which is why the rule was set in the first place .
mrs connor should be given the fair market value -lrb- less the % discounts she was originally given -rrb- and the council should sell to a local family -lrb- with no council connection ! -rrb-
janb , exeter uk as my ancestors emigrated from england to escape the tyranny of the british crown , i find it amusing to see the petty infringements upon the rights of others continuing in the uk .
tar taric , boston , massachusetts we do not know all the facts of course but on the face of it , it does seem difficult to understand that in a multi-racial , multi- cultural society that we purport to have in the uk that a local council is permitted to act in such an insular manner notwithstanding a covenant in its favour over the property .
it seems to me that a council would have a duty to its constituents and as such might consider that as mrs connor took advantage of the additional 15 % discount when purchasing the property then she compensates gwynedd council to the value of 15 % of the sale price -lrb- £ 240,000 x 15 % or £ 36,000 -rrb- in order to be released from her covenant .
andy coles , leamington spa , wawwickshire rampant house price inflation may not be unique to rural wales but the welsh language and culture is .
it is now not uncommon to find that the majority of a villages houses are second or holiday homes whilst young locals are forced to move away just to find a place to live-if measures like this prevent the lifeblood of our culture draining away then i am all for them .
steve , powys surely it ca n't be legal .
i strongly advocate protecting local language & culture -lrb- i am a fluent speaker of catalan -rrb- but do n't agree with this " protectionism " which can only isolate & divide communities .
anthony jenkins , barcelona , spain i would definitely support the gwynedd council ruling !
low cost housing in wales is far too susceptible to outsiders with huge profits from over-inflated house sales in england , coming in and excluding locals from gaining their own house due to the prices outsiders can offer .
paul mathews , port talbot , wales surely this ca n't be legal .
do we really want to be insular and isolated ?
i wish the chalabis and mrs connor the best of luck if they should consider seeking recompense via the courts .
doug evans , cardiff , wales surely if no locals have come forward wanting to buy this house then the owner can sell it to whoever she likes ?
i am afraid this does not surprise me , however .
wales is quite an insular place and until people here learn to welcome everyone , not to fear them as ' incomers ' things can only get worse .
having lived here for 10 years i am still made to feel like an outsider at times , as are my children who were all born here .

plaid cymru president dafydd iwan said owners of ex-council homes in gwynedd were expected to sell below market value .
he spoke out after the bbc wales news website reported how a £ 240,000 sale was halted .
it hit problems because of a rule aimed at making rural housing affordable to locals .
mr iwan , who is also a gwynedd councillor , said that , if he owned an ex-council property , he would be willing to sell it for as much as £ 100,000 below the market value .
he said it was " part and parcel " of the bargain .
on thursday , the bbc wales news website revealed how gill and zuhair chalabi sold their home in hampshire to buy a house in pennal , near machynlleth , for £ 240,000 .
mrs connor says she is being forced against her will to stay in her home the sale fell through as they were close to exchanging contracts - because gwynedd council invoked a clause stating that the old school house could only be sold to someone who had lived or worked in the area for three years .
the chalabis , who are in their 60s , are now living in bed-and-breakfast accommodation .
cilla connor bought the house with her husband in 1982 , when it was valued at just over £ 15,000 .
they had already rented it for four years .
the council said the connors were given a 15 % discount because of the locality clause .
however , mrs connor 's solicitors confirmed on friday that they may challenge the council directive and apply for a judicial review .
the dilemma of how to make rural housing affordable for local people is an issue for parts of rural wales , where prices have risen steeply .
there are concerns in welsh-speaking areas that the survival of the language is threatened if there are too many incomers .
gill and zuhair chalabi are now living in a bed-and-breakfast mr iwan admitted that the rule operated in gwynedd could seem " a bit of a nuisance , " but strongly defended the policy .
" about 95 % of the houses are sold on the open market , but this regulation is designed to help people with local connections , " he said .
" it can seem a bit of a nuisance , because after buying a house people say they should have the right to sell their house to anyone .
" but people with ex-council homes will have to sell for a slightly lower price .
" this is part and parcel of the bargain of owning an ex-council home and this would have been made quite clear to the owner . "
when asked whether he would be happy selling his property for £ 50,000 to £ 100,000 lower than its market value , mr iwan replied " yes " .
" we are trying to create a secondary market that is in reach of local people , " he added .
" there 's good reason why a few houses should be pegged back . "
mr iwan agreed that the council 's policy was partly designed to stop incomers buying up properties .
however , he said he was not aware of mrs connor 's case .
other houses mrs connor said mr iwan was talking " rubbish . "
" i think he 's -lrb- mr iwan -rrb- got a cheek .
i do n't think he would sell his home for lower than the asking price for a minute .
" i 'd rather let the place rot than sell it below the market value .
" if gwynedd council and plaid cymru want derelict houses in wales then that 's what 's going to happen . "
meanwhile , the people who had wanted to buy the house , the chalabis , are being supported by the local rector , geraint ap iorwerth , who said on friday that the couple were viewing other properties in the area .
we asked for your comments on this story .
a selection of responses are published below : do not agree with the council 's policy .
if the council can come up with a local buyer fair enough ; if they can not then the sale should go ahead to mr & mrs chalabi. e.reade , cardiff uk i had to laugh at mike from cardiff . £ 240,000 makes you rich enough to buy almost any house in the uk , does it mike ?
i live an hour outside london and £ 240,000 gets you a two-bedroom house if you 're lucky .
go into the city proper and it buys you a flat , as long as you do n't want anything too fancy .
in many areas you wo n't even get two bedrooms for that - in the uk property market £ 240,000 does n't make someone even remotely rich .
john b , uk the selling restriction is no secret .

there is a crisis in rural housing for locals in many parts of wales .
cumbria and cornwall have locality clauses , it is not insular of welsh councils to adopt similar measures .
in the absence of centrally directed laws or guidelines , councils like gwynedd are left to make decisions that they feel will best protect the heritage and character of their areas .
i feel it would be unfair and unrealistic to accuse gwynedd council of having made their decision with anything put the best interests of gwynedd at the forefront of their minds .
anyone who believes they took their decision to spite people not originally from the area would seem to be missing the wider picture and only focusing on a sensationalist element of the story .
this would not be an issue if there were measures protecting these fragile rural communities and it would seem that until there are such rules in place , that this story will sadly become more and more common .
g j brough -lrb- non-welsh speaker , non-gwynedd resident -rrb- g j brough , paris , france surely if no locals have come forward wanting to buy this house then the owner can sell it to whoever she likes ?
susan hughes , ruthin it 's not gwynedd being parochial .
the locality rules are contained in the housing act 1985 which creates the right to buy .
locality rules are available to any rural area designated as such by the office of the deputy prime minister .
such designations are found in england as well as wales .
to those who claim wales is insular i say stop being so paranoid .
i 'm welsh but not from pennal so i could n't buy the house .
david davies , ellesmere port cheshire i definitely support the council on this one - i wish we had similar local covenants in scotland .
i 've lived in rural perthshire for 5 years where there is virtually no affordable social housing to rent or buy ... this forces my family into the private sector with insecure and overpriced rentals .
without security of tenure , every new month means we could be just 30 days from homelessness - not an ideal way to bring up a family ...
i did have a council home for a while but with 3 kids a bedsit was n't really practical ! !
eddie smith , crieff , scotland good for gwynedd council for making far sighted regulations to try and stem the out of control housing market .
the freedom to live where you want should not be limited to those with the most money .
it is easy to make glib statements about insularity and isolationism .
the real scandal and the issue that must be addressed , is the thousands of families in wales and the rest of the uk who can not afford a home , not the plight of a rich couple who can afford to buy almost any house in the uk .
mike , cardiff in 1982 , a £ 15,000 house would be a real bargain . $ 240,000 in 2004 is anything but a bargain .
i am sure many people , like me , are fed up with ex- council tenants making outrageous profits on the sale of property .
how many locals in rural machynlleth can afford £ 240,000 ?
precious few ... which is why the rule was set in the first place .
mrs connor should be given the fair market value -lrb- less the % discounts she was originally given -rrb- and the council should sell to a local family -lrb- with no council connection ! -rrb-
janb , exeter uk as my ancestors emigrated from england to escape the tyranny of the british crown , i find it amusing to see the petty infringements upon the rights of others continuing in the uk .
tar taric , boston , massachusetts we do not know all the facts of course but on the face of it , it does seem difficult to understand that in a multi-racial , multi- cultural society that we purport to have in the uk that a local council is permitted to act in such an insular manner notwithstanding a covenant in its favour over the property .
it seems to me that a council would have a duty to its constituents and as such might consider that as mrs connor took advantage of the additional 15 % discount when purchasing the property then she compensates gwynedd council to the value of 15 % of the sale price -lrb- £ 240,000 x 15 % or £ 36,000 -rrb- in order to be released from her covenant .
andy coles , leamington spa , wawwickshire rampant house price inflation may not be unique to rural wales but the welsh language and culture is .
it is now not uncommon to find that the majority of a villages houses are second or holiday homes whilst young locals are forced to move away just to find a place to live-if measures like this prevent the lifeblood of our culture draining away then i am all for them .
steve , powys surely it ca n't be legal .
i strongly advocate protecting local language & culture -lrb- i am a fluent speaker of catalan -rrb- but do n't agree with this " protectionism " which can only isolate & divide communities .
anthony jenkins , barcelona , spain i would definitely support the gwynedd council ruling !
low cost housing in wales is far too susceptible to outsiders with huge profits from over-inflated house sales in england , coming in and excluding locals from gaining their own house due to the prices outsiders can offer .
paul mathews , port talbot , wales surely this ca n't be legal .
do we really want to be insular and isolated ?
i wish the chalabis and mrs connor the best of luck if they should consider seeking recompense via the courts .
doug evans , cardiff , wales surely if no locals have come forward wanting to buy this house then the owner can sell it to whoever she likes ?
i am afraid this does not surprise me , however .
wales is quite an insular place and until people here learn to welcome everyone , not to fear them as ' incomers ' things can only get worse .
having lived here for 10 years i am still made to feel like an outsider at times , as are my children who were all born here .

around 100 fans turned up on friday to watch the action in the psychological romantic thriller half light at ynys llanddwyn .
ms moore is the latest international star to film in wales .
half light is being filmed in and around newborough , and will take about eight weeks to make .
despite some criticisms about changes made to the island 's landscape for the film , residents say they are excited about the latest hollywood invasion of the island .
ynys llanddwyn is popular for its peninsula of sandy beaches .
it has a 13th century church dedicated to the welsh patron saint of lovers , santes dwynwen .
filing on anglesey is scheduled to last for eight weeks " they are filming at the lighthouse and about half of it is painted in terracotta , " said newborough resident wendy hughes , who was watching on friday .
" the filming is very interesting - i have been coming here every day since they started .
" the crew are very friendly .
we saw her -lrb- demi moore -rrb- last week , she was just walking past , she had been rehearsing on the island . "
mrs hughes said : " to be honest i would n't have recognised her , i 'm not a film buff , she had a pair of sunglasses on . "
excitement mrs hughes said she visited the set because it was a novelty on the island .
" hopefully for us , it will put us on the map , " she said .
" i know they are using the local library - it 's great they are using one of the resources here .

gwenfron griffiths , another newborough resident , said : " i went there last week to watch them put the sets up .
" they were putting something in a little cottage .
they have done up the lighthouse and made it look like stone .
" the bigger lighthouse of the two is painted a dark red , like a blood-red . "
" i do n't know why some people are complaining - nature has a way of restoring everything back again anyway . "
the filming of the thriller , also starring rising british actor hans matheson , is the latest in a long line of productions in wales .
recent films include tomb raider 2 - with angelina jolie - and parts of king arthur with ioan gruffudd .
richard coombs , of the north wales film commission , said : " we also have james nesbitt filming in rhyl and other parts of wales for a one-off comedy for itv . "
he said numerous film companies had travelled to wales to make use of its scenery .
they were also making use of the commission 's database , which holds details of thousands of production staff and facilities providers .

the scheme , which started this month , affects services from several villages to lampeter and aberystwyth .
resident sarah jane morgan , who has called the service " pretty awful " , has started a petition against it .
a spokesman for ceredigion council said buses which were carrying just one or two people were not sustainable .
ms morgan , from penbontrhydybeddau , said the taxi service was not popular .
" i think fewer people are using the service because it is so difficult to access , " she said . "
ideally i think we would rather a regular scheduled bus " sarah jane morgan " and you have to do it 24 hours in advance in office hours .
" so if you want a bus on a monday , you have to ring the previous friday .
" it is very difficult to book so far in advance .
" and if you have a hospital appointment , you do n't know how long it will take and you have to organise a taxi back .
" ideally i think we would rather a regular scheduled bus . "
ann edwards , also from penbontrhydybeddau , added that losing the regular buses was " a big blow to the community " .
" and not just to the youngsters , but to the older people who need their pension , who only want to go four miles down the road . "
" if nobody wants to go , the taxi does n't go " tommy jones , ceredigion council tommy jones , from ceredigion county council , said the service was trying to stop buses being " very much underused " .
" we have one or two people on buses , and if you look at it that way , they are not sustainable , " he said .
" but yet people in rural communities need a way to get to different towns for their shopping and for their doctors .
" so what we have looked at is a ' taxibus ' service which is a better service , but you have to book to use it .
" if nobody wants to go , the taxi does n't go . "
taxi driver rob lauder admitted there had been teething problems with the service .
" the first week or so was a bit messed up because a lot of them did n't realise they had to phone in the day before , " he said .
" they were just waiting on the bus stops . "
but he pointed out that passengers could now get to town much quicker - because the taxi did not have to go places unless someone there had made a booking .

although the project 's title - green ground zero - refers to the space in which the twin towers of the world trade center once stood , the project is designed around the entirety of new york 's lower manhattan district .
the aim , its founders argue , is to show that greener ways of living and " sustainable design " can be made part of a densely packed metropolis that exists in the real world .
the competition winners were announced here at the world urban forum .
farouk stemmet , one of the project 's advocates , told the bbc the idea was of " every building making its humble contribution " .
at both federal and local level there is interest in seeing this thing through farouk stemmet he explained one idea was to have tiny generators in every tap - so that every time the tap was turned on , the motion of the water passing over them produced electricity .
" you could , in theory , have a city of 10 million people acting as an electricity generator , " he said .
going underground the winning ideas are not part of the plans for the freedom tower - the competition ran after the architect daniel liebskind 's design was approved - nor are they part of any other official construction project .
instead , mr stemmet said , the idea was to demonstrate practical ideas that could help turn a real city into a sustainable , environmentally sound living-space .
ground zero will see a development led by architect daniel libeskind one winning competition entry , for example , featured details of how one could use the space at the top of the area 's numerous skyscrapers .
they included solar panels , wind turbines , large rainwater-collecting spaces , and a " green roof " covered in trees .
as well as energy , the competition also asked for ideas on light and air , construction , ecology , and greenery , water and waste .
as a result , other plans include a multi-layer " vertical park , " a tower-top farm , and " greywater gardens " that would use the waste water from human activities such as showering and clothes-washing .
another plan would see light captured at the top of buildings and taken via fibre-optic cables to below ground to subway stations .
in addition to providing natural light for commuters , such an idea would allow plants to grow , too .
city support mr stemmet said this could eventually mean they grew up to street level , providing the city with more green areas .
he said that light played a role as " medicine for the city 's healing " , a reference to both the plans for the new freedom tower and the twin pillars of light first illuminated in the spot where the world trade center had stood .
mr stemmet conceded that there had often been problems in persuading real-estate developers to incorporate such thinking into their building designs , especially as some of them had high-cost implications .
however , he believed that more developers were beginning to realise that they could make money out of these ideas .
and he stated further that the thinking had received crucial backing from the city of new york " at both federal and local level there is interest in seeing this thing through , " he said .

although the project 's title - green ground zero - refers to the space in which the twin towers of the world trade center once stood , the project is designed around the entirety of new york 's lower manhattan district .
the aim , its founders argue , is to show that greener ways of living and " sustainable design " can be made part of a densely packed metropolis that exists in the real world .
the competition winners were announced here at the world urban forum .
farouk stemmet , one of the project 's advocates , told the bbc the idea was of " every building making its humble contribution " .
at both federal and local level there is interest in seeing this thing through farouk stemmet he explained one idea was to have tiny generators in every tap - so that every time the tap was turned on , the motion of the water passing over them produced electricity .
" you could , in theory , have a city of 10 million people acting as an electricity generator , " he said .
going underground the winning ideas are not part of the plans for the freedom tower - the competition ran after the architect daniel liebskind 's design was approved - nor are they part of any other official construction project .
instead , mr stemmet said , the idea was to demonstrate practical ideas that could help turn a real city into a sustainable , environmentally sound living-space .
ground zero will see a development led by architect daniel libeskind one winning competition entry , for example , featured details of how one could use the space at the top of the area 's numerous skyscrapers .
they included solar panels , wind turbines , large rainwater-collecting spaces , and a " green roof " covered in trees .
as well as energy , the competition also asked for ideas on light and air , construction , ecology , and greenery , water and waste .
as a result , other plans include a multi-layer " vertical park , " a tower-top farm , and " greywater gardens " that would use the waste water from human activities such as showering and clothes-washing .
another plan would see light captured at the top of buildings and taken via fibre-optic cables to below ground to subway stations .
in addition to providing natural light for commuters , such an idea would allow plants to grow , too .
city support mr stemmet said this could eventually mean they grew up to street level , providing the city with more green areas .
he said that light played a role as " medicine for the city 's healing " , a reference to both the plans for the new freedom tower and the twin pillars of light first illuminated in the spot where the world trade center had stood .
mr stemmet conceded that there had often been problems in persuading real-estate developers to incorporate such thinking into their building designs , especially as some of them had high-cost implications .
however , he believed that more developers were beginning to realise that they could make money out of these ideas .
and he stated further that the thinking had received crucial backing from the city of new york " at both federal and local level there is interest in seeing this thing through , " he said .
" from that level , this is the agenda . "

and she revealed how the government and regulators ignored key evidence that pensions were at risk , continuing instead to reassure people their money was safe .
she explained how the department of work and pensions -lrb- dwp -rrb- put out leaflets telling people their pensions were " protected by a number of laws " and that " the regulator can act to look after you quickly " .
the result of the consultation was that they decided to ignore the advice of the actuaries ros altmann the financial services authority also sent information to scheme members telling them their final salary pensions were guaranteed , " mentioning no circumstances in which they might not be guaranteed " .

ms altmann told the programme none of these statements were true .
' careless ' over the years , she said , the protections that were in place began to disappear .
for example , the government relaxed the minimum funding requirement , allowing companies to put less money into schemes .
and crucially , she says , in 1999 and 2000 : " the institute of actuaries told the government ' members think they are safe and they are not .
you must at least warn them " ' .

and she told the programme , she feels people should also be compensated for the stress caused : " it is impossible to over-emphasise , the damage that this is doing to people 's lives . "
' not enough ' the government has already set up a £ 400m financial assistance scheme to help people in this situation .
but ms altmann is adamant this is not enough : " what this scheme is trying to do is fit a quart into a thimble .
it can not be done .
there a risk ... some of the people sadly will have died before they even get any compensation ms altmann " the fear i have is that the only thing that the £ 400m might be able to do is be some kind of means-tested benefit system for the hardship cases . "
she said the amount needed to properly compensate people is around £ 75m a year for about 40 years .
and she continued : " if the government refuses ... some of the people sadly will have died before they even get any compensation .
and they will have died in misery . "

bbc news online looks at why the new rights came about .
q : what is the right to roam ?
on 19 september , new rights laid down in the countryside and rights of way act 2000 start coming into force in kent , sussex , surrey and hampshire , as well as the forest of bowland , lancashire , and the peak district .
they grant walkers access to open country and registered common land in england and wales and will be rolled out across both countries in the next 15 months .
new maps are being published over the next year , showing where ramblers can walk over areas of privately-owned moor , mountain and heath land .
q : how long has the act been in the pipeline ?
the fight to open up large areas of countryside to the public goes back decades .
the first attempt to create a legal right to roam came with the mp james bryce 's 1884 bill for free access to scotland 's mountains .
it failed - as have 10 other attempts to introduce a freedom to roam bill in the 120 years since then .
violent clashes between walkers and gamekeepers on kinder scout hill , in derbyshire , in 1932 pushed the issue further into the public eye .
q : why do we need the act ?
the ramblers ' association says the new legislation will mean everyone , whether rich or poor , will be able to enjoy the wild landscapes of england and wales .
supporters say a centuries-old tradition of free access has been eroded in the last few decades as private ownership has changed .
while the forestry commission has always allowed access to its property , the sale of much of its land has closed thousands of acres to the public .
q : why is it controversial ?
while some say people have the right of access to countryside that has often been open for generations , others say landowners have the right to protect their own property .
some landowners see it as a dangerous free-for-all which would damage the economic and environmental viability of their land .
for example , some farmers are worried walkers will not keep dogs on leads and allow them to foul their fields .
some landowners have complained that some areas have been wrongly included on maps drawn up to show ramblers where they have a right to roam .
and there are some concerns that the new laws will invade their privacy .
in june , pop star madonna won a bid to keep ramblers from part of her estate on the wiltshire / dorset border saying her human rights would be infringed .
q : what governs ramblers ' behaviour ?
the countryside agency has drawn up a countryside code , asking walkers to " respect , protect and enjoy " their surroundings .
it expands on long-standing reminders to walkers to close farm gates , keep dogs under control and protect animals and plants .
and it urges walkers to plan ahead and follow local advice on whether areas may be restricted due to breeding seasons or while work is carried out .
however there is no legal obligation on walkers to follow the code .
q : how will the act be enforced ?
the new right of access will be managed by local authorities and national park authorities .
magistrates will also be able to use greater powers to clear blocked paths and there will be tougher penalties for wildlife offences .
