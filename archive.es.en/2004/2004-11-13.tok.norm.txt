opened on friday , the project paves the way for widespread use of alternative energy . in what was probably the most high-profile turn-out for a service station opening , some 100 managers from four international carmakers , energy experts , environmentalists and a minister for transportation all convened at a berlin service station to watch the first fleet of fuel cell-driven cars fill their tanks with hydrogen .
the demonstration at the aral service station in downtown berlin friday marked the launch of what many environmentalists hope will be the start of a bigger trend towards hydrogen-powered vehicles .
although still in its infancy as far as widespread implementation goes , fuel cell cars are being regarded as an important development in the automotive industry to reduce gasoline emissions and world-wide dependence on oil supplies .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.11.2004 opinion : a model worth repeating großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he voted on eu membership , his parliament ratified the constitution while several eu countries plan to put the proposed eu constitution before voters , lithuania this week became the first country to ratify the document in parliament .
it was a wise step , according to dw 's klaus dahmann . delivering an expectedly positive overture to the drawn-out process of ratifying the eu constitution , the lithuanian parliament overwhelmingly approved the document on thursday . the vote itself is less significant than the fact that there was a broad consensus that no referendum was necessary .
after all , 90 percent of lithuanians had obviously expressed confidence in the bloc by voting for eu membership in may 2003 , all political parties agreed . ardent supporters of grass-roots democracy might condemn that line of argument .
they 'd counter that eu membership and the eu 's proposed new constitution are two completely separate issues and people could very well support membership and oppose the constitution at the same time . voting on the wrong thing still , no one needs prophetic abilities to realize that , at best , referendums on the constitution will be votes on eu policy as a whole rather than the document .
in the worse case scenario , they 'll become polls on voters ' satisfaction with their respective national governments at the time . clearly , everyone can read the constitution .
large parts of the document address citizens directly , especially the second part , which focuses on basic rights . but the largest section deals with quotas and percentages , with exceptions , tactical loopholes and " yes , but " formulations .
all of this is necessary for a document based on political compromise , but it 's also fairly incomprehensible for the average citizen . that 's why some will use the referendums as an opportunity to " show them up there " how this , that and the other thing could be handled much better .
since the only options are to say " yes " or " no , " the temptation will be to do the latter . bildunterschrift : eu leaders pose for a family picture after signing the eu constitution in rome on oct .
29 .
countries planning to hold referendums include britain , france , denmark , the netherlands , spain , portugal , belgium and ireland . but most people wo n't even bother to carefully read the 350-page charter and instead let fantasy run wild on what they 're voting on : high salaries for eu civil servants , the proposed turkish eu membership or their national governments failed economic policy , as the case may be . populists will be flying high in the months leading up to the elections .
but all of this does n't have anything to do with well-meaning grass-roots democracy . " core europe " is not desirable one thing should definitely be clear : failure of the constitution to pass in one or more countries would serve as a catalyst for an undesirable development - the emergence of a mini-eu within the eu .
some politicians already dream about such a " core europe " but do n't dare to say so explicitly . it 's also obvious that lithuania will not suffer any future harm because of the ratification but instead has secured itself the no. 1 spot - ahead of germany and italy , both of whom actually wanted to shine as the speediest ratifiers .
that 's why lithuania has now become a bright model that 's worth repeating . klaus dahmann -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : the constitution is n't perfect but must do although the eu constitution has plenty of flaws and it still has to be ratified by member states , it reflects a compromise and marks the dawning of a new era , says dw 's bernd riegert .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.11.2004 corsican nationalists target immigrants großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not so peaceful for immigrants any more corsican nationalists who have bombed buildings in their war to win independence from france have turned their focus to the island 's immigrant community . the telephone rings at the office of ava basta , a group dedicated to fighting racism .
the caller leaves a message : " now it ’ s us who ’ ve had enough of you !
we ’ re going to form an anti-moroccan committee ! " nearby , on the metal grill that protects the association ’ s windows at night , graffiti announces a bomb .
and these days , spray-painted slogans such as " francesi fori " - " french out " are becoming " arabs go home . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yvan colonna , top suspect in the 1998 murder france 's highest official on the french mediterranean island of corsica .
for almost 30 years , corsican nationalists have bombed public buildings in an attempt to separate from france .
but now nationalistic violence has turned against the immigrant community , mainly made up of moroccans . " we thought our place was here " corsica is home to about 30,000 immigrants - one tenth of the population - and these days , many of them said they feel threatened and have had enough . " every day we hear ' dirty arab ' or ' arabs out ' , " said one moroccan resident of corsica .
" we ’ ve got no pride left , no dignity as human beings and with a heavy heart , i want to leave .
my three children were born here , but we can ’ t live here anymore . " another foreign resident said it hurts to be treated this way . " we thought we were well integrated , " said a moroccan woman .
" we thought our place was here . " a community in trauma the inhabitants of a peaceful , suburban neighbourhood of the northern city of bastia repair the walls around their gardens .
they were damaged when a huge blast destroyed the house next door .
the owner of what is now just a charred ruin of twisted metal and rubble is a moroccan tile worker .
he had almost finished building the villa of his dreams .
meanwhile , estate agents in bastia have been warned : don ’ t sell to north africans or face the consequences . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corsicans reading the newspaper after a 2003 no vote to give more autonomy to their island .
beneath one of the splendid baroque churches of bastia , most of the stall-holders and most of the customers at the market are north africans .
to the outsider , it seems to be a place where the cultures of the two sides of the mediterranean can mingle under the shade of the plane trees . but the reality is much darker : it is a community in trauma .
the area is full of destruction : torched cars , a bombed out pizza parlor , bank and shops .
this is part of 56 acts of violence against the island ’ s north african community over the past year - as many as in the whole of the rest of france put together .
two underground nationalist groups called the clandestini corsi and the mca that emerged this year have claimed responsibility for many of the attacks , which , they said , are aimed against the drug trade . drugs as a pretext that is a claim authorities dismiss .
the public prosecutor for northern corsica , jean-jacques fagni , called drugs a pretext . " it isn ’ t true that only north africans deal drugs , " he said .
" some do ... but so do french people whose origins are in corsica or mainland france .
this argument is just an attempt to justify acts which are essentially racist in character . " " for us , corsican people is not an ethic term " at a meeting in corte , the first public event organized to protest against the new , racist violence , all the island 's separatist leaders attended .
the town itself holds special significance for nationalists because it was corsica ’ s capital during its brief period of independence in the 18th century .
they discussed a recent racist tract sent to a local television station that signed off with the words " the land for the corsicans , " copied from an old nationalist slogan " corsica for the corsicans . " jean-guy talamoni , corsica ’ s most prominent separatist leader , said his definition of what it means to be corsican is an inclusive one . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a corsican stands next to a placard reading " no to the republican fall of corsica " in 2003 " the nationalists have , for 30 years , defined the corsican people as a distinct community made up of native and adopted corsicans , " he said .
" we even passed a motion in the corsican territorial assembly in 1988 affirming precisely that .
for us ' corsican people ' is not an ethnic term . " on the mountain road above bastia there 's a world war ii monument commemorating the soldiers who lost their lives liberating corsica from the nazis .
nearly all of them were moroccan .
the inscription ends with the regret that they would never know how much they were loved by the people they liberated .
for the north african community in corsica today , such sentiments appear increasingly hollow . john laurenson -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de corsica says " non " to greater autonomy the voters of corsica rejected a french offer of limited autonomy by a narrow margin in referendum on sunday , after the capture of the troubled island 's most wanted separatist .

the caller leaves a message : " now it ’ s us who ’ ve had enough of you !
we ’ re going to form an anti-moroccan committee ! " nearby , on the metal grill that protects the association ’ s windows at night , graffiti announces a bomb .
and these days , spray-painted slogans such as " francesi fori " - " french out " are becoming " arabs go home . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yvan colonna , top suspect in the 1998 murder france 's highest official on the french mediterranean island of corsica .
for almost 30 years , corsican nationalists have bombed public buildings in an attempt to separate from france .
but now nationalistic violence has turned against the immigrant community , mainly made up of moroccans . " we thought our place was here " corsica is home to about 30,000 immigrants - one tenth of the population - and these days , many of them said they feel threatened and have had enough . " every day we hear ' dirty arab ' or ' arabs out ' , " said one moroccan resident of corsica .
" we ’ ve got no pride left , no dignity as human beings and with a heavy heart , i want to leave .
my three children were born here , but we can ’ t live here anymore . " another foreign resident said it hurts to be treated this way . " we thought we were well integrated , " said a moroccan woman .
" we thought our place was here . " a community in trauma the inhabitants of a peaceful , suburban neighbourhood of the northern city of bastia repair the walls around their gardens .
they were damaged when a huge blast destroyed the house next door .
the owner of what is now just a charred ruin of twisted metal and rubble is a moroccan tile worker .
he had almost finished building the villa of his dreams .
meanwhile , estate agents in bastia have been warned : don ’ t sell to north africans or face the consequences . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corsicans reading the newspaper after a 2003 no vote to give more autonomy to their island .
beneath one of the splendid baroque churches of bastia , most of the stall-holders and most of the customers at the market are north africans .
to the outsider , it seems to be a place where the cultures of the two sides of the mediterranean can mingle under the shade of the plane trees . but the reality is much darker : it is a community in trauma .
the area is full of destruction : torched cars , a bombed out pizza parlor , bank and shops .
this is part of 56 acts of violence against the island ’ s north african community over the past year - as many as in the whole of the rest of france put together .
two underground nationalist groups called the clandestini corsi and the mca that emerged this year have claimed responsibility for many of the attacks , which , they said , are aimed against the drug trade . drugs as a pretext that is a claim authorities dismiss .
the public prosecutor for northern corsica , jean-jacques fagni , called drugs a pretext . " it isn ’ t true that only north africans deal drugs , " he said .
" some do ... but so do french people whose origins are in corsica or mainland france .
this argument is just an attempt to justify acts which are essentially racist in character . " " for us , corsican people is not an ethic term " at a meeting in corte , the first public event organized to protest against the new , racist violence , all the island 's separatist leaders attended .
the town itself holds special significance for nationalists because it was corsica ’ s capital during its brief period of independence in the 18th century .
they discussed a recent racist tract sent to a local television station that signed off with the words " the land for the corsicans , " copied from an old nationalist slogan " corsica for the corsicans . " jean-guy talamoni , corsica ’ s most prominent separatist leader , said his definition of what it means to be corsican is an inclusive one . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a corsican stands next to a placard reading " no to the republican fall of corsica " in 2003 " the nationalists have , for 30 years , defined the corsican people as a distinct community made up of native and adopted corsicans , " he said .
" we even passed a motion in the corsican territorial assembly in 1988 affirming precisely that .
for us ' corsican people ' is not an ethnic term . " on the mountain road above bastia there 's a world war ii monument commemorating the soldiers who lost their lives liberating corsica from the nazis .
nearly all of them were moroccan .
the inscription ends with the regret that they would never know how much they were loved by the people they liberated .
for the north african community in corsica today , such sentiments appear increasingly hollow . john laurenson -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de corsica says " non " to greater autonomy the voters of corsica rejected a french offer of limited autonomy by a narrow margin in referendum on sunday , after the capture of the troubled island 's most wanted separatist .

it was a wise step , according to dw 's klaus dahmann . delivering an expectedly positive overture to the drawn-out process of ratifying the eu constitution , the lithuanian parliament overwhelmingly approved the document on thursday . the vote itself is less significant than the fact that there was a broad consensus that no referendum was necessary .
after all , 90 percent of lithuanians had obviously expressed confidence in the bloc by voting for eu membership in may 2003 , all political parties agreed . ardent supporters of grass-roots democracy might condemn that line of argument .
they 'd counter that eu membership and the eu 's proposed new constitution are two completely separate issues and people could very well support membership and oppose the constitution at the same time . voting on the wrong thing still , no one needs prophetic abilities to realize that , at best , referendums on the constitution will be votes on eu policy as a whole rather than the document .
in the worse case scenario , they 'll become polls on voters ' satisfaction with their respective national governments at the time . clearly , everyone can read the constitution .
large parts of the document address citizens directly , especially the second part , which focuses on basic rights . but the largest section deals with quotas and percentages , with exceptions , tactical loopholes and " yes , but " formulations .
all of this is necessary for a document based on political compromise , but it 's also fairly incomprehensible for the average citizen . that 's why some will use the referendums as an opportunity to " show them up there " how this , that and the other thing could be handled much better .
since the only options are to say " yes " or " no , " the temptation will be to do the latter . bildunterschrift : eu leaders pose for a family picture after signing the eu constitution in rome on oct .

countries planning to hold referendums include britain , france , denmark , the netherlands , spain , portugal , belgium and ireland . but most people wo n't even bother to carefully read the 350-page charter and instead let fantasy run wild on what they 're voting on : high salaries for eu civil servants , the proposed turkish eu membership or their national governments failed economic policy , as the case may be . populists will be flying high in the months leading up to the elections .
but all of this does n't have anything to do with well-meaning grass-roots democracy . " core europe " is not desirable one thing should definitely be clear : failure of the constitution to pass in one or more countries would serve as a catalyst for an undesirable development - the emergence of a mini-eu within the eu .
some politicians already dream about such a " core europe " but do n't dare to say so explicitly . it 's also obvious that lithuania will not suffer any future harm because of the ratification but instead has secured itself the no. 1 spot - ahead of germany and italy , both of whom actually wanted to shine as the speediest ratifiers .
that 's why lithuania has now become a bright model that 's worth repeating . klaus dahmann -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : the constitution is n't perfect but must do although the eu constitution has plenty of flaws and it still has to be ratified by member states , it reflects a compromise and marks the dawning of a new era , says dw 's bernd riegert .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.11.2004 opinion : a model worth repeating großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he voted on eu membership , his parliament ratified the constitution while several eu countries plan to put the proposed eu constitution before voters , lithuania this week became the first country to ratify the document in parliament .
it was a wise step , according to dw 's klaus dahmann . delivering an expectedly positive overture to the drawn-out process of ratifying the eu constitution , the lithuanian parliament overwhelmingly approved the document on thursday . the vote itself is less significant than the fact that there was a broad consensus that no referendum was necessary .
after all , 90 percent of lithuanians had obviously expressed confidence in the bloc by voting for eu membership in may 2003 , all political parties agreed . ardent supporters of grass-roots democracy might condemn that line of argument .
they 'd counter that eu membership and the eu 's proposed new constitution are two completely separate issues and people could very well support membership and oppose the constitution at the same time . voting on the wrong thing still , no one needs prophetic abilities to realize that , at best , referendums on the constitution will be votes on eu policy as a whole rather than the document .
in the worse case scenario , they 'll become polls on voters ' satisfaction with their respective national governments at the time . clearly , everyone can read the constitution .
large parts of the document address citizens directly , especially the second part , which focuses on basic rights . but the largest section deals with quotas and percentages , with exceptions , tactical loopholes and " yes , but " formulations .
all of this is necessary for a document based on political compromise , but it 's also fairly incomprehensible for the average citizen . that 's why some will use the referendums as an opportunity to " show them up there " how this , that and the other thing could be handled much better .
since the only options are to say " yes " or " no , " the temptation will be to do the latter . bildunterschrift : eu leaders pose for a family picture after signing the eu constitution in rome on oct .
29 .
countries planning to hold referendums include britain , france , denmark , the netherlands , spain , portugal , belgium and ireland . but most people wo n't even bother to carefully read the 350-page charter and instead let fantasy run wild on what they 're voting on : high salaries for eu civil servants , the proposed turkish eu membership or their national governments failed economic policy , as the case may be . populists will be flying high in the months leading up to the elections .
but all of this does n't have anything to do with well-meaning grass-roots democracy . " core europe " is not desirable one thing should definitely be clear : failure of the constitution to pass in one or more countries would serve as a catalyst for an undesirable development - the emergence of a mini-eu within the eu .
some politicians already dream about such a " core europe " but do n't dare to say so explicitly . it 's also obvious that lithuania will not suffer any future harm because of the ratification but instead has secured itself the no. 1 spot - ahead of germany and italy , both of whom actually wanted to shine as the speediest ratifiers .
that 's why lithuania has now become a bright model that 's worth repeating . klaus dahmann -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : the constitution is n't perfect but must do although the eu constitution has plenty of flaws and it still has to be ratified by member states , it reflects a compromise and marks the dawning of a new era , says dw 's bernd riegert .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.11.2004 corsican nationalists target immigrants großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not so peaceful for immigrants any more corsican nationalists who have bombed buildings in their war to win independence from france have turned their focus to the island 's immigrant community . the telephone rings at the office of ava basta , a group dedicated to fighting racism .
the caller leaves a message : " now it ’ s us who ’ ve had enough of you !
we ’ re going to form an anti-moroccan committee ! " nearby , on the metal grill that protects the association ’ s windows at night , graffiti announces a bomb .
and these days , spray-painted slogans such as " francesi fori " - " french out " are becoming " arabs go home . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yvan colonna , top suspect in the 1998 murder france 's highest official on the french mediterranean island of corsica .
for almost 30 years , corsican nationalists have bombed public buildings in an attempt to separate from france .
but now nationalistic violence has turned against the immigrant community , mainly made up of moroccans . " we thought our place was here " corsica is home to about 30,000 immigrants - one tenth of the population - and these days , many of them said they feel threatened and have had enough . " every day we hear ' dirty arab ' or ' arabs out ' , " said one moroccan resident of corsica .
" we ’ ve got no pride left , no dignity as human beings and with a heavy heart , i want to leave .
my three children were born here , but we can ’ t live here anymore . " another foreign resident said it hurts to be treated this way . " we thought we were well integrated , " said a moroccan woman .
" we thought our place was here . " a community in trauma the inhabitants of a peaceful , suburban neighbourhood of the northern city of bastia repair the walls around their gardens .
they were damaged when a huge blast destroyed the house next door .
the owner of what is now just a charred ruin of twisted metal and rubble is a moroccan tile worker .
he had almost finished building the villa of his dreams .
meanwhile , estate agents in bastia have been warned : don ’ t sell to north africans or face the consequences . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corsicans reading the newspaper after a 2003 no vote to give more autonomy to their island .
beneath one of the splendid baroque churches of bastia , most of the stall-holders and most of the customers at the market are north africans .
to the outsider , it seems to be a place where the cultures of the two sides of the mediterranean can mingle under the shade of the plane trees . but the reality is much darker : it is a community in trauma .
the area is full of destruction : torched cars , a bombed out pizza parlor , bank and shops .
this is part of 56 acts of violence against the island ’ s north african community over the past year - as many as in the whole of the rest of france put together .
two underground nationalist groups called the clandestini corsi and the mca that emerged this year have claimed responsibility for many of the attacks , which , they said , are aimed against the drug trade . drugs as a pretext that is a claim authorities dismiss .
the public prosecutor for northern corsica , jean-jacques fagni , called drugs a pretext . " it isn ’ t true that only north africans deal drugs , " he said .
" some do ... but so do french people whose origins are in corsica or mainland france .
this argument is just an attempt to justify acts which are essentially racist in character . " " for us , corsican people is not an ethic term " at a meeting in corte , the first public event organized to protest against the new , racist violence , all the island 's separatist leaders attended .
the town itself holds special significance for nationalists because it was corsica ’ s capital during its brief period of independence in the 18th century .
they discussed a recent racist tract sent to a local television station that signed off with the words " the land for the corsicans , " copied from an old nationalist slogan " corsica for the corsicans . " jean-guy talamoni , corsica ’ s most prominent separatist leader , said his definition of what it means to be corsican is an inclusive one . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a corsican stands next to a placard reading " no to the republican fall of corsica " in 2003 " the nationalists have , for 30 years , defined the corsican people as a distinct community made up of native and adopted corsicans , " he said .
" we even passed a motion in the corsican territorial assembly in 1988 affirming precisely that .
for us ' corsican people ' is not an ethnic term . " on the mountain road above bastia there 's a world war ii monument commemorating the soldiers who lost their lives liberating corsica from the nazis .
nearly all of them were moroccan .
the inscription ends with the regret that they would never know how much they were loved by the people they liberated .
for the north african community in corsica today , such sentiments appear increasingly hollow . john laurenson -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de corsica says " non " to greater autonomy the voters of corsica rejected a french offer of limited autonomy by a narrow margin in referendum on sunday , after the capture of the troubled island 's most wanted separatist .

with his eyes clearly set on a national victory in two years , jürgen klinsmann has vowed to introduce new training techniques learned while living and working in the united states .
in an interview with dw-world , klinsmann stressed how important winning the world cup is for german national pride : " every time germany wins a world cup , it has an enormous importance for the whole country and people - a feeling of self-worth and pride . "
in order to reach that goal , the coach has begun implementing changes in the way the team trains and the way it works together .
he has hired on us fitness trainers , brought on a lot of new young players and criticized a few big names in the sport .
dw-world 's guido baumhauer asked him about how the reforms were being received .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann in dw-interview with dw-world 's guido baumhauer klinsmann : " we germans are always ready for reforms , but when it comes to changes , it gets to be a little bit uncomfortable , because we 're forced to depart from our daily routine , " klinsmann said .
dw-world : mr. klinsmann , you were active with the los angeles galaxy in some way or another over the past four years .
what training and motivation techniques have you brought over from the us and how have the german players adapted to them ?
klinsmann : we introduced some different ideas a few weeks ago in berlin before the game against brazil .
we had invited some athletic coaches from the us who used some of their training methods .
it was n't that they were so new but they were a little different for the players and it was well received .
dw : how do the sporting mentalities differ between germany and the us ?
jk : they are both big sports countries .
obviously in the us , you have a big sports variety : basketball , baseball , american football , hockey , golf and then soccer .
in germany , you have soccer , soccer and then soccer .
this is part of our culture and part of europe .
in general though , both nations are sports crazy .

dw : one of the biggest success stories in sports marketing in europe has been the english premiere league .
match times , just to name one example , are sometimes changed to make the games more marketable .
do you have any views on how to increase the commercial image of the bundesliga ?
jk : the premiere league did an unbelievable job in the last 15 years .
based on the connections with -lsb- rupert -rsb- murdoch and the sky network , they placed the premiere league in almost every country in the world , so it became more and more popular .
maybe this is something the bundesliga can pick up on .
we can show it around the world and convince the people of the product and maybe in a few years we 'll be at the same level .
dw : german soccer is seen by many as coming up on the short end of the stick compared to the primera division in spain , the serie a in italy and the english premiere league in terms of marketability , quality of soccer and audience excitement .
do you agree with that claim ?
jk : no .
absolutely not .
all four leagues belong to the top four in the world .
the stadiums are packed , the games are exciting .

in an interview with dw-world , klinsmann stressed how important winning the world cup is for german national pride : " every time germany wins a world cup , it has an enormous importance for the whole country and people - a feeling of self-worth and pride . "
in order to reach that goal , the coach has begun implementing changes in the way the team trains and the way it works together .
he has hired on us fitness trainers , brought on a lot of new young players and criticized a few big names in the sport .
dw-world 's guido baumhauer asked him about how the reforms were being received .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann in dw-interview with dw-world 's guido baumhauer klinsmann : " we germans are always ready for reforms , but when it comes to changes , it gets to be a little bit uncomfortable , because we 're forced to depart from our daily routine , " klinsmann said .
dw-world : mr. klinsmann , you were active with the los angeles galaxy in some way or another over the past four years .
what training and motivation techniques have you brought over from the us and how have the german players adapted to them ?
klinsmann : we introduced some different ideas a few weeks ago in berlin before the game against brazil .
we had invited some athletic coaches from the us who used some of their training methods .
it was n't that they were so new but they were a little different for the players and it was well received .
dw : how do the sporting mentalities differ between germany and the us ?
jk : they are both big sports countries .
obviously in the us , you have a big sports variety : basketball , baseball , american football , hockey , golf and then soccer .
in germany , you have soccer , soccer and then soccer .
this is part of our culture and part of europe .
in general though , both nations are sports crazy .

dw : one of the biggest success stories in sports marketing in europe has been the english premiere league .
match times , just to name one example , are sometimes changed to make the games more marketable .
do you have any views on how to increase the commercial image of the bundesliga ?
jk : the premiere league did an unbelievable job in the last 15 years .
based on the connections with -lsb- rupert -rsb- murdoch and the sky network , they placed the premiere league in almost every country in the world , so it became more and more popular .
maybe this is something the bundesliga can pick up on .
we can show it around the world and convince the people of the product and maybe in a few years we 'll be at the same level .
dw : german soccer is seen by many as coming up on the short end of the stick compared to the primera division in spain , the serie a in italy and the english premiere league in terms of marketability , quality of soccer and audience excitement .
do you agree with that claim ?
jk : no .
absolutely not .
all four leagues belong to the top four in the world .
the stadiums are packed , the games are exciting .
here in germany , the whole country is excited about hosting the world cup in two years .
we are moving ahead nicely and do n't have to hide from anybody . guido baumhauer -lrb- jk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bringing the world cup into the schools in the run-up to the 2006 world cup in germany , a new project headed by national soccer coach jürgen klinsmann aims to teach kids how to think globally and about the importance of good sportsmanship .

he did not say how soon after that date he would travel to europe , where ties to countries such as france and germany are still strained after the us decision to invade iraq last year .

opened on friday , the project paves the way for widespread use of alternative energy . in what was probably the most high-profile turn-out for a service station opening , some 100 managers from four international carmakers , energy experts , environmentalists and a minister for transportation all convened at a berlin service station to watch the first fleet of fuel cell-driven cars fill their tanks with hydrogen .
the demonstration at the aral service station in downtown berlin friday marked the launch of what many environmentalists hope will be the start of a bigger trend towards hydrogen-powered vehicles .
although still in its infancy as far as widespread implementation goes , fuel cell cars are being regarded as an important development in the automotive industry to reduce gasoline emissions and world-wide dependence on oil supplies .
" the berlin project is an important milestone on the road to a sustainable , emissions-free future for hydrogen-powered cars , " proclaimed uwe franke , head of the german branch of bp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : transportation minister manfred stolpe fills up with hydrogen for the first time in europe , a service station offers drivers hydrogen - in liquid and compressed form - next to the usual pumps for gasoline and diesel , franke said .
aral , which belongs to bp , has integrated the two forms of energy into one service station , and will serve as an important pioneer in the field .
together with the other members of the clean energy partnership -lrb- cep -rrb- which includes representatives from the car industry , energy providers and transportation experts , bp hopes to gain more knowledge on the production , delivery and storage of hydrogen for fuel cell-driven cars .
capacity for 100 cars the berlin service station has enough capacity to fill 100 vehicles with hydrogen .
at the moment , though , there are only 16 cars and one city bus which will hook up at the aral pumps .
the cars from bmw , daimlerchrysler , ford and opel are only prototypes and have not been designed for widespread use .
although the automotive industry has generally expressed an interest in developing fuel cell-driven cars , the few models they have built are still only in the test phase .
it will still be several years before the companies go into serial production .
daimlerchrysler has said it intends to be the first to introduce a fuel cell car in 2010 .
general motors and its german division opel announced earlier in the year that they want to be the first to sell over a million hydrogen-powered cars in the near future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder test drives daimlerchrysler 's new f-cell car which runs on hydrogen .

" until then hydrogen technology must prove itself as a reliable , cost-efficient and consumer friendly source of energy . "
the production , storage and refueling of hydrogen , its price and performance must all be tested on real market conditions - and that is the goal of the berlin aral station , stolpe explained .

opened on friday , the project paves the way for widespread use of alternative energy . in what was probably the most high-profile turn-out for a service station opening , some 100 managers from four international carmakers , energy experts , environmentalists and a minister for transportation all convened at a berlin service station to watch the first fleet of fuel cell-driven cars fill their tanks with hydrogen .
the demonstration at the aral service station in downtown berlin friday marked the launch of what many environmentalists hope will be the start of a bigger trend towards hydrogen-powered vehicles .
although still in its infancy as far as widespread implementation goes , fuel cell cars are being regarded as an important development in the automotive industry to reduce gasoline emissions and world-wide dependence on oil supplies .
" the berlin project is an important milestone on the road to a sustainable , emissions-free future for hydrogen-powered cars , " proclaimed uwe franke , head of the german branch of bp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : transportation minister manfred stolpe fills up with hydrogen for the first time in europe , a service station offers drivers hydrogen - in liquid and compressed form - next to the usual pumps for gasoline and diesel , franke said .
aral , which belongs to bp , has integrated the two forms of energy into one service station , and will serve as an important pioneer in the field .
together with the other members of the clean energy partnership -lrb- cep -rrb- which includes representatives from the car industry , energy providers and transportation experts , bp hopes to gain more knowledge on the production , delivery and storage of hydrogen for fuel cell-driven cars .
capacity for 100 cars the berlin service station has enough capacity to fill 100 vehicles with hydrogen .
at the moment , though , there are only 16 cars and one city bus which will hook up at the aral pumps .
the cars from bmw , daimlerchrysler , ford and opel are only prototypes and have not been designed for widespread use .
although the automotive industry has generally expressed an interest in developing fuel cell-driven cars , the few models they have built are still only in the test phase .
it will still be several years before the companies go into serial production .
daimlerchrysler has said it intends to be the first to introduce a fuel cell car in 2010 .
general motors and its german division opel announced earlier in the year that they want to be the first to sell over a million hydrogen-powered cars in the near future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder test drives daimlerchrysler 's new f-cell car which runs on hydrogen .
for the time being , though , the biggest obstacle to hydrogen-powered cars is the price , both for the original purchase and refueling .
those who do drive one of the early models are primarily politicians , such as chancellor gerhard schröder , who were given the vehicles as part of a publicity campaign .

" until then hydrogen technology must prove itself as a reliable , cost-efficient and consumer friendly source of energy . "
the production , storage and refueling of hydrogen , its price and performance must all be tested on real market conditions - and that is the goal of the berlin aral station , stolpe explained .

" in my second term , i will work to deepen our transatlantic ties with the nations of europe , " the american leader said .
" i intend to visit europe as soon as possible after my inauguration . "
bush , who was re-elected last week , will be inaugurated jan .
20 .
he did not say how soon after that date he would travel to europe , where ties to countries such as france and germany are still strained after the us decision to invade iraq last year .
reluctant alliance bush 's last trip to europe was in june to mark the 60th anniversary of the d-day allied landing in normandy , france , that heralded the end of world war ii .
compared to previous us presidents , bush has kept a distance from european allies , with the exception of britain , and few of the leaders who opposed the iraq war have openly embraced the us and its leader since the invasion .
bush has also been reluctant to meet with european politicians unless they see eye-to-eye with him on the iraq issue .
whereas britain 's tony blair has often visited the white house , french president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder have been infrequent guests in washington since bush first came to office .
as for spain , once a strong ally under its former prime minister jose maria aznar , bush has yet to take a phone call from the country 's new socialist leader jose luis rodriguez zapatero , who withdrew his country 's troops from the war-torn country shortly after being elected in march .
on tuesday , though , aznar visited with the president in the white house and king juan carlos and queen sofia are expected to visit bush 's ranch in texas on nov .
24 .
better years ahead ?
since winning a new four-year term , bush has said he wants to work on improving cooperation with his european allies .
at the same time , though , he has made it clear that the us will still go into battle alone if necessary to protect us interests - a unilateral approach many in europe reject .

11 , 2004 he said friday his european trip would serve to remind people on both sides of the atlantic that " the world is better off , america is better off , europe is better off , when we work together . "
" there 's a lot we can accomplish working together , " bush said referring to his administration 's intention to cooperate with europeans on tracking down members of the al qaeda terrorist network , halting the spread of weapons of mass destruction and nato expansion .
blair , who has pitted himself as a bridge between washington and the europeans -lrb- the uk supported the us in iraq but has aligned itself with the eu on other issues such as the middle east and iran -rrb- , said he supported " very strongly " bush 's hope to strengthen cooperation .
the british leader listed iraq , the middle east and afghanistan as priority areas for the two sides to come together on .
" i think there is a tremendous desire and willingness on the part of , certainly our partners in the european union , to make sure that the alliance is strong , " he said . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair heads to us to push bush on mideast british prime minister tony blair headed to washington thursday for talks with us president george bush expected to focus on the future of middle east peace following the death of yasser arafat .

with his eyes clearly set on a national victory in two years , jürgen klinsmann has vowed to introduce new training techniques learned while living and working in the united states .
in an interview with dw-world , klinsmann stressed how important winning the world cup is for german national pride : " every time germany wins a world cup , it has an enormous importance for the whole country and people - a feeling of self-worth and pride . "
in order to reach that goal , the coach has begun implementing changes in the way the team trains and the way it works together .
he has hired on us fitness trainers , brought on a lot of new young players and criticized a few big names in the sport .
dw-world 's guido baumhauer asked him about how the reforms were being received .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann in dw-interview with dw-world 's guido baumhauer klinsmann : " we germans are always ready for reforms , but when it comes to changes , it gets to be a little bit uncomfortable , because we 're forced to depart from our daily routine , " klinsmann said .
dw-world : mr. klinsmann , you were active with the los angeles galaxy in some way or another over the past four years .
what training and motivation techniques have you brought over from the us and how have the german players adapted to them ?
klinsmann : we introduced some different ideas a few weeks ago in berlin before the game against brazil .
we had invited some athletic coaches from the us who used some of their training methods .
it was n't that they were so new but they were a little different for the players and it was well received .
dw : how do the sporting mentalities differ between germany and the us ?
jk : they are both big sports countries .
obviously in the us , you have a big sports variety : basketball , baseball , american football , hockey , golf and then soccer .
in germany , you have soccer , soccer and then soccer .
this is part of our culture and part of europe .
in general though , both nations are sports crazy .

dw : one of the biggest success stories in sports marketing in europe has been the english premiere league .
match times , just to name one example , are sometimes changed to make the games more marketable .
do you have any views on how to increase the commercial image of the bundesliga ?
jk : the premiere league did an unbelievable job in the last 15 years .
based on the connections with -lsb- rupert -rsb- murdoch and the sky network , they placed the premiere league in almost every country in the world , so it became more and more popular .
maybe this is something the bundesliga can pick up on .
we can show it around the world and convince the people of the product and maybe in a few years we 'll be at the same level .
dw : german soccer is seen by many as coming up on the short end of the stick compared to the primera division in spain , the serie a in italy and the english premiere league in terms of marketability , quality of soccer and audience excitement .
do you agree with that claim ?
jk : no .
absolutely not .

the demonstration at the aral service station in downtown berlin friday marked the launch of what many environmentalists hope will be the start of a bigger trend towards hydrogen-powered vehicles .
although still in its infancy as far as widespread implementation goes , fuel cell cars are being regarded as an important development in the automotive industry to reduce gasoline emissions and world-wide dependence on oil supplies .
" the berlin project is an important milestone on the road to a sustainable , emissions-free future for hydrogen-powered cars , " proclaimed uwe franke , head of the german branch of bp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : transportation minister manfred stolpe fills up with hydrogen for the first time in europe , a service station offers drivers hydrogen - in liquid and compressed form - next to the usual pumps for gasoline and diesel , franke said .
aral , which belongs to bp , has integrated the two forms of energy into one service station , and will serve as an important pioneer in the field .
together with the other members of the clean energy partnership -lrb- cep -rrb- which includes representatives from the car industry , energy providers and transportation experts , bp hopes to gain more knowledge on the production , delivery and storage of hydrogen for fuel cell-driven cars .

at the moment , though , there are only 16 cars and one city bus which will hook up at the aral pumps .
the cars from bmw , daimlerchrysler , ford and opel are only prototypes and have not been designed for widespread use .
although the automotive industry has generally expressed an interest in developing fuel cell-driven cars , the few models they have built are still only in the test phase .
it will still be several years before the companies go into serial production .
daimlerchrysler has said it intends to be the first to introduce a fuel cell car in 2010 .
general motors and its german division opel announced earlier in the year that they want to be the first to sell over a million hydrogen-powered cars in the near future .

it was a wise step , according to dw 's klaus dahmann . delivering an expectedly positive overture to the drawn-out process of ratifying the eu constitution , the lithuanian parliament overwhelmingly approved the document on thursday . the vote itself is less significant than the fact that there was a broad consensus that no referendum was necessary .
after all , 90 percent of lithuanians had obviously expressed confidence in the bloc by voting for eu membership in may 2003 , all political parties agreed . ardent supporters of grass-roots democracy might condemn that line of argument .
they 'd counter that eu membership and the eu 's proposed new constitution are two completely separate issues and people could very well support membership and oppose the constitution at the same time . voting on the wrong thing still , no one needs prophetic abilities to realize that , at best , referendums on the constitution will be votes on eu policy as a whole rather than the document .
in the worse case scenario , they 'll become polls on voters ' satisfaction with their respective national governments at the time . clearly , everyone can read the constitution .
large parts of the document address citizens directly , especially the second part , which focuses on basic rights . but the largest section deals with quotas and percentages , with exceptions , tactical loopholes and " yes , but " formulations .
all of this is necessary for a document based on political compromise , but it 's also fairly incomprehensible for the average citizen . that 's why some will use the referendums as an opportunity to " show them up there " how this , that and the other thing could be handled much better .

the demonstration at the aral service station in downtown berlin friday marked the launch of what many environmentalists hope will be the start of a bigger trend towards hydrogen-powered vehicles .
although still in its infancy as far as widespread implementation goes , fuel cell cars are being regarded as an important development in the automotive industry to reduce gasoline emissions and world-wide dependence on oil supplies .
" the berlin project is an important milestone on the road to a sustainable , emissions-free future for hydrogen-powered cars , " proclaimed uwe franke , head of the german branch of bp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : transportation minister manfred stolpe fills up with hydrogen for the first time in europe , a service station offers drivers hydrogen - in liquid and compressed form - next to the usual pumps for gasoline and diesel , franke said .
aral , which belongs to bp , has integrated the two forms of energy into one service station , and will serve as an important pioneer in the field .
together with the other members of the clean energy partnership -lrb- cep -rrb- which includes representatives from the car industry , energy providers and transportation experts , bp hopes to gain more knowledge on the production , delivery and storage of hydrogen for fuel cell-driven cars .
capacity for 100 cars the berlin service station has enough capacity to fill 100 vehicles with hydrogen .
at the moment , though , there are only 16 cars and one city bus which will hook up at the aral pumps .
the cars from bmw , daimlerchrysler , ford and opel are only prototypes and have not been designed for widespread use .
although the automotive industry has generally expressed an interest in developing fuel cell-driven cars , the few models they have built are still only in the test phase .
it will still be several years before the companies go into serial production .
daimlerchrysler has said it intends to be the first to introduce a fuel cell car in 2010 .
general motors and its german division opel announced earlier in the year that they want to be the first to sell over a million hydrogen-powered cars in the near future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder test drives daimlerchrysler 's new f-cell car which runs on hydrogen .
for the time being , though , the biggest obstacle to hydrogen-powered cars is the price , both for the original purchase and refueling .
those who do drive one of the early models are primarily politicians , such as chancellor gerhard schröder , who were given the vehicles as part of a publicity campaign .
road to the future " we have a long road ahead of us , " said german transportation minister manfred stolpe .
" until then hydrogen technology must prove itself as a reliable , cost-efficient and consumer friendly source of energy . "
the production , storage and refueling of hydrogen , its price and performance must all be tested on real market conditions - and that is the goal of the berlin aral station , stolpe explained .

they 'd counter that eu membership and the eu 's proposed new constitution are two completely separate issues and people could very well support membership and oppose the constitution at the same time . voting on the wrong thing still , no one needs prophetic abilities to realize that , at best , referendums on the constitution will be votes on eu policy as a whole rather than the document .
in the worse case scenario , they 'll become polls on voters ' satisfaction with their respective national governments at the time . clearly , everyone can read the constitution .
large parts of the document address citizens directly , especially the second part , which focuses on basic rights . but the largest section deals with quotas and percentages , with exceptions , tactical loopholes and " yes , but " formulations .
all of this is necessary for a document based on political compromise , but it 's also fairly incomprehensible for the average citizen . that 's why some will use the referendums as an opportunity to " show them up there " how this , that and the other thing could be handled much better .
since the only options are to say " yes " or " no , " the temptation will be to do the latter . bildunterschrift : eu leaders pose for a family picture after signing the eu constitution in rome on oct .

countries planning to hold referendums include britain , france , denmark , the netherlands , spain , portugal , belgium and ireland . but most people wo n't even bother to carefully read the 350-page charter and instead let fantasy run wild on what they 're voting on : high salaries for eu civil servants , the proposed turkish eu membership or their national governments failed economic policy , as the case may be . populists will be flying high in the months leading up to the elections .
but all of this does n't have anything to do with well-meaning grass-roots democracy . " core europe " is not desirable one thing should definitely be clear : failure of the constitution to pass in one or more countries would serve as a catalyst for an undesirable development - the emergence of a mini-eu within the eu .
some politicians already dream about such a " core europe " but do n't dare to say so explicitly . it 's also obvious that lithuania will not suffer any future harm because of the ratification but instead has secured itself the no. 1 spot - ahead of germany and italy , both of whom actually wanted to shine as the speediest ratifiers .
that 's why lithuania has now become a bright model that 's worth repeating . klaus dahmann -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : the constitution is n't perfect but must do although the eu constitution has plenty of flaws and it still has to be ratified by member states , it reflects a compromise and marks the dawning of a new era , says dw 's bernd riegert .

he did not say how soon after that date he would travel to europe , where ties to countries such as france and germany are still strained after the us decision to invade iraq last year .
reluctant alliance bush 's last trip to europe was in june to mark the 60th anniversary of the d-day allied landing in normandy , france , that heralded the end of world war ii .
compared to previous us presidents , bush has kept a distance from european allies , with the exception of britain , and few of the leaders who opposed the iraq war have openly embraced the us and its leader since the invasion .
bush has also been reluctant to meet with european politicians unless they see eye-to-eye with him on the iraq issue .
whereas britain 's tony blair has often visited the white house , french president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder have been infrequent guests in washington since bush first came to office .
as for spain , once a strong ally under its former prime minister jose maria aznar , bush has yet to take a phone call from the country 's new socialist leader jose luis rodriguez zapatero , who withdrew his country 's troops from the war-torn country shortly after being elected in march .

opened on friday , the project paves the way for widespread use of alternative energy . in what was probably the most high-profile turn-out for a service station opening , some 100 managers from four international carmakers , energy experts , environmentalists and a minister for transportation all convened at a berlin service station to watch the first fleet of fuel cell-driven cars fill their tanks with hydrogen .
the demonstration at the aral service station in downtown berlin friday marked the launch of what many environmentalists hope will be the start of a bigger trend towards hydrogen-powered vehicles .
although still in its infancy as far as widespread implementation goes , fuel cell cars are being regarded as an important development in the automotive industry to reduce gasoline emissions and world-wide dependence on oil supplies .
" the berlin project is an important milestone on the road to a sustainable , emissions-free future for hydrogen-powered cars , " proclaimed uwe franke , head of the german branch of bp .

although still in its infancy as far as widespread implementation goes , fuel cell cars are being regarded as an important development in the automotive industry to reduce gasoline emissions and world-wide dependence on oil supplies .
" the berlin project is an important milestone on the road to a sustainable , emissions-free future for hydrogen-powered cars , " proclaimed uwe franke , head of the german branch of bp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : transportation minister manfred stolpe fills up with hydrogen for the first time in europe , a service station offers drivers hydrogen - in liquid and compressed form - next to the usual pumps for gasoline and diesel , franke said .
aral , which belongs to bp , has integrated the two forms of energy into one service station , and will serve as an important pioneer in the field .
together with the other members of the clean energy partnership -lrb- cep -rrb- which includes representatives from the car industry , energy providers and transportation experts , bp hopes to gain more knowledge on the production , delivery and storage of hydrogen for fuel cell-driven cars .
capacity for 100 cars the berlin service station has enough capacity to fill 100 vehicles with hydrogen .
at the moment , though , there are only 16 cars and one city bus which will hook up at the aral pumps .
the cars from bmw , daimlerchrysler , ford and opel are only prototypes and have not been designed for widespread use .
although the automotive industry has generally expressed an interest in developing fuel cell-driven cars , the few models they have built are still only in the test phase .
it will still be several years before the companies go into serial production .
daimlerchrysler has said it intends to be the first to introduce a fuel cell car in 2010 .
general motors and its german division opel announced earlier in the year that they want to be the first to sell over a million hydrogen-powered cars in the near future .

for the time being , though , the biggest obstacle to hydrogen-powered cars is the price , both for the original purchase and refueling .
those who do drive one of the early models are primarily politicians , such as chancellor gerhard schröder , who were given the vehicles as part of a publicity campaign .
road to the future " we have a long road ahead of us , " said german transportation minister manfred stolpe .
" until then hydrogen technology must prove itself as a reliable , cost-efficient and consumer friendly source of energy . "
the production , storage and refueling of hydrogen , its price and performance must all be tested on real market conditions - and that is the goal of the berlin aral station , stolpe explained .
to help the alternative energy on its way into the future , the german government and the auto industry have pledged 33 million euros as part of the clean energy partnership . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder 's lean , green machine german chancellor gerhard schröder has a new car .

he did not say how soon after that date he would travel to europe , where ties to countries such as france and germany are still strained after the us decision to invade iraq last year .
reluctant alliance bush 's last trip to europe was in june to mark the 60th anniversary of the d-day allied landing in normandy , france , that heralded the end of world war ii .
compared to previous us presidents , bush has kept a distance from european allies , with the exception of britain , and few of the leaders who opposed the iraq war have openly embraced the us and its leader since the invasion .
bush has also been reluctant to meet with european politicians unless they see eye-to-eye with him on the iraq issue .
whereas britain 's tony blair has often visited the white house , french president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder have been infrequent guests in washington since bush first came to office .
as for spain , once a strong ally under its former prime minister jose maria aznar , bush has yet to take a phone call from the country 's new socialist leader jose luis rodriguez zapatero , who withdrew his country 's troops from the war-torn country shortly after being elected in march .
on tuesday , though , aznar visited with the president in the white house and king juan carlos and queen sofia are expected to visit bush 's ranch in texas on nov .

better years ahead ?
since winning a new four-year term , bush has said he wants to work on improving cooperation with his european allies .
at the same time , though , he has made it clear that the us will still go into battle alone if necessary to protect us interests - a unilateral approach many in europe reject .

11 , 2004 he said friday his european trip would serve to remind people on both sides of the atlantic that " the world is better off , america is better off , europe is better off , when we work together . "
" there 's a lot we can accomplish working together , " bush said referring to his administration 's intention to cooperate with europeans on tracking down members of the al qaeda terrorist network , halting the spread of weapons of mass destruction and nato expansion .
blair , who has pitted himself as a bridge between washington and the europeans -lrb- the uk supported the us in iraq but has aligned itself with the eu on other issues such as the middle east and iran -rrb- , said he supported " very strongly " bush 's hope to strengthen cooperation .
the british leader listed iraq , the middle east and afghanistan as priority areas for the two sides to come together on .

with his eyes clearly set on a national victory in two years , jürgen klinsmann has vowed to introduce new training techniques learned while living and working in the united states .
in an interview with dw-world , klinsmann stressed how important winning the world cup is for german national pride : " every time germany wins a world cup , it has an enormous importance for the whole country and people - a feeling of self-worth and pride . "
in order to reach that goal , the coach has begun implementing changes in the way the team trains and the way it works together .
he has hired on us fitness trainers , brought on a lot of new young players and criticized a few big names in the sport .
dw-world 's guido baumhauer asked him about how the reforms were being received .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann in dw-interview with dw-world 's guido baumhauer klinsmann : " we germans are always ready for reforms , but when it comes to changes , it gets to be a little bit uncomfortable , because we 're forced to depart from our daily routine , " klinsmann said .
dw-world : mr. klinsmann , you were active with the los angeles galaxy in some way or another over the past four years .
what training and motivation techniques have you brought over from the us and how have the german players adapted to them ?
klinsmann : we introduced some different ideas a few weeks ago in berlin before the game against brazil .
we had invited some athletic coaches from the us who used some of their training methods .
it was n't that they were so new but they were a little different for the players and it was well received .
dw : how do the sporting mentalities differ between germany and the us ?
jk : they are both big sports countries .
obviously in the us , you have a big sports variety : basketball , baseball , american football , hockey , golf and then soccer .
in germany , you have soccer , soccer and then soccer .
this is part of our culture and part of europe .
in general though , both nations are sports crazy .

dw : one of the biggest success stories in sports marketing in europe has been the english premiere league .
match times , just to name one example , are sometimes changed to make the games more marketable .
do you have any views on how to increase the commercial image of the bundesliga ?
jk : the premiere league did an unbelievable job in the last 15 years .
based on the connections with -lsb- rupert -rsb- murdoch and the sky network , they placed the premiere league in almost every country in the world , so it became more and more popular .
maybe this is something the bundesliga can pick up on .
we can show it around the world and convince the people of the product and maybe in a few years we 'll be at the same level .
dw : german soccer is seen by many as coming up on the short end of the stick compared to the primera division in spain , the serie a in italy and the english premiere league in terms of marketability , quality of soccer and audience excitement .
do you agree with that claim ?
jk : no .
absolutely not .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.11.2004 opinion : a model worth repeating großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he voted on eu membership , his parliament ratified the constitution while several eu countries plan to put the proposed eu constitution before voters , lithuania this week became the first country to ratify the document in parliament .
it was a wise step , according to dw 's klaus dahmann . delivering an expectedly positive overture to the drawn-out process of ratifying the eu constitution , the lithuanian parliament overwhelmingly approved the document on thursday . the vote itself is less significant than the fact that there was a broad consensus that no referendum was necessary .
after all , 90 percent of lithuanians had obviously expressed confidence in the bloc by voting for eu membership in may 2003 , all political parties agreed . ardent supporters of grass-roots democracy might condemn that line of argument .
they 'd counter that eu membership and the eu 's proposed new constitution are two completely separate issues and people could very well support membership and oppose the constitution at the same time . voting on the wrong thing still , no one needs prophetic abilities to realize that , at best , referendums on the constitution will be votes on eu policy as a whole rather than the document .
in the worse case scenario , they 'll become polls on voters ' satisfaction with their respective national governments at the time . clearly , everyone can read the constitution .
large parts of the document address citizens directly , especially the second part , which focuses on basic rights . but the largest section deals with quotas and percentages , with exceptions , tactical loopholes and " yes , but " formulations .
all of this is necessary for a document based on political compromise , but it 's also fairly incomprehensible for the average citizen . that 's why some will use the referendums as an opportunity to " show them up there " how this , that and the other thing could be handled much better .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.11.2004 fill it up with hydrogen großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german transportation minister manfred stolpe examines the new pumps drivers in berlin can fill up their cars with hydrogen at the world 's largest service station for fuel cell vehicles .
opened on friday , the project paves the way for widespread use of alternative energy . in what was probably the most high-profile turn-out for a service station opening , some 100 managers from four international carmakers , energy experts , environmentalists and a minister for transportation all convened at a berlin service station to watch the first fleet of fuel cell-driven cars fill their tanks with hydrogen .
the demonstration at the aral service station in downtown berlin friday marked the launch of what many environmentalists hope will be the start of a bigger trend towards hydrogen-powered vehicles .
although still in its infancy as far as widespread implementation goes , fuel cell cars are being regarded as an important development in the automotive industry to reduce gasoline emissions and world-wide dependence on oil supplies .
" the berlin project is an important milestone on the road to a sustainable , emissions-free future for hydrogen-powered cars , " proclaimed uwe franke , head of the german branch of bp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : transportation minister manfred stolpe fills up with hydrogen for the first time in europe , a service station offers drivers hydrogen - in liquid and compressed form - next to the usual pumps for gasoline and diesel , franke said .
aral , which belongs to bp , has integrated the two forms of energy into one service station , and will serve as an important pioneer in the field .
together with the other members of the clean energy partnership -lrb- cep -rrb- which includes representatives from the car industry , energy providers and transportation experts , bp hopes to gain more knowledge on the production , delivery and storage of hydrogen for fuel cell-driven cars .
capacity for 100 cars the berlin service station has enough capacity to fill 100 vehicles with hydrogen .

with his eyes clearly set on a national victory in two years , jürgen klinsmann has vowed to introduce new training techniques learned while living and working in the united states .
in an interview with dw-world , klinsmann stressed how important winning the world cup is for german national pride : " every time germany wins a world cup , it has an enormous importance for the whole country and people - a feeling of self-worth and pride . "
in order to reach that goal , the coach has begun implementing changes in the way the team trains and the way it works together .
he has hired on us fitness trainers , brought on a lot of new young players and criticized a few big names in the sport .
dw-world 's guido baumhauer asked him about how the reforms were being received .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann in dw-interview with dw-world 's guido baumhauer klinsmann : " we germans are always ready for reforms , but when it comes to changes , it gets to be a little bit uncomfortable , because we 're forced to depart from our daily routine , " klinsmann said .
dw-world : mr. klinsmann , you were active with the los angeles galaxy in some way or another over the past four years .
what training and motivation techniques have you brought over from the us and how have the german players adapted to them ?
klinsmann : we introduced some different ideas a few weeks ago in berlin before the game against brazil .
we had invited some athletic coaches from the us who used some of their training methods .
it was n't that they were so new but they were a little different for the players and it was well received .
dw : how do the sporting mentalities differ between germany and the us ?
jk : they are both big sports countries .
obviously in the us , you have a big sports variety : basketball , baseball , american football , hockey , golf and then soccer .
in germany , you have soccer , soccer and then soccer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.11.2004 fill it up with hydrogen großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german transportation minister manfred stolpe examines the new pumps drivers in berlin can fill up their cars with hydrogen at the world 's largest service station for fuel cell vehicles .
opened on friday , the project paves the way for widespread use of alternative energy . in what was probably the most high-profile turn-out for a service station opening , some 100 managers from four international carmakers , energy experts , environmentalists and a minister for transportation all convened at a berlin service station to watch the first fleet of fuel cell-driven cars fill their tanks with hydrogen .
the demonstration at the aral service station in downtown berlin friday marked the launch of what many environmentalists hope will be the start of a bigger trend towards hydrogen-powered vehicles .
although still in its infancy as far as widespread implementation goes , fuel cell cars are being regarded as an important development in the automotive industry to reduce gasoline emissions and world-wide dependence on oil supplies .
" the berlin project is an important milestone on the road to a sustainable , emissions-free future for hydrogen-powered cars , " proclaimed uwe franke , head of the german branch of bp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : transportation minister manfred stolpe fills up with hydrogen for the first time in europe , a service station offers drivers hydrogen - in liquid and compressed form - next to the usual pumps for gasoline and diesel , franke said .
aral , which belongs to bp , has integrated the two forms of energy into one service station , and will serve as an important pioneer in the field .
together with the other members of the clean energy partnership -lrb- cep -rrb- which includes representatives from the car industry , energy providers and transportation experts , bp hopes to gain more knowledge on the production , delivery and storage of hydrogen for fuel cell-driven cars .
capacity for 100 cars the berlin service station has enough capacity to fill 100 vehicles with hydrogen .
at the moment , though , there are only 16 cars and one city bus which will hook up at the aral pumps .
the cars from bmw , daimlerchrysler , ford and opel are only prototypes and have not been designed for widespread use .
although the automotive industry has generally expressed an interest in developing fuel cell-driven cars , the few models they have built are still only in the test phase .
it will still be several years before the companies go into serial production .
daimlerchrysler has said it intends to be the first to introduce a fuel cell car in 2010 .
general motors and its german division opel announced earlier in the year that they want to be the first to sell over a million hydrogen-powered cars in the near future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder test drives daimlerchrysler 's new f-cell car which runs on hydrogen .
for the time being , though , the biggest obstacle to hydrogen-powered cars is the price , both for the original purchase and refueling .
those who do drive one of the early models are primarily politicians , such as chancellor gerhard schröder , who were given the vehicles as part of a publicity campaign .
road to the future " we have a long road ahead of us , " said german transportation minister manfred stolpe .
" until then hydrogen technology must prove itself as a reliable , cost-efficient and consumer friendly source of energy . "
the production , storage and refueling of hydrogen , its price and performance must all be tested on real market conditions - and that is the goal of the berlin aral station , stolpe explained .
to help the alternative energy on its way into the future , the german government and the auto industry have pledged 33 million euros as part of the clean energy partnership . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder 's lean , green machine german chancellor gerhard schröder has a new car .

it was a wise step , according to dw 's klaus dahmann . delivering an expectedly positive overture to the drawn-out process of ratifying the eu constitution , the lithuanian parliament overwhelmingly approved the document on thursday . the vote itself is less significant than the fact that there was a broad consensus that no referendum was necessary .
after all , 90 percent of lithuanians had obviously expressed confidence in the bloc by voting for eu membership in may 2003 , all political parties agreed . ardent supporters of grass-roots democracy might condemn that line of argument .
they 'd counter that eu membership and the eu 's proposed new constitution are two completely separate issues and people could very well support membership and oppose the constitution at the same time . voting on the wrong thing still , no one needs prophetic abilities to realize that , at best , referendums on the constitution will be votes on eu policy as a whole rather than the document .
in the worse case scenario , they 'll become polls on voters ' satisfaction with their respective national governments at the time . clearly , everyone can read the constitution .
large parts of the document address citizens directly , especially the second part , which focuses on basic rights . but the largest section deals with quotas and percentages , with exceptions , tactical loopholes and " yes , but " formulations .
all of this is necessary for a document based on political compromise , but it 's also fairly incomprehensible for the average citizen . that 's why some will use the referendums as an opportunity to " show them up there " how this , that and the other thing could be handled much better .

with his eyes clearly set on a national victory in two years , jürgen klinsmann has vowed to introduce new training techniques learned while living and working in the united states .
in an interview with dw-world , klinsmann stressed how important winning the world cup is for german national pride : " every time germany wins a world cup , it has an enormous importance for the whole country and people - a feeling of self-worth and pride . "
in order to reach that goal , the coach has begun implementing changes in the way the team trains and the way it works together .
he has hired on us fitness trainers , brought on a lot of new young players and criticized a few big names in the sport .
dw-world 's guido baumhauer asked him about how the reforms were being received .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann in dw-interview with dw-world 's guido baumhauer klinsmann : " we germans are always ready for reforms , but when it comes to changes , it gets to be a little bit uncomfortable , because we 're forced to depart from our daily routine , " klinsmann said .
dw-world : mr. klinsmann , you were active with the los angeles galaxy in some way or another over the past four years .
what training and motivation techniques have you brought over from the us and how have the german players adapted to them ?
klinsmann : we introduced some different ideas a few weeks ago in berlin before the game against brazil .
we had invited some athletic coaches from the us who used some of their training methods .
it was n't that they were so new but they were a little different for the players and it was well received .
dw : how do the sporting mentalities differ between germany and the us ?
jk : they are both big sports countries .
obviously in the us , you have a big sports variety : basketball , baseball , american football , hockey , golf and then soccer .
in germany , you have soccer , soccer and then soccer .
this is part of our culture and part of europe .
in general though , both nations are sports crazy .

dw : one of the biggest success stories in sports marketing in europe has been the english premiere league .
match times , just to name one example , are sometimes changed to make the games more marketable .
do you have any views on how to increase the commercial image of the bundesliga ?
jk : the premiere league did an unbelievable job in the last 15 years .
based on the connections with -lsb- rupert -rsb- murdoch and the sky network , they placed the premiere league in almost every country in the world , so it became more and more popular .
maybe this is something the bundesliga can pick up on .
we can show it around the world and convince the people of the product and maybe in a few years we 'll be at the same level .
dw : german soccer is seen by many as coming up on the short end of the stick compared to the primera division in spain , the serie a in italy and the english premiere league in terms of marketability , quality of soccer and audience excitement .
do you agree with that claim ?
jk : no .
absolutely not .
all four leagues belong to the top four in the world .

" in my second term , i will work to deepen our transatlantic ties with the nations of europe , " the american leader said .
" i intend to visit europe as soon as possible after my inauguration . "
bush , who was re-elected last week , will be inaugurated jan .
20 .
he did not say how soon after that date he would travel to europe , where ties to countries such as france and germany are still strained after the us decision to invade iraq last year .
reluctant alliance bush 's last trip to europe was in june to mark the 60th anniversary of the d-day allied landing in normandy , france , that heralded the end of world war ii .
compared to previous us presidents , bush has kept a distance from european allies , with the exception of britain , and few of the leaders who opposed the iraq war have openly embraced the us and its leader since the invasion .
bush has also been reluctant to meet with european politicians unless they see eye-to-eye with him on the iraq issue .
whereas britain 's tony blair has often visited the white house , french president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder have been infrequent guests in washington since bush first came to office .
as for spain , once a strong ally under its former prime minister jose maria aznar , bush has yet to take a phone call from the country 's new socialist leader jose luis rodriguez zapatero , who withdrew his country 's troops from the war-torn country shortly after being elected in march .
on tuesday , though , aznar visited with the president in the white house and king juan carlos and queen sofia are expected to visit bush 's ranch in texas on nov .
24 .
better years ahead ?
since winning a new four-year term , bush has said he wants to work on improving cooperation with his european allies .
at the same time , though , he has made it clear that the us will still go into battle alone if necessary to protect us interests - a unilateral approach many in europe reject .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush , right , and british prime minister tony blair at the white house , thursday , nov .
11 , 2004 he said friday his european trip would serve to remind people on both sides of the atlantic that " the world is better off , america is better off , europe is better off , when we work together . "
" there 's a lot we can accomplish working together , " bush said referring to his administration 's intention to cooperate with europeans on tracking down members of the al qaeda terrorist network , halting the spread of weapons of mass destruction and nato expansion .
blair , who has pitted himself as a bridge between washington and the europeans -lrb- the uk supported the us in iraq but has aligned itself with the eu on other issues such as the middle east and iran -rrb- , said he supported " very strongly " bush 's hope to strengthen cooperation .
the british leader listed iraq , the middle east and afghanistan as priority areas for the two sides to come together on .

opened on friday , the project paves the way for widespread use of alternative energy . in what was probably the most high-profile turn-out for a service station opening , some 100 managers from four international carmakers , energy experts , environmentalists and a minister for transportation all convened at a berlin service station to watch the first fleet of fuel cell-driven cars fill their tanks with hydrogen .
the demonstration at the aral service station in downtown berlin friday marked the launch of what many environmentalists hope will be the start of a bigger trend towards hydrogen-powered vehicles .
although still in its infancy as far as widespread implementation goes , fuel cell cars are being regarded as an important development in the automotive industry to reduce gasoline emissions and world-wide dependence on oil supplies .
" the berlin project is an important milestone on the road to a sustainable , emissions-free future for hydrogen-powered cars , " proclaimed uwe franke , head of the german branch of bp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : transportation minister manfred stolpe fills up with hydrogen for the first time in europe , a service station offers drivers hydrogen - in liquid and compressed form - next to the usual pumps for gasoline and diesel , franke said .
aral , which belongs to bp , has integrated the two forms of energy into one service station , and will serve as an important pioneer in the field .
together with the other members of the clean energy partnership -lrb- cep -rrb- which includes representatives from the car industry , energy providers and transportation experts , bp hopes to gain more knowledge on the production , delivery and storage of hydrogen for fuel cell-driven cars .
capacity for 100 cars the berlin service station has enough capacity to fill 100 vehicles with hydrogen .
at the moment , though , there are only 16 cars and one city bus which will hook up at the aral pumps .
the cars from bmw , daimlerchrysler , ford and opel are only prototypes and have not been designed for widespread use .
although the automotive industry has generally expressed an interest in developing fuel cell-driven cars , the few models they have built are still only in the test phase .
it will still be several years before the companies go into serial production .
daimlerchrysler has said it intends to be the first to introduce a fuel cell car in 2010 .
general motors and its german division opel announced earlier in the year that they want to be the first to sell over a million hydrogen-powered cars in the near future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder test drives daimlerchrysler 's new f-cell car which runs on hydrogen .
for the time being , though , the biggest obstacle to hydrogen-powered cars is the price , both for the original purchase and refueling .
those who do drive one of the early models are primarily politicians , such as chancellor gerhard schröder , who were given the vehicles as part of a publicity campaign .
road to the future " we have a long road ahead of us , " said german transportation minister manfred stolpe .
" until then hydrogen technology must prove itself as a reliable , cost-efficient and consumer friendly source of energy . "
the production , storage and refueling of hydrogen , its price and performance must all be tested on real market conditions - and that is the goal of the berlin aral station , stolpe explained .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.11.2004 fill it up with hydrogen großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german transportation minister manfred stolpe examines the new pumps drivers in berlin can fill up their cars with hydrogen at the world 's largest service station for fuel cell vehicles .
opened on friday , the project paves the way for widespread use of alternative energy . in what was probably the most high-profile turn-out for a service station opening , some 100 managers from four international carmakers , energy experts , environmentalists and a minister for transportation all convened at a berlin service station to watch the first fleet of fuel cell-driven cars fill their tanks with hydrogen .
the demonstration at the aral service station in downtown berlin friday marked the launch of what many environmentalists hope will be the start of a bigger trend towards hydrogen-powered vehicles .
although still in its infancy as far as widespread implementation goes , fuel cell cars are being regarded as an important development in the automotive industry to reduce gasoline emissions and world-wide dependence on oil supplies .
" the berlin project is an important milestone on the road to a sustainable , emissions-free future for hydrogen-powered cars , " proclaimed uwe franke , head of the german branch of bp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : transportation minister manfred stolpe fills up with hydrogen for the first time in europe , a service station offers drivers hydrogen - in liquid and compressed form - next to the usual pumps for gasoline and diesel , franke said .
aral , which belongs to bp , has integrated the two forms of energy into one service station , and will serve as an important pioneer in the field .
together with the other members of the clean energy partnership -lrb- cep -rrb- which includes representatives from the car industry , energy providers and transportation experts , bp hopes to gain more knowledge on the production , delivery and storage of hydrogen for fuel cell-driven cars .
capacity for 100 cars the berlin service station has enough capacity to fill 100 vehicles with hydrogen .
at the moment , though , there are only 16 cars and one city bus which will hook up at the aral pumps .
the cars from bmw , daimlerchrysler , ford and opel are only prototypes and have not been designed for widespread use .
although the automotive industry has generally expressed an interest in developing fuel cell-driven cars , the few models they have built are still only in the test phase .
it will still be several years before the companies go into serial production .
daimlerchrysler has said it intends to be the first to introduce a fuel cell car in 2010 .
general motors and its german division opel announced earlier in the year that they want to be the first to sell over a million hydrogen-powered cars in the near future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder test drives daimlerchrysler 's new f-cell car which runs on hydrogen .
for the time being , though , the biggest obstacle to hydrogen-powered cars is the price , both for the original purchase and refueling .
those who do drive one of the early models are primarily politicians , such as chancellor gerhard schröder , who were given the vehicles as part of a publicity campaign .
road to the future " we have a long road ahead of us , " said german transportation minister manfred stolpe .
" until then hydrogen technology must prove itself as a reliable , cost-efficient and consumer friendly source of energy . "
the production , storage and refueling of hydrogen , its price and performance must all be tested on real market conditions - and that is the goal of the berlin aral station , stolpe explained .
to help the alternative energy on its way into the future , the german government and the auto industry have pledged 33 million euros as part of the clean energy partnership . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder 's lean , green machine german chancellor gerhard schröder has a new car .

" in my second term , i will work to deepen our transatlantic ties with the nations of europe , " the american leader said .
" i intend to visit europe as soon as possible after my inauguration . "
bush , who was re-elected last week , will be inaugurated jan .
20 .
he did not say how soon after that date he would travel to europe , where ties to countries such as france and germany are still strained after the us decision to invade iraq last year .
reluctant alliance bush 's last trip to europe was in june to mark the 60th anniversary of the d-day allied landing in normandy , france , that heralded the end of world war ii .
compared to previous us presidents , bush has kept a distance from european allies , with the exception of britain , and few of the leaders who opposed the iraq war have openly embraced the us and its leader since the invasion .
bush has also been reluctant to meet with european politicians unless they see eye-to-eye with him on the iraq issue .
whereas britain 's tony blair has often visited the white house , french president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder have been infrequent guests in washington since bush first came to office .
as for spain , once a strong ally under its former prime minister jose maria aznar , bush has yet to take a phone call from the country 's new socialist leader jose luis rodriguez zapatero , who withdrew his country 's troops from the war-torn country shortly after being elected in march .
on tuesday , though , aznar visited with the president in the white house and king juan carlos and queen sofia are expected to visit bush 's ranch in texas on nov .
24 .
better years ahead ?
since winning a new four-year term , bush has said he wants to work on improving cooperation with his european allies .
at the same time , though , he has made it clear that the us will still go into battle alone if necessary to protect us interests - a unilateral approach many in europe reject .

11 , 2004 he said friday his european trip would serve to remind people on both sides of the atlantic that " the world is better off , america is better off , europe is better off , when we work together . "
" there 's a lot we can accomplish working together , " bush said referring to his administration 's intention to cooperate with europeans on tracking down members of the al qaeda terrorist network , halting the spread of weapons of mass destruction and nato expansion .
blair , who has pitted himself as a bridge between washington and the europeans -lrb- the uk supported the us in iraq but has aligned itself with the eu on other issues such as the middle east and iran -rrb- , said he supported " very strongly " bush 's hope to strengthen cooperation .
the british leader listed iraq , the middle east and afghanistan as priority areas for the two sides to come together on .

it was a wise step , according to dw 's klaus dahmann . delivering an expectedly positive overture to the drawn-out process of ratifying the eu constitution , the lithuanian parliament overwhelmingly approved the document on thursday . the vote itself is less significant than the fact that there was a broad consensus that no referendum was necessary .
after all , 90 percent of lithuanians had obviously expressed confidence in the bloc by voting for eu membership in may 2003 , all political parties agreed . ardent supporters of grass-roots democracy might condemn that line of argument .
they 'd counter that eu membership and the eu 's proposed new constitution are two completely separate issues and people could very well support membership and oppose the constitution at the same time . voting on the wrong thing still , no one needs prophetic abilities to realize that , at best , referendums on the constitution will be votes on eu policy as a whole rather than the document .
in the worse case scenario , they 'll become polls on voters ' satisfaction with their respective national governments at the time . clearly , everyone can read the constitution .
large parts of the document address citizens directly , especially the second part , which focuses on basic rights . but the largest section deals with quotas and percentages , with exceptions , tactical loopholes and " yes , but " formulations .
all of this is necessary for a document based on political compromise , but it 's also fairly incomprehensible for the average citizen . that 's why some will use the referendums as an opportunity to " show them up there " how this , that and the other thing could be handled much better .
since the only options are to say " yes " or " no , " the temptation will be to do the latter . bildunterschrift : eu leaders pose for a family picture after signing the eu constitution in rome on oct .

countries planning to hold referendums include britain , france , denmark , the netherlands , spain , portugal , belgium and ireland . but most people wo n't even bother to carefully read the 350-page charter and instead let fantasy run wild on what they 're voting on : high salaries for eu civil servants , the proposed turkish eu membership or their national governments failed economic policy , as the case may be . populists will be flying high in the months leading up to the elections .
but all of this does n't have anything to do with well-meaning grass-roots democracy . " core europe " is not desirable one thing should definitely be clear : failure of the constitution to pass in one or more countries would serve as a catalyst for an undesirable development - the emergence of a mini-eu within the eu .
some politicians already dream about such a " core europe " but do n't dare to say so explicitly . it 's also obvious that lithuania will not suffer any future harm because of the ratification but instead has secured itself the no. 1 spot - ahead of germany and italy , both of whom actually wanted to shine as the speediest ratifiers .

compared to previous us presidents , bush has kept a distance from european allies , with the exception of britain , and few of the leaders who opposed the iraq war have openly embraced the us and its leader since the invasion .

opened on friday , the project paves the way for widespread use of alternative energy . in what was probably the most high-profile turn-out for a service station opening , some 100 managers from four international carmakers , energy experts , environmentalists and a minister for transportation all convened at a berlin service station to watch the first fleet of fuel cell-driven cars fill their tanks with hydrogen .
the demonstration at the aral service station in downtown berlin friday marked the launch of what many environmentalists hope will be the start of a bigger trend towards hydrogen-powered vehicles .
although still in its infancy as far as widespread implementation goes , fuel cell cars are being regarded as an important development in the automotive industry to reduce gasoline emissions and world-wide dependence on oil supplies .
" the berlin project is an important milestone on the road to a sustainable , emissions-free future for hydrogen-powered cars , " proclaimed uwe franke , head of the german branch of bp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : transportation minister manfred stolpe fills up with hydrogen for the first time in europe , a service station offers drivers hydrogen - in liquid and compressed form - next to the usual pumps for gasoline and diesel , franke said .
aral , which belongs to bp , has integrated the two forms of energy into one service station , and will serve as an important pioneer in the field .
together with the other members of the clean energy partnership -lrb- cep -rrb- which includes representatives from the car industry , energy providers and transportation experts , bp hopes to gain more knowledge on the production , delivery and storage of hydrogen for fuel cell-driven cars .
capacity for 100 cars the berlin service station has enough capacity to fill 100 vehicles with hydrogen .
at the moment , though , there are only 16 cars and one city bus which will hook up at the aral pumps .
the cars from bmw , daimlerchrysler , ford and opel are only prototypes and have not been designed for widespread use .
although the automotive industry has generally expressed an interest in developing fuel cell-driven cars , the few models they have built are still only in the test phase .
it will still be several years before the companies go into serial production .
daimlerchrysler has said it intends to be the first to introduce a fuel cell car in 2010 .
general motors and its german division opel announced earlier in the year that they want to be the first to sell over a million hydrogen-powered cars in the near future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder test drives daimlerchrysler 's new f-cell car which runs on hydrogen .
for the time being , though , the biggest obstacle to hydrogen-powered cars is the price , both for the original purchase and refueling .
those who do drive one of the early models are primarily politicians , such as chancellor gerhard schröder , who were given the vehicles as part of a publicity campaign .
road to the future " we have a long road ahead of us , " said german transportation minister manfred stolpe .
" until then hydrogen technology must prove itself as a reliable , cost-efficient and consumer friendly source of energy . "
the production , storage and refueling of hydrogen , its price and performance must all be tested on real market conditions - and that is the goal of the berlin aral station , stolpe explained .
to help the alternative energy on its way into the future , the german government and the auto industry have pledged 33 million euros as part of the clean energy partnership . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder 's lean , green machine german chancellor gerhard schröder has a new car .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.11.2004 fill it up with hydrogen großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german transportation minister manfred stolpe examines the new pumps drivers in berlin can fill up their cars with hydrogen at the world 's largest service station for fuel cell vehicles .
opened on friday , the project paves the way for widespread use of alternative energy . in what was probably the most high-profile turn-out for a service station opening , some 100 managers from four international carmakers , energy experts , environmentalists and a minister for transportation all convened at a berlin service station to watch the first fleet of fuel cell-driven cars fill their tanks with hydrogen .
the demonstration at the aral service station in downtown berlin friday marked the launch of what many environmentalists hope will be the start of a bigger trend towards hydrogen-powered vehicles .
although still in its infancy as far as widespread implementation goes , fuel cell cars are being regarded as an important development in the automotive industry to reduce gasoline emissions and world-wide dependence on oil supplies .
" the berlin project is an important milestone on the road to a sustainable , emissions-free future for hydrogen-powered cars , " proclaimed uwe franke , head of the german branch of bp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : transportation minister manfred stolpe fills up with hydrogen for the first time in europe , a service station offers drivers hydrogen - in liquid and compressed form - next to the usual pumps for gasoline and diesel , franke said .
aral , which belongs to bp , has integrated the two forms of energy into one service station , and will serve as an important pioneer in the field .
together with the other members of the clean energy partnership -lrb- cep -rrb- which includes representatives from the car industry , energy providers and transportation experts , bp hopes to gain more knowledge on the production , delivery and storage of hydrogen for fuel cell-driven cars .
capacity for 100 cars the berlin service station has enough capacity to fill 100 vehicles with hydrogen .
at the moment , though , there are only 16 cars and one city bus which will hook up at the aral pumps .
the cars from bmw , daimlerchrysler , ford and opel are only prototypes and have not been designed for widespread use .
although the automotive industry has generally expressed an interest in developing fuel cell-driven cars , the few models they have built are still only in the test phase .
it will still be several years before the companies go into serial production .
daimlerchrysler has said it intends to be the first to introduce a fuel cell car in 2010 .
general motors and its german division opel announced earlier in the year that they want to be the first to sell over a million hydrogen-powered cars in the near future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder test drives daimlerchrysler 's new f-cell car which runs on hydrogen .
for the time being , though , the biggest obstacle to hydrogen-powered cars is the price , both for the original purchase and refueling .
those who do drive one of the early models are primarily politicians , such as chancellor gerhard schröder , who were given the vehicles as part of a publicity campaign .
road to the future " we have a long road ahead of us , " said german transportation minister manfred stolpe .
" until then hydrogen technology must prove itself as a reliable , cost-efficient and consumer friendly source of energy . "
the production , storage and refueling of hydrogen , its price and performance must all be tested on real market conditions - and that is the goal of the berlin aral station , stolpe explained .
to help the alternative energy on its way into the future , the german government and the auto industry have pledged 33 million euros as part of the clean energy partnership . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder 's lean , green machine german chancellor gerhard schröder has a new car .

with his eyes clearly set on a national victory in two years , jürgen klinsmann has vowed to introduce new training techniques learned while living and working in the united states .
in an interview with dw-world , klinsmann stressed how important winning the world cup is for german national pride : " every time germany wins a world cup , it has an enormous importance for the whole country and people - a feeling of self-worth and pride . "
in order to reach that goal , the coach has begun implementing changes in the way the team trains and the way it works together .
he has hired on us fitness trainers , brought on a lot of new young players and criticized a few big names in the sport .
dw-world 's guido baumhauer asked him about how the reforms were being received .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann in dw-interview with dw-world 's guido baumhauer klinsmann : " we germans are always ready for reforms , but when it comes to changes , it gets to be a little bit uncomfortable , because we 're forced to depart from our daily routine , " klinsmann said .
dw-world : mr. klinsmann , you were active with the los angeles galaxy in some way or another over the past four years .
what training and motivation techniques have you brought over from the us and how have the german players adapted to them ?
klinsmann : we introduced some different ideas a few weeks ago in berlin before the game against brazil .
we had invited some athletic coaches from the us who used some of their training methods .
it was n't that they were so new but they were a little different for the players and it was well received .
dw : how do the sporting mentalities differ between germany and the us ?
jk : they are both big sports countries .
obviously in the us , you have a big sports variety : basketball , baseball , american football , hockey , golf and then soccer .
in germany , you have soccer , soccer and then soccer .
this is part of our culture and part of europe .
in general though , both nations are sports crazy .

dw : one of the biggest success stories in sports marketing in europe has been the english premiere league .
match times , just to name one example , are sometimes changed to make the games more marketable .
do you have any views on how to increase the commercial image of the bundesliga ?
jk : the premiere league did an unbelievable job in the last 15 years .
based on the connections with -lsb- rupert -rsb- murdoch and the sky network , they placed the premiere league in almost every country in the world , so it became more and more popular .
maybe this is something the bundesliga can pick up on .
we can show it around the world and convince the people of the product and maybe in a few years we 'll be at the same level .
dw : german soccer is seen by many as coming up on the short end of the stick compared to the primera division in spain , the serie a in italy and the english premiere league in terms of marketability , quality of soccer and audience excitement .
do you agree with that claim ?
jk : no .
absolutely not .
all four leagues belong to the top four in the world .
the stadiums are packed , the games are exciting .

" in my second term , i will work to deepen our transatlantic ties with the nations of europe , " the american leader said .
" i intend to visit europe as soon as possible after my inauguration . "
bush , who was re-elected last week , will be inaugurated jan .
20 .
he did not say how soon after that date he would travel to europe , where ties to countries such as france and germany are still strained after the us decision to invade iraq last year .
reluctant alliance bush 's last trip to europe was in june to mark the 60th anniversary of the d-day allied landing in normandy , france , that heralded the end of world war ii .
compared to previous us presidents , bush has kept a distance from european allies , with the exception of britain , and few of the leaders who opposed the iraq war have openly embraced the us and its leader since the invasion .
bush has also been reluctant to meet with european politicians unless they see eye-to-eye with him on the iraq issue .
whereas britain 's tony blair has often visited the white house , french president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder have been infrequent guests in washington since bush first came to office .
as for spain , once a strong ally under its former prime minister jose maria aznar , bush has yet to take a phone call from the country 's new socialist leader jose luis rodriguez zapatero , who withdrew his country 's troops from the war-torn country shortly after being elected in march .
on tuesday , though , aznar visited with the president in the white house and king juan carlos and queen sofia are expected to visit bush 's ranch in texas on nov .
24 .
better years ahead ?
since winning a new four-year term , bush has said he wants to work on improving cooperation with his european allies .
at the same time , though , he has made it clear that the us will still go into battle alone if necessary to protect us interests - a unilateral approach many in europe reject .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush , right , and british prime minister tony blair at the white house , thursday , nov .
11 , 2004 he said friday his european trip would serve to remind people on both sides of the atlantic that " the world is better off , america is better off , europe is better off , when we work together . "
" there 's a lot we can accomplish working together , " bush said referring to his administration 's intention to cooperate with europeans on tracking down members of the al qaeda terrorist network , halting the spread of weapons of mass destruction and nato expansion .
blair , who has pitted himself as a bridge between washington and the europeans -lrb- the uk supported the us in iraq but has aligned itself with the eu on other issues such as the middle east and iran -rrb- , said he supported " very strongly " bush 's hope to strengthen cooperation .
the british leader listed iraq , the middle east and afghanistan as priority areas for the two sides to come together on .

the caller leaves a message : " now it ’ s us who ’ ve had enough of you !
we ’ re going to form an anti-moroccan committee ! " nearby , on the metal grill that protects the association ’ s windows at night , graffiti announces a bomb .
and these days , spray-painted slogans such as " francesi fori " - " french out " are becoming " arabs go home . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yvan colonna , top suspect in the 1998 murder france 's highest official on the french mediterranean island of corsica .
for almost 30 years , corsican nationalists have bombed public buildings in an attempt to separate from france .
but now nationalistic violence has turned against the immigrant community , mainly made up of moroccans . " we thought our place was here " corsica is home to about 30,000 immigrants - one tenth of the population - and these days , many of them said they feel threatened and have had enough . " every day we hear ' dirty arab ' or ' arabs out ' , " said one moroccan resident of corsica .
" we ’ ve got no pride left , no dignity as human beings and with a heavy heart , i want to leave .
my three children were born here , but we can ’ t live here anymore . " another foreign resident said it hurts to be treated this way . " we thought we were well integrated , " said a moroccan woman .
" we thought our place was here . " a community in trauma the inhabitants of a peaceful , suburban neighbourhood of the northern city of bastia repair the walls around their gardens .
they were damaged when a huge blast destroyed the house next door .
the owner of what is now just a charred ruin of twisted metal and rubble is a moroccan tile worker .
he had almost finished building the villa of his dreams .
meanwhile , estate agents in bastia have been warned : don ’ t sell to north africans or face the consequences . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corsicans reading the newspaper after a 2003 no vote to give more autonomy to their island .
beneath one of the splendid baroque churches of bastia , most of the stall-holders and most of the customers at the market are north africans .
to the outsider , it seems to be a place where the cultures of the two sides of the mediterranean can mingle under the shade of the plane trees . but the reality is much darker : it is a community in trauma .
the area is full of destruction : torched cars , a bombed out pizza parlor , bank and shops .
this is part of 56 acts of violence against the island ’ s north african community over the past year - as many as in the whole of the rest of france put together .
two underground nationalist groups called the clandestini corsi and the mca that emerged this year have claimed responsibility for many of the attacks , which , they said , are aimed against the drug trade . drugs as a pretext that is a claim authorities dismiss .
the public prosecutor for northern corsica , jean-jacques fagni , called drugs a pretext . " it isn ’ t true that only north africans deal drugs , " he said .
" some do ... but so do french people whose origins are in corsica or mainland france .
this argument is just an attempt to justify acts which are essentially racist in character . " " for us , corsican people is not an ethic term " at a meeting in corte , the first public event organized to protest against the new , racist violence , all the island 's separatist leaders attended .
the town itself holds special significance for nationalists because it was corsica ’ s capital during its brief period of independence in the 18th century .
they discussed a recent racist tract sent to a local television station that signed off with the words " the land for the corsicans , " copied from an old nationalist slogan " corsica for the corsicans . " jean-guy talamoni , corsica ’ s most prominent separatist leader , said his definition of what it means to be corsican is an inclusive one . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a corsican stands next to a placard reading " no to the republican fall of corsica " in 2003 " the nationalists have , for 30 years , defined the corsican people as a distinct community made up of native and adopted corsicans , " he said .
" we even passed a motion in the corsican territorial assembly in 1988 affirming precisely that .
for us ' corsican people ' is not an ethnic term . " on the mountain road above bastia there 's a world war ii monument commemorating the soldiers who lost their lives liberating corsica from the nazis .
nearly all of them were moroccan .
the inscription ends with the regret that they would never know how much they were loved by the people they liberated .

it was a wise step , according to dw 's klaus dahmann . delivering an expectedly positive overture to the drawn-out process of ratifying the eu constitution , the lithuanian parliament overwhelmingly approved the document on thursday . the vote itself is less significant than the fact that there was a broad consensus that no referendum was necessary .

they 'd counter that eu membership and the eu 's proposed new constitution are two completely separate issues and people could very well support membership and oppose the constitution at the same time . voting on the wrong thing still , no one needs prophetic abilities to realize that , at best , referendums on the constitution will be votes on eu policy as a whole rather than the document .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.11.2004 fill it up with hydrogen großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german transportation minister manfred stolpe examines the new pumps drivers in berlin can fill up their cars with hydrogen at the world 's largest service station for fuel cell vehicles .
opened on friday , the project paves the way for widespread use of alternative energy . in what was probably the most high-profile turn-out for a service station opening , some 100 managers from four international carmakers , energy experts , environmentalists and a minister for transportation all convened at a berlin service station to watch the first fleet of fuel cell-driven cars fill their tanks with hydrogen .
the demonstration at the aral service station in downtown berlin friday marked the launch of what many environmentalists hope will be the start of a bigger trend towards hydrogen-powered vehicles .
although still in its infancy as far as widespread implementation goes , fuel cell cars are being regarded as an important development in the automotive industry to reduce gasoline emissions and world-wide dependence on oil supplies .
" the berlin project is an important milestone on the road to a sustainable , emissions-free future for hydrogen-powered cars , " proclaimed uwe franke , head of the german branch of bp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : transportation minister manfred stolpe fills up with hydrogen for the first time in europe , a service station offers drivers hydrogen - in liquid and compressed form - next to the usual pumps for gasoline and diesel , franke said .
aral , which belongs to bp , has integrated the two forms of energy into one service station , and will serve as an important pioneer in the field .
together with the other members of the clean energy partnership -lrb- cep -rrb- which includes representatives from the car industry , energy providers and transportation experts , bp hopes to gain more knowledge on the production , delivery and storage of hydrogen for fuel cell-driven cars .
capacity for 100 cars the berlin service station has enough capacity to fill 100 vehicles with hydrogen .
at the moment , though , there are only 16 cars and one city bus which will hook up at the aral pumps .
the cars from bmw , daimlerchrysler , ford and opel are only prototypes and have not been designed for widespread use .
although the automotive industry has generally expressed an interest in developing fuel cell-driven cars , the few models they have built are still only in the test phase .
it will still be several years before the companies go into serial production .
daimlerchrysler has said it intends to be the first to introduce a fuel cell car in 2010 .
general motors and its german division opel announced earlier in the year that they want to be the first to sell over a million hydrogen-powered cars in the near future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder test drives daimlerchrysler 's new f-cell car which runs on hydrogen .
for the time being , though , the biggest obstacle to hydrogen-powered cars is the price , both for the original purchase and refueling .
those who do drive one of the early models are primarily politicians , such as chancellor gerhard schröder , who were given the vehicles as part of a publicity campaign .
road to the future " we have a long road ahead of us , " said german transportation minister manfred stolpe .
" until then hydrogen technology must prove itself as a reliable , cost-efficient and consumer friendly source of energy . "
the production , storage and refueling of hydrogen , its price and performance must all be tested on real market conditions - and that is the goal of the berlin aral station , stolpe explained .
to help the alternative energy on its way into the future , the german government and the auto industry have pledged 33 million euros as part of the clean energy partnership . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder 's lean , green machine german chancellor gerhard schröder has a new car .

opened on friday , the project paves the way for widespread use of alternative energy . in what was probably the most high-profile turn-out for a service station opening , some 100 managers from four international carmakers , energy experts , environmentalists and a minister for transportation all convened at a berlin service station to watch the first fleet of fuel cell-driven cars fill their tanks with hydrogen .
the demonstration at the aral service station in downtown berlin friday marked the launch of what many environmentalists hope will be the start of a bigger trend towards hydrogen-powered vehicles .
although still in its infancy as far as widespread implementation goes , fuel cell cars are being regarded as an important development in the automotive industry to reduce gasoline emissions and world-wide dependence on oil supplies .
" the berlin project is an important milestone on the road to a sustainable , emissions-free future for hydrogen-powered cars , " proclaimed uwe franke , head of the german branch of bp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : transportation minister manfred stolpe fills up with hydrogen for the first time in europe , a service station offers drivers hydrogen - in liquid and compressed form - next to the usual pumps for gasoline and diesel , franke said .
aral , which belongs to bp , has integrated the two forms of energy into one service station , and will serve as an important pioneer in the field .
together with the other members of the clean energy partnership -lrb- cep -rrb- which includes representatives from the car industry , energy providers and transportation experts , bp hopes to gain more knowledge on the production , delivery and storage of hydrogen for fuel cell-driven cars .
capacity for 100 cars the berlin service station has enough capacity to fill 100 vehicles with hydrogen .
at the moment , though , there are only 16 cars and one city bus which will hook up at the aral pumps .
the cars from bmw , daimlerchrysler , ford and opel are only prototypes and have not been designed for widespread use .
although the automotive industry has generally expressed an interest in developing fuel cell-driven cars , the few models they have built are still only in the test phase .
it will still be several years before the companies go into serial production .
daimlerchrysler has said it intends to be the first to introduce a fuel cell car in 2010 .
general motors and its german division opel announced earlier in the year that they want to be the first to sell over a million hydrogen-powered cars in the near future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder test drives daimlerchrysler 's new f-cell car which runs on hydrogen .
for the time being , though , the biggest obstacle to hydrogen-powered cars is the price , both for the original purchase and refueling .
those who do drive one of the early models are primarily politicians , such as chancellor gerhard schröder , who were given the vehicles as part of a publicity campaign .
road to the future " we have a long road ahead of us , " said german transportation minister manfred stolpe .
" until then hydrogen technology must prove itself as a reliable , cost-efficient and consumer friendly source of energy . "
the production , storage and refueling of hydrogen , its price and performance must all be tested on real market conditions - and that is the goal of the berlin aral station , stolpe explained .
to help the alternative energy on its way into the future , the german government and the auto industry have pledged 33 million euros as part of the clean energy partnership . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder 's lean , green machine german chancellor gerhard schröder has a new car .

" in my second term , i will work to deepen our transatlantic ties with the nations of europe , " the american leader said .
" i intend to visit europe as soon as possible after my inauguration . "
bush , who was re-elected last week , will be inaugurated jan .
20 .
he did not say how soon after that date he would travel to europe , where ties to countries such as france and germany are still strained after the us decision to invade iraq last year .
reluctant alliance bush 's last trip to europe was in june to mark the 60th anniversary of the d-day allied landing in normandy , france , that heralded the end of world war ii .
compared to previous us presidents , bush has kept a distance from european allies , with the exception of britain , and few of the leaders who opposed the iraq war have openly embraced the us and its leader since the invasion .
bush has also been reluctant to meet with european politicians unless they see eye-to-eye with him on the iraq issue .
whereas britain 's tony blair has often visited the white house , french president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder have been infrequent guests in washington since bush first came to office .
as for spain , once a strong ally under its former prime minister jose maria aznar , bush has yet to take a phone call from the country 's new socialist leader jose luis rodriguez zapatero , who withdrew his country 's troops from the war-torn country shortly after being elected in march .
on tuesday , though , aznar visited with the president in the white house and king juan carlos and queen sofia are expected to visit bush 's ranch in texas on nov .
24 .
better years ahead ?
since winning a new four-year term , bush has said he wants to work on improving cooperation with his european allies .
at the same time , though , he has made it clear that the us will still go into battle alone if necessary to protect us interests - a unilateral approach many in europe reject .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush , right , and british prime minister tony blair at the white house , thursday , nov .
11 , 2004 he said friday his european trip would serve to remind people on both sides of the atlantic that " the world is better off , america is better off , europe is better off , when we work together . "
" there 's a lot we can accomplish working together , " bush said referring to his administration 's intention to cooperate with europeans on tracking down members of the al qaeda terrorist network , halting the spread of weapons of mass destruction and nato expansion .
blair , who has pitted himself as a bridge between washington and the europeans -lrb- the uk supported the us in iraq but has aligned itself with the eu on other issues such as the middle east and iran -rrb- , said he supported " very strongly " bush 's hope to strengthen cooperation .
the british leader listed iraq , the middle east and afghanistan as priority areas for the two sides to come together on .

opened on friday , the project paves the way for widespread use of alternative energy . in what was probably the most high-profile turn-out for a service station opening , some 100 managers from four international carmakers , energy experts , environmentalists and a minister for transportation all convened at a berlin service station to watch the first fleet of fuel cell-driven cars fill their tanks with hydrogen .
the demonstration at the aral service station in downtown berlin friday marked the launch of what many environmentalists hope will be the start of a bigger trend towards hydrogen-powered vehicles .
although still in its infancy as far as widespread implementation goes , fuel cell cars are being regarded as an important development in the automotive industry to reduce gasoline emissions and world-wide dependence on oil supplies .
" the berlin project is an important milestone on the road to a sustainable , emissions-free future for hydrogen-powered cars , " proclaimed uwe franke , head of the german branch of bp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : transportation minister manfred stolpe fills up with hydrogen for the first time in europe , a service station offers drivers hydrogen - in liquid and compressed form - next to the usual pumps for gasoline and diesel , franke said .

together with the other members of the clean energy partnership -lrb- cep -rrb- which includes representatives from the car industry , energy providers and transportation experts , bp hopes to gain more knowledge on the production , delivery and storage of hydrogen for fuel cell-driven cars .
capacity for 100 cars the berlin service station has enough capacity to fill 100 vehicles with hydrogen .
at the moment , though , there are only 16 cars and one city bus which will hook up at the aral pumps .
the cars from bmw , daimlerchrysler , ford and opel are only prototypes and have not been designed for widespread use .
although the automotive industry has generally expressed an interest in developing fuel cell-driven cars , the few models they have built are still only in the test phase .
it will still be several years before the companies go into serial production .
daimlerchrysler has said it intends to be the first to introduce a fuel cell car in 2010 .

" in my second term , i will work to deepen our transatlantic ties with the nations of europe , " the american leader said .
" i intend to visit europe as soon as possible after my inauguration . "
bush , who was re-elected last week , will be inaugurated jan .
20 .
he did not say how soon after that date he would travel to europe , where ties to countries such as france and germany are still strained after the us decision to invade iraq last year .
reluctant alliance bush 's last trip to europe was in june to mark the 60th anniversary of the d-day allied landing in normandy , france , that heralded the end of world war ii .
compared to previous us presidents , bush has kept a distance from european allies , with the exception of britain , and few of the leaders who opposed the iraq war have openly embraced the us and its leader since the invasion .
bush has also been reluctant to meet with european politicians unless they see eye-to-eye with him on the iraq issue .
whereas britain 's tony blair has often visited the white house , french president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder have been infrequent guests in washington since bush first came to office .
as for spain , once a strong ally under its former prime minister jose maria aznar , bush has yet to take a phone call from the country 's new socialist leader jose luis rodriguez zapatero , who withdrew his country 's troops from the war-torn country shortly after being elected in march .
on tuesday , though , aznar visited with the president in the white house and king juan carlos and queen sofia are expected to visit bush 's ranch in texas on nov .
24 .
better years ahead ?
since winning a new four-year term , bush has said he wants to work on improving cooperation with his european allies .
at the same time , though , he has made it clear that the us will still go into battle alone if necessary to protect us interests - a unilateral approach many in europe reject .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush , right , and british prime minister tony blair at the white house , thursday , nov .
11 , 2004 he said friday his european trip would serve to remind people on both sides of the atlantic that " the world is better off , america is better off , europe is better off , when we work together . "
" there 's a lot we can accomplish working together , " bush said referring to his administration 's intention to cooperate with europeans on tracking down members of the al qaeda terrorist network , halting the spread of weapons of mass destruction and nato expansion .
blair , who has pitted himself as a bridge between washington and the europeans -lrb- the uk supported the us in iraq but has aligned itself with the eu on other issues such as the middle east and iran -rrb- , said he supported " very strongly " bush 's hope to strengthen cooperation .
the british leader listed iraq , the middle east and afghanistan as priority areas for the two sides to come together on .

the caller leaves a message : " now it ’ s us who ’ ve had enough of you !
we ’ re going to form an anti-moroccan committee ! " nearby , on the metal grill that protects the association ’ s windows at night , graffiti announces a bomb .
and these days , spray-painted slogans such as " francesi fori " - " french out " are becoming " arabs go home . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yvan colonna , top suspect in the 1998 murder france 's highest official on the french mediterranean island of corsica .
for almost 30 years , corsican nationalists have bombed public buildings in an attempt to separate from france .
but now nationalistic violence has turned against the immigrant community , mainly made up of moroccans . " we thought our place was here " corsica is home to about 30,000 immigrants - one tenth of the population - and these days , many of them said they feel threatened and have had enough . " every day we hear ' dirty arab ' or ' arabs out ' , " said one moroccan resident of corsica .
" we ’ ve got no pride left , no dignity as human beings and with a heavy heart , i want to leave .
my three children were born here , but we can ’ t live here anymore . " another foreign resident said it hurts to be treated this way . " we thought we were well integrated , " said a moroccan woman .
" we thought our place was here . " a community in trauma the inhabitants of a peaceful , suburban neighbourhood of the northern city of bastia repair the walls around their gardens .
they were damaged when a huge blast destroyed the house next door .
the owner of what is now just a charred ruin of twisted metal and rubble is a moroccan tile worker .
he had almost finished building the villa of his dreams .
meanwhile , estate agents in bastia have been warned : don ’ t sell to north africans or face the consequences . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corsicans reading the newspaper after a 2003 no vote to give more autonomy to their island .
beneath one of the splendid baroque churches of bastia , most of the stall-holders and most of the customers at the market are north africans .
to the outsider , it seems to be a place where the cultures of the two sides of the mediterranean can mingle under the shade of the plane trees . but the reality is much darker : it is a community in trauma .
the area is full of destruction : torched cars , a bombed out pizza parlor , bank and shops .
this is part of 56 acts of violence against the island ’ s north african community over the past year - as many as in the whole of the rest of france put together .
two underground nationalist groups called the clandestini corsi and the mca that emerged this year have claimed responsibility for many of the attacks , which , they said , are aimed against the drug trade . drugs as a pretext that is a claim authorities dismiss .
the public prosecutor for northern corsica , jean-jacques fagni , called drugs a pretext . " it isn ’ t true that only north africans deal drugs , " he said .
" some do ... but so do french people whose origins are in corsica or mainland france .
this argument is just an attempt to justify acts which are essentially racist in character . " " for us , corsican people is not an ethic term " at a meeting in corte , the first public event organized to protest against the new , racist violence , all the island 's separatist leaders attended .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.11.2004 fill it up with hydrogen großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german transportation minister manfred stolpe examines the new pumps drivers in berlin can fill up their cars with hydrogen at the world 's largest service station for fuel cell vehicles .
opened on friday , the project paves the way for widespread use of alternative energy . in what was probably the most high-profile turn-out for a service station opening , some 100 managers from four international carmakers , energy experts , environmentalists and a minister for transportation all convened at a berlin service station to watch the first fleet of fuel cell-driven cars fill their tanks with hydrogen .
the demonstration at the aral service station in downtown berlin friday marked the launch of what many environmentalists hope will be the start of a bigger trend towards hydrogen-powered vehicles .
although still in its infancy as far as widespread implementation goes , fuel cell cars are being regarded as an important development in the automotive industry to reduce gasoline emissions and world-wide dependence on oil supplies .
" the berlin project is an important milestone on the road to a sustainable , emissions-free future for hydrogen-powered cars , " proclaimed uwe franke , head of the german branch of bp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : transportation minister manfred stolpe fills up with hydrogen for the first time in europe , a service station offers drivers hydrogen - in liquid and compressed form - next to the usual pumps for gasoline and diesel , franke said .
aral , which belongs to bp , has integrated the two forms of energy into one service station , and will serve as an important pioneer in the field .
together with the other members of the clean energy partnership -lrb- cep -rrb- which includes representatives from the car industry , energy providers and transportation experts , bp hopes to gain more knowledge on the production , delivery and storage of hydrogen for fuel cell-driven cars .
capacity for 100 cars the berlin service station has enough capacity to fill 100 vehicles with hydrogen .
at the moment , though , there are only 16 cars and one city bus which will hook up at the aral pumps .
the cars from bmw , daimlerchrysler , ford and opel are only prototypes and have not been designed for widespread use .
although the automotive industry has generally expressed an interest in developing fuel cell-driven cars , the few models they have built are still only in the test phase .

for the time being , though , the biggest obstacle to hydrogen-powered cars is the price , both for the original purchase and refueling .
those who do drive one of the early models are primarily politicians , such as chancellor gerhard schröder , who were given the vehicles as part of a publicity campaign .
road to the future " we have a long road ahead of us , " said german transportation minister manfred stolpe .
" until then hydrogen technology must prove itself as a reliable , cost-efficient and consumer friendly source of energy . "
the production , storage and refueling of hydrogen , its price and performance must all be tested on real market conditions - and that is the goal of the berlin aral station , stolpe explained .

the caller leaves a message : " now it ’ s us who ’ ve had enough of you !
we ’ re going to form an anti-moroccan committee ! " nearby , on the metal grill that protects the association ’ s windows at night , graffiti announces a bomb .
and these days , spray-painted slogans such as " francesi fori " - " french out " are becoming " arabs go home . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yvan colonna , top suspect in the 1998 murder france 's highest official on the french mediterranean island of corsica .
for almost 30 years , corsican nationalists have bombed public buildings in an attempt to separate from france .
but now nationalistic violence has turned against the immigrant community , mainly made up of moroccans . " we thought our place was here " corsica is home to about 30,000 immigrants - one tenth of the population - and these days , many of them said they feel threatened and have had enough . " every day we hear ' dirty arab ' or ' arabs out ' , " said one moroccan resident of corsica .
" we ’ ve got no pride left , no dignity as human beings and with a heavy heart , i want to leave .
my three children were born here , but we can ’ t live here anymore . " another foreign resident said it hurts to be treated this way . " we thought we were well integrated , " said a moroccan woman .
" we thought our place was here . " a community in trauma the inhabitants of a peaceful , suburban neighbourhood of the northern city of bastia repair the walls around their gardens .
they were damaged when a huge blast destroyed the house next door .
the owner of what is now just a charred ruin of twisted metal and rubble is a moroccan tile worker .
he had almost finished building the villa of his dreams .
meanwhile , estate agents in bastia have been warned : don ’ t sell to north africans or face the consequences . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corsicans reading the newspaper after a 2003 no vote to give more autonomy to their island .
beneath one of the splendid baroque churches of bastia , most of the stall-holders and most of the customers at the market are north africans .
to the outsider , it seems to be a place where the cultures of the two sides of the mediterranean can mingle under the shade of the plane trees . but the reality is much darker : it is a community in trauma .
the area is full of destruction : torched cars , a bombed out pizza parlor , bank and shops .
this is part of 56 acts of violence against the island ’ s north african community over the past year - as many as in the whole of the rest of france put together .
two underground nationalist groups called the clandestini corsi and the mca that emerged this year have claimed responsibility for many of the attacks , which , they said , are aimed against the drug trade . drugs as a pretext that is a claim authorities dismiss .
the public prosecutor for northern corsica , jean-jacques fagni , called drugs a pretext . " it isn ’ t true that only north africans deal drugs , " he said .
" some do ... but so do french people whose origins are in corsica or mainland france .
this argument is just an attempt to justify acts which are essentially racist in character . " " for us , corsican people is not an ethic term " at a meeting in corte , the first public event organized to protest against the new , racist violence , all the island 's separatist leaders attended .
the town itself holds special significance for nationalists because it was corsica ’ s capital during its brief period of independence in the 18th century .
they discussed a recent racist tract sent to a local television station that signed off with the words " the land for the corsicans , " copied from an old nationalist slogan " corsica for the corsicans . " jean-guy talamoni , corsica ’ s most prominent separatist leader , said his definition of what it means to be corsican is an inclusive one . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a corsican stands next to a placard reading " no to the republican fall of corsica " in 2003 " the nationalists have , for 30 years , defined the corsican people as a distinct community made up of native and adopted corsicans , " he said .
" we even passed a motion in the corsican territorial assembly in 1988 affirming precisely that .
for us ' corsican people ' is not an ethnic term . " on the mountain road above bastia there 's a world war ii monument commemorating the soldiers who lost their lives liberating corsica from the nazis .
nearly all of them were moroccan .
the inscription ends with the regret that they would never know how much they were loved by the people they liberated .
for the north african community in corsica today , such sentiments appear increasingly hollow . john laurenson -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de corsica says " non " to greater autonomy the voters of corsica rejected a french offer of limited autonomy by a narrow margin in referendum on sunday , after the capture of the troubled island 's most wanted separatist .

" i intend to visit europe as soon as possible after my inauguration . "
bush , who was re-elected last week , will be inaugurated jan .
20 .
he did not say how soon after that date he would travel to europe , where ties to countries such as france and germany are still strained after the us decision to invade iraq last year .
reluctant alliance bush 's last trip to europe was in june to mark the 60th anniversary of the d-day allied landing in normandy , france , that heralded the end of world war ii .
compared to previous us presidents , bush has kept a distance from european allies , with the exception of britain , and few of the leaders who opposed the iraq war have openly embraced the us and its leader since the invasion .
bush has also been reluctant to meet with european politicians unless they see eye-to-eye with him on the iraq issue .
whereas britain 's tony blair has often visited the white house , french president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder have been infrequent guests in washington since bush first came to office .
as for spain , once a strong ally under its former prime minister jose maria aznar , bush has yet to take a phone call from the country 's new socialist leader jose luis rodriguez zapatero , who withdrew his country 's troops from the war-torn country shortly after being elected in march .
on tuesday , though , aznar visited with the president in the white house and king juan carlos and queen sofia are expected to visit bush 's ranch in texas on nov .
24 .
better years ahead ?
since winning a new four-year term , bush has said he wants to work on improving cooperation with his european allies .
at the same time , though , he has made it clear that the us will still go into battle alone if necessary to protect us interests - a unilateral approach many in europe reject .

11 , 2004 he said friday his european trip would serve to remind people on both sides of the atlantic that " the world is better off , america is better off , europe is better off , when we work together . "
" there 's a lot we can accomplish working together , " bush said referring to his administration 's intention to cooperate with europeans on tracking down members of the al qaeda terrorist network , halting the spread of weapons of mass destruction and nato expansion .
blair , who has pitted himself as a bridge between washington and the europeans -lrb- the uk supported the us in iraq but has aligned itself with the eu on other issues such as the middle east and iran -rrb- , said he supported " very strongly " bush 's hope to strengthen cooperation .
the british leader listed iraq , the middle east and afghanistan as priority areas for the two sides to come together on .

it was a wise step , according to dw 's klaus dahmann . delivering an expectedly positive overture to the drawn-out process of ratifying the eu constitution , the lithuanian parliament overwhelmingly approved the document on thursday . the vote itself is less significant than the fact that there was a broad consensus that no referendum was necessary .
after all , 90 percent of lithuanians had obviously expressed confidence in the bloc by voting for eu membership in may 2003 , all political parties agreed . ardent supporters of grass-roots democracy might condemn that line of argument .
they 'd counter that eu membership and the eu 's proposed new constitution are two completely separate issues and people could very well support membership and oppose the constitution at the same time . voting on the wrong thing still , no one needs prophetic abilities to realize that , at best , referendums on the constitution will be votes on eu policy as a whole rather than the document .

all of this is necessary for a document based on political compromise , but it 's also fairly incomprehensible for the average citizen . that 's why some will use the referendums as an opportunity to " show them up there " how this , that and the other thing could be handled much better .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.11.2004 opinion : a model worth repeating großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he voted on eu membership , his parliament ratified the constitution while several eu countries plan to put the proposed eu constitution before voters , lithuania this week became the first country to ratify the document in parliament .
it was a wise step , according to dw 's klaus dahmann . delivering an expectedly positive overture to the drawn-out process of ratifying the eu constitution , the lithuanian parliament overwhelmingly approved the document on thursday . the vote itself is less significant than the fact that there was a broad consensus that no referendum was necessary .
after all , 90 percent of lithuanians had obviously expressed confidence in the bloc by voting for eu membership in may 2003 , all political parties agreed . ardent supporters of grass-roots democracy might condemn that line of argument .
they 'd counter that eu membership and the eu 's proposed new constitution are two completely separate issues and people could very well support membership and oppose the constitution at the same time . voting on the wrong thing still , no one needs prophetic abilities to realize that , at best , referendums on the constitution will be votes on eu policy as a whole rather than the document .
in the worse case scenario , they 'll become polls on voters ' satisfaction with their respective national governments at the time . clearly , everyone can read the constitution .
large parts of the document address citizens directly , especially the second part , which focuses on basic rights . but the largest section deals with quotas and percentages , with exceptions , tactical loopholes and " yes , but " formulations .
all of this is necessary for a document based on political compromise , but it 's also fairly incomprehensible for the average citizen . that 's why some will use the referendums as an opportunity to " show them up there " how this , that and the other thing could be handled much better .

it was a wise step , according to dw 's klaus dahmann . delivering an expectedly positive overture to the drawn-out process of ratifying the eu constitution , the lithuanian parliament overwhelmingly approved the document on thursday . the vote itself is less significant than the fact that there was a broad consensus that no referendum was necessary .
after all , 90 percent of lithuanians had obviously expressed confidence in the bloc by voting for eu membership in may 2003 , all political parties agreed . ardent supporters of grass-roots democracy might condemn that line of argument .
they 'd counter that eu membership and the eu 's proposed new constitution are two completely separate issues and people could very well support membership and oppose the constitution at the same time . voting on the wrong thing still , no one needs prophetic abilities to realize that , at best , referendums on the constitution will be votes on eu policy as a whole rather than the document .
in the worse case scenario , they 'll become polls on voters ' satisfaction with their respective national governments at the time . clearly , everyone can read the constitution .
large parts of the document address citizens directly , especially the second part , which focuses on basic rights . but the largest section deals with quotas and percentages , with exceptions , tactical loopholes and " yes , but " formulations .
all of this is necessary for a document based on political compromise , but it 's also fairly incomprehensible for the average citizen . that 's why some will use the referendums as an opportunity to " show them up there " how this , that and the other thing could be handled much better .
since the only options are to say " yes " or " no , " the temptation will be to do the latter . bildunterschrift : eu leaders pose for a family picture after signing the eu constitution in rome on oct .

the caller leaves a message : " now it ’ s us who ’ ve had enough of you !
we ’ re going to form an anti-moroccan committee ! " nearby , on the metal grill that protects the association ’ s windows at night , graffiti announces a bomb .
and these days , spray-painted slogans such as " francesi fori " - " french out " are becoming " arabs go home . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yvan colonna , top suspect in the 1998 murder france 's highest official on the french mediterranean island of corsica .
for almost 30 years , corsican nationalists have bombed public buildings in an attempt to separate from france .
but now nationalistic violence has turned against the immigrant community , mainly made up of moroccans . " we thought our place was here " corsica is home to about 30,000 immigrants - one tenth of the population - and these days , many of them said they feel threatened and have had enough . " every day we hear ' dirty arab ' or ' arabs out ' , " said one moroccan resident of corsica .
" we ’ ve got no pride left , no dignity as human beings and with a heavy heart , i want to leave .
my three children were born here , but we can ’ t live here anymore . " another foreign resident said it hurts to be treated this way . " we thought we were well integrated , " said a moroccan woman .
" we thought our place was here . " a community in trauma the inhabitants of a peaceful , suburban neighbourhood of the northern city of bastia repair the walls around their gardens .
they were damaged when a huge blast destroyed the house next door .
the owner of what is now just a charred ruin of twisted metal and rubble is a moroccan tile worker .
he had almost finished building the villa of his dreams .
meanwhile , estate agents in bastia have been warned : don ’ t sell to north africans or face the consequences . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corsicans reading the newspaper after a 2003 no vote to give more autonomy to their island .
beneath one of the splendid baroque churches of bastia , most of the stall-holders and most of the customers at the market are north africans .
to the outsider , it seems to be a place where the cultures of the two sides of the mediterranean can mingle under the shade of the plane trees . but the reality is much darker : it is a community in trauma .
the area is full of destruction : torched cars , a bombed out pizza parlor , bank and shops .
this is part of 56 acts of violence against the island ’ s north african community over the past year - as many as in the whole of the rest of france put together .
two underground nationalist groups called the clandestini corsi and the mca that emerged this year have claimed responsibility for many of the attacks , which , they said , are aimed against the drug trade . drugs as a pretext that is a claim authorities dismiss .
the public prosecutor for northern corsica , jean-jacques fagni , called drugs a pretext . " it isn ’ t true that only north africans deal drugs , " he said .
" some do ... but so do french people whose origins are in corsica or mainland france .
this argument is just an attempt to justify acts which are essentially racist in character . " " for us , corsican people is not an ethic term " at a meeting in corte , the first public event organized to protest against the new , racist violence , all the island 's separatist leaders attended .
the town itself holds special significance for nationalists because it was corsica ’ s capital during its brief period of independence in the 18th century .
they discussed a recent racist tract sent to a local television station that signed off with the words " the land for the corsicans , " copied from an old nationalist slogan " corsica for the corsicans . " jean-guy talamoni , corsica ’ s most prominent separatist leader , said his definition of what it means to be corsican is an inclusive one . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a corsican stands next to a placard reading " no to the republican fall of corsica " in 2003 " the nationalists have , for 30 years , defined the corsican people as a distinct community made up of native and adopted corsicans , " he said .
" we even passed a motion in the corsican territorial assembly in 1988 affirming precisely that .
for us ' corsican people ' is not an ethnic term . " on the mountain road above bastia there 's a world war ii monument commemorating the soldiers who lost their lives liberating corsica from the nazis .
nearly all of them were moroccan .
the inscription ends with the regret that they would never know how much they were loved by the people they liberated .
for the north african community in corsica today , such sentiments appear increasingly hollow . john laurenson -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de corsica says " non " to greater autonomy the voters of corsica rejected a french offer of limited autonomy by a narrow margin in referendum on sunday , after the capture of the troubled island 's most wanted separatist .

with his eyes clearly set on a national victory in two years , jürgen klinsmann has vowed to introduce new training techniques learned while living and working in the united states .
in an interview with dw-world , klinsmann stressed how important winning the world cup is for german national pride : " every time germany wins a world cup , it has an enormous importance for the whole country and people - a feeling of self-worth and pride . "
in order to reach that goal , the coach has begun implementing changes in the way the team trains and the way it works together .

in an interview with dw-world , klinsmann stressed how important winning the world cup is for german national pride : " every time germany wins a world cup , it has an enormous importance for the whole country and people - a feeling of self-worth and pride . "
in order to reach that goal , the coach has begun implementing changes in the way the team trains and the way it works together .
he has hired on us fitness trainers , brought on a lot of new young players and criticized a few big names in the sport .
dw-world 's guido baumhauer asked him about how the reforms were being received .

dw-world : mr. klinsmann , you were active with the los angeles galaxy in some way or another over the past four years .
what training and motivation techniques have you brought over from the us and how have the german players adapted to them ?
klinsmann : we introduced some different ideas a few weeks ago in berlin before the game against brazil .
we had invited some athletic coaches from the us who used some of their training methods .
it was n't that they were so new but they were a little different for the players and it was well received .
dw : how do the sporting mentalities differ between germany and the us ?
jk : they are both big sports countries .
obviously in the us , you have a big sports variety : basketball , baseball , american football , hockey , golf and then soccer .
in germany , you have soccer , soccer and then soccer .

based on the connections with -lsb- rupert -rsb- murdoch and the sky network , they placed the premiere league in almost every country in the world , so it became more and more popular .
maybe this is something the bundesliga can pick up on .
we can show it around the world and convince the people of the product and maybe in a few years we 'll be at the same level .
dw : german soccer is seen by many as coming up on the short end of the stick compared to the primera division in spain , the serie a in italy and the english premiere league in terms of marketability , quality of soccer and audience excitement .

with his eyes clearly set on a national victory in two years , jürgen klinsmann has vowed to introduce new training techniques learned while living and working in the united states .
in an interview with dw-world , klinsmann stressed how important winning the world cup is for german national pride : " every time germany wins a world cup , it has an enormous importance for the whole country and people - a feeling of self-worth and pride . "
in order to reach that goal , the coach has begun implementing changes in the way the team trains and the way it works together .
he has hired on us fitness trainers , brought on a lot of new young players and criticized a few big names in the sport .
dw-world 's guido baumhauer asked him about how the reforms were being received .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann in dw-interview with dw-world 's guido baumhauer klinsmann : " we germans are always ready for reforms , but when it comes to changes , it gets to be a little bit uncomfortable , because we 're forced to depart from our daily routine , " klinsmann said .
dw-world : mr. klinsmann , you were active with the los angeles galaxy in some way or another over the past four years .
what training and motivation techniques have you brought over from the us and how have the german players adapted to them ?
klinsmann : we introduced some different ideas a few weeks ago in berlin before the game against brazil .
we had invited some athletic coaches from the us who used some of their training methods .
it was n't that they were so new but they were a little different for the players and it was well received .
dw : how do the sporting mentalities differ between germany and the us ?
jk : they are both big sports countries .
obviously in the us , you have a big sports variety : basketball , baseball , american football , hockey , golf and then soccer .
in germany , you have soccer , soccer and then soccer .
this is part of our culture and part of europe .
in general though , both nations are sports crazy .

dw : one of the biggest success stories in sports marketing in europe has been the english premiere league .
match times , just to name one example , are sometimes changed to make the games more marketable .
do you have any views on how to increase the commercial image of the bundesliga ?
jk : the premiere league did an unbelievable job in the last 15 years .
based on the connections with -lsb- rupert -rsb- murdoch and the sky network , they placed the premiere league in almost every country in the world , so it became more and more popular .
maybe this is something the bundesliga can pick up on .
we can show it around the world and convince the people of the product and maybe in a few years we 'll be at the same level .
dw : german soccer is seen by many as coming up on the short end of the stick compared to the primera division in spain , the serie a in italy and the english premiere league in terms of marketability , quality of soccer and audience excitement .
do you agree with that claim ?
jk : no .
absolutely not .
all four leagues belong to the top four in the world .
the stadiums are packed , the games are exciting .
here in germany , the whole country is excited about hosting the world cup in two years .
we are moving ahead nicely and do n't have to hide from anybody . guido baumhauer -lrb- jk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bringing the world cup into the schools in the run-up to the 2006 world cup in germany , a new project headed by national soccer coach jürgen klinsmann aims to teach kids how to think globally and about the importance of good sportsmanship .

opened on friday , the project paves the way for widespread use of alternative energy . in what was probably the most high-profile turn-out for a service station opening , some 100 managers from four international carmakers , energy experts , environmentalists and a minister for transportation all convened at a berlin service station to watch the first fleet of fuel cell-driven cars fill their tanks with hydrogen .
the demonstration at the aral service station in downtown berlin friday marked the launch of what many environmentalists hope will be the start of a bigger trend towards hydrogen-powered vehicles .
although still in its infancy as far as widespread implementation goes , fuel cell cars are being regarded as an important development in the automotive industry to reduce gasoline emissions and world-wide dependence on oil supplies .
" the berlin project is an important milestone on the road to a sustainable , emissions-free future for hydrogen-powered cars , " proclaimed uwe franke , head of the german branch of bp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : transportation minister manfred stolpe fills up with hydrogen for the first time in europe , a service station offers drivers hydrogen - in liquid and compressed form - next to the usual pumps for gasoline and diesel , franke said .
aral , which belongs to bp , has integrated the two forms of energy into one service station , and will serve as an important pioneer in the field .
together with the other members of the clean energy partnership -lrb- cep -rrb- which includes representatives from the car industry , energy providers and transportation experts , bp hopes to gain more knowledge on the production , delivery and storage of hydrogen for fuel cell-driven cars .
capacity for 100 cars the berlin service station has enough capacity to fill 100 vehicles with hydrogen .
at the moment , though , there are only 16 cars and one city bus which will hook up at the aral pumps .
the cars from bmw , daimlerchrysler , ford and opel are only prototypes and have not been designed for widespread use .
although the automotive industry has generally expressed an interest in developing fuel cell-driven cars , the few models they have built are still only in the test phase .
it will still be several years before the companies go into serial production .
daimlerchrysler has said it intends to be the first to introduce a fuel cell car in 2010 .
general motors and its german division opel announced earlier in the year that they want to be the first to sell over a million hydrogen-powered cars in the near future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder test drives daimlerchrysler 's new f-cell car which runs on hydrogen .
for the time being , though , the biggest obstacle to hydrogen-powered cars is the price , both for the original purchase and refueling .
those who do drive one of the early models are primarily politicians , such as chancellor gerhard schröder , who were given the vehicles as part of a publicity campaign .
road to the future " we have a long road ahead of us , " said german transportation minister manfred stolpe .
" until then hydrogen technology must prove itself as a reliable , cost-efficient and consumer friendly source of energy . "
the production , storage and refueling of hydrogen , its price and performance must all be tested on real market conditions - and that is the goal of the berlin aral station , stolpe explained .

opened on friday , the project paves the way for widespread use of alternative energy . in what was probably the most high-profile turn-out for a service station opening , some 100 managers from four international carmakers , energy experts , environmentalists and a minister for transportation all convened at a berlin service station to watch the first fleet of fuel cell-driven cars fill their tanks with hydrogen .
the demonstration at the aral service station in downtown berlin friday marked the launch of what many environmentalists hope will be the start of a bigger trend towards hydrogen-powered vehicles .
although still in its infancy as far as widespread implementation goes , fuel cell cars are being regarded as an important development in the automotive industry to reduce gasoline emissions and world-wide dependence on oil supplies .
" the berlin project is an important milestone on the road to a sustainable , emissions-free future for hydrogen-powered cars , " proclaimed uwe franke , head of the german branch of bp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : transportation minister manfred stolpe fills up with hydrogen for the first time in europe , a service station offers drivers hydrogen - in liquid and compressed form - next to the usual pumps for gasoline and diesel , franke said .
aral , which belongs to bp , has integrated the two forms of energy into one service station , and will serve as an important pioneer in the field .
together with the other members of the clean energy partnership -lrb- cep -rrb- which includes representatives from the car industry , energy providers and transportation experts , bp hopes to gain more knowledge on the production , delivery and storage of hydrogen for fuel cell-driven cars .
capacity for 100 cars the berlin service station has enough capacity to fill 100 vehicles with hydrogen .
at the moment , though , there are only 16 cars and one city bus which will hook up at the aral pumps .
the cars from bmw , daimlerchrysler , ford and opel are only prototypes and have not been designed for widespread use .
although the automotive industry has generally expressed an interest in developing fuel cell-driven cars , the few models they have built are still only in the test phase .
it will still be several years before the companies go into serial production .
daimlerchrysler has said it intends to be the first to introduce a fuel cell car in 2010 .
general motors and its german division opel announced earlier in the year that they want to be the first to sell over a million hydrogen-powered cars in the near future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder test drives daimlerchrysler 's new f-cell car which runs on hydrogen .

opened on friday , the project paves the way for widespread use of alternative energy . in what was probably the most high-profile turn-out for a service station opening , some 100 managers from four international carmakers , energy experts , environmentalists and a minister for transportation all convened at a berlin service station to watch the first fleet of fuel cell-driven cars fill their tanks with hydrogen .
the demonstration at the aral service station in downtown berlin friday marked the launch of what many environmentalists hope will be the start of a bigger trend towards hydrogen-powered vehicles .
although still in its infancy as far as widespread implementation goes , fuel cell cars are being regarded as an important development in the automotive industry to reduce gasoline emissions and world-wide dependence on oil supplies .
" the berlin project is an important milestone on the road to a sustainable , emissions-free future for hydrogen-powered cars , " proclaimed uwe franke , head of the german branch of bp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : transportation minister manfred stolpe fills up with hydrogen for the first time in europe , a service station offers drivers hydrogen - in liquid and compressed form - next to the usual pumps for gasoline and diesel , franke said .
aral , which belongs to bp , has integrated the two forms of energy into one service station , and will serve as an important pioneer in the field .
together with the other members of the clean energy partnership -lrb- cep -rrb- which includes representatives from the car industry , energy providers and transportation experts , bp hopes to gain more knowledge on the production , delivery and storage of hydrogen for fuel cell-driven cars .
capacity for 100 cars the berlin service station has enough capacity to fill 100 vehicles with hydrogen .
at the moment , though , there are only 16 cars and one city bus which will hook up at the aral pumps .
the cars from bmw , daimlerchrysler , ford and opel are only prototypes and have not been designed for widespread use .
although the automotive industry has generally expressed an interest in developing fuel cell-driven cars , the few models they have built are still only in the test phase .
it will still be several years before the companies go into serial production .
daimlerchrysler has said it intends to be the first to introduce a fuel cell car in 2010 .
general motors and its german division opel announced earlier in the year that they want to be the first to sell over a million hydrogen-powered cars in the near future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder test drives daimlerchrysler 's new f-cell car which runs on hydrogen .
for the time being , though , the biggest obstacle to hydrogen-powered cars is the price , both for the original purchase and refueling .
those who do drive one of the early models are primarily politicians , such as chancellor gerhard schröder , who were given the vehicles as part of a publicity campaign .

at a conference in iceland , they warned their traditional way of life was endangered by global warming .
they accused washington of thwarting efforts to reduce the problem by refusing to sign the kyoto agreement .
scientists have warned that the region is warming twice as quickly as the rest of the planet .
" the short-term economic policy of one country should not be able to trump the entire survival of one people , " said sheila watt-cloutier , the chair of the inuit circumpolar conference -lrb- icc -rrb- at the end of the four-day event .
" climate change is not just about weather or sea-ice conditions ... it 's a fight to preserve a way of life , " she added .
a team of international researchers published the results of a study before the meeting kicked off , predicting that the summer ice cap could melt completely before the end of this century .
the arctic climate impact assessment report -lrb- acia -rrb- found that the faster warming rate of the arctic is due to a build-up of greenhouse gases , mainly carbon dioxide released from burning oil , coal and gas in power plants and cars .
it also warned that several species including polar bears could disappear as a consequence of the melting ice .
climate change could also claim human lives , too , it said .
there have been several incidents in which inuit hunters have drowned after falling through unexpectedly thinner ice .
the foreign ministers of the eight arctic nations - the us , russia , canada , iceland , sweden , norway , denmark and finland - are due to meet in iceland 's capital reykjavik on 24 november to discuss how to fight the problem .
the us , responsible for about a quarter of the world 's gas emissions , has refused to ratify the kyoto protocol .
the agreement , negotiated in 1997 , requires industrial nations to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases below 1990 levels .
president bush argues the plan is too costly and unfairly excludes developing nations .

the ' no limits ' report was carried out by torbay youth offending team and will be used for a multi-agency strategy to tackle drinking problems .
the youth offending team is run by torbay council which admits there is a problem but wants to deal with the negative impacts of alcohol misuse .
the research shows that young people take their cue from adult role models .
' useful insight ' but chris harris , the leader of torbay council , says alcohol misuse is a complex problem for the whole of society and needs to be tacked from various perspectives .
he said : " most of our young people are not misusing alcohol and we must be careful not to imply that they are . "
the council says the multi-agency approach is the most effective .
" there are health , economic , policing , education and well-being factors here which require a co-ordinated approach , " said mr harris .
acting supt carl langley from safer communities torbay said : " the research is a useful insight into drinking habits , and confirms much of what we know about the risks involved when young people abuse alcohol .
" they are reporting that they are more likely to take risks walking home , where they 're at risk of being victims of crime or indeed committing crime themselves . "

police said it was evidence the message that their use while driving was illegal was still not getting through .
the ban on the use of hand-held mobile phones brought northern ireland into line with the rest of the uk .
although it was introduced on 1 february , police operated a " yellow card " system of warning drivers before implementing the fines from 1 march .
a total of 3,808 fixed penalty notices have been issued between then and 30 september .
chief inspector brian kee , of the psni 's road policing unit , said the number of tickets issued indicated drivers were not getting the ban message . "
drivers need to realise that if they are using a mobile phone while driving it does distract them and they are not paying attention to other road users " chief inspector brian kee psni " a significant number of people are still using mobile phones while driving , even though it has been banned since february , " he said .
" despite the messages when the legislation was introduced and messages since , they are not getting through as almost 4,000 tickets have been issued . "
the offence carries a fixed penalty notice of £ 30 , however motorists face fines of up to £ 1,000 if they go to court .
' hard shoulder ' " drivers need to realise that if they are using a mobile phone while driving it does distract them and they are not paying attention to other road users , " said the chief inspector .
" they are putting themselves , their passengers and other road users at risk . "
police advise that when a mobile phone rings while driving , the call is allowed to go through to voicemail .
on a motorway , it is illegal to pull over onto the hard shoulder to answer a call .
hands-free kits are allowed , but many road safety experts say they do not reduce the risks of having an accident .
chief inspector kee said while hands-free mobiles were less of a threat , they could still cause distraction and affect driving ability .
" if drivers who are using hands-free mobile phones are displaying inattention , there is the potential for them to be charged with careless driving .
" while their use of a hands-free mobile may not be illegal , their driving behaviour may mean they are committing other offences . "
the law also bans passengers from holding a mobile phone to the driver 's ear .
the maximum fine for drivers of vans , lorries , buses and coaches is £ 2,500 .

the 68-year-old , who famously blew the whistle on a winning goal for brazil in the dying seconds of a match , takes up the year-long post next march .
the job , which dates back to anglo-saxon times , is largely ceremonial .
but thomas , dubbed " the book " for his strict interpretation of the rules , said he wants to use the role to help set an example for young people .
thomas , who lives in porthcawl , south wales , was nominated for the unpaid but prestigious role in a 1,000-year old ceremony at the royal courts of justice in london on friday .
you have no divine right with young people for them to listen to you , so you have to sell yourself - just like a referee clive thomas high sheriff is the oldest secular office in britain .
the office once held many of the powers now vested in lord lieutenants , high court judges , magistrates , local authorities , coroners and even the inland revenue .
but these days its only significant legal functions relate to the enforcement of high court writs .
but thomas , who retired from business two years ago , said he wants to find a way he can use the position to help young people , by giving them a sense of discipline .
he said his famous decision against brazil in a 1978 world cup match shows that he can be an example to youngsters of how to make tough choices and then stick to them .
clive ' the book ' thomas as world cup players knew him since hanging up his football referee boots , he has worked as a president of the former boys club of wales .
he said : i 'm thrilled to bits , it 's as good if not better than refereeing the world cup and the fa cup final .
" i want to be working high sheriff and work extremely closely with the voluntary sector in mid glamorgan .
" i 'm well versed with organisations that work with young people and i want to help them and that 's what i intend to do .
" i have been brought up to believe in discipline and a code of conduct .
that showed in my man-management skills on the field of play .
" i can use that to help the youngsters of today .
" young people need leadership , they need guidance - there are some that do n't want it , of course , but generally , you have to sell yourself .
" you have no divine right with young people for them to listen to you , so you have to sell yourself - just like a referee .

on the football field i never had any trouble , so there has got to be something right there .
" it may be that players accept your decision .
i 'm not saying they agree with it , but they accept it .
" what you then get is respect .
