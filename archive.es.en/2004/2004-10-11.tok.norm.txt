the admiration is mutual : in the coming months , germany is expected to step up its efforts to court chinese business in preparation for chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s planned visit to beijing in december .
france in the forefront but germany is n't the only one getting in on the limelight . at the moment , it is france that that 's wooing chinese corporate giants . french and chinese companies have already signed around 20 contracts worth over $ 4 billion -lrb- € 3.2 billion -rrb- in the lead-up to french president jacques chirac ’ s arrival in shanghai from beijing on monday .
the biggest orders have gone to airbus and the train-maker alstrom .
according to the associated press , chirac said his meetings with chinese president hu jintao had " emphasized our determination to further strengthen french-chinese relations .
our cooperative relationship will serve the world of the future . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french-designed tgv-a high speed train france is also lobbying for use of its tgv train on a high-speed line between beijing and shanghai , and chirac said he hoped china would buy the trains " before much longer . " jin canrong , professor of international relations at remin university of china , told dw-radio that europe 's role as important trading partner for his country continues to grow .
' the year of europe ' " the foreign ministry of china defined this year as ' the year of europe ' in chinese diplomacy .
early october last year , we issued the first policy statement on the region .
so this now occupies a very important position in china ’ s global strategy , and to improve china ’ s international standing , " he said .
jin also said beijing has used the eu as a model for its market and political policies .
" in the inner mind of the chinese elite , the model of europe always has a strong opinion , to -lrb- the -rrb- extent that china is rather market orientated economy ...
but the political nature of china , i think the so-called cooperative market model represented by germany and especially the scandinavian countries , is more attractive to the chinese elite . "
france ’ s trade success in china has not gone unnoticed by other european nations .
economists predict paris ’ assertive diplomacy could intensify the race by eu states to gain a foothold in the world ’ s most promising markets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder with indian prime minister manmohan singh the german strategy appears to be an attempt to strengthen its business ties to asia not only within china , but elsewhere .
on his recent diplomatic trip to asia , german chancellor gerhard schröder suggested that germany may also want to beef up investment elsewhere on the continent - for instance , in india .
france is behind germany in terms of business investment in china , which imports more than three times more from germany than from france .
how open is open ?
but paris has indicated that france has the potential to catch up with germany over the next decade .
for its part , there is a huge debate in china as to how far the communist country should open up its markets to europe , professor jin said .
" economic nationalists say china is -lrb- already -rrb- open too far .
china is a more open economy than our neighboring countries , such as the republic of korea , and japan .
the dominant opinion is that china should do more to continue to open its markets .
the market situation is very complicated so the opening process should be taken gradually .
we can not afford a dramatic change , " he noted .
but he said china has its own demands for the eu .
" first china wants market economy status .
the second thing china wants is a lifting of the arms sales embargo .
third , china hopes the eu will take a stronger position against the separation movement in taiwan . "
human rights concerns human rights groups fear that this increase in competition for business in china could lead to european countries turning a blind eye to beijing ’ s poor human rights record .
but jin said beijing is mindful of what the eu thinks on the matter .
he claimed the country is making some progress in improving its human rights record . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de catching the slow boat to china hamburg-based architects gerkan , marg und partner have won an international competition to build the national museum of china in beijing .

" but eu foreign ministers also voiced continued concern over a death sentence hanging over five bulgarian nurses and one palestinian medic accused by libyan authorities of infecting hundreds of children with the aids virus . " libya is among the first countries to dismantle voluntarily its weapons of mass destruction programs under international supervision through a transparent and cooperative process , " they said .
but at the same time they " invited libya to respond positively to the eu 's policy of engagement ...
in this light , it insisted that libya resolves remaining eu concerns , notably the case of the bulgarian and palestinian medical workers . " rome has for several months been pressing its eu counterparts to lift the arms embargo imposed on libya in 1986 , in order to be able to deliver equipment to tripoli to beef up its frontiers .
sanctions were imposed on libya because of its role in state-sponsored terrorism , including the 1988 lockerbie bombing . they were partially eased last year , paving the way for tripoli to compensate victims ' families .
the eu eased sanctions against tripoli in 1999 but maintained a series of restrictive measures on key products , notably military equipment , which libya has sought in order to keep a better check on its borders .
rome considers libya a major hub for clandestine migrants from african countries and has already signed cooperation agreements to help the libyan authorities combat the problem . " cooperation with libya on migration is essential and urgent , " said the eu ministers in a statement after their luxembourg talks .
the eu move comes amid a rapid loosening of sanctions and a thaw in relations since last year , when tripoli took responsibility for the lockerbie bombing and agreed to pay 2.7 billion dollars in compensation . ditching wmds the rapprochement then gathered steam with libya 's surprise decision in december to renounce and dismantle its weapons of mass destruction under us , british and international supervision .
last month us president george w. bush removed most economic sanctions on libya , clearing the way for huge compensation payments to the families of victims of the lockerbie bombing . the eu celebrated its restored ties with libya notably when moammar gadhafi visited brussels in april , his first trip to western europe in 15 years . the bulgarian nurses and a palestinian doctor were sentenced to death in may by a libyan court after a four-year trial which ended with their conviction on charges of knowingly injecting children with tainted blood products .
the eu - which bulgaria is hoping to join in 2007 - has protested the sentences and accused the libyan authorities of violating the rights of the accused . " we are very concerned about the situation -lrb- of -rrb- the bulgarian citizens , " said spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos .

the admiration is mutual : in the coming months , germany is expected to step up its efforts to court chinese business in preparation for chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s planned visit to beijing in december .
france in the forefront but germany is n't the only one getting in on the limelight . at the moment , it is france that that 's wooing chinese corporate giants . french and chinese companies have already signed around 20 contracts worth over $ 4 billion -lrb- € 3.2 billion -rrb- in the lead-up to french president jacques chirac ’ s arrival in shanghai from beijing on monday .
the biggest orders have gone to airbus and the train-maker alstrom .
according to the associated press , chirac said his meetings with chinese president hu jintao had " emphasized our determination to further strengthen french-chinese relations .
our cooperative relationship will serve the world of the future . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french-designed tgv-a high speed train france is also lobbying for use of its tgv train on a high-speed line between beijing and shanghai , and chirac said he hoped china would buy the trains " before much longer . " jin canrong , professor of international relations at remin university of china , told dw-radio that europe 's role as important trading partner for his country continues to grow .
' the year of europe ' " the foreign ministry of china defined this year as ' the year of europe ' in chinese diplomacy .
early october last year , we issued the first policy statement on the region .
so this now occupies a very important position in china ’ s global strategy , and to improve china ’ s international standing , " he said .
jin also said beijing has used the eu as a model for its market and political policies .
" in the inner mind of the chinese elite , the model of europe always has a strong opinion , to -lrb- the -rrb- extent that china is rather market orientated economy ...
but the political nature of china , i think the so-called cooperative market model represented by germany and especially the scandinavian countries , is more attractive to the chinese elite . "
france ’ s trade success in china has not gone unnoticed by other european nations .
economists predict paris ’ assertive diplomacy could intensify the race by eu states to gain a foothold in the world ’ s most promising markets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder with indian prime minister manmohan singh the german strategy appears to be an attempt to strengthen its business ties to asia not only within china , but elsewhere .
on his recent diplomatic trip to asia , german chancellor gerhard schröder suggested that germany may also want to beef up investment elsewhere on the continent - for instance , in india .
france is behind germany in terms of business investment in china , which imports more than three times more from germany than from france .
how open is open ?
but paris has indicated that france has the potential to catch up with germany over the next decade .
for its part , there is a huge debate in china as to how far the communist country should open up its markets to europe , professor jin said .
" economic nationalists say china is -lrb- already -rrb- open too far .
china is a more open economy than our neighboring countries , such as the republic of korea , and japan .
the dominant opinion is that china should do more to continue to open its markets .
the market situation is very complicated so the opening process should be taken gradually .
we can not afford a dramatic change , " he noted .
but he said china has its own demands for the eu .
" first china wants market economy status .
the second thing china wants is a lifting of the arms sales embargo .
third , china hopes the eu will take a stronger position against the separation movement in taiwan . "
human rights concerns human rights groups fear that this increase in competition for business in china could lead to european countries turning a blind eye to beijing ’ s poor human rights record .
but jin said beijing is mindful of what the eu thinks on the matter .
he claimed the country is making some progress in improving its human rights record . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de catching the slow boat to china hamburg-based architects gerkan , marg und partner have won an international competition to build the national museum of china in beijing .

" but eu foreign ministers also voiced continued concern over a death sentence hanging over five bulgarian nurses and one palestinian medic accused by libyan authorities of infecting hundreds of children with the aids virus . " libya is among the first countries to dismantle voluntarily its weapons of mass destruction programs under international supervision through a transparent and cooperative process , " they said .
but at the same time they " invited libya to respond positively to the eu 's policy of engagement ...
in this light , it insisted that libya resolves remaining eu concerns , notably the case of the bulgarian and palestinian medical workers . " rome has for several months been pressing its eu counterparts to lift the arms embargo imposed on libya in 1986 , in order to be able to deliver equipment to tripoli to beef up its frontiers .
sanctions were imposed on libya because of its role in state-sponsored terrorism , including the 1988 lockerbie bombing . they were partially eased last year , paving the way for tripoli to compensate victims ' families .
the eu eased sanctions against tripoli in 1999 but maintained a series of restrictive measures on key products , notably military equipment , which libya has sought in order to keep a better check on its borders .
rome considers libya a major hub for clandestine migrants from african countries and has already signed cooperation agreements to help the libyan authorities combat the problem . " cooperation with libya on migration is essential and urgent , " said the eu ministers in a statement after their luxembourg talks .
the eu move comes amid a rapid loosening of sanctions and a thaw in relations since last year , when tripoli took responsibility for the lockerbie bombing and agreed to pay 2.7 billion dollars in compensation . ditching wmds the rapprochement then gathered steam with libya 's surprise decision in december to renounce and dismantle its weapons of mass destruction under us , british and international supervision .
last month us president george w. bush removed most economic sanctions on libya , clearing the way for huge compensation payments to the families of victims of the lockerbie bombing . the eu celebrated its restored ties with libya notably when moammar gadhafi visited brussels in april , his first trip to western europe in 15 years . the bulgarian nurses and a palestinian doctor were sentenced to death in may by a libyan court after a four-year trial which ended with their conviction on charges of knowingly injecting children with tainted blood products .
the eu - which bulgaria is hoping to join in 2007 - has protested the sentences and accused the libyan authorities of violating the rights of the accused . " we are very concerned about the situation -lrb- of -rrb- the bulgarian citizens , " said spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos .

the cdu chief told german television station zdf that the cdu were considering taking their resistance to turkey 's membership of the eu to the streets and reiterated an earlier call for an alternative offer .
" i think we should consider having a petition for privileged partnership and against full membership , " merkel said , adding that the petition was likely to be carried out . the proposal for a petition against turkish membership was originally presented by michael glos , a senior politician in the cdu 's sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
last month , merkel sent a letter to conservative politicians across europe , calling for a united front against turkey 's bid to enter the eu .
among the letter 's recipients were italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin , dutch prime minister jan-peter balkenende and greek prime minister kostas karamanlis .
merkel recommends alternative to membership in the letter , merkel proposed offering turkey a privileged partnership with the european union rather than a full membership .
she praised turkey 's recent reforms but said the european union would be overwhelmed if it tried to take turkey in as a full member .
merkel and others have said turkey 's large and growing population , which might eclipse germany 's as early as 2020 , mean the poor , muslim country would place too much economic and cultural pressure on current eu states if it were admitted to the union .
despite merkel throwing her political weight behind the petition idea , there is no blanket support for the proposal .
the leader of the european parliament foreign affairs committee , christian democrat mep elmar brok told reuters that he " suffered stomach aches over the proposal . " other options a possibility , says brok bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elmar brok .
brok added that the european commission recommendation that turkey begin entry talks without a guaranteed outcome clearly implied that options other than accession were possible .
he noted the eu executive had said last week that whatever the result , turkey should remain " fully anchored in european structures . " " that 's a clear indication that it is considering other possibilities in the relationship , " he said .
however , volker beck , parliamentary leader of the greens , the junior partner in germany 's ruling coalition , called the initiative " foul " and " irresponsible " , according to the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . g erman chancellor gerhard schröder too said that for him the strategic and security policy arguments for ankara 's bid for eu membership were decisive .
if turkey 's reforms develop further , then " we could stabilize the land and create a link between european enlightenment and non-fundamentalist islam " , he told reuters deutschland . turkish ambassador calls petition " discrimination " the call for a petition comes as the turkish ambassador in berlin , mehmet ali irtemcelik , called for his 1.9 million compatriots living in germany to do more to integrate themselves in their adopted country .
" it is important for the image of turkey for our citizens to contribute to this land . "
irtemcelik criticized the call for the petition against turkey 's eu membership , calling it " discrimination .

but iceland and britain are in for praise . the european network for smoking prevention will release a report ranking the european union 's 25 member states , as well as iceland , norway and switzerland , in terms of their progress on a range of anti-smoking measures .
the report heavily criticizes germany for its weak implementation of the anti-smoking measures , which were recommended by the world bank .
bottom ten germany ranked among the lowest 10 countries in the study , which graded the nations on the basis of six specific criteria .
these included increased taxes on cigarettes , smoke-free policies in offices , bars and restaurants , anti-tobacco advertising , and clear warnings on cigarette packages .
the survey also rated access to treatment for nicotine addiction , and increased government " tobacco control " budgets , which go to fund other anti-smoking measures .
" germany is certainly lagging behind , " luk joossens , who coordinated the network 's report , told the reuters news agency .
" it 's in the lowest 10 countries , so it could clearly do better . "

for 16-19 year-olds , the figure is 45 percent .
the country is a smokers ' paradise , with cheap cigarettes available from machines on street corners and very few restrictions as to where it is or is not acceptable to light up .
in fact , the state of berlin broke new ground this year in implementing a ban on smoking in its schools .
it 's a move which other states are likely to follow , but for the time being children over the age of 16 can smoke in designated areas on school premises provided they present a letter of consent from their parents .
roll your own officially , cigarette sales in germany dropped by nine percent over the previous year in 2003 , and big brand producers have reported trailing sales .
but there is evidence that more smokers have been turning to rolling tobacco and cigars , which have been spared the higher taxation rates dumped on cigarettes over the past couple of years .

the cdu chief told german television station zdf that the cdu were considering taking their resistance to turkey 's membership of the eu to the streets and reiterated an earlier call for an alternative offer .
" i think we should consider having a petition for privileged partnership and against full membership , " merkel said , adding that the petition was likely to be carried out . the proposal for a petition against turkish membership was originally presented by michael glos , a senior politician in the cdu 's sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
last month , merkel sent a letter to conservative politicians across europe , calling for a united front against turkey 's bid to enter the eu .
among the letter 's recipients were italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin , dutch prime minister jan-peter balkenende and greek prime minister kostas karamanlis .
merkel recommends alternative to membership in the letter , merkel proposed offering turkey a privileged partnership with the european union rather than a full membership .

however , volker beck , parliamentary leader of the greens , the junior partner in germany 's ruling coalition , called the initiative " foul " and " irresponsible " , according to the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . g erman chancellor gerhard schröder too said that for him the strategic and security policy arguments for ankara 's bid for eu membership were decisive .
if turkey 's reforms develop further , then " we could stabilize the land and create a link between european enlightenment and non-fundamentalist islam " , he told reuters deutschland . turkish ambassador calls petition " discrimination " the call for a petition comes as the turkish ambassador in berlin , mehmet ali irtemcelik , called for his 1.9 million compatriots living in germany to do more to integrate themselves in their adopted country .

but opposition candidates have accused him of favoritism . german chancellor gerhard schröder arrived in afghanistan on monday amid criticisms that his whistle-stop tour , which will be spent predominantly in the company of hamid karzai , the man expected to be named the country 's first freely elected president , shows bias . schröder landed in kabul just two days after afghanistan 's first ever democratic elections on saturday and his itinerary for the six hour tour , apart from visits to schools supported by german charities and institutions and german troops serving with the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , is dominated by talks with the us- and pakistan-blessed interim afghan president .
there are no plans to meet with any other of the nominees or politicians involved in the weekend 's historic vote . it was intended to be a visit to show german support for the democratization and stabilization efforts of a land that has suffered almost 20 years of civil war and the rule of the radical taliban regime .
instead , schröder found himself in the firing line of critics which claim his visit was evidence of the favoritism offered to karzai by western leaders . germany has decided winner , says candidate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while karzai is expected to make history by becoming afghanistan 's first democratically president when the official announcement comes on october 30 , one opposition candidate , mohammad mahfuz nedahi , told reporters that schröder 's agenda shows that germany has already decided how the vote has gone and has shown its true colors .
" germany supports us policy one hundred percent , " he said on sunday night . another , abdul latif pedram , echoed nedahi 's complaints saying that europe should been seen as supporting the democratic process and not a single nominee .
a candidate who did not want to be named added that schröder should not have come to kabul " in such a sensitive situation . "
others have expressed confusion over schröder 's timing as the election is over and his support now can achieve little . schröder lauds courageous vote despite the criticism , schröder has said that the peaceful process of voting and the high voter turnout suggests that the people of afghanistan have shown great courage in pursuing democracy and stability . as the debate rages over whether irregularities in the election had undermined the process , afghan election officials agreed on sunday to create an independent commission to probe opposition charges of fraud in the presidential poll . threat of boycott averted by probe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : originally , all 15 challengers announced they would boycott the outcome in the immediate aftermath of revelations that supposedly indelible ink used to mark voters ' thumbs in some polling stations could be rubbed off , allowing some people to vote more than once . however two candidates have since backed off , saying they wanted a commission to rule on whether the voting was fair and indicating they would accept its decision . " there is going to be an independent commission made to investigate it , " electoral director farooq wardak said in a statement .
" there could be mistakes ; we are just human beings .
my colleagues might have made a mistake . " an american delegation observing the election showed karzai with a clear majority of votes and his principal challenger , yonus qanooni , a former cabinet minister , running a distant second .
karzai needs a majority to avoid a runoff vote . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : a flawed success opposition candidates in afghanistan 's presidential elections have called for a repeat because of irregularities .

but iceland and britain are in for praise . the european network for smoking prevention will release a report ranking the european union 's 25 member states , as well as iceland , norway and switzerland , in terms of their progress on a range of anti-smoking measures .
the report heavily criticizes germany for its weak implementation of the anti-smoking measures , which were recommended by the world bank .
bottom ten germany ranked among the lowest 10 countries in the study , which graded the nations on the basis of six specific criteria .
these included increased taxes on cigarettes , smoke-free policies in offices , bars and restaurants , anti-tobacco advertising , and clear warnings on cigarette packages .
the survey also rated access to treatment for nicotine addiction , and increased government " tobacco control " budgets , which go to fund other anti-smoking measures .
" germany is certainly lagging behind , " luk joossens , who coordinated the network 's report , told the reuters news agency .
" it 's in the lowest 10 countries , so it could clearly do better . "
cheap smokes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoker with cigarette luxembourg and the czech republic are also set to be criticized for keeping cigarette prices very cheap in relation to wages .
on the other hand , iceland won top honors , having implemented almost all of the world bank measures .
britain also scored high , because it makes cigarettes so expensive with tax .
world bank research shows that raising prices by 10 percent cuts cigarette consumption in a wealthy country by four percent .
a package of marlboro cigarettes is more than twice as expensive in britain than in luxembourg , data show .
in march , ireland became the first country to ban smoking in restaurants , bars and pubs .
norway and malta have since instituted similar bans and incoming european health commissioner markos kyprianou last week urged all eu governments to follow ireland 's example within five years .
more young smokers the study also examined smoking rates over the last two decades .
there has been an overall decline in adult smoking in europe , joossens told reuters , but smoking among young people has not fallen over the last 10 years in most regions .
in germany , tobacco consumption among 12-15 year-olds almost doubled over the past ten years , with some 21 percent of girls and 18 percent of boys in the age group smoking regularly .
for 16-19 year-olds , the figure is 45 percent .
the country is a smokers ' paradise , with cheap cigarettes available from machines on street corners and very few restrictions as to where it is or is not acceptable to light up .
in fact , the state of berlin broke new ground this year in implementing a ban on smoking in its schools .
it 's a move which other states are likely to follow , but for the time being children over the age of 16 can smoke in designated areas on school premises provided they present a letter of consent from their parents .
roll your own officially , cigarette sales in germany dropped by nine percent over the previous year in 2003 , and big brand producers have reported trailing sales .
but there is evidence that more smokers have been turning to rolling tobacco and cigars , which have been spared the higher taxation rates dumped on cigarettes over the past couple of years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cartons of smuggled cigarettes there is also concern that more and more smokers are turning to smuggled , black market and cheaper tobacco -lrb- photo -rrb- to feed their habit .
eu commission attempts to outlaw smoking in bars and restaurants , or introducing smoke-free workplaces , has met with rigid resistance in germany .

" but eu foreign ministers also voiced continued concern over a death sentence hanging over five bulgarian nurses and one palestinian medic accused by libyan authorities of infecting hundreds of children with the aids virus . " libya is among the first countries to dismantle voluntarily its weapons of mass destruction programs under international supervision through a transparent and cooperative process , " they said .
but at the same time they " invited libya to respond positively to the eu 's policy of engagement ...
in this light , it insisted that libya resolves remaining eu concerns , notably the case of the bulgarian and palestinian medical workers . " rome has for several months been pressing its eu counterparts to lift the arms embargo imposed on libya in 1986 , in order to be able to deliver equipment to tripoli to beef up its frontiers .
sanctions were imposed on libya because of its role in state-sponsored terrorism , including the 1988 lockerbie bombing . they were partially eased last year , paving the way for tripoli to compensate victims ' families .
the eu eased sanctions against tripoli in 1999 but maintained a series of restrictive measures on key products , notably military equipment , which libya has sought in order to keep a better check on its borders .
rome considers libya a major hub for clandestine migrants from african countries and has already signed cooperation agreements to help the libyan authorities combat the problem . " cooperation with libya on migration is essential and urgent , " said the eu ministers in a statement after their luxembourg talks .
the eu move comes amid a rapid loosening of sanctions and a thaw in relations since last year , when tripoli took responsibility for the lockerbie bombing and agreed to pay 2.7 billion dollars in compensation . ditching wmds the rapprochement then gathered steam with libya 's surprise decision in december to renounce and dismantle its weapons of mass destruction under us , british and international supervision .
last month us president george w. bush removed most economic sanctions on libya , clearing the way for huge compensation payments to the families of victims of the lockerbie bombing . the eu celebrated its restored ties with libya notably when moammar gadhafi visited brussels in april , his first trip to western europe in 15 years . the bulgarian nurses and a palestinian doctor were sentenced to death in may by a libyan court after a four-year trial which ended with their conviction on charges of knowingly injecting children with tainted blood products .
the eu - which bulgaria is hoping to join in 2007 - has protested the sentences and accused the libyan authorities of violating the rights of the accused . " we are very concerned about the situation -lrb- of -rrb- the bulgarian citizens , " said spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos .
but overall the eu tone monday was positive , with a ministerial statement including an expression of " deep sympathy with those infected with hiv " in the tainted blood tragedy . afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu to lift arms embargo against libya the european union on wednesday agreed in principle to lift an arms embargo on libya after pressure from italy , which wants the libyan government to help crack down on illegal immigration to the eu .

after progress in wind and solar power , germans are looking to find a replacement for gasoline . last week , oil prices reached an all time high , breaking the $ 50 per barrel mark .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 11.10.2004 eu lifts arms ban against libya großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian pm berlusconi has already forged closer ties with gadhafi the european union agreed monday to lift an 18-year-old arms embargo on libya , welcoming the country 's renunciation of weapons of mass destruction and movement towards " responsible government . " but eu foreign ministers also voiced continued concern over a death sentence hanging over five bulgarian nurses and one palestinian medic accused by libyan authorities of infecting hundreds of children with the aids virus . " libya is among the first countries to dismantle voluntarily its weapons of mass destruction programs under international supervision through a transparent and cooperative process , " they said .
but at the same time they " invited libya to respond positively to the eu 's policy of engagement ...
in this light , it insisted that libya resolves remaining eu concerns , notably the case of the bulgarian and palestinian medical workers . " rome has for several months been pressing its eu counterparts to lift the arms embargo imposed on libya in 1986 , in order to be able to deliver equipment to tripoli to beef up its frontiers .
sanctions were imposed on libya because of its role in state-sponsored terrorism , including the 1988 lockerbie bombing . they were partially eased last year , paving the way for tripoli to compensate victims ' families .
the eu eased sanctions against tripoli in 1999 but maintained a series of restrictive measures on key products , notably military equipment , which libya has sought in order to keep a better check on its borders .
rome considers libya a major hub for clandestine migrants from african countries and has already signed cooperation agreements to help the libyan authorities combat the problem . " cooperation with libya on migration is essential and urgent , " said the eu ministers in a statement after their luxembourg talks .
the eu move comes amid a rapid loosening of sanctions and a thaw in relations since last year , when tripoli took responsibility for the lockerbie bombing and agreed to pay 2.7 billion dollars in compensation . ditching wmds the rapprochement then gathered steam with libya 's surprise decision in december to renounce and dismantle its weapons of mass destruction under us , british and international supervision .
last month us president george w. bush removed most economic sanctions on libya , clearing the way for huge compensation payments to the families of victims of the lockerbie bombing . the eu celebrated its restored ties with libya notably when moammar gadhafi visited brussels in april , his first trip to western europe in 15 years . the bulgarian nurses and a palestinian doctor were sentenced to death in may by a libyan court after a four-year trial which ended with their conviction on charges of knowingly injecting children with tainted blood products .
the eu - which bulgaria is hoping to join in 2007 - has protested the sentences and accused the libyan authorities of violating the rights of the accused . " we are very concerned about the situation -lrb- of -rrb- the bulgarian citizens , " said spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos .
but overall the eu tone monday was positive , with a ministerial statement including an expression of " deep sympathy with those infected with hiv " in the tainted blood tragedy . afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu to lift arms embargo against libya the european union on wednesday agreed in principle to lift an arms embargo on libya after pressure from italy , which wants the libyan government to help crack down on illegal immigration to the eu .

the admiration is mutual : in the coming months , germany is expected to step up its efforts to court chinese business in preparation for chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s planned visit to beijing in december .
france in the forefront but germany is n't the only one getting in on the limelight . at the moment , it is france that that 's wooing chinese corporate giants . french and chinese companies have already signed around 20 contracts worth over $ 4 billion -lrb- € 3.2 billion -rrb- in the lead-up to french president jacques chirac ’ s arrival in shanghai from beijing on monday .
the biggest orders have gone to airbus and the train-maker alstrom .
according to the associated press , chirac said his meetings with chinese president hu jintao had " emphasized our determination to further strengthen french-chinese relations .
our cooperative relationship will serve the world of the future . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french-designed tgv-a high speed train france is also lobbying for use of its tgv train on a high-speed line between beijing and shanghai , and chirac said he hoped china would buy the trains " before much longer . " jin canrong , professor of international relations at remin university of china , told dw-radio that europe 's role as important trading partner for his country continues to grow .
' the year of europe ' " the foreign ministry of china defined this year as ' the year of europe ' in chinese diplomacy .
early october last year , we issued the first policy statement on the region .
so this now occupies a very important position in china ’ s global strategy , and to improve china ’ s international standing , " he said .
jin also said beijing has used the eu as a model for its market and political policies .
" in the inner mind of the chinese elite , the model of europe always has a strong opinion , to -lrb- the -rrb- extent that china is rather market orientated economy ...
but the political nature of china , i think the so-called cooperative market model represented by germany and especially the scandinavian countries , is more attractive to the chinese elite . "
france ’ s trade success in china has not gone unnoticed by other european nations .
economists predict paris ’ assertive diplomacy could intensify the race by eu states to gain a foothold in the world ’ s most promising markets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder with indian prime minister manmohan singh the german strategy appears to be an attempt to strengthen its business ties to asia not only within china , but elsewhere .
on his recent diplomatic trip to asia , german chancellor gerhard schröder suggested that germany may also want to beef up investment elsewhere on the continent - for instance , in india .
france is behind germany in terms of business investment in china , which imports more than three times more from germany than from france .
how open is open ?
but paris has indicated that france has the potential to catch up with germany over the next decade .
for its part , there is a huge debate in china as to how far the communist country should open up its markets to europe , professor jin said .
" economic nationalists say china is -lrb- already -rrb- open too far .
china is a more open economy than our neighboring countries , such as the republic of korea , and japan .
the dominant opinion is that china should do more to continue to open its markets .
the market situation is very complicated so the opening process should be taken gradually .
we can not afford a dramatic change , " he noted .
but he said china has its own demands for the eu .
" first china wants market economy status .
the second thing china wants is a lifting of the arms sales embargo .
third , china hopes the eu will take a stronger position against the separation movement in taiwan . "
human rights concerns human rights groups fear that this increase in competition for business in china could lead to european countries turning a blind eye to beijing ’ s poor human rights record .
but jin said beijing is mindful of what the eu thinks on the matter .
he claimed the country is making some progress in improving its human rights record . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de catching the slow boat to china hamburg-based architects gerkan , marg und partner have won an international competition to build the national museum of china in beijing .

" jin canrong , professor of international relations at remin university of china , told dw-radio that europe 's role as important trading partner for his country continues to grow .
' the year of europe ' " the foreign ministry of china defined this year as ' the year of europe ' in chinese diplomacy .
early october last year , we issued the first policy statement on the region .
so this now occupies a very important position in china ’ s global strategy , and to improve china ’ s international standing , " he said .
jin also said beijing has used the eu as a model for its market and political policies .
" in the inner mind of the chinese elite , the model of europe always has a strong opinion , to -lrb- the -rrb- extent that china is rather market orientated economy ...
but the political nature of china , i think the so-called cooperative market model represented by germany and especially the scandinavian countries , is more attractive to the chinese elite . "
france ’ s trade success in china has not gone unnoticed by other european nations .
economists predict paris ’ assertive diplomacy could intensify the race by eu states to gain a foothold in the world ’ s most promising markets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder with indian prime minister manmohan singh the german strategy appears to be an attempt to strengthen its business ties to asia not only within china , but elsewhere .
on his recent diplomatic trip to asia , german chancellor gerhard schröder suggested that germany may also want to beef up investment elsewhere on the continent - for instance , in india .
france is behind germany in terms of business investment in china , which imports more than three times more from germany than from france .
how open is open ?
but paris has indicated that france has the potential to catch up with germany over the next decade .
for its part , there is a huge debate in china as to how far the communist country should open up its markets to europe , professor jin said .
" economic nationalists say china is -lrb- already -rrb- open too far .
china is a more open economy than our neighboring countries , such as the republic of korea , and japan .
the dominant opinion is that china should do more to continue to open its markets .
the market situation is very complicated so the opening process should be taken gradually .
we can not afford a dramatic change , " he noted .
but he said china has its own demands for the eu .
" first china wants market economy status .
the second thing china wants is a lifting of the arms sales embargo .
third , china hopes the eu will take a stronger position against the separation movement in taiwan . "
human rights concerns human rights groups fear that this increase in competition for business in china could lead to european countries turning a blind eye to beijing ’ s poor human rights record .
but jin said beijing is mindful of what the eu thinks on the matter .
he claimed the country is making some progress in improving its human rights record . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de catching the slow boat to china hamburg-based architects gerkan , marg und partner have won an international competition to build the national museum of china in beijing .

the cdu chief told german television station zdf that the cdu were considering taking their resistance to turkey 's membership of the eu to the streets and reiterated an earlier call for an alternative offer .
" i think we should consider having a petition for privileged partnership and against full membership , " merkel said , adding that the petition was likely to be carried out . the proposal for a petition against turkish membership was originally presented by michael glos , a senior politician in the cdu 's sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
last month , merkel sent a letter to conservative politicians across europe , calling for a united front against turkey 's bid to enter the eu .
among the letter 's recipients were italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin , dutch prime minister jan-peter balkenende and greek prime minister kostas karamanlis .
merkel recommends alternative to membership in the letter , merkel proposed offering turkey a privileged partnership with the european union rather than a full membership .
she praised turkey 's recent reforms but said the european union would be overwhelmed if it tried to take turkey in as a full member .
merkel and others have said turkey 's large and growing population , which might eclipse germany 's as early as 2020 , mean the poor , muslim country would place too much economic and cultural pressure on current eu states if it were admitted to the union .
despite merkel throwing her political weight behind the petition idea , there is no blanket support for the proposal .
the leader of the european parliament foreign affairs committee , christian democrat mep elmar brok told reuters that he " suffered stomach aches over the proposal . " other options a possibility , says brok bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elmar brok .
brok added that the european commission recommendation that turkey begin entry talks without a guaranteed outcome clearly implied that options other than accession were possible .
he noted the eu executive had said last week that whatever the result , turkey should remain " fully anchored in european structures . " " that 's a clear indication that it is considering other possibilities in the relationship , " he said .
however , volker beck , parliamentary leader of the greens , the junior partner in germany 's ruling coalition , called the initiative " foul " and " irresponsible " , according to the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . g erman chancellor gerhard schröder too said that for him the strategic and security policy arguments for ankara 's bid for eu membership were decisive .
if turkey 's reforms develop further , then " we could stabilize the land and create a link between european enlightenment and non-fundamentalist islam " , he told reuters deutschland . turkish ambassador calls petition " discrimination " the call for a petition comes as the turkish ambassador in berlin , mehmet ali irtemcelik , called for his 1.9 million compatriots living in germany to do more to integrate themselves in their adopted country .

the admiration is mutual : in the coming months , germany is expected to step up its efforts to court chinese business in preparation for chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s planned visit to beijing in december .
france in the forefront but germany is n't the only one getting in on the limelight . at the moment , it is france that that 's wooing chinese corporate giants . french and chinese companies have already signed around 20 contracts worth over $ 4 billion -lrb- € 3.2 billion -rrb- in the lead-up to french president jacques chirac ’ s arrival in shanghai from beijing on monday .
the biggest orders have gone to airbus and the train-maker alstrom .

but opposition candidates have accused him of favoritism . german chancellor gerhard schröder arrived in afghanistan on monday amid criticisms that his whistle-stop tour , which will be spent predominantly in the company of hamid karzai , the man expected to be named the country 's first freely elected president , shows bias . schröder landed in kabul just two days after afghanistan 's first ever democratic elections on saturday and his itinerary for the six hour tour , apart from visits to schools supported by german charities and institutions and german troops serving with the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , is dominated by talks with the us- and pakistan-blessed interim afghan president .
there are no plans to meet with any other of the nominees or politicians involved in the weekend 's historic vote . it was intended to be a visit to show german support for the democratization and stabilization efforts of a land that has suffered almost 20 years of civil war and the rule of the radical taliban regime .
instead , schröder found himself in the firing line of critics which claim his visit was evidence of the favoritism offered to karzai by western leaders . germany has decided winner , says candidate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while karzai is expected to make history by becoming afghanistan 's first democratically president when the official announcement comes on october 30 , one opposition candidate , mohammad mahfuz nedahi , told reporters that schröder 's agenda shows that germany has already decided how the vote has gone and has shown its true colors .
" germany supports us policy one hundred percent , " he said on sunday night . another , abdul latif pedram , echoed nedahi 's complaints saying that europe should been seen as supporting the democratic process and not a single nominee .
a candidate who did not want to be named added that schröder should not have come to kabul " in such a sensitive situation . "
others have expressed confusion over schröder 's timing as the election is over and his support now can achieve little . schröder lauds courageous vote despite the criticism , schröder has said that the peaceful process of voting and the high voter turnout suggests that the people of afghanistan have shown great courage in pursuing democracy and stability . as the debate rages over whether irregularities in the election had undermined the process , afghan election officials agreed on sunday to create an independent commission to probe opposition charges of fraud in the presidential poll . threat of boycott averted by probe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : originally , all 15 challengers announced they would boycott the outcome in the immediate aftermath of revelations that supposedly indelible ink used to mark voters ' thumbs in some polling stations could be rubbed off , allowing some people to vote more than once . however two candidates have since backed off , saying they wanted a commission to rule on whether the voting was fair and indicating they would accept its decision . " there is going to be an independent commission made to investigate it , " electoral director farooq wardak said in a statement .
" there could be mistakes ; we are just human beings .
my colleagues might have made a mistake . " an american delegation observing the election showed karzai with a clear majority of votes and his principal challenger , yonus qanooni , a former cabinet minister , running a distant second .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 11.10.2004 eu lifts arms ban against libya großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian pm berlusconi has already forged closer ties with gadhafi the european union agreed monday to lift an 18-year-old arms embargo on libya , welcoming the country 's renunciation of weapons of mass destruction and movement towards " responsible government . " but eu foreign ministers also voiced continued concern over a death sentence hanging over five bulgarian nurses and one palestinian medic accused by libyan authorities of infecting hundreds of children with the aids virus . " libya is among the first countries to dismantle voluntarily its weapons of mass destruction programs under international supervision through a transparent and cooperative process , " they said .
but at the same time they " invited libya to respond positively to the eu 's policy of engagement ...
in this light , it insisted that libya resolves remaining eu concerns , notably the case of the bulgarian and palestinian medical workers . " rome has for several months been pressing its eu counterparts to lift the arms embargo imposed on libya in 1986 , in order to be able to deliver equipment to tripoli to beef up its frontiers .
sanctions were imposed on libya because of its role in state-sponsored terrorism , including the 1988 lockerbie bombing . they were partially eased last year , paving the way for tripoli to compensate victims ' families .
the eu eased sanctions against tripoli in 1999 but maintained a series of restrictive measures on key products , notably military equipment , which libya has sought in order to keep a better check on its borders .
rome considers libya a major hub for clandestine migrants from african countries and has already signed cooperation agreements to help the libyan authorities combat the problem . " cooperation with libya on migration is essential and urgent , " said the eu ministers in a statement after their luxembourg talks .
the eu move comes amid a rapid loosening of sanctions and a thaw in relations since last year , when tripoli took responsibility for the lockerbie bombing and agreed to pay 2.7 billion dollars in compensation . ditching wmds the rapprochement then gathered steam with libya 's surprise decision in december to renounce and dismantle its weapons of mass destruction under us , british and international supervision .
last month us president george w. bush removed most economic sanctions on libya , clearing the way for huge compensation payments to the families of victims of the lockerbie bombing . the eu celebrated its restored ties with libya notably when moammar gadhafi visited brussels in april , his first trip to western europe in 15 years . the bulgarian nurses and a palestinian doctor were sentenced to death in may by a libyan court after a four-year trial which ended with their conviction on charges of knowingly injecting children with tainted blood products .
the eu - which bulgaria is hoping to join in 2007 - has protested the sentences and accused the libyan authorities of violating the rights of the accused . " we are very concerned about the situation -lrb- of -rrb- the bulgarian citizens , " said spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos .
but overall the eu tone monday was positive , with a ministerial statement including an expression of " deep sympathy with those infected with hiv " in the tainted blood tragedy . afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu to lift arms embargo against libya the european union on wednesday agreed in principle to lift an arms embargo on libya after pressure from italy , which wants the libyan government to help crack down on illegal immigration to the eu .
-lrb- sept .
22 , 2004 -rrb- italy and libya tackle illegal immigration italian prime minister silvio berlusconi met libyan leader moammar gadhafi on wednesday for talks on stemming the tide of illegal immigrants using the north african country as a transit point .

others have expressed confusion over schröder 's timing as the election is over and his support now can achieve little . schröder lauds courageous vote despite the criticism , schröder has said that the peaceful process of voting and the high voter turnout suggests that the people of afghanistan have shown great courage in pursuing democracy and stability . as the debate rages over whether irregularities in the election had undermined the process , afghan election officials agreed on sunday to create an independent commission to probe opposition charges of fraud in the presidential poll . threat of boycott averted by probe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : originally , all 15 challengers announced they would boycott the outcome in the immediate aftermath of revelations that supposedly indelible ink used to mark voters ' thumbs in some polling stations could be rubbed off , allowing some people to vote more than once . however two candidates have since backed off , saying they wanted a commission to rule on whether the voting was fair and indicating they would accept its decision .

the report heavily criticizes germany for its weak implementation of the anti-smoking measures , which were recommended by the world bank .

these included increased taxes on cigarettes , smoke-free policies in offices , bars and restaurants , anti-tobacco advertising , and clear warnings on cigarette packages .
the survey also rated access to treatment for nicotine addiction , and increased government " tobacco control " budgets , which go to fund other anti-smoking measures .

for 16-19 year-olds , the figure is 45 percent .
the country is a smokers ' paradise , with cheap cigarettes available from machines on street corners and very few restrictions as to where it is or is not acceptable to light up .
in fact , the state of berlin broke new ground this year in implementing a ban on smoking in its schools .

the report heavily criticizes germany for its weak implementation of the anti-smoking measures , which were recommended by the world bank .
bottom ten germany ranked among the lowest 10 countries in the study , which graded the nations on the basis of six specific criteria .
these included increased taxes on cigarettes , smoke-free policies in offices , bars and restaurants , anti-tobacco advertising , and clear warnings on cigarette packages .
the survey also rated access to treatment for nicotine addiction , and increased government " tobacco control " budgets , which go to fund other anti-smoking measures .
" germany is certainly lagging behind , " luk joossens , who coordinated the network 's report , told the reuters news agency .
" it 's in the lowest 10 countries , so it could clearly do better . "

for 16-19 year-olds , the figure is 45 percent .
the country is a smokers ' paradise , with cheap cigarettes available from machines on street corners and very few restrictions as to where it is or is not acceptable to light up .
in fact , the state of berlin broke new ground this year in implementing a ban on smoking in its schools .
it 's a move which other states are likely to follow , but for the time being children over the age of 16 can smoke in designated areas on school premises provided they present a letter of consent from their parents .
roll your own officially , cigarette sales in germany dropped by nine percent over the previous year in 2003 , and big brand producers have reported trailing sales .

the cdu chief told german television station zdf that the cdu were considering taking their resistance to turkey 's membership of the eu to the streets and reiterated an earlier call for an alternative offer .
" i think we should consider having a petition for privileged partnership and against full membership , " merkel said , adding that the petition was likely to be carried out . the proposal for a petition against turkish membership was originally presented by michael glos , a senior politician in the cdu 's sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
last month , merkel sent a letter to conservative politicians across europe , calling for a united front against turkey 's bid to enter the eu .
among the letter 's recipients were italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin , dutch prime minister jan-peter balkenende and greek prime minister kostas karamanlis .
merkel recommends alternative to membership in the letter , merkel proposed offering turkey a privileged partnership with the european union rather than a full membership .
she praised turkey 's recent reforms but said the european union would be overwhelmed if it tried to take turkey in as a full member .
merkel and others have said turkey 's large and growing population , which might eclipse germany 's as early as 2020 , mean the poor , muslim country would place too much economic and cultural pressure on current eu states if it were admitted to the union .
despite merkel throwing her political weight behind the petition idea , there is no blanket support for the proposal .
the leader of the european parliament foreign affairs committee , christian democrat mep elmar brok told reuters that he " suffered stomach aches over the proposal . " other options a possibility , says brok bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elmar brok .
brok added that the european commission recommendation that turkey begin entry talks without a guaranteed outcome clearly implied that options other than accession were possible .
he noted the eu executive had said last week that whatever the result , turkey should remain " fully anchored in european structures . " " that 's a clear indication that it is considering other possibilities in the relationship , " he said .
however , volker beck , parliamentary leader of the greens , the junior partner in germany 's ruling coalition , called the initiative " foul " and " irresponsible " , according to the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . g erman chancellor gerhard schröder too said that for him the strategic and security policy arguments for ankara 's bid for eu membership were decisive .
if turkey 's reforms develop further , then " we could stabilize the land and create a link between european enlightenment and non-fundamentalist islam " , he told reuters deutschland . turkish ambassador calls petition " discrimination " the call for a petition comes as the turkish ambassador in berlin , mehmet ali irtemcelik , called for his 1.9 million compatriots living in germany to do more to integrate themselves in their adopted country .
" it is important for the image of turkey for our citizens to contribute to this land . "
irtemcelik criticized the call for the petition against turkey 's eu membership , calling it " discrimination .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 11.10.2004 france moves to strengthen china ties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a welcome for chirac near a mao statue in shanghai german investment in china is huge , but it could now be facing competition from france as paris hopes to consolidate its business foothold in the vast asian economy with a visit by president jacques chirac . beijing appears to be keen on strengthening its relationship with the european union and the chinese authorities have even cited german and scandinavian social and business practices as a sort of working model for the future of chinese business .
the admiration is mutual : in the coming months , germany is expected to step up its efforts to court chinese business in preparation for chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s planned visit to beijing in december .
france in the forefront but germany is n't the only one getting in on the limelight . at the moment , it is france that that 's wooing chinese corporate giants . french and chinese companies have already signed around 20 contracts worth over $ 4 billion -lrb- € 3.2 billion -rrb- in the lead-up to french president jacques chirac ’ s arrival in shanghai from beijing on monday .
the biggest orders have gone to airbus and the train-maker alstrom .
according to the associated press , chirac said his meetings with chinese president hu jintao had " emphasized our determination to further strengthen french-chinese relations .
our cooperative relationship will serve the world of the future . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french-designed tgv-a high speed train france is also lobbying for use of its tgv train on a high-speed line between beijing and shanghai , and chirac said he hoped china would buy the trains " before much longer . " jin canrong , professor of international relations at remin university of china , told dw-radio that europe 's role as important trading partner for his country continues to grow .
' the year of europe ' " the foreign ministry of china defined this year as ' the year of europe ' in chinese diplomacy .
early october last year , we issued the first policy statement on the region .
so this now occupies a very important position in china ’ s global strategy , and to improve china ’ s international standing , " he said .
jin also said beijing has used the eu as a model for its market and political policies .
" in the inner mind of the chinese elite , the model of europe always has a strong opinion , to -lrb- the -rrb- extent that china is rather market orientated economy ...
but the political nature of china , i think the so-called cooperative market model represented by germany and especially the scandinavian countries , is more attractive to the chinese elite . "
france ’ s trade success in china has not gone unnoticed by other european nations .
economists predict paris ’ assertive diplomacy could intensify the race by eu states to gain a foothold in the world ’ s most promising markets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder with indian prime minister manmohan singh the german strategy appears to be an attempt to strengthen its business ties to asia not only within china , but elsewhere .
on his recent diplomatic trip to asia , german chancellor gerhard schröder suggested that germany may also want to beef up investment elsewhere on the continent - for instance , in india .
france is behind germany in terms of business investment in china , which imports more than three times more from germany than from france .
how open is open ?
but paris has indicated that france has the potential to catch up with germany over the next decade .
for its part , there is a huge debate in china as to how far the communist country should open up its markets to europe , professor jin said .
" economic nationalists say china is -lrb- already -rrb- open too far .
china is a more open economy than our neighboring countries , such as the republic of korea , and japan .
the dominant opinion is that china should do more to continue to open its markets .
the market situation is very complicated so the opening process should be taken gradually .
we can not afford a dramatic change , " he noted .
but he said china has its own demands for the eu .
" first china wants market economy status .
the second thing china wants is a lifting of the arms sales embargo .
third , china hopes the eu will take a stronger position against the separation movement in taiwan . "
human rights concerns human rights groups fear that this increase in competition for business in china could lead to european countries turning a blind eye to beijing ’ s poor human rights record .
but jin said beijing is mindful of what the eu thinks on the matter .
he claimed the country is making some progress in improving its human rights record . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de catching the slow boat to china hamburg-based architects gerkan , marg und partner have won an international competition to build the national museum of china in beijing .

" in the inner mind of the chinese elite , the model of europe always has a strong opinion , to -lrb- the -rrb- extent that china is rather market orientated economy ...

" economic nationalists say china is -lrb- already -rrb- open too far .
china is a more open economy than our neighboring countries , such as the republic of korea , and japan .
the dominant opinion is that china should do more to continue to open its markets .
the market situation is very complicated so the opening process should be taken gradually .
we can not afford a dramatic change , " he noted .

the cdu chief told german television station zdf that the cdu were considering taking their resistance to turkey 's membership of the eu to the streets and reiterated an earlier call for an alternative offer .
" i think we should consider having a petition for privileged partnership and against full membership , " merkel said , adding that the petition was likely to be carried out . the proposal for a petition against turkish membership was originally presented by michael glos , a senior politician in the cdu 's sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
last month , merkel sent a letter to conservative politicians across europe , calling for a united front against turkey 's bid to enter the eu .
among the letter 's recipients were italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin , dutch prime minister jan-peter balkenende and greek prime minister kostas karamanlis .
merkel recommends alternative to membership in the letter , merkel proposed offering turkey a privileged partnership with the european union rather than a full membership .
she praised turkey 's recent reforms but said the european union would be overwhelmed if it tried to take turkey in as a full member .

despite merkel throwing her political weight behind the petition idea , there is no blanket support for the proposal .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 11.10.2004 eu lifts arms ban against libya großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian pm berlusconi has already forged closer ties with gadhafi the european union agreed monday to lift an 18-year-old arms embargo on libya , welcoming the country 's renunciation of weapons of mass destruction and movement towards " responsible government . " but eu foreign ministers also voiced continued concern over a death sentence hanging over five bulgarian nurses and one palestinian medic accused by libyan authorities of infecting hundreds of children with the aids virus . " libya is among the first countries to dismantle voluntarily its weapons of mass destruction programs under international supervision through a transparent and cooperative process , " they said .
but at the same time they " invited libya to respond positively to the eu 's policy of engagement ...
in this light , it insisted that libya resolves remaining eu concerns , notably the case of the bulgarian and palestinian medical workers . " rome has for several months been pressing its eu counterparts to lift the arms embargo imposed on libya in 1986 , in order to be able to deliver equipment to tripoli to beef up its frontiers .
sanctions were imposed on libya because of its role in state-sponsored terrorism , including the 1988 lockerbie bombing . they were partially eased last year , paving the way for tripoli to compensate victims ' families .
the eu eased sanctions against tripoli in 1999 but maintained a series of restrictive measures on key products , notably military equipment , which libya has sought in order to keep a better check on its borders .
rome considers libya a major hub for clandestine migrants from african countries and has already signed cooperation agreements to help the libyan authorities combat the problem . " cooperation with libya on migration is essential and urgent , " said the eu ministers in a statement after their luxembourg talks .
the eu move comes amid a rapid loosening of sanctions and a thaw in relations since last year , when tripoli took responsibility for the lockerbie bombing and agreed to pay 2.7 billion dollars in compensation . ditching wmds the rapprochement then gathered steam with libya 's surprise decision in december to renounce and dismantle its weapons of mass destruction under us , british and international supervision .
last month us president george w. bush removed most economic sanctions on libya , clearing the way for huge compensation payments to the families of victims of the lockerbie bombing . the eu celebrated its restored ties with libya notably when moammar gadhafi visited brussels in april , his first trip to western europe in 15 years . the bulgarian nurses and a palestinian doctor were sentenced to death in may by a libyan court after a four-year trial which ended with their conviction on charges of knowingly injecting children with tainted blood products .
the eu - which bulgaria is hoping to join in 2007 - has protested the sentences and accused the libyan authorities of violating the rights of the accused . " we are very concerned about the situation -lrb- of -rrb- the bulgarian citizens , " said spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos .
but overall the eu tone monday was positive , with a ministerial statement including an expression of " deep sympathy with those infected with hiv " in the tainted blood tragedy . afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu to lift arms embargo against libya the european union on wednesday agreed in principle to lift an arms embargo on libya after pressure from italy , which wants the libyan government to help crack down on illegal immigration to the eu .

but opposition candidates have accused him of favoritism . german chancellor gerhard schröder arrived in afghanistan on monday amid criticisms that his whistle-stop tour , which will be spent predominantly in the company of hamid karzai , the man expected to be named the country 's first freely elected president , shows bias . schröder landed in kabul just two days after afghanistan 's first ever democratic elections on saturday and his itinerary for the six hour tour , apart from visits to schools supported by german charities and institutions and german troops serving with the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , is dominated by talks with the us- and pakistan-blessed interim afghan president .
there are no plans to meet with any other of the nominees or politicians involved in the weekend 's historic vote . it was intended to be a visit to show german support for the democratization and stabilization efforts of a land that has suffered almost 20 years of civil war and the rule of the radical taliban regime .
instead , schröder found himself in the firing line of critics which claim his visit was evidence of the favoritism offered to karzai by western leaders . germany has decided winner , says candidate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while karzai is expected to make history by becoming afghanistan 's first democratically president when the official announcement comes on october 30 , one opposition candidate , mohammad mahfuz nedahi , told reporters that schröder 's agenda shows that germany has already decided how the vote has gone and has shown its true colors .
" germany supports us policy one hundred percent , " he said on sunday night . another , abdul latif pedram , echoed nedahi 's complaints saying that europe should been seen as supporting the democratic process and not a single nominee .
a candidate who did not want to be named added that schröder should not have come to kabul " in such a sensitive situation . "
others have expressed confusion over schröder 's timing as the election is over and his support now can achieve little . schröder lauds courageous vote despite the criticism , schröder has said that the peaceful process of voting and the high voter turnout suggests that the people of afghanistan have shown great courage in pursuing democracy and stability . as the debate rages over whether irregularities in the election had undermined the process , afghan election officials agreed on sunday to create an independent commission to probe opposition charges of fraud in the presidential poll . threat of boycott averted by probe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : originally , all 15 challengers announced they would boycott the outcome in the immediate aftermath of revelations that supposedly indelible ink used to mark voters ' thumbs in some polling stations could be rubbed off , allowing some people to vote more than once . however two candidates have since backed off , saying they wanted a commission to rule on whether the voting was fair and indicating they would accept its decision . " there is going to be an independent commission made to investigate it , " electoral director farooq wardak said in a statement .
" there could be mistakes ; we are just human beings .
my colleagues might have made a mistake . " an american delegation observing the election showed karzai with a clear majority of votes and his principal challenger , yonus qanooni , a former cabinet minister , running a distant second .
karzai needs a majority to avoid a runoff vote . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : a flawed success opposition candidates in afghanistan 's presidential elections have called for a repeat because of irregularities .
it 's a demand that could seriously harm the country 's budding democracy , according to dw 's karen fischer .

the report heavily criticizes germany for its weak implementation of the anti-smoking measures , which were recommended by the world bank .
bottom ten germany ranked among the lowest 10 countries in the study , which graded the nations on the basis of six specific criteria .
these included increased taxes on cigarettes , smoke-free policies in offices , bars and restaurants , anti-tobacco advertising , and clear warnings on cigarette packages .
the survey also rated access to treatment for nicotine addiction , and increased government " tobacco control " budgets , which go to fund other anti-smoking measures .

but iceland and britain are in for praise . the european network for smoking prevention will release a report ranking the european union 's 25 member states , as well as iceland , norway and switzerland , in terms of their progress on a range of anti-smoking measures .
the report heavily criticizes germany for its weak implementation of the anti-smoking measures , which were recommended by the world bank .
bottom ten germany ranked among the lowest 10 countries in the study , which graded the nations on the basis of six specific criteria .
these included increased taxes on cigarettes , smoke-free policies in offices , bars and restaurants , anti-tobacco advertising , and clear warnings on cigarette packages .
the survey also rated access to treatment for nicotine addiction , and increased government " tobacco control " budgets , which go to fund other anti-smoking measures .
" germany is certainly lagging behind , " luk joossens , who coordinated the network 's report , told the reuters news agency .
" it 's in the lowest 10 countries , so it could clearly do better . "
cheap smokes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoker with cigarette luxembourg and the czech republic are also set to be criticized for keeping cigarette prices very cheap in relation to wages .
on the other hand , iceland won top honors , having implemented almost all of the world bank measures .
britain also scored high , because it makes cigarettes so expensive with tax .
world bank research shows that raising prices by 10 percent cuts cigarette consumption in a wealthy country by four percent .
a package of marlboro cigarettes is more than twice as expensive in britain than in luxembourg , data show .
in march , ireland became the first country to ban smoking in restaurants , bars and pubs .
norway and malta have since instituted similar bans and incoming european health commissioner markos kyprianou last week urged all eu governments to follow ireland 's example within five years .
more young smokers the study also examined smoking rates over the last two decades .
there has been an overall decline in adult smoking in europe , joossens told reuters , but smoking among young people has not fallen over the last 10 years in most regions .
in germany , tobacco consumption among 12-15 year-olds almost doubled over the past ten years , with some 21 percent of girls and 18 percent of boys in the age group smoking regularly .
for 16-19 year-olds , the figure is 45 percent .
the country is a smokers ' paradise , with cheap cigarettes available from machines on street corners and very few restrictions as to where it is or is not acceptable to light up .
in fact , the state of berlin broke new ground this year in implementing a ban on smoking in its schools .
it 's a move which other states are likely to follow , but for the time being children over the age of 16 can smoke in designated areas on school premises provided they present a letter of consent from their parents .
roll your own officially , cigarette sales in germany dropped by nine percent over the previous year in 2003 , and big brand producers have reported trailing sales .
but there is evidence that more smokers have been turning to rolling tobacco and cigars , which have been spared the higher taxation rates dumped on cigarettes over the past couple of years .

the cdu chief told german television station zdf that the cdu were considering taking their resistance to turkey 's membership of the eu to the streets and reiterated an earlier call for an alternative offer .
" i think we should consider having a petition for privileged partnership and against full membership , " merkel said , adding that the petition was likely to be carried out . the proposal for a petition against turkish membership was originally presented by michael glos , a senior politician in the cdu 's sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
last month , merkel sent a letter to conservative politicians across europe , calling for a united front against turkey 's bid to enter the eu .
among the letter 's recipients were italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin , dutch prime minister jan-peter balkenende and greek prime minister kostas karamanlis .
merkel recommends alternative to membership in the letter , merkel proposed offering turkey a privileged partnership with the european union rather than a full membership .
she praised turkey 's recent reforms but said the european union would be overwhelmed if it tried to take turkey in as a full member .
merkel and others have said turkey 's large and growing population , which might eclipse germany 's as early as 2020 , mean the poor , muslim country would place too much economic and cultural pressure on current eu states if it were admitted to the union .
despite merkel throwing her political weight behind the petition idea , there is no blanket support for the proposal .
the leader of the european parliament foreign affairs committee , christian democrat mep elmar brok told reuters that he " suffered stomach aches over the proposal . " other options a possibility , says brok bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elmar brok .
brok added that the european commission recommendation that turkey begin entry talks without a guaranteed outcome clearly implied that options other than accession were possible .
he noted the eu executive had said last week that whatever the result , turkey should remain " fully anchored in european structures . " " that 's a clear indication that it is considering other possibilities in the relationship , " he said .
however , volker beck , parliamentary leader of the greens , the junior partner in germany 's ruling coalition , called the initiative " foul " and " irresponsible " , according to the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . g erman chancellor gerhard schröder too said that for him the strategic and security policy arguments for ankara 's bid for eu membership were decisive .
if turkey 's reforms develop further , then " we could stabilize the land and create a link between european enlightenment and non-fundamentalist islam " , he told reuters deutschland . turkish ambassador calls petition " discrimination " the call for a petition comes as the turkish ambassador in berlin , mehmet ali irtemcelik , called for his 1.9 million compatriots living in germany to do more to integrate themselves in their adopted country .
" it is important for the image of turkey for our citizens to contribute to this land . "
irtemcelik criticized the call for the petition against turkey 's eu membership , calling it " discrimination . " the final decision of whether to start membership negotiations with turkey lies with eu leaders who meet in brussels for a summit on december 17 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey 's eu moment of truth turkey 's chances of starting negotiations for member status in the european union have come to a head .

the admiration is mutual : in the coming months , germany is expected to step up its efforts to court chinese business in preparation for chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s planned visit to beijing in december .
france in the forefront but germany is n't the only one getting in on the limelight . at the moment , it is france that that 's wooing chinese corporate giants . french and chinese companies have already signed around 20 contracts worth over $ 4 billion -lrb- € 3.2 billion -rrb- in the lead-up to french president jacques chirac ’ s arrival in shanghai from beijing on monday .
the biggest orders have gone to airbus and the train-maker alstrom .
according to the associated press , chirac said his meetings with chinese president hu jintao had " emphasized our determination to further strengthen french-chinese relations .
our cooperative relationship will serve the world of the future . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french-designed tgv-a high speed train france is also lobbying for use of its tgv train on a high-speed line between beijing and shanghai , and chirac said he hoped china would buy the trains " before much longer .

early october last year , we issued the first policy statement on the region .
so this now occupies a very important position in china ’ s global strategy , and to improve china ’ s international standing , " he said .
jin also said beijing has used the eu as a model for its market and political policies .
" in the inner mind of the chinese elite , the model of europe always has a strong opinion , to -lrb- the -rrb- extent that china is rather market orientated economy ...
but the political nature of china , i think the so-called cooperative market model represented by germany and especially the scandinavian countries , is more attractive to the chinese elite . "

france is behind germany in terms of business investment in china , which imports more than three times more from germany than from france .

for its part , there is a huge debate in china as to how far the communist country should open up its markets to europe , professor jin said .

china is a more open economy than our neighboring countries , such as the republic of korea , and japan .

the market situation is very complicated so the opening process should be taken gradually .
we can not afford a dramatic change , " he noted .
but he said china has its own demands for the eu .
" first china wants market economy status .
the second thing china wants is a lifting of the arms sales embargo .
third , china hopes the eu will take a stronger position against the separation movement in taiwan . "
human rights concerns human rights groups fear that this increase in competition for business in china could lead to european countries turning a blind eye to beijing ’ s poor human rights record .

according to the associated press , chirac said his meetings with chinese president hu jintao had " emphasized our determination to further strengthen french-chinese relations .
our cooperative relationship will serve the world of the future . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french-designed tgv-a high speed train france is also lobbying for use of its tgv train on a high-speed line between beijing and shanghai , and chirac said he hoped china would buy the trains " before much longer . " jin canrong , professor of international relations at remin university of china , told dw-radio that europe 's role as important trading partner for his country continues to grow .
' the year of europe ' " the foreign ministry of china defined this year as ' the year of europe ' in chinese diplomacy .
early october last year , we issued the first policy statement on the region .
so this now occupies a very important position in china ’ s global strategy , and to improve china ’ s international standing , " he said .
jin also said beijing has used the eu as a model for its market and political policies .
" in the inner mind of the chinese elite , the model of europe always has a strong opinion , to -lrb- the -rrb- extent that china is rather market orientated economy ...
but the political nature of china , i think the so-called cooperative market model represented by germany and especially the scandinavian countries , is more attractive to the chinese elite . "
france ’ s trade success in china has not gone unnoticed by other european nations .
economists predict paris ’ assertive diplomacy could intensify the race by eu states to gain a foothold in the world ’ s most promising markets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder with indian prime minister manmohan singh the german strategy appears to be an attempt to strengthen its business ties to asia not only within china , but elsewhere .
on his recent diplomatic trip to asia , german chancellor gerhard schröder suggested that germany may also want to beef up investment elsewhere on the continent - for instance , in india .
france is behind germany in terms of business investment in china , which imports more than three times more from germany than from france .
how open is open ?
but paris has indicated that france has the potential to catch up with germany over the next decade .
for its part , there is a huge debate in china as to how far the communist country should open up its markets to europe , professor jin said .
" economic nationalists say china is -lrb- already -rrb- open too far .
china is a more open economy than our neighboring countries , such as the republic of korea , and japan .
the dominant opinion is that china should do more to continue to open its markets .
the market situation is very complicated so the opening process should be taken gradually .
we can not afford a dramatic change , " he noted .
but he said china has its own demands for the eu .
" first china wants market economy status .
the second thing china wants is a lifting of the arms sales embargo .
third , china hopes the eu will take a stronger position against the separation movement in taiwan . "
human rights concerns human rights groups fear that this increase in competition for business in china could lead to european countries turning a blind eye to beijing ’ s poor human rights record .
but jin said beijing is mindful of what the eu thinks on the matter .
he claimed the country is making some progress in improving its human rights record . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de catching the slow boat to china hamburg-based architects gerkan , marg und partner have won an international competition to build the national museum of china in beijing .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 11.10.2004 eu lifts arms ban against libya großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian pm berlusconi has already forged closer ties with gadhafi the european union agreed monday to lift an 18-year-old arms embargo on libya , welcoming the country 's renunciation of weapons of mass destruction and movement towards " responsible government . " but eu foreign ministers also voiced continued concern over a death sentence hanging over five bulgarian nurses and one palestinian medic accused by libyan authorities of infecting hundreds of children with the aids virus . " libya is among the first countries to dismantle voluntarily its weapons of mass destruction programs under international supervision through a transparent and cooperative process , " they said .
but at the same time they " invited libya to respond positively to the eu 's policy of engagement ...
in this light , it insisted that libya resolves remaining eu concerns , notably the case of the bulgarian and palestinian medical workers . " rome has for several months been pressing its eu counterparts to lift the arms embargo imposed on libya in 1986 , in order to be able to deliver equipment to tripoli to beef up its frontiers .
sanctions were imposed on libya because of its role in state-sponsored terrorism , including the 1988 lockerbie bombing . they were partially eased last year , paving the way for tripoli to compensate victims ' families .
the eu eased sanctions against tripoli in 1999 but maintained a series of restrictive measures on key products , notably military equipment , which libya has sought in order to keep a better check on its borders .
rome considers libya a major hub for clandestine migrants from african countries and has already signed cooperation agreements to help the libyan authorities combat the problem . " cooperation with libya on migration is essential and urgent , " said the eu ministers in a statement after their luxembourg talks .
the eu move comes amid a rapid loosening of sanctions and a thaw in relations since last year , when tripoli took responsibility for the lockerbie bombing and agreed to pay 2.7 billion dollars in compensation . ditching wmds the rapprochement then gathered steam with libya 's surprise decision in december to renounce and dismantle its weapons of mass destruction under us , british and international supervision .
last month us president george w. bush removed most economic sanctions on libya , clearing the way for huge compensation payments to the families of victims of the lockerbie bombing . the eu celebrated its restored ties with libya notably when moammar gadhafi visited brussels in april , his first trip to western europe in 15 years . the bulgarian nurses and a palestinian doctor were sentenced to death in may by a libyan court after a four-year trial which ended with their conviction on charges of knowingly injecting children with tainted blood products .
the eu - which bulgaria is hoping to join in 2007 - has protested the sentences and accused the libyan authorities of violating the rights of the accused . " we are very concerned about the situation -lrb- of -rrb- the bulgarian citizens , " said spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos .
but overall the eu tone monday was positive , with a ministerial statement including an expression of " deep sympathy with those infected with hiv " in the tainted blood tragedy . afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu to lift arms embargo against libya the european union on wednesday agreed in principle to lift an arms embargo on libya after pressure from italy , which wants the libyan government to help crack down on illegal immigration to the eu .

but opposition candidates have accused him of favoritism . german chancellor gerhard schröder arrived in afghanistan on monday amid criticisms that his whistle-stop tour , which will be spent predominantly in the company of hamid karzai , the man expected to be named the country 's first freely elected president , shows bias . schröder landed in kabul just two days after afghanistan 's first ever democratic elections on saturday and his itinerary for the six hour tour , apart from visits to schools supported by german charities and institutions and german troops serving with the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , is dominated by talks with the us- and pakistan-blessed interim afghan president .
there are no plans to meet with any other of the nominees or politicians involved in the weekend 's historic vote . it was intended to be a visit to show german support for the democratization and stabilization efforts of a land that has suffered almost 20 years of civil war and the rule of the radical taliban regime .
instead , schröder found himself in the firing line of critics which claim his visit was evidence of the favoritism offered to karzai by western leaders . germany has decided winner , says candidate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while karzai is expected to make history by becoming afghanistan 's first democratically president when the official announcement comes on october 30 , one opposition candidate , mohammad mahfuz nedahi , told reporters that schröder 's agenda shows that germany has already decided how the vote has gone and has shown its true colors .
" germany supports us policy one hundred percent , " he said on sunday night . another , abdul latif pedram , echoed nedahi 's complaints saying that europe should been seen as supporting the democratic process and not a single nominee .
a candidate who did not want to be named added that schröder should not have come to kabul " in such a sensitive situation . "
others have expressed confusion over schröder 's timing as the election is over and his support now can achieve little . schröder lauds courageous vote despite the criticism , schröder has said that the peaceful process of voting and the high voter turnout suggests that the people of afghanistan have shown great courage in pursuing democracy and stability . as the debate rages over whether irregularities in the election had undermined the process , afghan election officials agreed on sunday to create an independent commission to probe opposition charges of fraud in the presidential poll . threat of boycott averted by probe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : originally , all 15 challengers announced they would boycott the outcome in the immediate aftermath of revelations that supposedly indelible ink used to mark voters ' thumbs in some polling stations could be rubbed off , allowing some people to vote more than once . however two candidates have since backed off , saying they wanted a commission to rule on whether the voting was fair and indicating they would accept its decision . " there is going to be an independent commission made to investigate it , " electoral director farooq wardak said in a statement .
" there could be mistakes ; we are just human beings .
my colleagues might have made a mistake . " an american delegation observing the election showed karzai with a clear majority of votes and his principal challenger , yonus qanooni , a former cabinet minister , running a distant second .

after progress in wind and solar power , germans are looking to find a replacement for gasoline . last week , oil prices reached an all time high , breaking the $ 50 per barrel mark .
fuelled by political instability in the middle east and africa and a series of hurricanes in the united states , the per barrel price peaked at $ 50.47 -lrb- € 40.65 -rrb- .
the situation highlighted , once again , how precarious the world 's oil supply is and the cost of relying too heavily on traditional fossil fuels . germans have long sensed the looming crisis and invested millions in the development of renewable energy .
the 2000 renewable energy law paved the way for serious progress in the fields of solar and wind energy , and germany is now well on its way to meeting the goal of having 12 percent of all electricity come from renewable energy by 2010 . the effort has proven so effective that the worldwatch institute , one of the world 's leading environmental organizations , has singled out germany for special praise in its annual " state of the world " report . a lucrative new field ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : windmills in northern germany encouraged by that success , the german government and researchers are looking to replace good old-fashioned gasoline .
a new law making so-called " biofuels " tax exempt and technologies in development at a few start-up german firms are making a good start .
but the nagging question remains : is renewable energy profitable ?
the answer is yes , say exporters , if producers look beyond germany 's borders for markets . at a symposium in chicago on monday entitled " renewable energy , made in germany " sponsored by the german energy agency -lrb- dena -rrb- and its renewable energy export initiative companies researching biofuels and their collegues in other renewable sectors will showcase their latest products to the rest of the world - all in the hopes of drumming-up a little business abroad . germany , long a leading exporter of many products , may find that its investment in renewable energy technologies , will not only be good for the earth , but good for business , daniel becker the project leader of dena 's export initiative , told dw-world .
" it 's important to develop the technology , but also to market it well , " he said .
" to make renewable energies profitable - and thus lucrative to produce - we need to seek out new markets . "
that goes for the solar and wind technologies german firms are already widely respected for , and the newer biofuels still in development . law fosters progress in wind and solar energy in 2000 , german chancellor gerhard schröder 's incoming government and his coalition partner , the green party , made a huge commitment to the environment and passed the renewable energy law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rapeseed oil is transformed into biodiesel in schwarzheide in the german state of brandenburg .
it required electricity utilities to purchase a certain amount of power from renewable sources at a premium rate each year - basically , price-fixing .
and the plan - now widely considered an excellent example of how legislation can spur the development of new technology - worked .
the percentage of electricity from renewables has jumped from 4.7 percent in 1998 to 10 percent . " germany chose a price-fixing scheme , as have other countries such as spain and france , and in every case , the approach has contributed to the development of a stable market for renewable energies , particularly solar and wind power , " johannes lackmann , president of the german renewable energy association -lrb- bee -rrb- , told dw-world . biofuel , the next big thing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saxony-based choren specializes in producing biofuels .
it 's precisely that kind of success that the german government is now hoping to replicate in the development of alternatives to gasoline , hans-joseph fell , a spokesman for the green party 's research and technology division , told dw-world . and he reckons there 's a pretty good chance that up to 10 to 20 percent of traditional gasoline usage could be replaced by biofuels in five years time .
to help make those fuels more attractive and affordable , the german government passed a new law this year exempting biofuels from taxes . lackman of the bee also thinks the usage of biofuels will grow , though his estimates are conservative .
he reckons the current 1 percent market share will grow to 6 percent by 2010 .
" with this new tax exemption , we are going to see lots of growth in the biofuel sector , " he said . sundiesel , biodiesel and more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chroen 's " sundiesel beetle " runs on biodiesel .
numerous german companies are hoping to profit , including choren industries from the state of saxony , developers of " sun diesel , " and hamburg 's adm-oelmühle , developers of a biodiesel product .
both fuels fall under the umbrella of biomass energy , a vary large and diverse category .
they are environmentally friendlier fuels made out of vegetable oil , sugars , wood - almost anything that grows in the earth , as fell of the green party likes to put it . by developing such technologies , germany is chasing the coattails of brazil , where biofuels already have a 30 percent market share .
if it works more so-called " flex-fuel " cars , already popular in brazil , could soon be cruising the streets of germany . kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany opens world 's biggest solar plant the world ’ s biggest solar power plant was inaugurated in the german town of espenhain wednesday .

after progress in wind and solar power , germans are looking to find a replacement for gasoline . last week , oil prices reached an all time high , breaking the $ 50 per barrel mark .
fuelled by political instability in the middle east and africa and a series of hurricanes in the united states , the per barrel price peaked at $ 50.47 -lrb- € 40.65 -rrb- .
the situation highlighted , once again , how precarious the world 's oil supply is and the cost of relying too heavily on traditional fossil fuels . germans have long sensed the looming crisis and invested millions in the development of renewable energy .
the 2000 renewable energy law paved the way for serious progress in the fields of solar and wind energy , and germany is now well on its way to meeting the goal of having 12 percent of all electricity come from renewable energy by 2010 . the effort has proven so effective that the worldwatch institute , one of the world 's leading environmental organizations , has singled out germany for special praise in its annual " state of the world " report . a lucrative new field ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : windmills in northern germany encouraged by that success , the german government and researchers are looking to replace good old-fashioned gasoline .
a new law making so-called " biofuels " tax exempt and technologies in development at a few start-up german firms are making a good start .
but the nagging question remains : is renewable energy profitable ?
the answer is yes , say exporters , if producers look beyond germany 's borders for markets . at a symposium in chicago on monday entitled " renewable energy , made in germany " sponsored by the german energy agency -lrb- dena -rrb- and its renewable energy export initiative companies researching biofuels and their collegues in other renewable sectors will showcase their latest products to the rest of the world - all in the hopes of drumming-up a little business abroad . germany , long a leading exporter of many products , may find that its investment in renewable energy technologies , will not only be good for the earth , but good for business , daniel becker the project leader of dena 's export initiative , told dw-world .
" it 's important to develop the technology , but also to market it well , " he said .
" to make renewable energies profitable - and thus lucrative to produce - we need to seek out new markets . "
that goes for the solar and wind technologies german firms are already widely respected for , and the newer biofuels still in development . law fosters progress in wind and solar energy in 2000 , german chancellor gerhard schröder 's incoming government and his coalition partner , the green party , made a huge commitment to the environment and passed the renewable energy law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rapeseed oil is transformed into biodiesel in schwarzheide in the german state of brandenburg .
it required electricity utilities to purchase a certain amount of power from renewable sources at a premium rate each year - basically , price-fixing .
and the plan - now widely considered an excellent example of how legislation can spur the development of new technology - worked .
the percentage of electricity from renewables has jumped from 4.7 percent in 1998 to 10 percent . " germany chose a price-fixing scheme , as have other countries such as spain and france , and in every case , the approach has contributed to the development of a stable market for renewable energies , particularly solar and wind power , " johannes lackmann , president of the german renewable energy association -lrb- bee -rrb- , told dw-world . biofuel , the next big thing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saxony-based choren specializes in producing biofuels .
it 's precisely that kind of success that the german government is now hoping to replicate in the development of alternatives to gasoline , hans-joseph fell , a spokesman for the green party 's research and technology division , told dw-world . and he reckons there 's a pretty good chance that up to 10 to 20 percent of traditional gasoline usage could be replaced by biofuels in five years time .
to help make those fuels more attractive and affordable , the german government passed a new law this year exempting biofuels from taxes . lackman of the bee also thinks the usage of biofuels will grow , though his estimates are conservative .
he reckons the current 1 percent market share will grow to 6 percent by 2010 .
" with this new tax exemption , we are going to see lots of growth in the biofuel sector , " he said . sundiesel , biodiesel and more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chroen 's " sundiesel beetle " runs on biodiesel .
numerous german companies are hoping to profit , including choren industries from the state of saxony , developers of " sun diesel , " and hamburg 's adm-oelmühle , developers of a biodiesel product .
both fuels fall under the umbrella of biomass energy , a vary large and diverse category .
they are environmentally friendlier fuels made out of vegetable oil , sugars , wood - almost anything that grows in the earth , as fell of the green party likes to put it . by developing such technologies , germany is chasing the coattails of brazil , where biofuels already have a 30 percent market share .
if it works more so-called " flex-fuel " cars , already popular in brazil , could soon be cruising the streets of germany . kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany opens world 's biggest solar plant the world ’ s biggest solar power plant was inaugurated in the german town of espenhain wednesday .

" but eu foreign ministers also voiced continued concern over a death sentence hanging over five bulgarian nurses and one palestinian medic accused by libyan authorities of infecting hundreds of children with the aids virus . " libya is among the first countries to dismantle voluntarily its weapons of mass destruction programs under international supervision through a transparent and cooperative process , " they said .
but at the same time they " invited libya to respond positively to the eu 's policy of engagement ...
in this light , it insisted that libya resolves remaining eu concerns , notably the case of the bulgarian and palestinian medical workers . " rome has for several months been pressing its eu counterparts to lift the arms embargo imposed on libya in 1986 , in order to be able to deliver equipment to tripoli to beef up its frontiers .
sanctions were imposed on libya because of its role in state-sponsored terrorism , including the 1988 lockerbie bombing . they were partially eased last year , paving the way for tripoli to compensate victims ' families .
the eu eased sanctions against tripoli in 1999 but maintained a series of restrictive measures on key products , notably military equipment , which libya has sought in order to keep a better check on its borders .
rome considers libya a major hub for clandestine migrants from african countries and has already signed cooperation agreements to help the libyan authorities combat the problem . " cooperation with libya on migration is essential and urgent , " said the eu ministers in a statement after their luxembourg talks .
the eu move comes amid a rapid loosening of sanctions and a thaw in relations since last year , when tripoli took responsibility for the lockerbie bombing and agreed to pay 2.7 billion dollars in compensation . ditching wmds the rapprochement then gathered steam with libya 's surprise decision in december to renounce and dismantle its weapons of mass destruction under us , british and international supervision .
last month us president george w. bush removed most economic sanctions on libya , clearing the way for huge compensation payments to the families of victims of the lockerbie bombing . the eu celebrated its restored ties with libya notably when moammar gadhafi visited brussels in april , his first trip to western europe in 15 years . the bulgarian nurses and a palestinian doctor were sentenced to death in may by a libyan court after a four-year trial which ended with their conviction on charges of knowingly injecting children with tainted blood products .
the eu - which bulgaria is hoping to join in 2007 - has protested the sentences and accused the libyan authorities of violating the rights of the accused . " we are very concerned about the situation -lrb- of -rrb- the bulgarian citizens , " said spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 11.10.2004 france moves to strengthen china ties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a welcome for chirac near a mao statue in shanghai german investment in china is huge , but it could now be facing competition from france as paris hopes to consolidate its business foothold in the vast asian economy with a visit by president jacques chirac . beijing appears to be keen on strengthening its relationship with the european union and the chinese authorities have even cited german and scandinavian social and business practices as a sort of working model for the future of chinese business .
the admiration is mutual : in the coming months , germany is expected to step up its efforts to court chinese business in preparation for chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s planned visit to beijing in december .
france in the forefront but germany is n't the only one getting in on the limelight . at the moment , it is france that that 's wooing chinese corporate giants . french and chinese companies have already signed around 20 contracts worth over $ 4 billion -lrb- € 3.2 billion -rrb- in the lead-up to french president jacques chirac ’ s arrival in shanghai from beijing on monday .
the biggest orders have gone to airbus and the train-maker alstrom .
according to the associated press , chirac said his meetings with chinese president hu jintao had " emphasized our determination to further strengthen french-chinese relations .
our cooperative relationship will serve the world of the future . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french-designed tgv-a high speed train france is also lobbying for use of its tgv train on a high-speed line between beijing and shanghai , and chirac said he hoped china would buy the trains " before much longer . " jin canrong , professor of international relations at remin university of china , told dw-radio that europe 's role as important trading partner for his country continues to grow .
' the year of europe ' " the foreign ministry of china defined this year as ' the year of europe ' in chinese diplomacy .
early october last year , we issued the first policy statement on the region .
so this now occupies a very important position in china ’ s global strategy , and to improve china ’ s international standing , " he said .
jin also said beijing has used the eu as a model for its market and political policies .
" in the inner mind of the chinese elite , the model of europe always has a strong opinion , to -lrb- the -rrb- extent that china is rather market orientated economy ...
but the political nature of china , i think the so-called cooperative market model represented by germany and especially the scandinavian countries , is more attractive to the chinese elite . "
france ’ s trade success in china has not gone unnoticed by other european nations .
economists predict paris ’ assertive diplomacy could intensify the race by eu states to gain a foothold in the world ’ s most promising markets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder with indian prime minister manmohan singh the german strategy appears to be an attempt to strengthen its business ties to asia not only within china , but elsewhere .
on his recent diplomatic trip to asia , german chancellor gerhard schröder suggested that germany may also want to beef up investment elsewhere on the continent - for instance , in india .
france is behind germany in terms of business investment in china , which imports more than three times more from germany than from france .
how open is open ?
but paris has indicated that france has the potential to catch up with germany over the next decade .
for its part , there is a huge debate in china as to how far the communist country should open up its markets to europe , professor jin said .
" economic nationalists say china is -lrb- already -rrb- open too far .
china is a more open economy than our neighboring countries , such as the republic of korea , and japan .
the dominant opinion is that china should do more to continue to open its markets .
the market situation is very complicated so the opening process should be taken gradually .
we can not afford a dramatic change , " he noted .
but he said china has its own demands for the eu .
" first china wants market economy status .
the second thing china wants is a lifting of the arms sales embargo .
third , china hopes the eu will take a stronger position against the separation movement in taiwan . "
human rights concerns human rights groups fear that this increase in competition for business in china could lead to european countries turning a blind eye to beijing ’ s poor human rights record .
but jin said beijing is mindful of what the eu thinks on the matter .
he claimed the country is making some progress in improving its human rights record . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de catching the slow boat to china hamburg-based architects gerkan , marg und partner have won an international competition to build the national museum of china in beijing .

but opposition candidates have accused him of favoritism . german chancellor gerhard schröder arrived in afghanistan on monday amid criticisms that his whistle-stop tour , which will be spent predominantly in the company of hamid karzai , the man expected to be named the country 's first freely elected president , shows bias . schröder landed in kabul just two days after afghanistan 's first ever democratic elections on saturday and his itinerary for the six hour tour , apart from visits to schools supported by german charities and institutions and german troops serving with the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , is dominated by talks with the us- and pakistan-blessed interim afghan president .
there are no plans to meet with any other of the nominees or politicians involved in the weekend 's historic vote . it was intended to be a visit to show german support for the democratization and stabilization efforts of a land that has suffered almost 20 years of civil war and the rule of the radical taliban regime .
instead , schröder found himself in the firing line of critics which claim his visit was evidence of the favoritism offered to karzai by western leaders . germany has decided winner , says candidate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while karzai is expected to make history by becoming afghanistan 's first democratically president when the official announcement comes on october 30 , one opposition candidate , mohammad mahfuz nedahi , told reporters that schröder 's agenda shows that germany has already decided how the vote has gone and has shown its true colors .
" germany supports us policy one hundred percent , " he said on sunday night . another , abdul latif pedram , echoed nedahi 's complaints saying that europe should been seen as supporting the democratic process and not a single nominee .
a candidate who did not want to be named added that schröder should not have come to kabul " in such a sensitive situation . "
others have expressed confusion over schröder 's timing as the election is over and his support now can achieve little . schröder lauds courageous vote despite the criticism , schröder has said that the peaceful process of voting and the high voter turnout suggests that the people of afghanistan have shown great courage in pursuing democracy and stability . as the debate rages over whether irregularities in the election had undermined the process , afghan election officials agreed on sunday to create an independent commission to probe opposition charges of fraud in the presidential poll . threat of boycott averted by probe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : originally , all 15 challengers announced they would boycott the outcome in the immediate aftermath of revelations that supposedly indelible ink used to mark voters ' thumbs in some polling stations could be rubbed off , allowing some people to vote more than once . however two candidates have since backed off , saying they wanted a commission to rule on whether the voting was fair and indicating they would accept its decision . " there is going to be an independent commission made to investigate it , " electoral director farooq wardak said in a statement .
" there could be mistakes ; we are just human beings .
my colleagues might have made a mistake . " an american delegation observing the election showed karzai with a clear majority of votes and his principal challenger , yonus qanooni , a former cabinet minister , running a distant second .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 11.10.2004 france moves to strengthen china ties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a welcome for chirac near a mao statue in shanghai german investment in china is huge , but it could now be facing competition from france as paris hopes to consolidate its business foothold in the vast asian economy with a visit by president jacques chirac . beijing appears to be keen on strengthening its relationship with the european union and the chinese authorities have even cited german and scandinavian social and business practices as a sort of working model for the future of chinese business .
the admiration is mutual : in the coming months , germany is expected to step up its efforts to court chinese business in preparation for chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s planned visit to beijing in december .
france in the forefront but germany is n't the only one getting in on the limelight . at the moment , it is france that that 's wooing chinese corporate giants . french and chinese companies have already signed around 20 contracts worth over $ 4 billion -lrb- € 3.2 billion -rrb- in the lead-up to french president jacques chirac ’ s arrival in shanghai from beijing on monday .
the biggest orders have gone to airbus and the train-maker alstrom .
according to the associated press , chirac said his meetings with chinese president hu jintao had " emphasized our determination to further strengthen french-chinese relations .
our cooperative relationship will serve the world of the future . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french-designed tgv-a high speed train france is also lobbying for use of its tgv train on a high-speed line between beijing and shanghai , and chirac said he hoped china would buy the trains " before much longer . " jin canrong , professor of international relations at remin university of china , told dw-radio that europe 's role as important trading partner for his country continues to grow .
' the year of europe ' " the foreign ministry of china defined this year as ' the year of europe ' in chinese diplomacy .
early october last year , we issued the first policy statement on the region .
so this now occupies a very important position in china ’ s global strategy , and to improve china ’ s international standing , " he said .
jin also said beijing has used the eu as a model for its market and political policies .
" in the inner mind of the chinese elite , the model of europe always has a strong opinion , to -lrb- the -rrb- extent that china is rather market orientated economy ...
but the political nature of china , i think the so-called cooperative market model represented by germany and especially the scandinavian countries , is more attractive to the chinese elite . "
france ’ s trade success in china has not gone unnoticed by other european nations .
economists predict paris ’ assertive diplomacy could intensify the race by eu states to gain a foothold in the world ’ s most promising markets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder with indian prime minister manmohan singh the german strategy appears to be an attempt to strengthen its business ties to asia not only within china , but elsewhere .
on his recent diplomatic trip to asia , german chancellor gerhard schröder suggested that germany may also want to beef up investment elsewhere on the continent - for instance , in india .
france is behind germany in terms of business investment in china , which imports more than three times more from germany than from france .
how open is open ?
but paris has indicated that france has the potential to catch up with germany over the next decade .
for its part , there is a huge debate in china as to how far the communist country should open up its markets to europe , professor jin said .
" economic nationalists say china is -lrb- already -rrb- open too far .
china is a more open economy than our neighboring countries , such as the republic of korea , and japan .
the dominant opinion is that china should do more to continue to open its markets .
the market situation is very complicated so the opening process should be taken gradually .
we can not afford a dramatic change , " he noted .
but he said china has its own demands for the eu .
" first china wants market economy status .
the second thing china wants is a lifting of the arms sales embargo .
third , china hopes the eu will take a stronger position against the separation movement in taiwan . "
human rights concerns human rights groups fear that this increase in competition for business in china could lead to european countries turning a blind eye to beijing ’ s poor human rights record .
but jin said beijing is mindful of what the eu thinks on the matter .
he claimed the country is making some progress in improving its human rights record . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de catching the slow boat to china hamburg-based architects gerkan , marg und partner have won an international competition to build the national museum of china in beijing .

in this light , it insisted that libya resolves remaining eu concerns , notably the case of the bulgarian and palestinian medical workers . " rome has for several months been pressing its eu counterparts to lift the arms embargo imposed on libya in 1986 , in order to be able to deliver equipment to tripoli to beef up its frontiers .
sanctions were imposed on libya because of its role in state-sponsored terrorism , including the 1988 lockerbie bombing . they were partially eased last year , paving the way for tripoli to compensate victims ' families .

rome considers libya a major hub for clandestine migrants from african countries and has already signed cooperation agreements to help the libyan authorities combat the problem . " cooperation with libya on migration is essential and urgent , " said the eu ministers in a statement after their luxembourg talks .

last month us president george w. bush removed most economic sanctions on libya , clearing the way for huge compensation payments to the families of victims of the lockerbie bombing . the eu celebrated its restored ties with libya notably when moammar gadhafi visited brussels in april , his first trip to western europe in 15 years . the bulgarian nurses and a palestinian doctor were sentenced to death in may by a libyan court after a four-year trial which ended with their conviction on charges of knowingly injecting children with tainted blood products .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 11.10.2004 france moves to strengthen china ties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a welcome for chirac near a mao statue in shanghai german investment in china is huge , but it could now be facing competition from france as paris hopes to consolidate its business foothold in the vast asian economy with a visit by president jacques chirac . beijing appears to be keen on strengthening its relationship with the european union and the chinese authorities have even cited german and scandinavian social and business practices as a sort of working model for the future of chinese business .
the admiration is mutual : in the coming months , germany is expected to step up its efforts to court chinese business in preparation for chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s planned visit to beijing in december .
france in the forefront but germany is n't the only one getting in on the limelight . at the moment , it is france that that 's wooing chinese corporate giants . french and chinese companies have already signed around 20 contracts worth over $ 4 billion -lrb- € 3.2 billion -rrb- in the lead-up to french president jacques chirac ’ s arrival in shanghai from beijing on monday .
the biggest orders have gone to airbus and the train-maker alstrom .
according to the associated press , chirac said his meetings with chinese president hu jintao had " emphasized our determination to further strengthen french-chinese relations .
our cooperative relationship will serve the world of the future . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french-designed tgv-a high speed train france is also lobbying for use of its tgv train on a high-speed line between beijing and shanghai , and chirac said he hoped china would buy the trains " before much longer . " jin canrong , professor of international relations at remin university of china , told dw-radio that europe 's role as important trading partner for his country continues to grow .
' the year of europe ' " the foreign ministry of china defined this year as ' the year of europe ' in chinese diplomacy .
early october last year , we issued the first policy statement on the region .
so this now occupies a very important position in china ’ s global strategy , and to improve china ’ s international standing , " he said .
jin also said beijing has used the eu as a model for its market and political policies .
" in the inner mind of the chinese elite , the model of europe always has a strong opinion , to -lrb- the -rrb- extent that china is rather market orientated economy ...
but the political nature of china , i think the so-called cooperative market model represented by germany and especially the scandinavian countries , is more attractive to the chinese elite . "
france ’ s trade success in china has not gone unnoticed by other european nations .
economists predict paris ’ assertive diplomacy could intensify the race by eu states to gain a foothold in the world ’ s most promising markets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder with indian prime minister manmohan singh the german strategy appears to be an attempt to strengthen its business ties to asia not only within china , but elsewhere .
on his recent diplomatic trip to asia , german chancellor gerhard schröder suggested that germany may also want to beef up investment elsewhere on the continent - for instance , in india .
france is behind germany in terms of business investment in china , which imports more than three times more from germany than from france .
how open is open ?
but paris has indicated that france has the potential to catch up with germany over the next decade .
for its part , there is a huge debate in china as to how far the communist country should open up its markets to europe , professor jin said .
" economic nationalists say china is -lrb- already -rrb- open too far .
china is a more open economy than our neighboring countries , such as the republic of korea , and japan .
the dominant opinion is that china should do more to continue to open its markets .
the market situation is very complicated so the opening process should be taken gradually .
we can not afford a dramatic change , " he noted .
but he said china has its own demands for the eu .
" first china wants market economy status .
the second thing china wants is a lifting of the arms sales embargo .
third , china hopes the eu will take a stronger position against the separation movement in taiwan . "
human rights concerns human rights groups fear that this increase in competition for business in china could lead to european countries turning a blind eye to beijing ’ s poor human rights record .
but jin said beijing is mindful of what the eu thinks on the matter .
he claimed the country is making some progress in improving its human rights record . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de catching the slow boat to china hamburg-based architects gerkan , marg und partner have won an international competition to build the national museum of china in beijing .

but opposition candidates have accused him of favoritism . german chancellor gerhard schröder arrived in afghanistan on monday amid criticisms that his whistle-stop tour , which will be spent predominantly in the company of hamid karzai , the man expected to be named the country 's first freely elected president , shows bias . schröder landed in kabul just two days after afghanistan 's first ever democratic elections on saturday and his itinerary for the six hour tour , apart from visits to schools supported by german charities and institutions and german troops serving with the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , is dominated by talks with the us- and pakistan-blessed interim afghan president .
there are no plans to meet with any other of the nominees or politicians involved in the weekend 's historic vote . it was intended to be a visit to show german support for the democratization and stabilization efforts of a land that has suffered almost 20 years of civil war and the rule of the radical taliban regime .
instead , schröder found himself in the firing line of critics which claim his visit was evidence of the favoritism offered to karzai by western leaders . germany has decided winner , says candidate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while karzai is expected to make history by becoming afghanistan 's first democratically president when the official announcement comes on october 30 , one opposition candidate , mohammad mahfuz nedahi , told reporters that schröder 's agenda shows that germany has already decided how the vote has gone and has shown its true colors .
" germany supports us policy one hundred percent , " he said on sunday night . another , abdul latif pedram , echoed nedahi 's complaints saying that europe should been seen as supporting the democratic process and not a single nominee .
a candidate who did not want to be named added that schröder should not have come to kabul " in such a sensitive situation . "
others have expressed confusion over schröder 's timing as the election is over and his support now can achieve little . schröder lauds courageous vote despite the criticism , schröder has said that the peaceful process of voting and the high voter turnout suggests that the people of afghanistan have shown great courage in pursuing democracy and stability . as the debate rages over whether irregularities in the election had undermined the process , afghan election officials agreed on sunday to create an independent commission to probe opposition charges of fraud in the presidential poll . threat of boycott averted by probe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : originally , all 15 challengers announced they would boycott the outcome in the immediate aftermath of revelations that supposedly indelible ink used to mark voters ' thumbs in some polling stations could be rubbed off , allowing some people to vote more than once . however two candidates have since backed off , saying they wanted a commission to rule on whether the voting was fair and indicating they would accept its decision . " there is going to be an independent commission made to investigate it , " electoral director farooq wardak said in a statement .
" there could be mistakes ; we are just human beings .
my colleagues might have made a mistake . " an american delegation observing the election showed karzai with a clear majority of votes and his principal challenger , yonus qanooni , a former cabinet minister , running a distant second .

for 16-19 year-olds , the figure is 45 percent .
the country is a smokers ' paradise , with cheap cigarettes available from machines on street corners and very few restrictions as to where it is or is not acceptable to light up .

instead , schröder found himself in the firing line of critics which claim his visit was evidence of the favoritism offered to karzai by western leaders . germany has decided winner , says candidate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while karzai is expected to make history by becoming afghanistan 's first democratically president when the official announcement comes on october 30 , one opposition candidate , mohammad mahfuz nedahi , told reporters that schröder 's agenda shows that germany has already decided how the vote has gone and has shown its true colors .
" germany supports us policy one hundred percent , " he said on sunday night . another , abdul latif pedram , echoed nedahi 's complaints saying that europe should been seen as supporting the democratic process and not a single nominee .
a candidate who did not want to be named added that schröder should not have come to kabul " in such a sensitive situation . "
others have expressed confusion over schröder 's timing as the election is over and his support now can achieve little . schröder lauds courageous vote despite the criticism , schröder has said that the peaceful process of voting and the high voter turnout suggests that the people of afghanistan have shown great courage in pursuing democracy and stability . as the debate rages over whether irregularities in the election had undermined the process , afghan election officials agreed on sunday to create an independent commission to probe opposition charges of fraud in the presidential poll . threat of boycott averted by probe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : originally , all 15 challengers announced they would boycott the outcome in the immediate aftermath of revelations that supposedly indelible ink used to mark voters ' thumbs in some polling stations could be rubbed off , allowing some people to vote more than once . however two candidates have since backed off , saying they wanted a commission to rule on whether the voting was fair and indicating they would accept its decision . " there is going to be an independent commission made to investigate it , " electoral director farooq wardak said in a statement .
" there could be mistakes ; we are just human beings .
my colleagues might have made a mistake . " an american delegation observing the election showed karzai with a clear majority of votes and his principal challenger , yonus qanooni , a former cabinet minister , running a distant second .
karzai needs a majority to avoid a runoff vote . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : a flawed success opposition candidates in afghanistan 's presidential elections have called for a repeat because of irregularities .

the cdu chief told german television station zdf that the cdu were considering taking their resistance to turkey 's membership of the eu to the streets and reiterated an earlier call for an alternative offer .
" i think we should consider having a petition for privileged partnership and against full membership , " merkel said , adding that the petition was likely to be carried out . the proposal for a petition against turkish membership was originally presented by michael glos , a senior politician in the cdu 's sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
last month , merkel sent a letter to conservative politicians across europe , calling for a united front against turkey 's bid to enter the eu .
among the letter 's recipients were italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin , dutch prime minister jan-peter balkenende and greek prime minister kostas karamanlis .
merkel recommends alternative to membership in the letter , merkel proposed offering turkey a privileged partnership with the european union rather than a full membership .
she praised turkey 's recent reforms but said the european union would be overwhelmed if it tried to take turkey in as a full member .
merkel and others have said turkey 's large and growing population , which might eclipse germany 's as early as 2020 , mean the poor , muslim country would place too much economic and cultural pressure on current eu states if it were admitted to the union .
despite merkel throwing her political weight behind the petition idea , there is no blanket support for the proposal .
the leader of the european parliament foreign affairs committee , christian democrat mep elmar brok told reuters that he " suffered stomach aches over the proposal . " other options a possibility , says brok bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elmar brok .
brok added that the european commission recommendation that turkey begin entry talks without a guaranteed outcome clearly implied that options other than accession were possible .
he noted the eu executive had said last week that whatever the result , turkey should remain " fully anchored in european structures . " " that 's a clear indication that it is considering other possibilities in the relationship , " he said .
however , volker beck , parliamentary leader of the greens , the junior partner in germany 's ruling coalition , called the initiative " foul " and " irresponsible " , according to the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . g erman chancellor gerhard schröder too said that for him the strategic and security policy arguments for ankara 's bid for eu membership were decisive .
if turkey 's reforms develop further , then " we could stabilize the land and create a link between european enlightenment and non-fundamentalist islam " , he told reuters deutschland . turkish ambassador calls petition " discrimination " the call for a petition comes as the turkish ambassador in berlin , mehmet ali irtemcelik , called for his 1.9 million compatriots living in germany to do more to integrate themselves in their adopted country .
" it is important for the image of turkey for our citizens to contribute to this land . "

" i think we should consider having a petition for privileged partnership and against full membership , " merkel said , adding that the petition was likely to be carried out . the proposal for a petition against turkish membership was originally presented by michael glos , a senior politician in the cdu 's sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
last month , merkel sent a letter to conservative politicians across europe , calling for a united front against turkey 's bid to enter the eu .
among the letter 's recipients were italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin , dutch prime minister jan-peter balkenende and greek prime minister kostas karamanlis .
merkel recommends alternative to membership in the letter , merkel proposed offering turkey a privileged partnership with the european union rather than a full membership .
she praised turkey 's recent reforms but said the european union would be overwhelmed if it tried to take turkey in as a full member .
merkel and others have said turkey 's large and growing population , which might eclipse germany 's as early as 2020 , mean the poor , muslim country would place too much economic and cultural pressure on current eu states if it were admitted to the union .
despite merkel throwing her political weight behind the petition idea , there is no blanket support for the proposal .
the leader of the european parliament foreign affairs committee , christian democrat mep elmar brok told reuters that he " suffered stomach aches over the proposal . " other options a possibility , says brok bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elmar brok .
brok added that the european commission recommendation that turkey begin entry talks without a guaranteed outcome clearly implied that options other than accession were possible .
he noted the eu executive had said last week that whatever the result , turkey should remain " fully anchored in european structures . " " that 's a clear indication that it is considering other possibilities in the relationship , " he said .
however , volker beck , parliamentary leader of the greens , the junior partner in germany 's ruling coalition , called the initiative " foul " and " irresponsible " , according to the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . g erman chancellor gerhard schröder too said that for him the strategic and security policy arguments for ankara 's bid for eu membership were decisive .
if turkey 's reforms develop further , then " we could stabilize the land and create a link between european enlightenment and non-fundamentalist islam " , he told reuters deutschland . turkish ambassador calls petition " discrimination " the call for a petition comes as the turkish ambassador in berlin , mehmet ali irtemcelik , called for his 1.9 million compatriots living in germany to do more to integrate themselves in their adopted country .
" it is important for the image of turkey for our citizens to contribute to this land . "
irtemcelik criticized the call for the petition against turkey 's eu membership , calling it " discrimination .

the admiration is mutual : in the coming months , germany is expected to step up its efforts to court chinese business in preparation for chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s planned visit to beijing in december .
france in the forefront but germany is n't the only one getting in on the limelight . at the moment , it is france that that 's wooing chinese corporate giants . french and chinese companies have already signed around 20 contracts worth over $ 4 billion -lrb- € 3.2 billion -rrb- in the lead-up to french president jacques chirac ’ s arrival in shanghai from beijing on monday .
the biggest orders have gone to airbus and the train-maker alstrom .

jin also said beijing has used the eu as a model for its market and political policies .
" in the inner mind of the chinese elite , the model of europe always has a strong opinion , to -lrb- the -rrb- extent that china is rather market orientated economy ...

on his recent diplomatic trip to asia , german chancellor gerhard schröder suggested that germany may also want to beef up investment elsewhere on the continent - for instance , in india .
france is behind germany in terms of business investment in china , which imports more than three times more from germany than from france .
how open is open ?
but paris has indicated that france has the potential to catch up with germany over the next decade .
for its part , there is a huge debate in china as to how far the communist country should open up its markets to europe , professor jin said .
" economic nationalists say china is -lrb- already -rrb- open too far .
china is a more open economy than our neighboring countries , such as the republic of korea , and japan .
the dominant opinion is that china should do more to continue to open its markets .
the market situation is very complicated so the opening process should be taken gradually .
we can not afford a dramatic change , " he noted .

third , china hopes the eu will take a stronger position against the separation movement in taiwan . "

the admiration is mutual : in the coming months , germany is expected to step up its efforts to court chinese business in preparation for chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s planned visit to beijing in december .
france in the forefront but germany is n't the only one getting in on the limelight . at the moment , it is france that that 's wooing chinese corporate giants . french and chinese companies have already signed around 20 contracts worth over $ 4 billion -lrb- € 3.2 billion -rrb- in the lead-up to french president jacques chirac ’ s arrival in shanghai from beijing on monday .
the biggest orders have gone to airbus and the train-maker alstrom .
according to the associated press , chirac said his meetings with chinese president hu jintao had " emphasized our determination to further strengthen french-chinese relations .
our cooperative relationship will serve the world of the future . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french-designed tgv-a high speed train france is also lobbying for use of its tgv train on a high-speed line between beijing and shanghai , and chirac said he hoped china would buy the trains " before much longer . " jin canrong , professor of international relations at remin university of china , told dw-radio that europe 's role as important trading partner for his country continues to grow .
' the year of europe ' " the foreign ministry of china defined this year as ' the year of europe ' in chinese diplomacy .
early october last year , we issued the first policy statement on the region .
so this now occupies a very important position in china ’ s global strategy , and to improve china ’ s international standing , " he said .
jin also said beijing has used the eu as a model for its market and political policies .
" in the inner mind of the chinese elite , the model of europe always has a strong opinion , to -lrb- the -rrb- extent that china is rather market orientated economy ...
but the political nature of china , i think the so-called cooperative market model represented by germany and especially the scandinavian countries , is more attractive to the chinese elite . "
france ’ s trade success in china has not gone unnoticed by other european nations .
economists predict paris ’ assertive diplomacy could intensify the race by eu states to gain a foothold in the world ’ s most promising markets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder with indian prime minister manmohan singh the german strategy appears to be an attempt to strengthen its business ties to asia not only within china , but elsewhere .
on his recent diplomatic trip to asia , german chancellor gerhard schröder suggested that germany may also want to beef up investment elsewhere on the continent - for instance , in india .
france is behind germany in terms of business investment in china , which imports more than three times more from germany than from france .
how open is open ?
but paris has indicated that france has the potential to catch up with germany over the next decade .
for its part , there is a huge debate in china as to how far the communist country should open up its markets to europe , professor jin said .
" economic nationalists say china is -lrb- already -rrb- open too far .
china is a more open economy than our neighboring countries , such as the republic of korea , and japan .
the dominant opinion is that china should do more to continue to open its markets .
the market situation is very complicated so the opening process should be taken gradually .
we can not afford a dramatic change , " he noted .
but he said china has its own demands for the eu .
" first china wants market economy status .
the second thing china wants is a lifting of the arms sales embargo .
third , china hopes the eu will take a stronger position against the separation movement in taiwan . "
human rights concerns human rights groups fear that this increase in competition for business in china could lead to european countries turning a blind eye to beijing ’ s poor human rights record .
but jin said beijing is mindful of what the eu thinks on the matter .
he claimed the country is making some progress in improving its human rights record . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de catching the slow boat to china hamburg-based architects gerkan , marg und partner have won an international competition to build the national museum of china in beijing .

after progress in wind and solar power , germans are looking to find a replacement for gasoline . last week , oil prices reached an all time high , breaking the $ 50 per barrel mark .
fuelled by political instability in the middle east and africa and a series of hurricanes in the united states , the per barrel price peaked at $ 50.47 -lrb- € 40.65 -rrb- .
the situation highlighted , once again , how precarious the world 's oil supply is and the cost of relying too heavily on traditional fossil fuels . germans have long sensed the looming crisis and invested millions in the development of renewable energy .
the 2000 renewable energy law paved the way for serious progress in the fields of solar and wind energy , and germany is now well on its way to meeting the goal of having 12 percent of all electricity come from renewable energy by 2010 . the effort has proven so effective that the worldwatch institute , one of the world 's leading environmental organizations , has singled out germany for special praise in its annual " state of the world " report . a lucrative new field ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : windmills in northern germany encouraged by that success , the german government and researchers are looking to replace good old-fashioned gasoline .
a new law making so-called " biofuels " tax exempt and technologies in development at a few start-up german firms are making a good start .
but the nagging question remains : is renewable energy profitable ?
the answer is yes , say exporters , if producers look beyond germany 's borders for markets . at a symposium in chicago on monday entitled " renewable energy , made in germany " sponsored by the german energy agency -lrb- dena -rrb- and its renewable energy export initiative companies researching biofuels and their collegues in other renewable sectors will showcase their latest products to the rest of the world - all in the hopes of drumming-up a little business abroad . germany , long a leading exporter of many products , may find that its investment in renewable energy technologies , will not only be good for the earth , but good for business , daniel becker the project leader of dena 's export initiative , told dw-world .
" it 's important to develop the technology , but also to market it well , " he said .
" to make renewable energies profitable - and thus lucrative to produce - we need to seek out new markets . "
that goes for the solar and wind technologies german firms are already widely respected for , and the newer biofuels still in development . law fosters progress in wind and solar energy in 2000 , german chancellor gerhard schröder 's incoming government and his coalition partner , the green party , made a huge commitment to the environment and passed the renewable energy law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rapeseed oil is transformed into biodiesel in schwarzheide in the german state of brandenburg .

and the plan - now widely considered an excellent example of how legislation can spur the development of new technology - worked .
the percentage of electricity from renewables has jumped from 4.7 percent in 1998 to 10 percent . " germany chose a price-fixing scheme , as have other countries such as spain and france , and in every case , the approach has contributed to the development of a stable market for renewable energies , particularly solar and wind power , " johannes lackmann , president of the german renewable energy association -lrb- bee -rrb- , told dw-world . biofuel , the next big thing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saxony-based choren specializes in producing biofuels .

to help make those fuels more attractive and affordable , the german government passed a new law this year exempting biofuels from taxes . lackman of the bee also thinks the usage of biofuels will grow , though his estimates are conservative .

but opposition candidates have accused him of favoritism . german chancellor gerhard schröder arrived in afghanistan on monday amid criticisms that his whistle-stop tour , which will be spent predominantly in the company of hamid karzai , the man expected to be named the country 's first freely elected president , shows bias . schröder landed in kabul just two days after afghanistan 's first ever democratic elections on saturday and his itinerary for the six hour tour , apart from visits to schools supported by german charities and institutions and german troops serving with the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , is dominated by talks with the us- and pakistan-blessed interim afghan president .
there are no plans to meet with any other of the nominees or politicians involved in the weekend 's historic vote . it was intended to be a visit to show german support for the democratization and stabilization efforts of a land that has suffered almost 20 years of civil war and the rule of the radical taliban regime .
instead , schröder found himself in the firing line of critics which claim his visit was evidence of the favoritism offered to karzai by western leaders . germany has decided winner , says candidate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while karzai is expected to make history by becoming afghanistan 's first democratically president when the official announcement comes on october 30 , one opposition candidate , mohammad mahfuz nedahi , told reporters that schröder 's agenda shows that germany has already decided how the vote has gone and has shown its true colors .
" germany supports us policy one hundred percent , " he said on sunday night . another , abdul latif pedram , echoed nedahi 's complaints saying that europe should been seen as supporting the democratic process and not a single nominee .
a candidate who did not want to be named added that schröder should not have come to kabul " in such a sensitive situation . "
others have expressed confusion over schröder 's timing as the election is over and his support now can achieve little . schröder lauds courageous vote despite the criticism , schröder has said that the peaceful process of voting and the high voter turnout suggests that the people of afghanistan have shown great courage in pursuing democracy and stability . as the debate rages over whether irregularities in the election had undermined the process , afghan election officials agreed on sunday to create an independent commission to probe opposition charges of fraud in the presidential poll . threat of boycott averted by probe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : originally , all 15 challengers announced they would boycott the outcome in the immediate aftermath of revelations that supposedly indelible ink used to mark voters ' thumbs in some polling stations could be rubbed off , allowing some people to vote more than once . however two candidates have since backed off , saying they wanted a commission to rule on whether the voting was fair and indicating they would accept its decision . " there is going to be an independent commission made to investigate it , " electoral director farooq wardak said in a statement .
" there could be mistakes ; we are just human beings .
my colleagues might have made a mistake . " an american delegation observing the election showed karzai with a clear majority of votes and his principal challenger , yonus qanooni , a former cabinet minister , running a distant second .
karzai needs a majority to avoid a runoff vote . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : a flawed success opposition candidates in afghanistan 's presidential elections have called for a repeat because of irregularities .

but opposition candidates have accused him of favoritism . german chancellor gerhard schröder arrived in afghanistan on monday amid criticisms that his whistle-stop tour , which will be spent predominantly in the company of hamid karzai , the man expected to be named the country 's first freely elected president , shows bias . schröder landed in kabul just two days after afghanistan 's first ever democratic elections on saturday and his itinerary for the six hour tour , apart from visits to schools supported by german charities and institutions and german troops serving with the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , is dominated by talks with the us- and pakistan-blessed interim afghan president .
there are no plans to meet with any other of the nominees or politicians involved in the weekend 's historic vote . it was intended to be a visit to show german support for the democratization and stabilization efforts of a land that has suffered almost 20 years of civil war and the rule of the radical taliban regime .
instead , schröder found himself in the firing line of critics which claim his visit was evidence of the favoritism offered to karzai by western leaders . germany has decided winner , says candidate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while karzai is expected to make history by becoming afghanistan 's first democratically president when the official announcement comes on october 30 , one opposition candidate , mohammad mahfuz nedahi , told reporters that schröder 's agenda shows that germany has already decided how the vote has gone and has shown its true colors .
" germany supports us policy one hundred percent , " he said on sunday night . another , abdul latif pedram , echoed nedahi 's complaints saying that europe should been seen as supporting the democratic process and not a single nominee .
a candidate who did not want to be named added that schröder should not have come to kabul " in such a sensitive situation . "
others have expressed confusion over schröder 's timing as the election is over and his support now can achieve little . schröder lauds courageous vote despite the criticism , schröder has said that the peaceful process of voting and the high voter turnout suggests that the people of afghanistan have shown great courage in pursuing democracy and stability . as the debate rages over whether irregularities in the election had undermined the process , afghan election officials agreed on sunday to create an independent commission to probe opposition charges of fraud in the presidential poll . threat of boycott averted by probe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : originally , all 15 challengers announced they would boycott the outcome in the immediate aftermath of revelations that supposedly indelible ink used to mark voters ' thumbs in some polling stations could be rubbed off , allowing some people to vote more than once . however two candidates have since backed off , saying they wanted a commission to rule on whether the voting was fair and indicating they would accept its decision . " there is going to be an independent commission made to investigate it , " electoral director farooq wardak said in a statement .
" there could be mistakes ; we are just human beings .
my colleagues might have made a mistake . " an american delegation observing the election showed karzai with a clear majority of votes and his principal challenger , yonus qanooni , a former cabinet minister , running a distant second .
karzai needs a majority to avoid a runoff vote . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : a flawed success opposition candidates in afghanistan 's presidential elections have called for a repeat because of irregularities .

" but eu foreign ministers also voiced continued concern over a death sentence hanging over five bulgarian nurses and one palestinian medic accused by libyan authorities of infecting hundreds of children with the aids virus . " libya is among the first countries to dismantle voluntarily its weapons of mass destruction programs under international supervision through a transparent and cooperative process , " they said .
but at the same time they " invited libya to respond positively to the eu 's policy of engagement ...
in this light , it insisted that libya resolves remaining eu concerns , notably the case of the bulgarian and palestinian medical workers . " rome has for several months been pressing its eu counterparts to lift the arms embargo imposed on libya in 1986 , in order to be able to deliver equipment to tripoli to beef up its frontiers .
sanctions were imposed on libya because of its role in state-sponsored terrorism , including the 1988 lockerbie bombing . they were partially eased last year , paving the way for tripoli to compensate victims ' families .
the eu eased sanctions against tripoli in 1999 but maintained a series of restrictive measures on key products , notably military equipment , which libya has sought in order to keep a better check on its borders .
rome considers libya a major hub for clandestine migrants from african countries and has already signed cooperation agreements to help the libyan authorities combat the problem . " cooperation with libya on migration is essential and urgent , " said the eu ministers in a statement after their luxembourg talks .
the eu move comes amid a rapid loosening of sanctions and a thaw in relations since last year , when tripoli took responsibility for the lockerbie bombing and agreed to pay 2.7 billion dollars in compensation . ditching wmds the rapprochement then gathered steam with libya 's surprise decision in december to renounce and dismantle its weapons of mass destruction under us , british and international supervision .
last month us president george w. bush removed most economic sanctions on libya , clearing the way for huge compensation payments to the families of victims of the lockerbie bombing . the eu celebrated its restored ties with libya notably when moammar gadhafi visited brussels in april , his first trip to western europe in 15 years . the bulgarian nurses and a palestinian doctor were sentenced to death in may by a libyan court after a four-year trial which ended with their conviction on charges of knowingly injecting children with tainted blood products .
the eu - which bulgaria is hoping to join in 2007 - has protested the sentences and accused the libyan authorities of violating the rights of the accused . " we are very concerned about the situation -lrb- of -rrb- the bulgarian citizens , " said spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos .

" but eu foreign ministers also voiced continued concern over a death sentence hanging over five bulgarian nurses and one palestinian medic accused by libyan authorities of infecting hundreds of children with the aids virus . " libya is among the first countries to dismantle voluntarily its weapons of mass destruction programs under international supervision through a transparent and cooperative process , " they said .
but at the same time they " invited libya to respond positively to the eu 's policy of engagement ...
in this light , it insisted that libya resolves remaining eu concerns , notably the case of the bulgarian and palestinian medical workers . " rome has for several months been pressing its eu counterparts to lift the arms embargo imposed on libya in 1986 , in order to be able to deliver equipment to tripoli to beef up its frontiers .
sanctions were imposed on libya because of its role in state-sponsored terrorism , including the 1988 lockerbie bombing . they were partially eased last year , paving the way for tripoli to compensate victims ' families .
the eu eased sanctions against tripoli in 1999 but maintained a series of restrictive measures on key products , notably military equipment , which libya has sought in order to keep a better check on its borders .
rome considers libya a major hub for clandestine migrants from african countries and has already signed cooperation agreements to help the libyan authorities combat the problem . " cooperation with libya on migration is essential and urgent , " said the eu ministers in a statement after their luxembourg talks .
the eu move comes amid a rapid loosening of sanctions and a thaw in relations since last year , when tripoli took responsibility for the lockerbie bombing and agreed to pay 2.7 billion dollars in compensation . ditching wmds the rapprochement then gathered steam with libya 's surprise decision in december to renounce and dismantle its weapons of mass destruction under us , british and international supervision .
last month us president george w. bush removed most economic sanctions on libya , clearing the way for huge compensation payments to the families of victims of the lockerbie bombing . the eu celebrated its restored ties with libya notably when moammar gadhafi visited brussels in april , his first trip to western europe in 15 years . the bulgarian nurses and a palestinian doctor were sentenced to death in may by a libyan court after a four-year trial which ended with their conviction on charges of knowingly injecting children with tainted blood products .
the eu - which bulgaria is hoping to join in 2007 - has protested the sentences and accused the libyan authorities of violating the rights of the accused . " we are very concerned about the situation -lrb- of -rrb- the bulgarian citizens , " said spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos .
but overall the eu tone monday was positive , with a ministerial statement including an expression of " deep sympathy with those infected with hiv " in the tainted blood tragedy . afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu to lift arms embargo against libya the european union on wednesday agreed in principle to lift an arms embargo on libya after pressure from italy , which wants the libyan government to help crack down on illegal immigration to the eu .

the biggest orders have gone to airbus and the train-maker alstrom .

the admiration is mutual : in the coming months , germany is expected to step up its efforts to court chinese business in preparation for chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s planned visit to beijing in december .
france in the forefront but germany is n't the only one getting in on the limelight . at the moment , it is france that that 's wooing chinese corporate giants . french and chinese companies have already signed around 20 contracts worth over $ 4 billion -lrb- € 3.2 billion -rrb- in the lead-up to french president jacques chirac ’ s arrival in shanghai from beijing on monday .
the biggest orders have gone to airbus and the train-maker alstrom .
according to the associated press , chirac said his meetings with chinese president hu jintao had " emphasized our determination to further strengthen french-chinese relations .
our cooperative relationship will serve the world of the future . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french-designed tgv-a high speed train france is also lobbying for use of its tgv train on a high-speed line between beijing and shanghai , and chirac said he hoped china would buy the trains " before much longer .

' the year of europe ' " the foreign ministry of china defined this year as ' the year of europe ' in chinese diplomacy .
early october last year , we issued the first policy statement on the region .
so this now occupies a very important position in china ’ s global strategy , and to improve china ’ s international standing , " he said .
jin also said beijing has used the eu as a model for its market and political policies .
" in the inner mind of the chinese elite , the model of europe always has a strong opinion , to -lrb- the -rrb- extent that china is rather market orientated economy ...
but the political nature of china , i think the so-called cooperative market model represented by germany and especially the scandinavian countries , is more attractive to the chinese elite . "
france ’ s trade success in china has not gone unnoticed by other european nations .
economists predict paris ’ assertive diplomacy could intensify the race by eu states to gain a foothold in the world ’ s most promising markets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder with indian prime minister manmohan singh the german strategy appears to be an attempt to strengthen its business ties to asia not only within china , but elsewhere .
on his recent diplomatic trip to asia , german chancellor gerhard schröder suggested that germany may also want to beef up investment elsewhere on the continent - for instance , in india .
france is behind germany in terms of business investment in china , which imports more than three times more from germany than from france .
how open is open ?
but paris has indicated that france has the potential to catch up with germany over the next decade .
for its part , there is a huge debate in china as to how far the communist country should open up its markets to europe , professor jin said .
" economic nationalists say china is -lrb- already -rrb- open too far .
china is a more open economy than our neighboring countries , such as the republic of korea , and japan .
the dominant opinion is that china should do more to continue to open its markets .
the market situation is very complicated so the opening process should be taken gradually .
we can not afford a dramatic change , " he noted .
but he said china has its own demands for the eu .
" first china wants market economy status .
the second thing china wants is a lifting of the arms sales embargo .
third , china hopes the eu will take a stronger position against the separation movement in taiwan . "
human rights concerns human rights groups fear that this increase in competition for business in china could lead to european countries turning a blind eye to beijing ’ s poor human rights record .

the cdu chief told german television station zdf that the cdu were considering taking their resistance to turkey 's membership of the eu to the streets and reiterated an earlier call for an alternative offer .
" i think we should consider having a petition for privileged partnership and against full membership , " merkel said , adding that the petition was likely to be carried out . the proposal for a petition against turkish membership was originally presented by michael glos , a senior politician in the cdu 's sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
last month , merkel sent a letter to conservative politicians across europe , calling for a united front against turkey 's bid to enter the eu .
among the letter 's recipients were italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin , dutch prime minister jan-peter balkenende and greek prime minister kostas karamanlis .
merkel recommends alternative to membership in the letter , merkel proposed offering turkey a privileged partnership with the european union rather than a full membership .
she praised turkey 's recent reforms but said the european union would be overwhelmed if it tried to take turkey in as a full member .
merkel and others have said turkey 's large and growing population , which might eclipse germany 's as early as 2020 , mean the poor , muslim country would place too much economic and cultural pressure on current eu states if it were admitted to the union .
despite merkel throwing her political weight behind the petition idea , there is no blanket support for the proposal .

brok added that the european commission recommendation that turkey begin entry talks without a guaranteed outcome clearly implied that options other than accession were possible .
he noted the eu executive had said last week that whatever the result , turkey should remain " fully anchored in european structures . " " that 's a clear indication that it is considering other possibilities in the relationship , " he said .
however , volker beck , parliamentary leader of the greens , the junior partner in germany 's ruling coalition , called the initiative " foul " and " irresponsible " , according to the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . g erman chancellor gerhard schröder too said that for him the strategic and security policy arguments for ankara 's bid for eu membership were decisive .

after progress in wind and solar power , germans are looking to find a replacement for gasoline . last week , oil prices reached an all time high , breaking the $ 50 per barrel mark .
fuelled by political instability in the middle east and africa and a series of hurricanes in the united states , the per barrel price peaked at $ 50.47 -lrb- € 40.65 -rrb- .
the situation highlighted , once again , how precarious the world 's oil supply is and the cost of relying too heavily on traditional fossil fuels . germans have long sensed the looming crisis and invested millions in the development of renewable energy .
the 2000 renewable energy law paved the way for serious progress in the fields of solar and wind energy , and germany is now well on its way to meeting the goal of having 12 percent of all electricity come from renewable energy by 2010 . the effort has proven so effective that the worldwatch institute , one of the world 's leading environmental organizations , has singled out germany for special praise in its annual " state of the world " report . a lucrative new field ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : windmills in northern germany encouraged by that success , the german government and researchers are looking to replace good old-fashioned gasoline .
a new law making so-called " biofuels " tax exempt and technologies in development at a few start-up german firms are making a good start .
but the nagging question remains : is renewable energy profitable ?
the answer is yes , say exporters , if producers look beyond germany 's borders for markets . at a symposium in chicago on monday entitled " renewable energy , made in germany " sponsored by the german energy agency -lrb- dena -rrb- and its renewable energy export initiative companies researching biofuels and their collegues in other renewable sectors will showcase their latest products to the rest of the world - all in the hopes of drumming-up a little business abroad . germany , long a leading exporter of many products , may find that its investment in renewable energy technologies , will not only be good for the earth , but good for business , daniel becker the project leader of dena 's export initiative , told dw-world .
" it 's important to develop the technology , but also to market it well , " he said .
" to make renewable energies profitable - and thus lucrative to produce - we need to seek out new markets . "
that goes for the solar and wind technologies german firms are already widely respected for , and the newer biofuels still in development . law fosters progress in wind and solar energy in 2000 , german chancellor gerhard schröder 's incoming government and his coalition partner , the green party , made a huge commitment to the environment and passed the renewable energy law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rapeseed oil is transformed into biodiesel in schwarzheide in the german state of brandenburg .

the percentage of electricity from renewables has jumped from 4.7 percent in 1998 to 10 percent . " germany chose a price-fixing scheme , as have other countries such as spain and france , and in every case , the approach has contributed to the development of a stable market for renewable energies , particularly solar and wind power , " johannes lackmann , president of the german renewable energy association -lrb- bee -rrb- , told dw-world . biofuel , the next big thing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saxony-based choren specializes in producing biofuels .

to help make those fuels more attractive and affordable , the german government passed a new law this year exempting biofuels from taxes . lackman of the bee also thinks the usage of biofuels will grow , though his estimates are conservative .

the cdu chief told german television station zdf that the cdu were considering taking their resistance to turkey 's membership of the eu to the streets and reiterated an earlier call for an alternative offer .
" i think we should consider having a petition for privileged partnership and against full membership , " merkel said , adding that the petition was likely to be carried out . the proposal for a petition against turkish membership was originally presented by michael glos , a senior politician in the cdu 's sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
last month , merkel sent a letter to conservative politicians across europe , calling for a united front against turkey 's bid to enter the eu .
among the letter 's recipients were italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin , dutch prime minister jan-peter balkenende and greek prime minister kostas karamanlis .
merkel recommends alternative to membership in the letter , merkel proposed offering turkey a privileged partnership with the european union rather than a full membership .
she praised turkey 's recent reforms but said the european union would be overwhelmed if it tried to take turkey in as a full member .
merkel and others have said turkey 's large and growing population , which might eclipse germany 's as early as 2020 , mean the poor , muslim country would place too much economic and cultural pressure on current eu states if it were admitted to the union .
despite merkel throwing her political weight behind the petition idea , there is no blanket support for the proposal .
the leader of the european parliament foreign affairs committee , christian democrat mep elmar brok told reuters that he " suffered stomach aches over the proposal . " other options a possibility , says brok bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elmar brok .
brok added that the european commission recommendation that turkey begin entry talks without a guaranteed outcome clearly implied that options other than accession were possible .
he noted the eu executive had said last week that whatever the result , turkey should remain " fully anchored in european structures . " " that 's a clear indication that it is considering other possibilities in the relationship , " he said .
however , volker beck , parliamentary leader of the greens , the junior partner in germany 's ruling coalition , called the initiative " foul " and " irresponsible " , according to the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . g erman chancellor gerhard schröder too said that for him the strategic and security policy arguments for ankara 's bid for eu membership were decisive .

the cdu chief told german television station zdf that the cdu were considering taking their resistance to turkey 's membership of the eu to the streets and reiterated an earlier call for an alternative offer .
" i think we should consider having a petition for privileged partnership and against full membership , " merkel said , adding that the petition was likely to be carried out . the proposal for a petition against turkish membership was originally presented by michael glos , a senior politician in the cdu 's sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
last month , merkel sent a letter to conservative politicians across europe , calling for a united front against turkey 's bid to enter the eu .
among the letter 's recipients were italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin , dutch prime minister jan-peter balkenende and greek prime minister kostas karamanlis .
merkel recommends alternative to membership in the letter , merkel proposed offering turkey a privileged partnership with the european union rather than a full membership .
she praised turkey 's recent reforms but said the european union would be overwhelmed if it tried to take turkey in as a full member .
merkel and others have said turkey 's large and growing population , which might eclipse germany 's as early as 2020 , mean the poor , muslim country would place too much economic and cultural pressure on current eu states if it were admitted to the union .
despite merkel throwing her political weight behind the petition idea , there is no blanket support for the proposal .
the leader of the european parliament foreign affairs committee , christian democrat mep elmar brok told reuters that he " suffered stomach aches over the proposal . " other options a possibility , says brok bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elmar brok .
brok added that the european commission recommendation that turkey begin entry talks without a guaranteed outcome clearly implied that options other than accession were possible .
he noted the eu executive had said last week that whatever the result , turkey should remain " fully anchored in european structures . " " that 's a clear indication that it is considering other possibilities in the relationship , " he said .
however , volker beck , parliamentary leader of the greens , the junior partner in germany 's ruling coalition , called the initiative " foul " and " irresponsible " , according to the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . g erman chancellor gerhard schröder too said that for him the strategic and security policy arguments for ankara 's bid for eu membership were decisive .
if turkey 's reforms develop further , then " we could stabilize the land and create a link between european enlightenment and non-fundamentalist islam " , he told reuters deutschland . turkish ambassador calls petition " discrimination " the call for a petition comes as the turkish ambassador in berlin , mehmet ali irtemcelik , called for his 1.9 million compatriots living in germany to do more to integrate themselves in their adopted country .
" it is important for the image of turkey for our citizens to contribute to this land . "
irtemcelik criticized the call for the petition against turkey 's eu membership , calling it " discrimination .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.10.2004 renewables made in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exporting renewable energy could become a profitable business at a time when oil prices are at a record high , germany is one of the world 's leaders in developing renewable energy .
after progress in wind and solar power , germans are looking to find a replacement for gasoline . last week , oil prices reached an all time high , breaking the $ 50 per barrel mark .
fuelled by political instability in the middle east and africa and a series of hurricanes in the united states , the per barrel price peaked at $ 50.47 -lrb- € 40.65 -rrb- .
the situation highlighted , once again , how precarious the world 's oil supply is and the cost of relying too heavily on traditional fossil fuels . germans have long sensed the looming crisis and invested millions in the development of renewable energy .
the 2000 renewable energy law paved the way for serious progress in the fields of solar and wind energy , and germany is now well on its way to meeting the goal of having 12 percent of all electricity come from renewable energy by 2010 . the effort has proven so effective that the worldwatch institute , one of the world 's leading environmental organizations , has singled out germany for special praise in its annual " state of the world " report . a lucrative new field ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : windmills in northern germany encouraged by that success , the german government and researchers are looking to replace good old-fashioned gasoline .
a new law making so-called " biofuels " tax exempt and technologies in development at a few start-up german firms are making a good start .
but the nagging question remains : is renewable energy profitable ?
the answer is yes , say exporters , if producers look beyond germany 's borders for markets . at a symposium in chicago on monday entitled " renewable energy , made in germany " sponsored by the german energy agency -lrb- dena -rrb- and its renewable energy export initiative companies researching biofuels and their collegues in other renewable sectors will showcase their latest products to the rest of the world - all in the hopes of drumming-up a little business abroad . germany , long a leading exporter of many products , may find that its investment in renewable energy technologies , will not only be good for the earth , but good for business , daniel becker the project leader of dena 's export initiative , told dw-world .
" it 's important to develop the technology , but also to market it well , " he said .
" to make renewable energies profitable - and thus lucrative to produce - we need to seek out new markets . "
that goes for the solar and wind technologies german firms are already widely respected for , and the newer biofuels still in development . law fosters progress in wind and solar energy in 2000 , german chancellor gerhard schröder 's incoming government and his coalition partner , the green party , made a huge commitment to the environment and passed the renewable energy law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rapeseed oil is transformed into biodiesel in schwarzheide in the german state of brandenburg .
it required electricity utilities to purchase a certain amount of power from renewable sources at a premium rate each year - basically , price-fixing .
and the plan - now widely considered an excellent example of how legislation can spur the development of new technology - worked .
the percentage of electricity from renewables has jumped from 4.7 percent in 1998 to 10 percent . " germany chose a price-fixing scheme , as have other countries such as spain and france , and in every case , the approach has contributed to the development of a stable market for renewable energies , particularly solar and wind power , " johannes lackmann , president of the german renewable energy association -lrb- bee -rrb- , told dw-world . biofuel , the next big thing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saxony-based choren specializes in producing biofuels .
it 's precisely that kind of success that the german government is now hoping to replicate in the development of alternatives to gasoline , hans-joseph fell , a spokesman for the green party 's research and technology division , told dw-world . and he reckons there 's a pretty good chance that up to 10 to 20 percent of traditional gasoline usage could be replaced by biofuels in five years time .
to help make those fuels more attractive and affordable , the german government passed a new law this year exempting biofuels from taxes . lackman of the bee also thinks the usage of biofuels will grow , though his estimates are conservative .
he reckons the current 1 percent market share will grow to 6 percent by 2010 .
" with this new tax exemption , we are going to see lots of growth in the biofuel sector , " he said . sundiesel , biodiesel and more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chroen 's " sundiesel beetle " runs on biodiesel .
numerous german companies are hoping to profit , including choren industries from the state of saxony , developers of " sun diesel , " and hamburg 's adm-oelmühle , developers of a biodiesel product .
both fuels fall under the umbrella of biomass energy , a vary large and diverse category .
they are environmentally friendlier fuels made out of vegetable oil , sugars , wood - almost anything that grows in the earth , as fell of the green party likes to put it . by developing such technologies , germany is chasing the coattails of brazil , where biofuels already have a 30 percent market share .
if it works more so-called " flex-fuel " cars , already popular in brazil , could soon be cruising the streets of germany . kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany opens world 's biggest solar plant the world ’ s biggest solar power plant was inaugurated in the german town of espenhain wednesday .

but iceland and britain are in for praise . the european network for smoking prevention will release a report ranking the european union 's 25 member states , as well as iceland , norway and switzerland , in terms of their progress on a range of anti-smoking measures .
the report heavily criticizes germany for its weak implementation of the anti-smoking measures , which were recommended by the world bank .
bottom ten germany ranked among the lowest 10 countries in the study , which graded the nations on the basis of six specific criteria .
these included increased taxes on cigarettes , smoke-free policies in offices , bars and restaurants , anti-tobacco advertising , and clear warnings on cigarette packages .
the survey also rated access to treatment for nicotine addiction , and increased government " tobacco control " budgets , which go to fund other anti-smoking measures .

but opposition candidates have accused him of favoritism . german chancellor gerhard schröder arrived in afghanistan on monday amid criticisms that his whistle-stop tour , which will be spent predominantly in the company of hamid karzai , the man expected to be named the country 's first freely elected president , shows bias . schröder landed in kabul just two days after afghanistan 's first ever democratic elections on saturday and his itinerary for the six hour tour , apart from visits to schools supported by german charities and institutions and german troops serving with the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , is dominated by talks with the us- and pakistan-blessed interim afghan president .
there are no plans to meet with any other of the nominees or politicians involved in the weekend 's historic vote . it was intended to be a visit to show german support for the democratization and stabilization efforts of a land that has suffered almost 20 years of civil war and the rule of the radical taliban regime .
instead , schröder found himself in the firing line of critics which claim his visit was evidence of the favoritism offered to karzai by western leaders . germany has decided winner , says candidate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while karzai is expected to make history by becoming afghanistan 's first democratically president when the official announcement comes on october 30 , one opposition candidate , mohammad mahfuz nedahi , told reporters that schröder 's agenda shows that germany has already decided how the vote has gone and has shown its true colors .
" germany supports us policy one hundred percent , " he said on sunday night . another , abdul latif pedram , echoed nedahi 's complaints saying that europe should been seen as supporting the democratic process and not a single nominee .
a candidate who did not want to be named added that schröder should not have come to kabul " in such a sensitive situation . "
others have expressed confusion over schröder 's timing as the election is over and his support now can achieve little . schröder lauds courageous vote despite the criticism , schröder has said that the peaceful process of voting and the high voter turnout suggests that the people of afghanistan have shown great courage in pursuing democracy and stability . as the debate rages over whether irregularities in the election had undermined the process , afghan election officials agreed on sunday to create an independent commission to probe opposition charges of fraud in the presidential poll . threat of boycott averted by probe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : originally , all 15 challengers announced they would boycott the outcome in the immediate aftermath of revelations that supposedly indelible ink used to mark voters ' thumbs in some polling stations could be rubbed off , allowing some people to vote more than once . however two candidates have since backed off , saying they wanted a commission to rule on whether the voting was fair and indicating they would accept its decision . " there is going to be an independent commission made to investigate it , " electoral director farooq wardak said in a statement .
" there could be mistakes ; we are just human beings .
my colleagues might have made a mistake . " an american delegation observing the election showed karzai with a clear majority of votes and his principal challenger , yonus qanooni , a former cabinet minister , running a distant second .
karzai needs a majority to avoid a runoff vote . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : a flawed success opposition candidates in afghanistan 's presidential elections have called for a repeat because of irregularities .
it 's a demand that could seriously harm the country 's budding democracy , according to dw 's karen fischer .

the cdu chief told german television station zdf that the cdu were considering taking their resistance to turkey 's membership of the eu to the streets and reiterated an earlier call for an alternative offer .
" i think we should consider having a petition for privileged partnership and against full membership , " merkel said , adding that the petition was likely to be carried out . the proposal for a petition against turkish membership was originally presented by michael glos , a senior politician in the cdu 's sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
last month , merkel sent a letter to conservative politicians across europe , calling for a united front against turkey 's bid to enter the eu .
among the letter 's recipients were italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin , dutch prime minister jan-peter balkenende and greek prime minister kostas karamanlis .
merkel recommends alternative to membership in the letter , merkel proposed offering turkey a privileged partnership with the european union rather than a full membership .
she praised turkey 's recent reforms but said the european union would be overwhelmed if it tried to take turkey in as a full member .
merkel and others have said turkey 's large and growing population , which might eclipse germany 's as early as 2020 , mean the poor , muslim country would place too much economic and cultural pressure on current eu states if it were admitted to the union .
despite merkel throwing her political weight behind the petition idea , there is no blanket support for the proposal .
the leader of the european parliament foreign affairs committee , christian democrat mep elmar brok told reuters that he " suffered stomach aches over the proposal . " other options a possibility , says brok bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elmar brok .
brok added that the european commission recommendation that turkey begin entry talks without a guaranteed outcome clearly implied that options other than accession were possible .
he noted the eu executive had said last week that whatever the result , turkey should remain " fully anchored in european structures . " " that 's a clear indication that it is considering other possibilities in the relationship , " he said .
however , volker beck , parliamentary leader of the greens , the junior partner in germany 's ruling coalition , called the initiative " foul " and " irresponsible " , according to the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . g erman chancellor gerhard schröder too said that for him the strategic and security policy arguments for ankara 's bid for eu membership were decisive .
if turkey 's reforms develop further , then " we could stabilize the land and create a link between european enlightenment and non-fundamentalist islam " , he told reuters deutschland . turkish ambassador calls petition " discrimination " the call for a petition comes as the turkish ambassador in berlin , mehmet ali irtemcelik , called for his 1.9 million compatriots living in germany to do more to integrate themselves in their adopted country .

the cdu chief told german television station zdf that the cdu were considering taking their resistance to turkey 's membership of the eu to the streets and reiterated an earlier call for an alternative offer .
" i think we should consider having a petition for privileged partnership and against full membership , " merkel said , adding that the petition was likely to be carried out . the proposal for a petition against turkish membership was originally presented by michael glos , a senior politician in the cdu 's sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
last month , merkel sent a letter to conservative politicians across europe , calling for a united front against turkey 's bid to enter the eu .
among the letter 's recipients were italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin , dutch prime minister jan-peter balkenende and greek prime minister kostas karamanlis .
merkel recommends alternative to membership in the letter , merkel proposed offering turkey a privileged partnership with the european union rather than a full membership .
she praised turkey 's recent reforms but said the european union would be overwhelmed if it tried to take turkey in as a full member .
merkel and others have said turkey 's large and growing population , which might eclipse germany 's as early as 2020 , mean the poor , muslim country would place too much economic and cultural pressure on current eu states if it were admitted to the union .
despite merkel throwing her political weight behind the petition idea , there is no blanket support for the proposal .
the leader of the european parliament foreign affairs committee , christian democrat mep elmar brok told reuters that he " suffered stomach aches over the proposal . " other options a possibility , says brok bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elmar brok .
brok added that the european commission recommendation that turkey begin entry talks without a guaranteed outcome clearly implied that options other than accession were possible .
he noted the eu executive had said last week that whatever the result , turkey should remain " fully anchored in european structures . " " that 's a clear indication that it is considering other possibilities in the relationship , " he said .
however , volker beck , parliamentary leader of the greens , the junior partner in germany 's ruling coalition , called the initiative " foul " and " irresponsible " , according to the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . g erman chancellor gerhard schröder too said that for him the strategic and security policy arguments for ankara 's bid for eu membership were decisive .
if turkey 's reforms develop further , then " we could stabilize the land and create a link between european enlightenment and non-fundamentalist islam " , he told reuters deutschland . turkish ambassador calls petition " discrimination " the call for a petition comes as the turkish ambassador in berlin , mehmet ali irtemcelik , called for his 1.9 million compatriots living in germany to do more to integrate themselves in their adopted country .
" it is important for the image of turkey for our citizens to contribute to this land . "
irtemcelik criticized the call for the petition against turkey 's eu membership , calling it " discrimination .

this was the message delivered by economics and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia at a conference in amsterdam on monday to assess the euro 's first five years .
" overall , emu -lsb- economic and monetary union -rsb- has succeeded in delivering macroeconomic stability , but it has not yet delivered economic dynamism , " said almunia .
he blamed the lack of dynamism on the inflexibility of the euro zone 's product and labour markets .
despite these problems , the euro was hailed as " the second most important currency on the international market " and mr almunia noted that about 50 countries have an exchange rate regime linked to the euro .

the cdu chief told german television station zdf that the cdu were considering taking their resistance to turkey 's membership of the eu to the streets and reiterated an earlier call for an alternative offer .
" i think we should consider having a petition for privileged partnership and against full membership , " merkel said , adding that the petition was likely to be carried out . the proposal for a petition against turkish membership was originally presented by michael glos , a senior politician in the cdu 's sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
last month , merkel sent a letter to conservative politicians across europe , calling for a united front against turkey 's bid to enter the eu .
among the letter 's recipients were italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin , dutch prime minister jan-peter balkenende and greek prime minister kostas karamanlis .
merkel recommends alternative to membership in the letter , merkel proposed offering turkey a privileged partnership with the european union rather than a full membership .
she praised turkey 's recent reforms but said the european union would be overwhelmed if it tried to take turkey in as a full member .
merkel and others have said turkey 's large and growing population , which might eclipse germany 's as early as 2020 , mean the poor , muslim country would place too much economic and cultural pressure on current eu states if it were admitted to the union .
despite merkel throwing her political weight behind the petition idea , there is no blanket support for the proposal .
the leader of the european parliament foreign affairs committee , christian democrat mep elmar brok told reuters that he " suffered stomach aches over the proposal . " other options a possibility , says brok bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elmar brok .
brok added that the european commission recommendation that turkey begin entry talks without a guaranteed outcome clearly implied that options other than accession were possible .
he noted the eu executive had said last week that whatever the result , turkey should remain " fully anchored in european structures . " " that 's a clear indication that it is considering other possibilities in the relationship , " he said .
however , volker beck , parliamentary leader of the greens , the junior partner in germany 's ruling coalition , called the initiative " foul " and " irresponsible " , according to the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . g erman chancellor gerhard schröder too said that for him the strategic and security policy arguments for ankara 's bid for eu membership were decisive .
if turkey 's reforms develop further , then " we could stabilize the land and create a link between european enlightenment and non-fundamentalist islam " , he told reuters deutschland . turkish ambassador calls petition " discrimination " the call for a petition comes as the turkish ambassador in berlin , mehmet ali irtemcelik , called for his 1.9 million compatriots living in germany to do more to integrate themselves in their adopted country .
" it is important for the image of turkey for our citizens to contribute to this land . "
irtemcelik criticized the call for the petition against turkey 's eu membership , calling it " discrimination .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 11.10.2004 france moves to strengthen china ties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a welcome for chirac near a mao statue in shanghai german investment in china is huge , but it could now be facing competition from france as paris hopes to consolidate its business foothold in the vast asian economy with a visit by president jacques chirac . beijing appears to be keen on strengthening its relationship with the european union and the chinese authorities have even cited german and scandinavian social and business practices as a sort of working model for the future of chinese business .
the admiration is mutual : in the coming months , germany is expected to step up its efforts to court chinese business in preparation for chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s planned visit to beijing in december .
france in the forefront but germany is n't the only one getting in on the limelight . at the moment , it is france that that 's wooing chinese corporate giants . french and chinese companies have already signed around 20 contracts worth over $ 4 billion -lrb- € 3.2 billion -rrb- in the lead-up to french president jacques chirac ’ s arrival in shanghai from beijing on monday .
the biggest orders have gone to airbus and the train-maker alstrom .
according to the associated press , chirac said his meetings with chinese president hu jintao had " emphasized our determination to further strengthen french-chinese relations .
our cooperative relationship will serve the world of the future . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french-designed tgv-a high speed train france is also lobbying for use of its tgv train on a high-speed line between beijing and shanghai , and chirac said he hoped china would buy the trains " before much longer . " jin canrong , professor of international relations at remin university of china , told dw-radio that europe 's role as important trading partner for his country continues to grow .
' the year of europe ' " the foreign ministry of china defined this year as ' the year of europe ' in chinese diplomacy .
early october last year , we issued the first policy statement on the region .
so this now occupies a very important position in china ’ s global strategy , and to improve china ’ s international standing , " he said .
jin also said beijing has used the eu as a model for its market and political policies .
" in the inner mind of the chinese elite , the model of europe always has a strong opinion , to -lrb- the -rrb- extent that china is rather market orientated economy ...
but the political nature of china , i think the so-called cooperative market model represented by germany and especially the scandinavian countries , is more attractive to the chinese elite . "
france ’ s trade success in china has not gone unnoticed by other european nations .
economists predict paris ’ assertive diplomacy could intensify the race by eu states to gain a foothold in the world ’ s most promising markets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder with indian prime minister manmohan singh the german strategy appears to be an attempt to strengthen its business ties to asia not only within china , but elsewhere .
on his recent diplomatic trip to asia , german chancellor gerhard schröder suggested that germany may also want to beef up investment elsewhere on the continent - for instance , in india .
france is behind germany in terms of business investment in china , which imports more than three times more from germany than from france .
how open is open ?
but paris has indicated that france has the potential to catch up with germany over the next decade .
for its part , there is a huge debate in china as to how far the communist country should open up its markets to europe , professor jin said .
" economic nationalists say china is -lrb- already -rrb- open too far .
china is a more open economy than our neighboring countries , such as the republic of korea , and japan .
the dominant opinion is that china should do more to continue to open its markets .
the market situation is very complicated so the opening process should be taken gradually .
we can not afford a dramatic change , " he noted .
but he said china has its own demands for the eu .
" first china wants market economy status .
the second thing china wants is a lifting of the arms sales embargo .
third , china hopes the eu will take a stronger position against the separation movement in taiwan . "
human rights concerns human rights groups fear that this increase in competition for business in china could lead to european countries turning a blind eye to beijing ’ s poor human rights record .
but jin said beijing is mindful of what the eu thinks on the matter .
he claimed the country is making some progress in improving its human rights record . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de catching the slow boat to china hamburg-based architects gerkan , marg und partner have won an international competition to build the national museum of china in beijing .

maier 's departure comes at a time when his charges - germany 's top keepers bayern munich 's oliver kahn and arsenal 's jens lehmann - continue to air their feud in public .
both kahn and lehmann have made a claim of the number one jersey and have often stooped to personal abuse in their campaigns to unseat and unsettle the other . the feud between the two shot-stoppers seems to have cost sepp maier his job as klinsmann continues to assert an increasingly tight strangle hold on team affairs .
maier angered klinsmann last week by going public with remarks that oliver kahn was better than rival lehmann . the goalkeeping legend , who is also kahn 's goalie coach at bayern munich , was warned by klinsmann for similar comments last month .
maier had demanded the coach give kahn unequivocal backing as the country 's first choice keeper . number one jersey up for grabs , says coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jens lehmann .

klinsmann has gone on record by saying , " it 's an open position just like every other on the team . " maier appears to have paid the price for crossing klinsmann and for stoking the fires of the simmering goalie argument .

the apparent forcing-out of maier has prompted harsh criticism from former germany captain lothar matthaeus .
the world cup-winning skipper and international cap record holder told the munich tageszeitung newspaper on monday that klinsmann was a " cold-blooded killer " for sacking goalkeeping coach maier . " jürgen is going his way in a cold-blooded manner , " matthaeus said .

maier 's departure comes at a time when his charges - germany 's top keepers bayern munich 's oliver kahn and arsenal 's jens lehmann - continue to air their feud in public .
both kahn and lehmann have made a claim of the number one jersey and have often stooped to personal abuse in their campaigns to unseat and unsettle the other . the feud between the two shot-stoppers seems to have cost sepp maier his job as klinsmann continues to assert an increasingly tight strangle hold on team affairs .
maier angered klinsmann last week by going public with remarks that oliver kahn was better than rival lehmann . the goalkeeping legend , who is also kahn 's goalie coach at bayern munich , was warned by klinsmann for similar comments last month .
maier had demanded the coach give kahn unequivocal backing as the country 's first choice keeper . number one jersey up for grabs , says coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jens lehmann .
the germany coach has broken with the tradition of having a designated number one by saying that kahn , a two-time fifa keeper of the year , remains first choice at the moment , but that lehmann -lrb- photo -rrb- would get his chance to earn the job .
klinsmann has gone on record by saying , " it 's an open position just like every other on the team . " maier appears to have paid the price for crossing klinsmann and for stoking the fires of the simmering goalie argument .
oliver bierhoff , the germany team manager under klinsmann , told reporters on sunday that maier had been spoken to before agreeing to step down .

the apparent forcing-out of maier has prompted harsh criticism from former germany captain lothar matthaeus .
the world cup-winning skipper and international cap record holder told the munich tageszeitung newspaper on monday that klinsmann was a " cold-blooded killer " for sacking goalkeeping coach maier . " jürgen is going his way in a cold-blooded manner , " matthaeus said .
" he 's a killer - in the past on the pitch and now in the dfb .

maier 's departure comes at a time when his charges - germany 's top keepers bayern munich 's oliver kahn and arsenal 's jens lehmann - continue to air their feud in public .
both kahn and lehmann have made a claim of the number one jersey and have often stooped to personal abuse in their campaigns to unseat and unsettle the other . the feud between the two shot-stoppers seems to have cost sepp maier his job as klinsmann continues to assert an increasingly tight strangle hold on team affairs .
maier angered klinsmann last week by going public with remarks that oliver kahn was better than rival lehmann . the goalkeeping legend , who is also kahn 's goalie coach at bayern munich , was warned by klinsmann for similar comments last month .
maier had demanded the coach give kahn unequivocal backing as the country 's first choice keeper . number one jersey up for grabs , says coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jens lehmann .
the germany coach has broken with the tradition of having a designated number one by saying that kahn , a two-time fifa keeper of the year , remains first choice at the moment , but that lehmann -lrb- photo -rrb- would get his chance to earn the job .
klinsmann has gone on record by saying , " it 's an open position just like every other on the team . " maier appears to have paid the price for crossing klinsmann and for stoking the fires of the simmering goalie argument .
oliver bierhoff , the germany team manager under klinsmann , told reporters on sunday that maier had been spoken to before agreeing to step down .
" we made it clear to him that it ca n't go on like this , " he said . matthaeus anger at " cold-blooded killer " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lothar matthaeus .
the apparent forcing-out of maier has prompted harsh criticism from former germany captain lothar matthaeus .
the world cup-winning skipper and international cap record holder told the munich tageszeitung newspaper on monday that klinsmann was a " cold-blooded killer " for sacking goalkeeping coach maier . " jürgen is going his way in a cold-blooded manner , " matthaeus said .
" he 's a killer - in the past on the pitch and now in the dfb .
there 's no humanity left .
he 's letting heads roll to accomplish his aims . " no quarter in bid for world cup glory klinsmann is in the midst of a huge shake-up of the three time world champions as he attempts to rebuild a side which he hopes will achieve great things come 2006 and bring the coveted title back to germany . the message being sent out appears to be one that petty arguments that threaten to distract the team and the coach from that aim will be sorted out by klinsmann if they can not be resolved by the people involved . keepers to be warned klinsmann is likely to tackle the two goalies , whose rivalry has generated steady headlines in germany and is regarded as a source of tension on the team , head on to end the feud once and for all .
" jürgen will make it clear to both ' keepers before the next cap that they have to follow the rules , " bierhoff said .
" bluntly said , they should keep their mouths shut and concentrate on their performances . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz beckenbauer .
other figures , namely germany ' soccer monarch franz beckenbauer , have complained about the goalkeeping stand-off .

" but eu foreign ministers also voiced continued concern over a death sentence hanging over five bulgarian nurses and one palestinian medic accused by libyan authorities of infecting hundreds of children with the aids virus . " libya is among the first countries to dismantle voluntarily its weapons of mass destruction programs under international supervision through a transparent and cooperative process , " they said .
but at the same time they " invited libya to respond positively to the eu 's policy of engagement ...
in this light , it insisted that libya resolves remaining eu concerns , notably the case of the bulgarian and palestinian medical workers . " rome has for several months been pressing its eu counterparts to lift the arms embargo imposed on libya in 1986 , in order to be able to deliver equipment to tripoli to beef up its frontiers .
sanctions were imposed on libya because of its role in state-sponsored terrorism , including the 1988 lockerbie bombing . they were partially eased last year , paving the way for tripoli to compensate victims ' families .
the eu eased sanctions against tripoli in 1999 but maintained a series of restrictive measures on key products , notably military equipment , which libya has sought in order to keep a better check on its borders .
rome considers libya a major hub for clandestine migrants from african countries and has already signed cooperation agreements to help the libyan authorities combat the problem . " cooperation with libya on migration is essential and urgent , " said the eu ministers in a statement after their luxembourg talks .
the eu move comes amid a rapid loosening of sanctions and a thaw in relations since last year , when tripoli took responsibility for the lockerbie bombing and agreed to pay 2.7 billion dollars in compensation . ditching wmds the rapprochement then gathered steam with libya 's surprise decision in december to renounce and dismantle its weapons of mass destruction under us , british and international supervision .
last month us president george w. bush removed most economic sanctions on libya , clearing the way for huge compensation payments to the families of victims of the lockerbie bombing . the eu celebrated its restored ties with libya notably when moammar gadhafi visited brussels in april , his first trip to western europe in 15 years . the bulgarian nurses and a palestinian doctor were sentenced to death in may by a libyan court after a four-year trial which ended with their conviction on charges of knowingly injecting children with tainted blood products .
the eu - which bulgaria is hoping to join in 2007 - has protested the sentences and accused the libyan authorities of violating the rights of the accused . " we are very concerned about the situation -lrb- of -rrb- the bulgarian citizens , " said spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos .

the cdu chief told german television station zdf that the cdu were considering taking their resistance to turkey 's membership of the eu to the streets and reiterated an earlier call for an alternative offer .
" i think we should consider having a petition for privileged partnership and against full membership , " merkel said , adding that the petition was likely to be carried out . the proposal for a petition against turkish membership was originally presented by michael glos , a senior politician in the cdu 's sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
last month , merkel sent a letter to conservative politicians across europe , calling for a united front against turkey 's bid to enter the eu .
among the letter 's recipients were italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin , dutch prime minister jan-peter balkenende and greek prime minister kostas karamanlis .
merkel recommends alternative to membership in the letter , merkel proposed offering turkey a privileged partnership with the european union rather than a full membership .
she praised turkey 's recent reforms but said the european union would be overwhelmed if it tried to take turkey in as a full member .
merkel and others have said turkey 's large and growing population , which might eclipse germany 's as early as 2020 , mean the poor , muslim country would place too much economic and cultural pressure on current eu states if it were admitted to the union .
despite merkel throwing her political weight behind the petition idea , there is no blanket support for the proposal .
the leader of the european parliament foreign affairs committee , christian democrat mep elmar brok told reuters that he " suffered stomach aches over the proposal . " other options a possibility , says brok bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elmar brok .
brok added that the european commission recommendation that turkey begin entry talks without a guaranteed outcome clearly implied that options other than accession were possible .
he noted the eu executive had said last week that whatever the result , turkey should remain " fully anchored in european structures . " " that 's a clear indication that it is considering other possibilities in the relationship , " he said .
however , volker beck , parliamentary leader of the greens , the junior partner in germany 's ruling coalition , called the initiative " foul " and " irresponsible " , according to the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . g erman chancellor gerhard schröder too said that for him the strategic and security policy arguments for ankara 's bid for eu membership were decisive .
if turkey 's reforms develop further , then " we could stabilize the land and create a link between european enlightenment and non-fundamentalist islam " , he told reuters deutschland . turkish ambassador calls petition " discrimination " the call for a petition comes as the turkish ambassador in berlin , mehmet ali irtemcelik , called for his 1.9 million compatriots living in germany to do more to integrate themselves in their adopted country .
" it is important for the image of turkey for our citizens to contribute to this land . "
irtemcelik criticized the call for the petition against turkey 's eu membership , calling it " discrimination . " the final decision of whether to start membership negotiations with turkey lies with eu leaders who meet in brussels for a summit on december 17 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey 's eu moment of truth turkey 's chances of starting negotiations for member status in the european union have come to a head .

but opposition candidates have accused him of favoritism . german chancellor gerhard schröder arrived in afghanistan on monday amid criticisms that his whistle-stop tour , which will be spent predominantly in the company of hamid karzai , the man expected to be named the country 's first freely elected president , shows bias . schröder landed in kabul just two days after afghanistan 's first ever democratic elections on saturday and his itinerary for the six hour tour , apart from visits to schools supported by german charities and institutions and german troops serving with the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , is dominated by talks with the us- and pakistan-blessed interim afghan president .
there are no plans to meet with any other of the nominees or politicians involved in the weekend 's historic vote . it was intended to be a visit to show german support for the democratization and stabilization efforts of a land that has suffered almost 20 years of civil war and the rule of the radical taliban regime .
instead , schröder found himself in the firing line of critics which claim his visit was evidence of the favoritism offered to karzai by western leaders . germany has decided winner , says candidate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while karzai is expected to make history by becoming afghanistan 's first democratically president when the official announcement comes on october 30 , one opposition candidate , mohammad mahfuz nedahi , told reporters that schröder 's agenda shows that germany has already decided how the vote has gone and has shown its true colors .
" germany supports us policy one hundred percent , " he said on sunday night . another , abdul latif pedram , echoed nedahi 's complaints saying that europe should been seen as supporting the democratic process and not a single nominee .
a candidate who did not want to be named added that schröder should not have come to kabul " in such a sensitive situation . "
others have expressed confusion over schröder 's timing as the election is over and his support now can achieve little . schröder lauds courageous vote despite the criticism , schröder has said that the peaceful process of voting and the high voter turnout suggests that the people of afghanistan have shown great courage in pursuing democracy and stability . as the debate rages over whether irregularities in the election had undermined the process , afghan election officials agreed on sunday to create an independent commission to probe opposition charges of fraud in the presidential poll . threat of boycott averted by probe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : originally , all 15 challengers announced they would boycott the outcome in the immediate aftermath of revelations that supposedly indelible ink used to mark voters ' thumbs in some polling stations could be rubbed off , allowing some people to vote more than once . however two candidates have since backed off , saying they wanted a commission to rule on whether the voting was fair and indicating they would accept its decision . " there is going to be an independent commission made to investigate it , " electoral director farooq wardak said in a statement .
" there could be mistakes ; we are just human beings .
my colleagues might have made a mistake . " an american delegation observing the election showed karzai with a clear majority of votes and his principal challenger , yonus qanooni , a former cabinet minister , running a distant second .

after progress in wind and solar power , germans are looking to find a replacement for gasoline . last week , oil prices reached an all time high , breaking the $ 50 per barrel mark .
fuelled by political instability in the middle east and africa and a series of hurricanes in the united states , the per barrel price peaked at $ 50.47 -lrb- € 40.65 -rrb- .
the situation highlighted , once again , how precarious the world 's oil supply is and the cost of relying too heavily on traditional fossil fuels . germans have long sensed the looming crisis and invested millions in the development of renewable energy .
the 2000 renewable energy law paved the way for serious progress in the fields of solar and wind energy , and germany is now well on its way to meeting the goal of having 12 percent of all electricity come from renewable energy by 2010 . the effort has proven so effective that the worldwatch institute , one of the world 's leading environmental organizations , has singled out germany for special praise in its annual " state of the world " report . a lucrative new field ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : windmills in northern germany encouraged by that success , the german government and researchers are looking to replace good old-fashioned gasoline .
a new law making so-called " biofuels " tax exempt and technologies in development at a few start-up german firms are making a good start .
but the nagging question remains : is renewable energy profitable ?
the answer is yes , say exporters , if producers look beyond germany 's borders for markets . at a symposium in chicago on monday entitled " renewable energy , made in germany " sponsored by the german energy agency -lrb- dena -rrb- and its renewable energy export initiative companies researching biofuels and their collegues in other renewable sectors will showcase their latest products to the rest of the world - all in the hopes of drumming-up a little business abroad . germany , long a leading exporter of many products , may find that its investment in renewable energy technologies , will not only be good for the earth , but good for business , daniel becker the project leader of dena 's export initiative , told dw-world .
" it 's important to develop the technology , but also to market it well , " he said .
" to make renewable energies profitable - and thus lucrative to produce - we need to seek out new markets . "
that goes for the solar and wind technologies german firms are already widely respected for , and the newer biofuels still in development . law fosters progress in wind and solar energy in 2000 , german chancellor gerhard schröder 's incoming government and his coalition partner , the green party , made a huge commitment to the environment and passed the renewable energy law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rapeseed oil is transformed into biodiesel in schwarzheide in the german state of brandenburg .

" germany chose a price-fixing scheme , as have other countries such as spain and france , and in every case , the approach has contributed to the development of a stable market for renewable energies , particularly solar and wind power , " johannes lackmann , president of the german renewable energy association -lrb- bee -rrb- , told dw-world . biofuel , the next big thing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saxony-based choren specializes in producing biofuels .
it 's precisely that kind of success that the german government is now hoping to replicate in the development of alternatives to gasoline , hans-joseph fell , a spokesman for the green party 's research and technology division , told dw-world . and he reckons there 's a pretty good chance that up to 10 to 20 percent of traditional gasoline usage could be replaced by biofuels in five years time .
to help make those fuels more attractive and affordable , the german government passed a new law this year exempting biofuels from taxes . lackman of the bee also thinks the usage of biofuels will grow , though his estimates are conservative .
he reckons the current 1 percent market share will grow to 6 percent by 2010 .
" with this new tax exemption , we are going to see lots of growth in the biofuel sector , " he said . sundiesel , biodiesel and more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chroen 's " sundiesel beetle " runs on biodiesel .

they are environmentally friendlier fuels made out of vegetable oil , sugars , wood - almost anything that grows in the earth , as fell of the green party likes to put it . by developing such technologies , germany is chasing the coattails of brazil , where biofuels already have a 30 percent market share .

the report heavily criticizes germany for its weak implementation of the anti-smoking measures , which were recommended by the world bank .

for 16-19 year-olds , the figure is 45 percent .
the country is a smokers ' paradise , with cheap cigarettes available from machines on street corners and very few restrictions as to where it is or is not acceptable to light up .

but iceland and britain are in for praise . the european network for smoking prevention will release a report ranking the european union 's 25 member states , as well as iceland , norway and switzerland , in terms of their progress on a range of anti-smoking measures .
the report heavily criticizes germany for its weak implementation of the anti-smoking measures , which were recommended by the world bank .
bottom ten germany ranked among the lowest 10 countries in the study , which graded the nations on the basis of six specific criteria .
these included increased taxes on cigarettes , smoke-free policies in offices , bars and restaurants , anti-tobacco advertising , and clear warnings on cigarette packages .
the survey also rated access to treatment for nicotine addiction , and increased government " tobacco control " budgets , which go to fund other anti-smoking measures .
" germany is certainly lagging behind , " luk joossens , who coordinated the network 's report , told the reuters news agency .
" it 's in the lowest 10 countries , so it could clearly do better . "
cheap smokes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoker with cigarette luxembourg and the czech republic are also set to be criticized for keeping cigarette prices very cheap in relation to wages .
on the other hand , iceland won top honors , having implemented almost all of the world bank measures .
britain also scored high , because it makes cigarettes so expensive with tax .
world bank research shows that raising prices by 10 percent cuts cigarette consumption in a wealthy country by four percent .

more young smokers the study also examined smoking rates over the last two decades .
there has been an overall decline in adult smoking in europe , joossens told reuters , but smoking among young people has not fallen over the last 10 years in most regions .
in germany , tobacco consumption among 12-15 year-olds almost doubled over the past ten years , with some 21 percent of girls and 18 percent of boys in the age group smoking regularly .
for 16-19 year-olds , the figure is 45 percent .
the country is a smokers ' paradise , with cheap cigarettes available from machines on street corners and very few restrictions as to where it is or is not acceptable to light up .
in fact , the state of berlin broke new ground this year in implementing a ban on smoking in its schools .
it 's a move which other states are likely to follow , but for the time being children over the age of 16 can smoke in designated areas on school premises provided they present a letter of consent from their parents .
roll your own officially , cigarette sales in germany dropped by nine percent over the previous year in 2003 , and big brand producers have reported trailing sales .
but there is evidence that more smokers have been turning to rolling tobacco and cigars , which have been spared the higher taxation rates dumped on cigarettes over the past couple of years .

the cdu chief told german television station zdf that the cdu were considering taking their resistance to turkey 's membership of the eu to the streets and reiterated an earlier call for an alternative offer .
" i think we should consider having a petition for privileged partnership and against full membership , " merkel said , adding that the petition was likely to be carried out . the proposal for a petition against turkish membership was originally presented by michael glos , a senior politician in the cdu 's sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
last month , merkel sent a letter to conservative politicians across europe , calling for a united front against turkey 's bid to enter the eu .
among the letter 's recipients were italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin , dutch prime minister jan-peter balkenende and greek prime minister kostas karamanlis .
merkel recommends alternative to membership in the letter , merkel proposed offering turkey a privileged partnership with the european union rather than a full membership .
she praised turkey 's recent reforms but said the european union would be overwhelmed if it tried to take turkey in as a full member .
merkel and others have said turkey 's large and growing population , which might eclipse germany 's as early as 2020 , mean the poor , muslim country would place too much economic and cultural pressure on current eu states if it were admitted to the union .
despite merkel throwing her political weight behind the petition idea , there is no blanket support for the proposal .
the leader of the european parliament foreign affairs committee , christian democrat mep elmar brok told reuters that he " suffered stomach aches over the proposal . " other options a possibility , says brok bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elmar brok .
brok added that the european commission recommendation that turkey begin entry talks without a guaranteed outcome clearly implied that options other than accession were possible .
he noted the eu executive had said last week that whatever the result , turkey should remain " fully anchored in european structures . " " that 's a clear indication that it is considering other possibilities in the relationship , " he said .
however , volker beck , parliamentary leader of the greens , the junior partner in germany 's ruling coalition , called the initiative " foul " and " irresponsible " , according to the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . g erman chancellor gerhard schröder too said that for him the strategic and security policy arguments for ankara 's bid for eu membership were decisive .
if turkey 's reforms develop further , then " we could stabilize the land and create a link between european enlightenment and non-fundamentalist islam " , he told reuters deutschland . turkish ambassador calls petition " discrimination " the call for a petition comes as the turkish ambassador in berlin , mehmet ali irtemcelik , called for his 1.9 million compatriots living in germany to do more to integrate themselves in their adopted country .

they lie at crazy angles , half-sunk in the oily water .
scattered across their decks you can see blankets , odd shoes and water bottles , discarded by the lucky passengers who made it ashore .
nearly 10,000 would-be asylum seekers have washed up on italy 's southernmost outpost so far this year .
that 's twice the island 's population .
expelled until october most were shipped onward to neighbouring sicily , where their claims for political refuge were checked .
the government must do something lampedusa hotelier signor rosario but when numbers suddenly swelled the italian government took more drastic measures .
migrants were despatched back handcuffed in military planes from lampedusa direct to libya .
no questions asked .
human rights groups and the united nations refugee agency the unhcr condemned this as indiscriminate and unfair .
and suddenly a holiday island that 's just 20 square kilometres of rock , and which few had ever heard of , is at the centre of an international storm .
illegal immigrants caught arriving in italy , 1 january - 15 september 2004 sicily region -lrb- including lampedusa -rrb- - 9,666 in total calabria region - 23 in total puglia region - 18 in total sleek , italian coastguard cutters cruise the sea off lampedusa to intercept the migrants ' boats as they head across from the coasts of libya and tunisia .
the crew , immaculate in their white uniforms , train powerful binoculars from the rail and scan radar screens in the wheelhouse .
but they can not stem the migration tide .
" every day and every night our patrol boats are out here , " harbour master michel niosi says .
" and we have planes from sicily searching too .
" it 's our job not just to stop these people but to save them from drowning , and we do save many .
but to prevent them coming ? "
he shakes his head .
" we ca n't do that .
there must be political agreement between europe and these african states . "
something needs to be done fast , the islanders of lampedusa will tell you .
they would like to see the back of the " boat people " for good , they say , because news coverage of these uninvited visitors is ruining the one and only industry here - tourism .
tourism hit signor rosario is planting rows of parasols outside his beachfront hotel as he puts the concerns of everyone .
" the economy of this island depends on tourists - 100 % .
when they hear about this problem they do n't want to come here .
" the government must do something .
it must close the door to these people .
close the door and help them in another way . "
but how to do that ?
hundreds of thousands of people have already made their way from the war-torn and the poorest nations of africa to attempt to cross the long mediterranean coast that is now europe 's most fragile frontline .
more will surely follow .
italy 's prime minister silvio berlusconi is taking what steps he can .
he has flown to meet the libyan president colonel gaddafi in tripoli .
and italy , along with britain and germany , has also promoted a controversial plan to build holding camps in north africa and process migrants before they set out to sea .
berlusconi has held urgent talks with gaddafi on immigration that scheme seriously worries several leading humanitarian agencies , who say it would expose already vulnerable people to new risks .
" libya and other countries where these camps might be sited could not be guaranteed to respect international agreements on how to protect refugees , " juergen humburg of the unhcr told me on lampedusa .
" it would be dangerous for these people . "
it is not possible to ask the migrants how they view all of this on the island itself .
the old stone building that has turned into a detention centre has heavy bars on every window , high steel gates and spirals of razor wire .
not even aid workers get inside to meet the inmates .
those who were earlier allowed to go to sicily do have stories to tell however : stories of the risks they took in travelling across africa to go to lampedusa , and of many hours spent on open boats in the scorching sun with no food or water .
they are keen as well to explain what drove them to this .
in the southern sicilian town of agrigento 60 or more men from countries like sudan , the ivory coast , ethiopia and eritrea queue up with their trays to be served lunch of pasta and chicken by cheerful local volunteers .
all are quick to deny they are economic migrants .
dangerous crossing a tall eritrean in his mid-20s has a typical tale .
" i was a soldier with the army and i fought for six years , " he says .
" my captain told me to shoot men who had deserted from the war , and i was not willing .
so i had to run away .
illegal immigrants are escorted onto a plane by italian police " i paid $ 1,000 to cross to lampedusa from tunisia but something was wrong with the boat so we had to go back .
i had to pay another $ 1,000 to try again - that time from libya .
" it was so dangerous on the sea , but i had no choice .
they would not let me stay in libya or tunisia . "
so are his troubles over now ?
no , he is grateful to the social workers at the centre and to the italian government for their hospitality but still does not have permanent refugee papers .
and it will be some months before his appeal to stay is finally processed .
" until now i have n't got political asylum and i do n't know if i will , " he says .
" while we all wait here it is very hard .
we can eat but we must sleep on the street .
we have hardly any clothes and no money .
we can not get a job when we are in this situation .
" i wish that europe , that all nations were aware of our problems . "
at the centre that evening a dozen of the migrants sit at tables to learn some italian - basic greetings and how to ask for a cup of tea .
there is laughter as they get the phrases wrong , light relief as their wait for the chance of a new life goes on .

hundreds of thousands of people have already made their way from the war-torn and the poorest nations of africa to attempt to cross the long mediterranean coast that is now europe 's most fragile frontline .
more will surely follow .
italy 's prime minister silvio berlusconi is taking what steps he can .
he has flown to meet the libyan president colonel gaddafi in tripoli .
and italy , along with britain and germany , has also promoted a controversial plan to build holding camps in north africa and process migrants before they set out to sea .
berlusconi has held urgent talks with gaddafi on immigration that scheme seriously worries several leading humanitarian agencies , who say it would expose already vulnerable people to new risks .
" libya and other countries where these camps might be sited could not be guaranteed to respect international agreements on how to protect refugees , " juergen humburg of the unhcr told me on lampedusa .
" it would be dangerous for these people . "
it is not possible to ask the migrants how they view all of this on the island itself .
the old stone building that has turned into a detention centre has heavy bars on every window , high steel gates and spirals of razor wire .
not even aid workers get inside to meet the inmates .
those who were earlier allowed to go to sicily do have stories to tell however : stories of the risks they took in travelling across africa to go to lampedusa , and of many hours spent on open boats in the scorching sun with no food or water .
they are keen as well to explain what drove them to this .
in the southern sicilian town of agrigento 60 or more men from countries like sudan , the ivory coast , ethiopia and eritrea queue up with their trays to be served lunch of pasta and chicken by cheerful local volunteers .

danielle beccan was killed in an apparently random shooting as she walked home from a funfair with a group of friends .
danielle was hit once in the abdomen when a number of rounds were shot from a moving car .
police have described the killing as " senseless " and are trying to establish if it was a case of mistaken identity .
' appalling crime ' the schoolgirl died yards from her home in the st ann 's area of nottingham .
assistant chief constable sue fish said : " clearly people are very shocked and revolted by this appalling crime .
" it is a very emotive crime .
it is a terrible and sickening crime .
" we need to know the motive - we need to know whether this was a case of mistaken identity . "
ms fish declined to give any details about the person arrested , except to say they were from nottinghamshire .
city 's history of gun killings nottinghamshire police - who on average dealt with more than one shooting a week in 2003 - made a fresh appeal for help .
they want information about a gold-coloured car , believed to have blacked-out windows , which is thought to have carried the killer .
officers are also keen to trace members of a 30-strong group of youths who were nearby when danielle was shot .
superintendent dave colbeck said officers had received intelligence that there could be trouble at the goose fair , where the teenager had spent the evening .
but he said that , although measures had been put into place to combat any problems , the information was not specific and no extra patrols were operated in the st ann 's area .
he added that , before danielle 's killing , there had been no shooting-related injuries in nottingham for four months .
' enough is enough ' the congregation of chasewood baptist church , where danielle 's family worship , paid tribute to her at their sunday service .
reverend anna ratcliffe has been comforting the family over the weekend and told bbc radio nottingham there is great shock and disbelief in the area and a growing sense that " enough is enough " .
danielle 's grandfather , alvin beccan , was tearful as he spoke of his " friendly , easy-going " granddaughter , and how his family had been devastated by the drive-by shooting .
speaking from his terraced home just a few minutes ' walk from the scene of the tragedy , he said : " she was just easy-going .
she was a nice girl .
" she was popular .
all the family are cut up about it . "
danielle was walking home from nottingham 's goose fair in the early hours of saturday just ahead of the shooting .
she died during emergency surgery at the queen 's medical centre , nottingham , of a gunshot wound to her abdomen .
a 20-year-old woman who lives near the crime scene , said : " those people who did this are not human , they are evil .
" i feel so sorry for her mum and dad as i am a young parent myself . "
friends of danielle described her as a popular girl who loved music and dancing .
her ambition was to be a beautician .
carla browne , 16 , said : " i saw her laughing and joking on the dodgem cars only a couple of hours before she was dead .
" she was a really nice girl , not big-headed or one to cause trouble , just out enjoying herself .
we are all so upset .

a team from the county council working at scarcewater near st stephen-in-brannel says its finds are significant .
fieldwork has revealed a history of ceremonial and settlement activity at scarcewater spanning five millennia .
the finds represent the neolithic , bronze and iron ages , and include hearth pits , pottery , a stock enclosure and roundhouses .
the archaeological site is on the site of a china clay tip and the excavations are being funded by imerys minerals who are helping with the removal of modern layers on the site .
these are the largest excavations to be undertaken in cornwall and the council hopes the continuing work will answer questions about the occupation of the area which are still outstanding .

senior archaeologist andy jones said : " the excavations are providing a fantastic opportunity to investigate the shifting prehistoric settlement patterns over several millennia . "

a team from the county council working at scarcewater near st stephen-in-brannel says its finds are significant .
fieldwork has revealed a history of ceremonial and settlement activity at scarcewater spanning five millennia .
the finds represent the neolithic , bronze and iron ages , and include hearth pits , pottery , a stock enclosure and roundhouses .
the archaeological site is on the site of a china clay tip and the excavations are being funded by imerys minerals who are helping with the removal of modern layers on the site .
these are the largest excavations to be undertaken in cornwall and the council hopes the continuing work will answer questions about the occupation of the area which are still outstanding .
the council says the information from the site gives an important opportunity to study the changing lifestyle of cornish communities over thousands of years .
senior archaeologist andy jones said : " the excavations are providing a fantastic opportunity to investigate the shifting prehistoric settlement patterns over several millennia . "

speedboats have come to the low wood centre for 34 years to try to set new records for their class .
the current record on windermere is 154mph .
the new limit is designed to restore tranquillity to the lake .
organisers say next year 's event could move to coniston , if permission to hold the races on windermere is denied .
the four busiest areas of windermere have a 6mph limit , and there will be a 10mph limit elsewhere .
worldwide interest campaigners , including some businesses , say the rescriction will devastate the local economy , which has struggled to recover from the foot-and-mouth crisis of 2001 .
event organiser , tim berry , said this year 's speed records week is proving more popular than ever with 28 competitors already signed up .
he said of the speed limit introduction : " a lot of people think it is a crying shame , not just for cumbria but for the rest of the world , because record week has worldwide recognition .
" it creates interest from the rest of the world for the lake district . "
he said one option for next year 's event was to hold it on coniston , where organisers can apply to use the lake for world and national record attempts .
mr berry said : " we already applied for dispensation to operate next year on windermere and it was denied , but that was a good few years ago .
" we will reapply for windermere , but also apply for coniston - so record-breaking might be back in coniston next year . "
