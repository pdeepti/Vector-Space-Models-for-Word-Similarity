there 's still a glimmer of hope that the world 's largest techno music party will survive .
but just in case it does n't , many dw-world readers expressed their sorrow over the parade 's demise . i am sad to hear of the cancellation of the love parade .
i live in new york and was actually planning to come over to berlin for it .
i agree with the decline of techno music in the united states here as well .
out of my friends , i am the only one who listens to it .
yet , when i was in europe , i found this to be untrue .
it still seems to be very popular over there .
there is still a following in the u.s. , yet it seems to be more underground .
maybe next year they will revive the love parade ! - gina bouchard , usa i was planning to visit berlin this summer and attend the love parade .
if it 's cancelled , berlin will be excluded of my tour , maybe the entire country .
i 'm sure that this party will survive , if not in berlin , in another more progressive city -lrb- paris ? -rrb- . - marcelo , chile techno music will be alive in our hearts forever .
save the love parade , the biggest techno manifestation in the world .
berlin never will be the same without love parade and will be eliminated from out list of holiday destinations . - alejandro oyarzún , chile so the first time i come to berlin for the love parade , it has been cancelled .
an event like the love parade can become a world event , indeed it already is , rather like the rio carnival or the new orleans mardi gras .
of course the berlin authorities should bankroll the event : think of the tourism funds !
berlin is a beautiful city and needs to become a great tourist city like paris and london . - graham smith thank god , the love parade is finished - at least i hope so .
what a degrading spectacle it was .
it should have been banned years ago .
it was disgusting all aspects .
the garbage left behind was unbelieveable and the illegal drugs just showed you how far germany has fallen in the gutter . - erni stetz i am absolutely gutted to hear that this year 's parade has been cancelled .
i have always wanted to go but never got round to it .
i finally booked flights and now i cancelled them .
techno music is far from being dead and i think it should still go ahead . - hayley peckett it would be a shame if the love parade was gone .
i lived in berlin for a while and plan to return , i was hoping to attend the parade when i do .
the love parade was a large part of the capital 's pulse and without it , berlin will be lessened .
i know how much germans love to party , so i am sure something will take its place , but it probably wo n't be the same kind of youthful celebration .
the love parade does need to evolve as tastes change , that could be the saving of it , but only if the organizers will make those changes .
i certainly hope that they do , if the love parade dies , it will be a loss for berlin . - dawn rae send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de is the party over for the love parade ?
the organizers of the love parade , the world 's biggest techno music parade , say the event wo n't happen this year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 26.04.2004 eu hits greek cypriots in pocketbook after ' no ' vote großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brussels says it will reward turk cypriots for approving reunion angered by greek cypriots ' vote against reunification , eu foreign ministers pledge to help push the divided island 's turkish residents back into the international fold . at a meeting in luxembourg on monday , the eu 's top diplomats praised turkish cypriots for their affirmative vote on a united nations plan to reunite the island .
the vote came in the face of a landslide rejection of the same referendum by greek cypriots on the southern half of the island .
in a diplomatic slap at greek cypriots , the foreign ministers also ordered that the € 259 million -lrb- $ 307 million -rrb- that had been earmarked for implementing a settlement between the greeks and turks on the island instead be placed in an economic development fund for the turkish half of the island , which has been the subject of an international embargo since turkey invaded cyprus in 1974 .
' an affront to europe ' though turks on the island voted in favor of reunification , the greeks rejected it , meaning the southern half will be the only part of cyprus to enter the eu on may 1 .
" this is an affront to europe , " belgian foreign minister louis michel told the news agency reuters .
" those who campaigned ' no ' may perhaps not have measured all the consequences . "
in a joint statement , the eu council " expressed its determination to ensure that the people of cyprus will soon achieve their shared destiny as citizens of a united cyprus in the european union . "
an audibly irritated günter verheugen , the eu 's commissioner for enlargement , said : " under no circumstances should we allow a situation in which turkish cypriots would be punished for the fact that a settlement could not be reached .
we will have to cooperate with the authorities in the north . "
among the options being considered by the eu is the opening of an official mission in northern cyprus .
unification : so close , so far away never in the 30 years of the island 's divided history had reunification been so close , yet so far . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people read newspapers in central nicosia , cyprus the greek cypriots simply did n't want it , and brashly underlined the fact by voting against with an overwhelming 76 percent .
their ' no ' spells out the end of turkish cypriots ' hopes to become eu citizens on may 1 and keeps them locked on the far side of the free-trade barrier .
recognized only by turkey , the northern part of the divided island can only export to one country - turkey . the ballot is a major blow for the impoverished north , where per capita income is currently four times less than that of greek cypriots . anger and frustration the sentiment of " missed opportunity " has been echoed around the world , but the reality is that it leaves the eu looking pretty silly .
eu enlargement commissioner , günter verheugen has sharply criticized the outcome of the vote , reminding the greek-cypriot government that it was the greek government which had pushed for a unified cyprus in the first place , and that the greek side had pledged to bring its people to agree to the un reunification plan , with the pay-off that cyprus would be accepted into the union . if ever there were any fears that the plan , designed by un secretary general kofi annan , might be rejected , it was that the turkish cypriots might not play along .
but the tables turned and 65 percent voted in favor of joining with their greek neighbors . ultimately the greek cypriots objected to the plan on the grounds that it would not allow greek cypriots who fled south in 1974 to return home , and that it would allow turkish troops to stay on the island for too long , which in turn raised security concerns .
that was all it took for what could have been a united future to become history .
verheugen slammed the reasoning .

the vote came in the face of a landslide rejection of the same referendum by greek cypriots on the southern half of the island .
in a diplomatic slap at greek cypriots , the foreign ministers also ordered that the € 259 million -lrb- $ 307 million -rrb- that had been earmarked for implementing a settlement between the greeks and turks on the island instead be placed in an economic development fund for the turkish half of the island , which has been the subject of an international embargo since turkey invaded cyprus in 1974 .
' an affront to europe ' though turks on the island voted in favor of reunification , the greeks rejected it , meaning the southern half will be the only part of cyprus to enter the eu on may 1 .
" this is an affront to europe , " belgian foreign minister louis michel told the news agency reuters .
" those who campaigned ' no ' may perhaps not have measured all the consequences . "
in a joint statement , the eu council " expressed its determination to ensure that the people of cyprus will soon achieve their shared destiny as citizens of a united cyprus in the european union . "
an audibly irritated günter verheugen , the eu 's commissioner for enlargement , said : " under no circumstances should we allow a situation in which turkish cypriots would be punished for the fact that a settlement could not be reached .
we will have to cooperate with the authorities in the north . "
among the options being considered by the eu is the opening of an official mission in northern cyprus .
unification : so close , so far away never in the 30 years of the island 's divided history had reunification been so close , yet so far . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people read newspapers in central nicosia , cyprus the greek cypriots simply did n't want it , and brashly underlined the fact by voting against with an overwhelming 76 percent .
their ' no ' spells out the end of turkish cypriots ' hopes to become eu citizens on may 1 and keeps them locked on the far side of the free-trade barrier .
recognized only by turkey , the northern part of the divided island can only export to one country - turkey . the ballot is a major blow for the impoverished north , where per capita income is currently four times less than that of greek cypriots . anger and frustration the sentiment of " missed opportunity " has been echoed around the world , but the reality is that it leaves the eu looking pretty silly .
eu enlargement commissioner , günter verheugen has sharply criticized the outcome of the vote , reminding the greek-cypriot government that it was the greek government which had pushed for a unified cyprus in the first place , and that the greek side had pledged to bring its people to agree to the un reunification plan , with the pay-off that cyprus would be accepted into the union . if ever there were any fears that the plan , designed by un secretary general kofi annan , might be rejected , it was that the turkish cypriots might not play along .
but the tables turned and 65 percent voted in favor of joining with their greek neighbors . ultimately the greek cypriots objected to the plan on the grounds that it would not allow greek cypriots who fled south in 1974 to return home , and that it would allow turkish troops to stay on the island for too long , which in turn raised security concerns .
that was all it took for what could have been a united future to become history .

the vote came in the face of a landslide rejection of the same referendum by greek cypriots on the southern half of the island .
in a diplomatic slap at greek cypriots , the foreign ministers also ordered that the € 259 million -lrb- $ 307 million -rrb- that had been earmarked for implementing a settlement between the greeks and turks on the island instead be placed in an economic development fund for the turkish half of the island , which has been the subject of an international embargo since turkey invaded cyprus in 1974 .
' an affront to europe ' though turks on the island voted in favor of reunification , the greeks rejected it , meaning the southern half will be the only part of cyprus to enter the eu on may 1 .
" this is an affront to europe , " belgian foreign minister louis michel told the news agency reuters .
" those who campaigned ' no ' may perhaps not have measured all the consequences . "
in a joint statement , the eu council " expressed its determination to ensure that the people of cyprus will soon achieve their shared destiny as citizens of a united cyprus in the european union . "
an audibly irritated günter verheugen , the eu 's commissioner for enlargement , said : " under no circumstances should we allow a situation in which turkish cypriots would be punished for the fact that a settlement could not be reached .
we will have to cooperate with the authorities in the north . "
among the options being considered by the eu is the opening of an official mission in northern cyprus .
unification : so close , so far away never in the 30 years of the island 's divided history had reunification been so close , yet so far . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people read newspapers in central nicosia , cyprus the greek cypriots simply did n't want it , and brashly underlined the fact by voting against with an overwhelming 76 percent .
their ' no ' spells out the end of turkish cypriots ' hopes to become eu citizens on may 1 and keeps them locked on the far side of the free-trade barrier .
recognized only by turkey , the northern part of the divided island can only export to one country - turkey . the ballot is a major blow for the impoverished north , where per capita income is currently four times less than that of greek cypriots . anger and frustration the sentiment of " missed opportunity " has been echoed around the world , but the reality is that it leaves the eu looking pretty silly .
eu enlargement commissioner , günter verheugen has sharply criticized the outcome of the vote , reminding the greek-cypriot government that it was the greek government which had pushed for a unified cyprus in the first place , and that the greek side had pledged to bring its people to agree to the un reunification plan , with the pay-off that cyprus would be accepted into the union . if ever there were any fears that the plan , designed by un secretary general kofi annan , might be rejected , it was that the turkish cypriots might not play along .
but the tables turned and 65 percent voted in favor of joining with their greek neighbors . ultimately the greek cypriots objected to the plan on the grounds that it would not allow greek cypriots who fled south in 1974 to return home , and that it would allow turkish troops to stay on the island for too long , which in turn raised security concerns .
that was all it took for what could have been a united future to become history .
verheugen slammed the reasoning .
" no-one can seriously believe that an eu member state could be threatened by turkish troops , " he said .
" citing inadequate security guarantees is so far removed from reality that i just do n't believe it . " second chance ? in response to the poll , greek cypriot president tassos papandopoulos stressed that his people meant the turkish cypriots no ill will .
he added that his government would make specific proposals to the eu ministers to enable the turkish cypriots to enjoy the benefits of their country 's accession to the eu as much as possible .
he also urged them not to abandon efforts to reunite the island within the eu .
but günter verheugen said he believed the opportunity has passed . " my impression is that there will be no new united nations initiative and i do n't see any chance to negotiate , " he said .
" i do n't know who could lead negotiations and moreover i do n't see any further opportunity for compromise .
what is on the table is the best possible result . " dw staff -lrb- dsl / tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de greek cypriots say " no " to reunification greek cypriots on saturday voted overwhelmingly against reunification with turkish cypriots , sounding the death knell for a un-backed peace plan to end a 30-year division of the island .

the french-german pharmaceutical group aventis has agreed to merge with its french rival sanofi-synthelabo in a move that is expected to create the world 's third-largest drugs company . aventis and sanofi announced on monday they have agreed to merge , ending months of hostilities and government pressure against a potential third party bidder .
the board of aventis accepted a raised takeover offer from its smaller rival , who had upped its bid by 14 percent .
sanofi-synthelabo said that the french-german drug maker had agreed to the terms and that it had now launched a friendly bid of € 54.5 billion -lrb- $ 64.31 billion -rrb- in place of the previously rejected hostile bid of € 47.8 billion .
the french government immediately welcomed the deal between the country 's two main pharmaceutical groups , which would lead to the creation of the world 's third largest behind u.s. giant pfizer and britain 's glaxosmithkline .
government pressure the merger follows a three-month takeover battle in which the french government of prime minister jean-pierre raffarin had actively applied pressure to aventis to accept a local merger solution .
only last week paris had harshly criticized the french-german company 's attempts to negotiate a friendly merger with switzerland 's much larger novartis ag .
a french government official , who asked not to be named , told the associated press that finance minister nicolas sarkozy had put heavy pressure on sanofi to raise its bid for aventis after it became known that novartis was in the running .
the swiss company , however , withdrew from the bidding race late sunday , signaling an unwillingness to be pulled into a battle for aventis against its government-backed rival .
" following aventis ' decision to engage in discussions with sanofi , at the strong intervention of the french government , novartis decided not to proceed , " the company said in an official statement .
on monday raffarin hailed the sanofi-aventis deal , saying it would " maintain decision-making centers and jobs in france and europe . "
german chancellor gerhard schröder and swiss president joseph deiss expressed irritation over paris ' mingling in the business affairs of the pharmaceutical groups , according to french press reports .
politics has no role to play in companies ' decision making processes , schröder was quoted as saying .
aventis , which itself was created from a merger of france 's rhone-poulenc and germany 's hoechst in 1999 , employs about 69,000 people , some 9,000 of whom work in germany . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de novartis to join merger talks with aventis swiss pharmaceutical giant novartis said on thursday it would enter merger talks with france 's aventis , possibly preventing a bid by rival sanofi-synthelabo which is backed by the french government .

a french government official , who asked not to be named , told the associated press that finance minister nicolas sarkozy had put heavy pressure on sanofi to raise its bid for aventis after it became known that novartis was in the running .

" following aventis ' decision to engage in discussions with sanofi , at the strong intervention of the french government , novartis decided not to proceed , " the company said in an official statement .
on monday raffarin hailed the sanofi-aventis deal , saying it would " maintain decision-making centers and jobs in france and europe . "
german chancellor gerhard schröder and swiss president joseph deiss expressed irritation over paris ' mingling in the business affairs of the pharmaceutical groups , according to french press reports .

the french-german pharmaceutical group aventis has agreed to merge with its french rival sanofi-synthelabo in a move that is expected to create the world 's third-largest drugs company . aventis and sanofi announced on monday they have agreed to merge , ending months of hostilities and government pressure against a potential third party bidder .
the board of aventis accepted a raised takeover offer from its smaller rival , who had upped its bid by 14 percent .
sanofi-synthelabo said that the french-german drug maker had agreed to the terms and that it had now launched a friendly bid of € 54.5 billion -lrb- $ 64.31 billion -rrb- in place of the previously rejected hostile bid of € 47.8 billion .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 26.04.2004 -pipe- 14:00 utc retailers : longer shop hours might not help economy the german retailers association hde , which represents 100,000 retailers , has said plans by economics minster wolfgang clement to allow stores to stay open 24 hours from monday to saturday may fail to boost consumer spending and employment .
the shop hours proposal is part of a 34-point government strategy to cut red tape and encourage economic growth and job creation .
but the hde said experience had shown that long shop hours do not automatically bring about an increase in business .
it said sales had not risen markedly since stores were allowed to stay open longer on saturdays almost a year ago .
" people wo n't buy new television sets even if stores give them more time to do so , " holger wenzel , managing director of the hde , said in an interview .
he expects retail sales to stagnate in 2004 after three years of decline .
germany 's verdi labor union , which represents 2.8 million retail workers , has come out against the plan and said last year 's shopping hours extension actually cut jobs by squeezing profits at smaller shops .
clement is also proposing allowing germany 's 16 federal states to determine whether and how long shops can stay open sundays .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 26.04.2004 aventis accepts sanofi bid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's new pharmaceutical giant : sanofi-aventis .
the french-german pharmaceutical group aventis has agreed to merge with its french rival sanofi-synthelabo in a move that is expected to create the world 's third-largest drugs company . aventis and sanofi announced on monday they have agreed to merge , ending months of hostilities and government pressure against a potential third party bidder .
the board of aventis accepted a raised takeover offer from its smaller rival , who had upped its bid by 14 percent .
sanofi-synthelabo said that the french-german drug maker had agreed to the terms and that it had now launched a friendly bid of € 54.5 billion -lrb- $ 64.31 billion -rrb- in place of the previously rejected hostile bid of € 47.8 billion .
the french government immediately welcomed the deal between the country 's two main pharmaceutical groups , which would lead to the creation of the world 's third largest behind u.s. giant pfizer and britain 's glaxosmithkline .
government pressure the merger follows a three-month takeover battle in which the french government of prime minister jean-pierre raffarin had actively applied pressure to aventis to accept a local merger solution .
only last week paris had harshly criticized the french-german company 's attempts to negotiate a friendly merger with switzerland 's much larger novartis ag .
a french government official , who asked not to be named , told the associated press that finance minister nicolas sarkozy had put heavy pressure on sanofi to raise its bid for aventis after it became known that novartis was in the running .
the swiss company , however , withdrew from the bidding race late sunday , signaling an unwillingness to be pulled into a battle for aventis against its government-backed rival .
" following aventis ' decision to engage in discussions with sanofi , at the strong intervention of the french government , novartis decided not to proceed , " the company said in an official statement .
on monday raffarin hailed the sanofi-aventis deal , saying it would " maintain decision-making centers and jobs in france and europe . "
german chancellor gerhard schröder and swiss president joseph deiss expressed irritation over paris ' mingling in the business affairs of the pharmaceutical groups , according to french press reports .
politics has no role to play in companies ' decision making processes , schröder was quoted as saying .
aventis , which itself was created from a merger of france 's rhone-poulenc and germany 's hoechst in 1999 , employs about 69,000 people , some 9,000 of whom work in germany . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de novartis to join merger talks with aventis swiss pharmaceutical giant novartis said on thursday it would enter merger talks with france 's aventis , possibly preventing a bid by rival sanofi-synthelabo which is backed by the french government .
-lrb- april 22 , 2004 -rrb- aventis moves to prevent hostile takeover french pharmaceutical company sanofi-synthelabo wants to acquire the franco-german drug-maker aventis in a hostile takeover .

the french-german pharmaceutical group aventis has agreed to merge with its french rival sanofi-synthelabo in a move that is expected to create the world 's third-largest drugs company . aventis and sanofi announced on monday they have agreed to merge , ending months of hostilities and government pressure against a potential third party bidder .
the board of aventis accepted a raised takeover offer from its smaller rival , who had upped its bid by 14 percent .
sanofi-synthelabo said that the french-german drug maker had agreed to the terms and that it had now launched a friendly bid of € 54.5 billion -lrb- $ 64.31 billion -rrb- in place of the previously rejected hostile bid of € 47.8 billion .
the french government immediately welcomed the deal between the country 's two main pharmaceutical groups , which would lead to the creation of the world 's third largest behind u.s. giant pfizer and britain 's glaxosmithkline .
government pressure the merger follows a three-month takeover battle in which the french government of prime minister jean-pierre raffarin had actively applied pressure to aventis to accept a local merger solution .
only last week paris had harshly criticized the french-german company 's attempts to negotiate a friendly merger with switzerland 's much larger novartis ag .
a french government official , who asked not to be named , told the associated press that finance minister nicolas sarkozy had put heavy pressure on sanofi to raise its bid for aventis after it became known that novartis was in the running .
the swiss company , however , withdrew from the bidding race late sunday , signaling an unwillingness to be pulled into a battle for aventis against its government-backed rival .
" following aventis ' decision to engage in discussions with sanofi , at the strong intervention of the french government , novartis decided not to proceed , " the company said in an official statement .
on monday raffarin hailed the sanofi-aventis deal , saying it would " maintain decision-making centers and jobs in france and europe . "
german chancellor gerhard schröder and swiss president joseph deiss expressed irritation over paris ' mingling in the business affairs of the pharmaceutical groups , according to french press reports .
politics has no role to play in companies ' decision making processes , schröder was quoted as saying .

the vote came in the face of a landslide rejection of the same referendum by greek cypriots on the southern half of the island .
in a diplomatic slap at greek cypriots , the foreign ministers also ordered that the € 259 million -lrb- $ 307 million -rrb- that had been earmarked for implementing a settlement between the greeks and turks on the island instead be placed in an economic development fund for the turkish half of the island , which has been the subject of an international embargo since turkey invaded cyprus in 1974 .
' an affront to europe ' though turks on the island voted in favor of reunification , the greeks rejected it , meaning the southern half will be the only part of cyprus to enter the eu on may 1 .
" this is an affront to europe , " belgian foreign minister louis michel told the news agency reuters .
" those who campaigned ' no ' may perhaps not have measured all the consequences . "
in a joint statement , the eu council " expressed its determination to ensure that the people of cyprus will soon achieve their shared destiny as citizens of a united cyprus in the european union . "
an audibly irritated günter verheugen , the eu 's commissioner for enlargement , said : " under no circumstances should we allow a situation in which turkish cypriots would be punished for the fact that a settlement could not be reached .
we will have to cooperate with the authorities in the north . "
among the options being considered by the eu is the opening of an official mission in northern cyprus .
unification : so close , so far away never in the 30 years of the island 's divided history had reunification been so close , yet so far . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people read newspapers in central nicosia , cyprus the greek cypriots simply did n't want it , and brashly underlined the fact by voting against with an overwhelming 76 percent .
their ' no ' spells out the end of turkish cypriots ' hopes to become eu citizens on may 1 and keeps them locked on the far side of the free-trade barrier .
recognized only by turkey , the northern part of the divided island can only export to one country - turkey . the ballot is a major blow for the impoverished north , where per capita income is currently four times less than that of greek cypriots . anger and frustration the sentiment of " missed opportunity " has been echoed around the world , but the reality is that it leaves the eu looking pretty silly .
eu enlargement commissioner , günter verheugen has sharply criticized the outcome of the vote , reminding the greek-cypriot government that it was the greek government which had pushed for a unified cyprus in the first place , and that the greek side had pledged to bring its people to agree to the un reunification plan , with the pay-off that cyprus would be accepted into the union . if ever there were any fears that the plan , designed by un secretary general kofi annan , might be rejected , it was that the turkish cypriots might not play along .
but the tables turned and 65 percent voted in favor of joining with their greek neighbors . ultimately the greek cypriots objected to the plan on the grounds that it would not allow greek cypriots who fled south in 1974 to return home , and that it would allow turkish troops to stay on the island for too long , which in turn raised security concerns .
that was all it took for what could have been a united future to become history .
verheugen slammed the reasoning .
" no-one can seriously believe that an eu member state could be threatened by turkish troops , " he said .
" citing inadequate security guarantees is so far removed from reality that i just do n't believe it . " second chance ? in response to the poll , greek cypriot president tassos papandopoulos stressed that his people meant the turkish cypriots no ill will .
he added that his government would make specific proposals to the eu ministers to enable the turkish cypriots to enjoy the benefits of their country 's accession to the eu as much as possible .
he also urged them not to abandon efforts to reunite the island within the eu .
but günter verheugen said he believed the opportunity has passed . " my impression is that there will be no new united nations initiative and i do n't see any chance to negotiate , " he said .
" i do n't know who could lead negotiations and moreover i do n't see any further opportunity for compromise .
what is on the table is the best possible result .

the french government immediately welcomed the deal between the country 's two main pharmaceutical groups , which would lead to the creation of the world 's third largest behind u.s. giant pfizer and britain 's glaxosmithkline .
government pressure the merger follows a three-month takeover battle in which the french government of prime minister jean-pierre raffarin had actively applied pressure to aventis to accept a local merger solution .
only last week paris had harshly criticized the french-german company 's attempts to negotiate a friendly merger with switzerland 's much larger novartis ag .
a french government official , who asked not to be named , told the associated press that finance minister nicolas sarkozy had put heavy pressure on sanofi to raise its bid for aventis after it became known that novartis was in the running .
the swiss company , however , withdrew from the bidding race late sunday , signaling an unwillingness to be pulled into a battle for aventis against its government-backed rival .
" following aventis ' decision to engage in discussions with sanofi , at the strong intervention of the french government , novartis decided not to proceed , " the company said in an official statement .
on monday raffarin hailed the sanofi-aventis deal , saying it would " maintain decision-making centers and jobs in france and europe . "
german chancellor gerhard schröder and swiss president joseph deiss expressed irritation over paris ' mingling in the business affairs of the pharmaceutical groups , according to french press reports .
politics has no role to play in companies ' decision making processes , schröder was quoted as saying .
aventis , which itself was created from a merger of france 's rhone-poulenc and germany 's hoechst in 1999 , employs about 69,000 people , some 9,000 of whom work in germany . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de novartis to join merger talks with aventis swiss pharmaceutical giant novartis said on thursday it would enter merger talks with france 's aventis , possibly preventing a bid by rival sanofi-synthelabo which is backed by the french government .
-lrb- april 22 , 2004 -rrb- aventis moves to prevent hostile takeover french pharmaceutical company sanofi-synthelabo wants to acquire the franco-german drug-maker aventis in a hostile takeover .
if the € 50 billion merger is successful , it would create the world 's third-largest pharma firm .

the shop hours proposal is part of a 34-point government strategy to cut red tape and encourage economic growth and job creation .
but the hde said experience had shown that long shop hours do not automatically bring about an increase in business .
it said sales had not risen markedly since stores were allowed to stay open longer on saturdays almost a year ago .
" people wo n't buy new television sets even if stores give them more time to do so , " holger wenzel , managing director of the hde , said in an interview .
he expects retail sales to stagnate in 2004 after three years of decline .
germany 's verdi labor union , which represents 2.8 million retail workers , has come out against the plan and said last year 's shopping hours extension actually cut jobs by squeezing profits at smaller shops .
clement is also proposing allowing germany 's 16 federal states to determine whether and how long shops can stay open sundays .

there 's still a glimmer of hope that the world 's largest techno music party will survive .
but just in case it does n't , many dw-world readers expressed their sorrow over the parade 's demise . i am sad to hear of the cancellation of the love parade .
i live in new york and was actually planning to come over to berlin for it .
i agree with the decline of techno music in the united states here as well .
out of my friends , i am the only one who listens to it .
yet , when i was in europe , i found this to be untrue .
it still seems to be very popular over there .
there is still a following in the u.s. , yet it seems to be more underground .
maybe next year they will revive the love parade ! - gina bouchard , usa i was planning to visit berlin this summer and attend the love parade .
if it 's cancelled , berlin will be excluded of my tour , maybe the entire country .
i 'm sure that this party will survive , if not in berlin , in another more progressive city -lrb- paris ? -rrb- . - marcelo , chile techno music will be alive in our hearts forever .
save the love parade , the biggest techno manifestation in the world .
berlin never will be the same without love parade and will be eliminated from out list of holiday destinations . - alejandro oyarzún , chile so the first time i come to berlin for the love parade , it has been cancelled .
an event like the love parade can become a world event , indeed it already is , rather like the rio carnival or the new orleans mardi gras .
of course the berlin authorities should bankroll the event : think of the tourism funds !
berlin is a beautiful city and needs to become a great tourist city like paris and london . - graham smith thank god , the love parade is finished - at least i hope so .
what a degrading spectacle it was .
it should have been banned years ago .
it was disgusting all aspects .
the garbage left behind was unbelieveable and the illegal drugs just showed you how far germany has fallen in the gutter . - erni stetz i am absolutely gutted to hear that this year 's parade has been cancelled .
i have always wanted to go but never got round to it .
i finally booked flights and now i cancelled them .
techno music is far from being dead and i think it should still go ahead . - hayley peckett it would be a shame if the love parade was gone .
i lived in berlin for a while and plan to return , i was hoping to attend the parade when i do .
the love parade was a large part of the capital 's pulse and without it , berlin will be lessened .
i know how much germans love to party , so i am sure something will take its place , but it probably wo n't be the same kind of youthful celebration .
the love parade does need to evolve as tastes change , that could be the saving of it , but only if the organizers will make those changes .
i certainly hope that they do , if the love parade dies , it will be a loss for berlin . - dawn rae send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de is the party over for the love parade ?
the organizers of the love parade , the world 's biggest techno music parade , say the event wo n't happen this year .
the mass party , which at its peak had 1.5 million dancing through berlin 's streets , ca n't find financing .

the french-german pharmaceutical group aventis has agreed to merge with its french rival sanofi-synthelabo in a move that is expected to create the world 's third-largest drugs company . aventis and sanofi announced on monday they have agreed to merge , ending months of hostilities and government pressure against a potential third party bidder .
the board of aventis accepted a raised takeover offer from its smaller rival , who had upped its bid by 14 percent .
sanofi-synthelabo said that the french-german drug maker had agreed to the terms and that it had now launched a friendly bid of € 54.5 billion -lrb- $ 64.31 billion -rrb- in place of the previously rejected hostile bid of € 47.8 billion .
the french government immediately welcomed the deal between the country 's two main pharmaceutical groups , which would lead to the creation of the world 's third largest behind u.s. giant pfizer and britain 's glaxosmithkline .
government pressure the merger follows a three-month takeover battle in which the french government of prime minister jean-pierre raffarin had actively applied pressure to aventis to accept a local merger solution .
only last week paris had harshly criticized the french-german company 's attempts to negotiate a friendly merger with switzerland 's much larger novartis ag .
a french government official , who asked not to be named , told the associated press that finance minister nicolas sarkozy had put heavy pressure on sanofi to raise its bid for aventis after it became known that novartis was in the running .
the swiss company , however , withdrew from the bidding race late sunday , signaling an unwillingness to be pulled into a battle for aventis against its government-backed rival .
" following aventis ' decision to engage in discussions with sanofi , at the strong intervention of the french government , novartis decided not to proceed , " the company said in an official statement .
on monday raffarin hailed the sanofi-aventis deal , saying it would " maintain decision-making centers and jobs in france and europe . "
german chancellor gerhard schröder and swiss president joseph deiss expressed irritation over paris ' mingling in the business affairs of the pharmaceutical groups , according to french press reports .
politics has no role to play in companies ' decision making processes , schröder was quoted as saying .
aventis , which itself was created from a merger of france 's rhone-poulenc and germany 's hoechst in 1999 , employs about 69,000 people , some 9,000 of whom work in germany . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de novartis to join merger talks with aventis swiss pharmaceutical giant novartis said on thursday it would enter merger talks with france 's aventis , possibly preventing a bid by rival sanofi-synthelabo which is backed by the french government .

the vote came in the face of a landslide rejection of the same referendum by greek cypriots on the southern half of the island .
in a diplomatic slap at greek cypriots , the foreign ministers also ordered that the € 259 million -lrb- $ 307 million -rrb- that had been earmarked for implementing a settlement between the greeks and turks on the island instead be placed in an economic development fund for the turkish half of the island , which has been the subject of an international embargo since turkey invaded cyprus in 1974 .
' an affront to europe ' though turks on the island voted in favor of reunification , the greeks rejected it , meaning the southern half will be the only part of cyprus to enter the eu on may 1 .
" this is an affront to europe , " belgian foreign minister louis michel told the news agency reuters .
" those who campaigned ' no ' may perhaps not have measured all the consequences . "
in a joint statement , the eu council " expressed its determination to ensure that the people of cyprus will soon achieve their shared destiny as citizens of a united cyprus in the european union . "
an audibly irritated günter verheugen , the eu 's commissioner for enlargement , said : " under no circumstances should we allow a situation in which turkish cypriots would be punished for the fact that a settlement could not be reached .
we will have to cooperate with the authorities in the north . "
among the options being considered by the eu is the opening of an official mission in northern cyprus .
unification : so close , so far away never in the 30 years of the island 's divided history had reunification been so close , yet so far . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people read newspapers in central nicosia , cyprus the greek cypriots simply did n't want it , and brashly underlined the fact by voting against with an overwhelming 76 percent .
their ' no ' spells out the end of turkish cypriots ' hopes to become eu citizens on may 1 and keeps them locked on the far side of the free-trade barrier .
recognized only by turkey , the northern part of the divided island can only export to one country - turkey . the ballot is a major blow for the impoverished north , where per capita income is currently four times less than that of greek cypriots . anger and frustration the sentiment of " missed opportunity " has been echoed around the world , but the reality is that it leaves the eu looking pretty silly .
eu enlargement commissioner , günter verheugen has sharply criticized the outcome of the vote , reminding the greek-cypriot government that it was the greek government which had pushed for a unified cyprus in the first place , and that the greek side had pledged to bring its people to agree to the un reunification plan , with the pay-off that cyprus would be accepted into the union . if ever there were any fears that the plan , designed by un secretary general kofi annan , might be rejected , it was that the turkish cypriots might not play along .
but the tables turned and 65 percent voted in favor of joining with their greek neighbors . ultimately the greek cypriots objected to the plan on the grounds that it would not allow greek cypriots who fled south in 1974 to return home , and that it would allow turkish troops to stay on the island for too long , which in turn raised security concerns .
that was all it took for what could have been a united future to become history .
verheugen slammed the reasoning .
" no-one can seriously believe that an eu member state could be threatened by turkish troops , " he said .
" citing inadequate security guarantees is so far removed from reality that i just do n't believe it . " second chance ? in response to the poll , greek cypriot president tassos papandopoulos stressed that his people meant the turkish cypriots no ill will .
he added that his government would make specific proposals to the eu ministers to enable the turkish cypriots to enjoy the benefits of their country 's accession to the eu as much as possible .
he also urged them not to abandon efforts to reunite the island within the eu .
but günter verheugen said he believed the opportunity has passed . " my impression is that there will be no new united nations initiative and i do n't see any chance to negotiate , " he said .
" i do n't know who could lead negotiations and moreover i do n't see any further opportunity for compromise .

the vote came in the face of a landslide rejection of the same referendum by greek cypriots on the southern half of the island .
in a diplomatic slap at greek cypriots , the foreign ministers also ordered that the € 259 million -lrb- $ 307 million -rrb- that had been earmarked for implementing a settlement between the greeks and turks on the island instead be placed in an economic development fund for the turkish half of the island , which has been the subject of an international embargo since turkey invaded cyprus in 1974 .
' an affront to europe ' though turks on the island voted in favor of reunification , the greeks rejected it , meaning the southern half will be the only part of cyprus to enter the eu on may 1 .
" this is an affront to europe , " belgian foreign minister louis michel told the news agency reuters .
" those who campaigned ' no ' may perhaps not have measured all the consequences . "
in a joint statement , the eu council " expressed its determination to ensure that the people of cyprus will soon achieve their shared destiny as citizens of a united cyprus in the european union . "
an audibly irritated günter verheugen , the eu 's commissioner for enlargement , said : " under no circumstances should we allow a situation in which turkish cypriots would be punished for the fact that a settlement could not be reached .
we will have to cooperate with the authorities in the north . "
among the options being considered by the eu is the opening of an official mission in northern cyprus .
unification : so close , so far away never in the 30 years of the island 's divided history had reunification been so close , yet so far . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people read newspapers in central nicosia , cyprus the greek cypriots simply did n't want it , and brashly underlined the fact by voting against with an overwhelming 76 percent .
their ' no ' spells out the end of turkish cypriots ' hopes to become eu citizens on may 1 and keeps them locked on the far side of the free-trade barrier .
recognized only by turkey , the northern part of the divided island can only export to one country - turkey . the ballot is a major blow for the impoverished north , where per capita income is currently four times less than that of greek cypriots . anger and frustration the sentiment of " missed opportunity " has been echoed around the world , but the reality is that it leaves the eu looking pretty silly .
eu enlargement commissioner , günter verheugen has sharply criticized the outcome of the vote , reminding the greek-cypriot government that it was the greek government which had pushed for a unified cyprus in the first place , and that the greek side had pledged to bring its people to agree to the un reunification plan , with the pay-off that cyprus would be accepted into the union . if ever there were any fears that the plan , designed by un secretary general kofi annan , might be rejected , it was that the turkish cypriots might not play along .
but the tables turned and 65 percent voted in favor of joining with their greek neighbors . ultimately the greek cypriots objected to the plan on the grounds that it would not allow greek cypriots who fled south in 1974 to return home , and that it would allow turkish troops to stay on the island for too long , which in turn raised security concerns .
that was all it took for what could have been a united future to become history .
verheugen slammed the reasoning .
" no-one can seriously believe that an eu member state could be threatened by turkish troops , " he said .
" citing inadequate security guarantees is so far removed from reality that i just do n't believe it . " second chance ? in response to the poll , greek cypriot president tassos papandopoulos stressed that his people meant the turkish cypriots no ill will .
he added that his government would make specific proposals to the eu ministers to enable the turkish cypriots to enjoy the benefits of their country 's accession to the eu as much as possible .
he also urged them not to abandon efforts to reunite the island within the eu .
but günter verheugen said he believed the opportunity has passed . " my impression is that there will be no new united nations initiative and i do n't see any chance to negotiate , " he said .
" i do n't know who could lead negotiations and moreover i do n't see any further opportunity for compromise .
what is on the table is the best possible result .

the french-german pharmaceutical group aventis has agreed to merge with its french rival sanofi-synthelabo in a move that is expected to create the world 's third-largest drugs company . aventis and sanofi announced on monday they have agreed to merge , ending months of hostilities and government pressure against a potential third party bidder .
the board of aventis accepted a raised takeover offer from its smaller rival , who had upped its bid by 14 percent .
sanofi-synthelabo said that the french-german drug maker had agreed to the terms and that it had now launched a friendly bid of € 54.5 billion -lrb- $ 64.31 billion -rrb- in place of the previously rejected hostile bid of € 47.8 billion .
the french government immediately welcomed the deal between the country 's two main pharmaceutical groups , which would lead to the creation of the world 's third largest behind u.s. giant pfizer and britain 's glaxosmithkline .
government pressure the merger follows a three-month takeover battle in which the french government of prime minister jean-pierre raffarin had actively applied pressure to aventis to accept a local merger solution .
only last week paris had harshly criticized the french-german company 's attempts to negotiate a friendly merger with switzerland 's much larger novartis ag .
a french government official , who asked not to be named , told the associated press that finance minister nicolas sarkozy had put heavy pressure on sanofi to raise its bid for aventis after it became known that novartis was in the running .
the swiss company , however , withdrew from the bidding race late sunday , signaling an unwillingness to be pulled into a battle for aventis against its government-backed rival .
" following aventis ' decision to engage in discussions with sanofi , at the strong intervention of the french government , novartis decided not to proceed , " the company said in an official statement .
on monday raffarin hailed the sanofi-aventis deal , saying it would " maintain decision-making centers and jobs in france and europe . "
german chancellor gerhard schröder and swiss president joseph deiss expressed irritation over paris ' mingling in the business affairs of the pharmaceutical groups , according to french press reports .
politics has no role to play in companies ' decision making processes , schröder was quoted as saying .
aventis , which itself was created from a merger of france 's rhone-poulenc and germany 's hoechst in 1999 , employs about 69,000 people , some 9,000 of whom work in germany . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de novartis to join merger talks with aventis swiss pharmaceutical giant novartis said on thursday it would enter merger talks with france 's aventis , possibly preventing a bid by rival sanofi-synthelabo which is backed by the french government .

there 's still a glimmer of hope that the world 's largest techno music party will survive .
but just in case it does n't , many dw-world readers expressed their sorrow over the parade 's demise . i am sad to hear of the cancellation of the love parade .
i live in new york and was actually planning to come over to berlin for it .
i agree with the decline of techno music in the united states here as well .
out of my friends , i am the only one who listens to it .
yet , when i was in europe , i found this to be untrue .
it still seems to be very popular over there .
there is still a following in the u.s. , yet it seems to be more underground .
maybe next year they will revive the love parade ! - gina bouchard , usa i was planning to visit berlin this summer and attend the love parade .
if it 's cancelled , berlin will be excluded of my tour , maybe the entire country .
i 'm sure that this party will survive , if not in berlin , in another more progressive city -lrb- paris ? -rrb- . - marcelo , chile techno music will be alive in our hearts forever .
save the love parade , the biggest techno manifestation in the world .
berlin never will be the same without love parade and will be eliminated from out list of holiday destinations . - alejandro oyarzún , chile so the first time i come to berlin for the love parade , it has been cancelled .
an event like the love parade can become a world event , indeed it already is , rather like the rio carnival or the new orleans mardi gras .
of course the berlin authorities should bankroll the event : think of the tourism funds !
berlin is a beautiful city and needs to become a great tourist city like paris and london . - graham smith thank god , the love parade is finished - at least i hope so .
what a degrading spectacle it was .
it should have been banned years ago .
it was disgusting all aspects .
the garbage left behind was unbelieveable and the illegal drugs just showed you how far germany has fallen in the gutter . - erni stetz i am absolutely gutted to hear that this year 's parade has been cancelled .
i have always wanted to go but never got round to it .
i finally booked flights and now i cancelled them .
techno music is far from being dead and i think it should still go ahead . - hayley peckett it would be a shame if the love parade was gone .
i lived in berlin for a while and plan to return , i was hoping to attend the parade when i do .
the love parade was a large part of the capital 's pulse and without it , berlin will be lessened .
i know how much germans love to party , so i am sure something will take its place , but it probably wo n't be the same kind of youthful celebration .
the love parade does need to evolve as tastes change , that could be the saving of it , but only if the organizers will make those changes .
i certainly hope that they do , if the love parade dies , it will be a loss for berlin . - dawn rae send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de is the party over for the love parade ?
the organizers of the love parade , the world 's biggest techno music parade , say the event wo n't happen this year .
the mass party , which at its peak had 1.5 million dancing through berlin 's streets , ca n't find financing .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 26.04.2004 -pipe- 14:00 utc retailers : longer shop hours might not help economy the german retailers association hde , which represents 100,000 retailers , has said plans by economics minster wolfgang clement to allow stores to stay open 24 hours from monday to saturday may fail to boost consumer spending and employment .
the shop hours proposal is part of a 34-point government strategy to cut red tape and encourage economic growth and job creation .
but the hde said experience had shown that long shop hours do not automatically bring about an increase in business .
it said sales had not risen markedly since stores were allowed to stay open longer on saturdays almost a year ago .
" people wo n't buy new television sets even if stores give them more time to do so , " holger wenzel , managing director of the hde , said in an interview .
he expects retail sales to stagnate in 2004 after three years of decline .
germany 's verdi labor union , which represents 2.8 million retail workers , has come out against the plan and said last year 's shopping hours extension actually cut jobs by squeezing profits at smaller shops .
clement is also proposing allowing germany 's 16 federal states to determine whether and how long shops can stay open sundays .

the french-german pharmaceutical group aventis has agreed to merge with its french rival sanofi-synthelabo in a move that is expected to create the world 's third-largest drugs company . aventis and sanofi announced on monday they have agreed to merge , ending months of hostilities and government pressure against a potential third party bidder .
the board of aventis accepted a raised takeover offer from its smaller rival , who had upped its bid by 14 percent .
sanofi-synthelabo said that the french-german drug maker had agreed to the terms and that it had now launched a friendly bid of € 54.5 billion -lrb- $ 64.31 billion -rrb- in place of the previously rejected hostile bid of € 47.8 billion .
the french government immediately welcomed the deal between the country 's two main pharmaceutical groups , which would lead to the creation of the world 's third largest behind u.s. giant pfizer and britain 's glaxosmithkline .
government pressure the merger follows a three-month takeover battle in which the french government of prime minister jean-pierre raffarin had actively applied pressure to aventis to accept a local merger solution .
only last week paris had harshly criticized the french-german company 's attempts to negotiate a friendly merger with switzerland 's much larger novartis ag .
a french government official , who asked not to be named , told the associated press that finance minister nicolas sarkozy had put heavy pressure on sanofi to raise its bid for aventis after it became known that novartis was in the running .
the swiss company , however , withdrew from the bidding race late sunday , signaling an unwillingness to be pulled into a battle for aventis against its government-backed rival .
" following aventis ' decision to engage in discussions with sanofi , at the strong intervention of the french government , novartis decided not to proceed , " the company said in an official statement .
on monday raffarin hailed the sanofi-aventis deal , saying it would " maintain decision-making centers and jobs in france and europe . "

the vote came in the face of a landslide rejection of the same referendum by greek cypriots on the southern half of the island .
in a diplomatic slap at greek cypriots , the foreign ministers also ordered that the € 259 million -lrb- $ 307 million -rrb- that had been earmarked for implementing a settlement between the greeks and turks on the island instead be placed in an economic development fund for the turkish half of the island , which has been the subject of an international embargo since turkey invaded cyprus in 1974 .
' an affront to europe ' though turks on the island voted in favor of reunification , the greeks rejected it , meaning the southern half will be the only part of cyprus to enter the eu on may 1 .
" this is an affront to europe , " belgian foreign minister louis michel told the news agency reuters .
" those who campaigned ' no ' may perhaps not have measured all the consequences . "
in a joint statement , the eu council " expressed its determination to ensure that the people of cyprus will soon achieve their shared destiny as citizens of a united cyprus in the european union . "
an audibly irritated günter verheugen , the eu 's commissioner for enlargement , said : " under no circumstances should we allow a situation in which turkish cypriots would be punished for the fact that a settlement could not be reached .
we will have to cooperate with the authorities in the north . "
among the options being considered by the eu is the opening of an official mission in northern cyprus .
unification : so close , so far away never in the 30 years of the island 's divided history had reunification been so close , yet so far . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people read newspapers in central nicosia , cyprus the greek cypriots simply did n't want it , and brashly underlined the fact by voting against with an overwhelming 76 percent .
their ' no ' spells out the end of turkish cypriots ' hopes to become eu citizens on may 1 and keeps them locked on the far side of the free-trade barrier .
recognized only by turkey , the northern part of the divided island can only export to one country - turkey . the ballot is a major blow for the impoverished north , where per capita income is currently four times less than that of greek cypriots . anger and frustration the sentiment of " missed opportunity " has been echoed around the world , but the reality is that it leaves the eu looking pretty silly .
eu enlargement commissioner , günter verheugen has sharply criticized the outcome of the vote , reminding the greek-cypriot government that it was the greek government which had pushed for a unified cyprus in the first place , and that the greek side had pledged to bring its people to agree to the un reunification plan , with the pay-off that cyprus would be accepted into the union . if ever there were any fears that the plan , designed by un secretary general kofi annan , might be rejected , it was that the turkish cypriots might not play along .
but the tables turned and 65 percent voted in favor of joining with their greek neighbors . ultimately the greek cypriots objected to the plan on the grounds that it would not allow greek cypriots who fled south in 1974 to return home , and that it would allow turkish troops to stay on the island for too long , which in turn raised security concerns .
that was all it took for what could have been a united future to become history .
verheugen slammed the reasoning .
" no-one can seriously believe that an eu member state could be threatened by turkish troops , " he said .
" citing inadequate security guarantees is so far removed from reality that i just do n't believe it . " second chance ? in response to the poll , greek cypriot president tassos papandopoulos stressed that his people meant the turkish cypriots no ill will .
he added that his government would make specific proposals to the eu ministers to enable the turkish cypriots to enjoy the benefits of their country 's accession to the eu as much as possible .
he also urged them not to abandon efforts to reunite the island within the eu .
but günter verheugen said he believed the opportunity has passed . " my impression is that there will be no new united nations initiative and i do n't see any chance to negotiate , " he said .
" i do n't know who could lead negotiations and moreover i do n't see any further opportunity for compromise .

the shop hours proposal is part of a 34-point government strategy to cut red tape and encourage economic growth and job creation .
but the hde said experience had shown that long shop hours do not automatically bring about an increase in business .
it said sales had not risen markedly since stores were allowed to stay open longer on saturdays almost a year ago .
" people wo n't buy new television sets even if stores give them more time to do so , " holger wenzel , managing director of the hde , said in an interview .
he expects retail sales to stagnate in 2004 after three years of decline .
germany 's verdi labor union , which represents 2.8 million retail workers , has come out against the plan and said last year 's shopping hours extension actually cut jobs by squeezing profits at smaller shops .
clement is also proposing allowing germany 's 16 federal states to determine whether and how long shops can stay open sundays .

the vote came in the face of a landslide rejection of the same referendum by greek cypriots on the southern half of the island .
in a diplomatic slap at greek cypriots , the foreign ministers also ordered that the € 259 million -lrb- $ 307 million -rrb- that had been earmarked for implementing a settlement between the greeks and turks on the island instead be placed in an economic development fund for the turkish half of the island , which has been the subject of an international embargo since turkey invaded cyprus in 1974 .
' an affront to europe ' though turks on the island voted in favor of reunification , the greeks rejected it , meaning the southern half will be the only part of cyprus to enter the eu on may 1 .
" this is an affront to europe , " belgian foreign minister louis michel told the news agency reuters .
" those who campaigned ' no ' may perhaps not have measured all the consequences . "
in a joint statement , the eu council " expressed its determination to ensure that the people of cyprus will soon achieve their shared destiny as citizens of a united cyprus in the european union . "
an audibly irritated günter verheugen , the eu 's commissioner for enlargement , said : " under no circumstances should we allow a situation in which turkish cypriots would be punished for the fact that a settlement could not be reached .
we will have to cooperate with the authorities in the north . "
among the options being considered by the eu is the opening of an official mission in northern cyprus .
unification : so close , so far away never in the 30 years of the island 's divided history had reunification been so close , yet so far . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people read newspapers in central nicosia , cyprus the greek cypriots simply did n't want it , and brashly underlined the fact by voting against with an overwhelming 76 percent .
their ' no ' spells out the end of turkish cypriots ' hopes to become eu citizens on may 1 and keeps them locked on the far side of the free-trade barrier .
recognized only by turkey , the northern part of the divided island can only export to one country - turkey . the ballot is a major blow for the impoverished north , where per capita income is currently four times less than that of greek cypriots . anger and frustration the sentiment of " missed opportunity " has been echoed around the world , but the reality is that it leaves the eu looking pretty silly .
eu enlargement commissioner , günter verheugen has sharply criticized the outcome of the vote , reminding the greek-cypriot government that it was the greek government which had pushed for a unified cyprus in the first place , and that the greek side had pledged to bring its people to agree to the un reunification plan , with the pay-off that cyprus would be accepted into the union . if ever there were any fears that the plan , designed by un secretary general kofi annan , might be rejected , it was that the turkish cypriots might not play along .
but the tables turned and 65 percent voted in favor of joining with their greek neighbors . ultimately the greek cypriots objected to the plan on the grounds that it would not allow greek cypriots who fled south in 1974 to return home , and that it would allow turkish troops to stay on the island for too long , which in turn raised security concerns .
that was all it took for what could have been a united future to become history .
verheugen slammed the reasoning .
" no-one can seriously believe that an eu member state could be threatened by turkish troops , " he said .
" citing inadequate security guarantees is so far removed from reality that i just do n't believe it . " second chance ? in response to the poll , greek cypriot president tassos papandopoulos stressed that his people meant the turkish cypriots no ill will .

the shop hours proposal is part of a 34-point government strategy to cut red tape and encourage economic growth and job creation .
but the hde said experience had shown that long shop hours do not automatically bring about an increase in business .
it said sales had not risen markedly since stores were allowed to stay open longer on saturdays almost a year ago .
" people wo n't buy new television sets even if stores give them more time to do so , " holger wenzel , managing director of the hde , said in an interview .
he expects retail sales to stagnate in 2004 after three years of decline .
germany 's verdi labor union , which represents 2.8 million retail workers , has come out against the plan and said last year 's shopping hours extension actually cut jobs by squeezing profits at smaller shops .
clement is also proposing allowing germany 's 16 federal states to determine whether and how long shops can stay open sundays .

the french-german pharmaceutical group aventis has agreed to merge with its french rival sanofi-synthelabo in a move that is expected to create the world 's third-largest drugs company . aventis and sanofi announced on monday they have agreed to merge , ending months of hostilities and government pressure against a potential third party bidder .
the board of aventis accepted a raised takeover offer from its smaller rival , who had upped its bid by 14 percent .
sanofi-synthelabo said that the french-german drug maker had agreed to the terms and that it had now launched a friendly bid of € 54.5 billion -lrb- $ 64.31 billion -rrb- in place of the previously rejected hostile bid of € 47.8 billion .
the french government immediately welcomed the deal between the country 's two main pharmaceutical groups , which would lead to the creation of the world 's third largest behind u.s. giant pfizer and britain 's glaxosmithkline .
government pressure the merger follows a three-month takeover battle in which the french government of prime minister jean-pierre raffarin had actively applied pressure to aventis to accept a local merger solution .
only last week paris had harshly criticized the french-german company 's attempts to negotiate a friendly merger with switzerland 's much larger novartis ag .
a french government official , who asked not to be named , told the associated press that finance minister nicolas sarkozy had put heavy pressure on sanofi to raise its bid for aventis after it became known that novartis was in the running .
the swiss company , however , withdrew from the bidding race late sunday , signaling an unwillingness to be pulled into a battle for aventis against its government-backed rival .
" following aventis ' decision to engage in discussions with sanofi , at the strong intervention of the french government , novartis decided not to proceed , " the company said in an official statement .
on monday raffarin hailed the sanofi-aventis deal , saying it would " maintain decision-making centers and jobs in france and europe . "
german chancellor gerhard schröder and swiss president joseph deiss expressed irritation over paris ' mingling in the business affairs of the pharmaceutical groups , according to french press reports .
politics has no role to play in companies ' decision making processes , schröder was quoted as saying .
aventis , which itself was created from a merger of france 's rhone-poulenc and germany 's hoechst in 1999 , employs about 69,000 people , some 9,000 of whom work in germany . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de novartis to join merger talks with aventis swiss pharmaceutical giant novartis said on thursday it would enter merger talks with france 's aventis , possibly preventing a bid by rival sanofi-synthelabo which is backed by the french government .

there 's still a glimmer of hope that the world 's largest techno music party will survive .
but just in case it does n't , many dw-world readers expressed their sorrow over the parade 's demise . i am sad to hear of the cancellation of the love parade .
i live in new york and was actually planning to come over to berlin for it .
i agree with the decline of techno music in the united states here as well .
out of my friends , i am the only one who listens to it .
yet , when i was in europe , i found this to be untrue .
it still seems to be very popular over there .
there is still a following in the u.s. , yet it seems to be more underground .
maybe next year they will revive the love parade ! - gina bouchard , usa i was planning to visit berlin this summer and attend the love parade .
if it 's cancelled , berlin will be excluded of my tour , maybe the entire country .
i 'm sure that this party will survive , if not in berlin , in another more progressive city -lrb- paris ? -rrb- . - marcelo , chile techno music will be alive in our hearts forever .
save the love parade , the biggest techno manifestation in the world .
berlin never will be the same without love parade and will be eliminated from out list of holiday destinations . - alejandro oyarzún , chile so the first time i come to berlin for the love parade , it has been cancelled .
an event like the love parade can become a world event , indeed it already is , rather like the rio carnival or the new orleans mardi gras .
of course the berlin authorities should bankroll the event : think of the tourism funds !
berlin is a beautiful city and needs to become a great tourist city like paris and london . - graham smith thank god , the love parade is finished - at least i hope so .

it should have been banned years ago .
it was disgusting all aspects .

there 's still a glimmer of hope that the world 's largest techno music party will survive .
but just in case it does n't , many dw-world readers expressed their sorrow over the parade 's demise . i am sad to hear of the cancellation of the love parade .
i live in new york and was actually planning to come over to berlin for it .
i agree with the decline of techno music in the united states here as well .
out of my friends , i am the only one who listens to it .
yet , when i was in europe , i found this to be untrue .
it still seems to be very popular over there .
there is still a following in the u.s. , yet it seems to be more underground .
maybe next year they will revive the love parade ! - gina bouchard , usa i was planning to visit berlin this summer and attend the love parade .
if it 's cancelled , berlin will be excluded of my tour , maybe the entire country .
i 'm sure that this party will survive , if not in berlin , in another more progressive city -lrb- paris ? -rrb- . - marcelo , chile techno music will be alive in our hearts forever .
save the love parade , the biggest techno manifestation in the world .
berlin never will be the same without love parade and will be eliminated from out list of holiday destinations . - alejandro oyarzún , chile so the first time i come to berlin for the love parade , it has been cancelled .
an event like the love parade can become a world event , indeed it already is , rather like the rio carnival or the new orleans mardi gras .
of course the berlin authorities should bankroll the event : think of the tourism funds !
berlin is a beautiful city and needs to become a great tourist city like paris and london . - graham smith thank god , the love parade is finished - at least i hope so .
what a degrading spectacle it was .
it should have been banned years ago .
it was disgusting all aspects .
the garbage left behind was unbelieveable and the illegal drugs just showed you how far germany has fallen in the gutter . - erni stetz i am absolutely gutted to hear that this year 's parade has been cancelled .
i have always wanted to go but never got round to it .
i finally booked flights and now i cancelled them .
techno music is far from being dead and i think it should still go ahead . - hayley peckett it would be a shame if the love parade was gone .
i lived in berlin for a while and plan to return , i was hoping to attend the parade when i do .
the love parade was a large part of the capital 's pulse and without it , berlin will be lessened .
i know how much germans love to party , so i am sure something will take its place , but it probably wo n't be the same kind of youthful celebration .
the love parade does need to evolve as tastes change , that could be the saving of it , but only if the organizers will make those changes .
i certainly hope that they do , if the love parade dies , it will be a loss for berlin . - dawn rae send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de is the party over for the love parade ?
the organizers of the love parade , the world 's biggest techno music parade , say the event wo n't happen this year .
the mass party , which at its peak had 1.5 million dancing through berlin 's streets , ca n't find financing .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 26.04.2004 -pipe- 14:00 utc retailers : longer shop hours might not help economy the german retailers association hde , which represents 100,000 retailers , has said plans by economics minster wolfgang clement to allow stores to stay open 24 hours from monday to saturday may fail to boost consumer spending and employment .
the shop hours proposal is part of a 34-point government strategy to cut red tape and encourage economic growth and job creation .
but the hde said experience had shown that long shop hours do not automatically bring about an increase in business .
it said sales had not risen markedly since stores were allowed to stay open longer on saturdays almost a year ago .
" people wo n't buy new television sets even if stores give them more time to do so , " holger wenzel , managing director of the hde , said in an interview .
he expects retail sales to stagnate in 2004 after three years of decline .
germany 's verdi labor union , which represents 2.8 million retail workers , has come out against the plan and said last year 's shopping hours extension actually cut jobs by squeezing profits at smaller shops .
clement is also proposing allowing germany 's 16 federal states to determine whether and how long shops can stay open sundays .
a 54-year-old law currently on the books allows only a few stores , such as gas stations and shops in train stations , to operate on sunday . more briefs 26.04.2004 -pipe- mitsubishi motors head steps down 23.04.2004 -pipe- abu dhabi interested in buying large stake in vw 23.04.2004 -pipe- daimlerchrysler drops mitsubishi 23.04.2004 -pipe- gasoline prices in germany hit postwar high 23.04.2004 -pipe- infineon to expand virginia chip factory 22.04.2004 -pipe- atm maker to go public 22.04.2004 -pipe- volkswagen downbeat over car market 22.04.2004 -pipe- german firm sues gucci over perfume licenses radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

a new call by germany 's interior minister has further fueled the country 's debate over balancing the need for civil liberties and the necessity of stopping potential terrorists before they can act . in an interview published sunday in the newsweekly der spiegel , social democrat otto schily said his ministry wants to push through legislation that would allow police to take foreigners identified as potential terrorists or dangers to the state into protective custody until a decision can be made on their deportation . however , both the green party , the social democrats ' junior government coalition partner , and the opposition free democrats rejected the proposal , saying preventative arrests were not compatible with a country that recognizes democracy and the rule of law .
both the government parties and opposition plan to meet on friday for a new round of negotiations on germany 's first-ever immigration law .
politics should n't ' shirk ' responsibilities in his talk with der spiegel , schily said he was confident the parties , including the opposition christian democrats , would reach an agreement on " reasonable rules " that would allow the deportation of suspected terrorists .
schily also said he believed the first deportations could be carried out as soon as this year .
politics can not " shirk " what " we do with people whom we believe represent a massive danger to our country , " schily told the magazine .
schily said he would also consider additional foreigner registration requirements as well as limitations on residence permits for suspected terrorists who can not be deported under german law because they face torture or capital punishment in their home countries .
in extreme cases , he said , it " may also be necessary to put them in custody for a while . "
günther beckstein , bavaria 's interior minister and a member of the conservative christian social union , said there were up to 1,000 candidates for deportation . but schily said he did not want to mention numbers , " much more important is the question whether i can really deport the people , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an afghan guerrilla handles a u.s.-made stinger anti-aircraft missile in this photo made between november 1987 and january 1988 .
the shoulder-fired , heat-seeking missile supplied to the afghan resistance by the cia during the soviet invasion of afghanistan , is capable of bringing down low-flying planes and helicopters .
under the plan , a person could be deported from germany if it could be proven they had been trained in an al qaeda terrorist camp , if they had served as a guerrilla fighter in chechnya or had been involved in the distribution of videos calling for holy war against western states , schily told der spiegel .
the plan would permit state interior ministries or , in some cases , the federal interior ministry to determine whether a suspect could be deported .
the plan stipulates that a special chamber of the federal administrative court in karlsruhe could also be convened to review cases .
an unconstitutional idea ?
volker beck , manager of the green party 's parliamentary group , rejected schily 's call , noting that most instances of preventative arrest are illegal under german law .
" protective custody for innocent people does not exist in a constitutional state and that 's how it will remain . "
meanwhile , silke stokar , the party 's domestic affairs spokeswoman , said : " we 're not going to allow them to create a guantánamo -lrb- bay -rrb- in germany ! "
and max stadler , the domestic policy spokesman for the free democrats , described schily 's plan as " unacceptable and superfluous . "
all three called on the government to review existing laws .
criticism also came from marieluise beck , the federal government 's commissioner for integration and foreigners .
the berlin commissioner told the osnabrücker zeitung newspaper that any plan to deport suspected terrorists or state enemies would have to undergo constitutional review before being implemented .
law limits protective custody under current german law , a foreigner under consideration for deportation can only be taken into custody if both the deportation decision can not be made immediately and deportation would be " seriously exacerbated or thwarted " without detention .
however , the law also holds that individuals can not be taken into custody if they can not be deported within three months due to circumstances they can not control - if , for example , they face the death penalty at home .

a new call by germany 's interior minister has further fueled the country 's debate over balancing the need for civil liberties and the necessity of stopping potential terrorists before they can act . in an interview published sunday in the newsweekly der spiegel , social democrat otto schily said his ministry wants to push through legislation that would allow police to take foreigners identified as potential terrorists or dangers to the state into protective custody until a decision can be made on their deportation . however , both the green party , the social democrats ' junior government coalition partner , and the opposition free democrats rejected the proposal , saying preventative arrests were not compatible with a country that recognizes democracy and the rule of law .
both the government parties and opposition plan to meet on friday for a new round of negotiations on germany 's first-ever immigration law .
politics should n't ' shirk ' responsibilities in his talk with der spiegel , schily said he was confident the parties , including the opposition christian democrats , would reach an agreement on " reasonable rules " that would allow the deportation of suspected terrorists .
schily also said he believed the first deportations could be carried out as soon as this year .
politics can not " shirk " what " we do with people whom we believe represent a massive danger to our country , " schily told the magazine .
schily said he would also consider additional foreigner registration requirements as well as limitations on residence permits for suspected terrorists who can not be deported under german law because they face torture or capital punishment in their home countries .
in extreme cases , he said , it " may also be necessary to put them in custody for a while . "
günther beckstein , bavaria 's interior minister and a member of the conservative christian social union , said there were up to 1,000 candidates for deportation . but schily said he did not want to mention numbers , " much more important is the question whether i can really deport the people , " he said .

the shoulder-fired , heat-seeking missile supplied to the afghan resistance by the cia during the soviet invasion of afghanistan , is capable of bringing down low-flying planes and helicopters .
under the plan , a person could be deported from germany if it could be proven they had been trained in an al qaeda terrorist camp , if they had served as a guerrilla fighter in chechnya or had been involved in the distribution of videos calling for holy war against western states , schily told der spiegel .
the plan would permit state interior ministries or , in some cases , the federal interior ministry to determine whether a suspect could be deported .
the plan stipulates that a special chamber of the federal administrative court in karlsruhe could also be convened to review cases .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 26.04.2004 -pipe- 13:00 utc mitsubishi motors head steps down rolf eckrodt , the chief executive and president of mitsubishi motors corporation , has announced he will step down after partner daimlerchrysler revealed last week it would not help the struggling japanese automaker finance a turnaround .
the german-born eckrodt , 61 , took the mitsubishi reigns in 2001 and was charged with leading a planned turnaround for mitsubishi , which has been plagued with plummeting sales , massive debt and a series of recalls .
eckrodt , who worked as an executive with a daimler unit before coming to mitsubishi , said he was leaving his post because of daimler 's refusal of financial help and the subsequent decision by the mitsubishi group to hammer out a different revival strategy .

the german-born eckrodt , 61 , took the mitsubishi reigns in 2001 and was charged with leading a planned turnaround for mitsubishi , which has been plagued with plummeting sales , massive debt and a series of recalls .
eckrodt , who worked as an executive with a daimler unit before coming to mitsubishi , said he was leaving his post because of daimler 's refusal of financial help and the subsequent decision by the mitsubishi group to hammer out a different revival strategy .
daimlerchrysler owns 37 percent of the tokyo-based automaker and has not said what it will do with that stake .
mitsubishi motors is forecasting a loss of € 557 million -lrb- $ 661 million -rrb- for the fiscal year that ended march 31 .
its debt totals € 8.4 billion . more briefs 23.04.2004 -pipe- abu dhabi interested in buying large stake in vw 23.04.2004 -pipe- daimlerchrysler drops mitsubishi 23.04.2004 -pipe- gasoline prices in germany hit postwar high 23.04.2004 -pipe- infineon to expand virginia chip factory 22.04.2004 -pipe- atm maker to go public 22.04.2004 -pipe- volkswagen downbeat over car market 22.04.2004 -pipe- german firm sues gucci over perfume licenses 22.04.2004 -pipe- german economy minister meets novartis chief radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

there 's still a glimmer of hope that the world 's largest techno music party will survive .
but just in case it does n't , many dw-world readers expressed their sorrow over the parade 's demise . i am sad to hear of the cancellation of the love parade .
i live in new york and was actually planning to come over to berlin for it .
i agree with the decline of techno music in the united states here as well .
out of my friends , i am the only one who listens to it .
yet , when i was in europe , i found this to be untrue .
it still seems to be very popular over there .
there is still a following in the u.s. , yet it seems to be more underground .
maybe next year they will revive the love parade ! - gina bouchard , usa i was planning to visit berlin this summer and attend the love parade .
if it 's cancelled , berlin will be excluded of my tour , maybe the entire country .
i 'm sure that this party will survive , if not in berlin , in another more progressive city -lrb- paris ? -rrb- . - marcelo , chile techno music will be alive in our hearts forever .
save the love parade , the biggest techno manifestation in the world .
berlin never will be the same without love parade and will be eliminated from out list of holiday destinations . - alejandro oyarzún , chile so the first time i come to berlin for the love parade , it has been cancelled .
an event like the love parade can become a world event , indeed it already is , rather like the rio carnival or the new orleans mardi gras .
of course the berlin authorities should bankroll the event : think of the tourism funds !
berlin is a beautiful city and needs to become a great tourist city like paris and london . - graham smith thank god , the love parade is finished - at least i hope so .
what a degrading spectacle it was .
it should have been banned years ago .
it was disgusting all aspects .
the garbage left behind was unbelieveable and the illegal drugs just showed you how far germany has fallen in the gutter . - erni stetz i am absolutely gutted to hear that this year 's parade has been cancelled .
i have always wanted to go but never got round to it .
i finally booked flights and now i cancelled them .
techno music is far from being dead and i think it should still go ahead . - hayley peckett it would be a shame if the love parade was gone .
i lived in berlin for a while and plan to return , i was hoping to attend the parade when i do .
the love parade was a large part of the capital 's pulse and without it , berlin will be lessened .
i know how much germans love to party , so i am sure something will take its place , but it probably wo n't be the same kind of youthful celebration .
the love parade does need to evolve as tastes change , that could be the saving of it , but only if the organizers will make those changes .
i certainly hope that they do , if the love parade dies , it will be a loss for berlin . - dawn rae send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de is the party over for the love parade ?
the organizers of the love parade , the world 's biggest techno music parade , say the event wo n't happen this year .
the mass party , which at its peak had 1.5 million dancing through berlin 's streets , ca n't find financing .

that 's why i think that , if we ever get to this referendum , it 's really going to be about whether we want to stay in .
what 's the point of being inside and endlessly and truculently making trouble ?
is that really pursuing the national interest ? "
asked specifically whether a no would mean britain leaving the eu , patten said : " i think as good as .
i just think that psychologically we ca n't go on like this .
it poisons political debate . "
his words follow british premier tony blair 's u-turn decision last week to hold a public poll on the constitution after denying for months the need to have one .
blair 's decision has sparked huge discussion and some criticism in the rest of europe as britain is one of the most ambivalent members of the eu and could reject the constitution .
it has also led to speculation about whether other large countries such as france may also have to follow suit and hold a referendum on the constitution .
the treaty blueprint , which is due to be finalised in june , has to be ratified by all 25 member states before it can come into force .

even if ministers fail to reach an agreement today , the decision will automatically be referred back to the european commission for approval .
a commission spokesperson said last friday that the brussels executive would then give it the go ahead .
environmental groups are protesting the move .
" there are too many question marks hanging over this food , " said geert ritsema , gmo coordinator for friends of the earth europe .
" european countries should reject it outright .
the public demands proper testing to ensure that this sweet corn poses no threat to our health . "
the eu has had a de facto ban on gm food since 1998 .
this moratorium was made official at an eu environment ministers council meeting in june 1999 when five member states issued a declaration that they would effectively block new gmo approvals until there was new eu law on labelling and traceability .
but since then , new labelling rules for food containing gm ingredients have been put into place .
bt-11 is the first of about 30 gm products waiting for regulatory clearance .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 26.04.2004 aventis accepts sanofi bid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's new pharmaceutical giant : sanofi-aventis .
the french-german pharmaceutical group aventis has agreed to merge with its french rival sanofi-synthelabo in a move that is expected to create the world 's third-largest drugs company . aventis and sanofi announced on monday they have agreed to merge , ending months of hostilities and government pressure against a potential third party bidder .
the board of aventis accepted a raised takeover offer from its smaller rival , who had upped its bid by 14 percent .
sanofi-synthelabo said that the french-german drug maker had agreed to the terms and that it had now launched a friendly bid of € 54.5 billion -lrb- $ 64.31 billion -rrb- in place of the previously rejected hostile bid of € 47.8 billion .
the french government immediately welcomed the deal between the country 's two main pharmaceutical groups , which would lead to the creation of the world 's third largest behind u.s. giant pfizer and britain 's glaxosmithkline .
government pressure the merger follows a three-month takeover battle in which the french government of prime minister jean-pierre raffarin had actively applied pressure to aventis to accept a local merger solution .
only last week paris had harshly criticized the french-german company 's attempts to negotiate a friendly merger with switzerland 's much larger novartis ag .
a french government official , who asked not to be named , told the associated press that finance minister nicolas sarkozy had put heavy pressure on sanofi to raise its bid for aventis after it became known that novartis was in the running .
the swiss company , however , withdrew from the bidding race late sunday , signaling an unwillingness to be pulled into a battle for aventis against its government-backed rival .
" following aventis ' decision to engage in discussions with sanofi , at the strong intervention of the french government , novartis decided not to proceed , " the company said in an official statement .
on monday raffarin hailed the sanofi-aventis deal , saying it would " maintain decision-making centers and jobs in france and europe . "

the french-german pharmaceutical group aventis has agreed to merge with its french rival sanofi-synthelabo in a move that is expected to create the world 's third-largest drugs company . aventis and sanofi announced on monday they have agreed to merge , ending months of hostilities and government pressure against a potential third party bidder .
the board of aventis accepted a raised takeover offer from its smaller rival , who had upped its bid by 14 percent .
sanofi-synthelabo said that the french-german drug maker had agreed to the terms and that it had now launched a friendly bid of € 54.5 billion -lrb- $ 64.31 billion -rrb- in place of the previously rejected hostile bid of € 47.8 billion .
the french government immediately welcomed the deal between the country 's two main pharmaceutical groups , which would lead to the creation of the world 's third largest behind u.s. giant pfizer and britain 's glaxosmithkline .
government pressure the merger follows a three-month takeover battle in which the french government of prime minister jean-pierre raffarin had actively applied pressure to aventis to accept a local merger solution .
only last week paris had harshly criticized the french-german company 's attempts to negotiate a friendly merger with switzerland 's much larger novartis ag .
a french government official , who asked not to be named , told the associated press that finance minister nicolas sarkozy had put heavy pressure on sanofi to raise its bid for aventis after it became known that novartis was in the running .
the swiss company , however , withdrew from the bidding race late sunday , signaling an unwillingness to be pulled into a battle for aventis against its government-backed rival .
" following aventis ' decision to engage in discussions with sanofi , at the strong intervention of the french government , novartis decided not to proceed , " the company said in an official statement .
on monday raffarin hailed the sanofi-aventis deal , saying it would " maintain decision-making centers and jobs in france and europe . "

the french-german pharmaceutical group aventis has agreed to merge with its french rival sanofi-synthelabo in a move that is expected to create the world 's third-largest drugs company . aventis and sanofi announced on monday they have agreed to merge , ending months of hostilities and government pressure against a potential third party bidder .
the board of aventis accepted a raised takeover offer from its smaller rival , who had upped its bid by 14 percent .
sanofi-synthelabo said that the french-german drug maker had agreed to the terms and that it had now launched a friendly bid of € 54.5 billion -lrb- $ 64.31 billion -rrb- in place of the previously rejected hostile bid of € 47.8 billion .
the french government immediately welcomed the deal between the country 's two main pharmaceutical groups , which would lead to the creation of the world 's third largest behind u.s. giant pfizer and britain 's glaxosmithkline .
government pressure the merger follows a three-month takeover battle in which the french government of prime minister jean-pierre raffarin had actively applied pressure to aventis to accept a local merger solution .
only last week paris had harshly criticized the french-german company 's attempts to negotiate a friendly merger with switzerland 's much larger novartis ag .
a french government official , who asked not to be named , told the associated press that finance minister nicolas sarkozy had put heavy pressure on sanofi to raise its bid for aventis after it became known that novartis was in the running .
the swiss company , however , withdrew from the bidding race late sunday , signaling an unwillingness to be pulled into a battle for aventis against its government-backed rival .
" following aventis ' decision to engage in discussions with sanofi , at the strong intervention of the french government , novartis decided not to proceed , " the company said in an official statement .
on monday raffarin hailed the sanofi-aventis deal , saying it would " maintain decision-making centers and jobs in france and europe . "
german chancellor gerhard schröder and swiss president joseph deiss expressed irritation over paris ' mingling in the business affairs of the pharmaceutical groups , according to french press reports .
politics has no role to play in companies ' decision making processes , schröder was quoted as saying .

there 's still a glimmer of hope that the world 's largest techno music party will survive .
but just in case it does n't , many dw-world readers expressed their sorrow over the parade 's demise . i am sad to hear of the cancellation of the love parade .
i live in new york and was actually planning to come over to berlin for it .
i agree with the decline of techno music in the united states here as well .
out of my friends , i am the only one who listens to it .
yet , when i was in europe , i found this to be untrue .
it still seems to be very popular over there .
there is still a following in the u.s. , yet it seems to be more underground .
maybe next year they will revive the love parade ! - gina bouchard , usa i was planning to visit berlin this summer and attend the love parade .
if it 's cancelled , berlin will be excluded of my tour , maybe the entire country .
i 'm sure that this party will survive , if not in berlin , in another more progressive city -lrb- paris ? -rrb- . - marcelo , chile techno music will be alive in our hearts forever .
save the love parade , the biggest techno manifestation in the world .
berlin never will be the same without love parade and will be eliminated from out list of holiday destinations . - alejandro oyarzún , chile so the first time i come to berlin for the love parade , it has been cancelled .
an event like the love parade can become a world event , indeed it already is , rather like the rio carnival or the new orleans mardi gras .
of course the berlin authorities should bankroll the event : think of the tourism funds !
berlin is a beautiful city and needs to become a great tourist city like paris and london . - graham smith thank god , the love parade is finished - at least i hope so .
what a degrading spectacle it was .
it should have been banned years ago .
it was disgusting all aspects .
the garbage left behind was unbelieveable and the illegal drugs just showed you how far germany has fallen in the gutter . - erni stetz i am absolutely gutted to hear that this year 's parade has been cancelled .
i have always wanted to go but never got round to it .
i finally booked flights and now i cancelled them .
techno music is far from being dead and i think it should still go ahead . - hayley peckett it would be a shame if the love parade was gone .
i lived in berlin for a while and plan to return , i was hoping to attend the parade when i do .
the love parade was a large part of the capital 's pulse and without it , berlin will be lessened .
i know how much germans love to party , so i am sure something will take its place , but it probably wo n't be the same kind of youthful celebration .
the love parade does need to evolve as tastes change , that could be the saving of it , but only if the organizers will make those changes .
i certainly hope that they do , if the love parade dies , it will be a loss for berlin . - dawn rae send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de is the party over for the love parade ?
the organizers of the love parade , the world 's biggest techno music parade , say the event wo n't happen this year .
the mass party , which at its peak had 1.5 million dancing through berlin 's streets , ca n't find financing .

just after tony blair announced britain would vote on the eu constitution , german opposition politicians started calling for a referendum .
but the opposition 's demand is really just political gamesmanship . the convinced european , however , fears that if the people reject the eu constitution the european project could become unhinged .
despite all the eu euphoria , you ca n't overlook the fact that the majority of the eu states ' populaces supports neither the euro nor eastward expansion . in germany too , polls have shown that the majority is hardly interested in european politics , feels inadequately informed and quite critically appraises the national usefulness of the european union .
of course , they do n't question the need for the community .
but interest in the european union 's design is very limited for the most part . bypassing the people so far , mainly political decision makers have implemented " project europe " - occasionally against the majority 's will , which the introduction of the euro showed ; it certainly would n't have been introduced if the mood among the germans had been taken into account .
still , the political elite took action according to the principle : once the common currency is established , people will automatically accept it . at the same time as criticizing politicians in a democracy avoiding referendums , you realize looking back that the strategy panned out .
the european union is a success story that contributed fundamentally to healing the wounds of a continent plagued by war . gamesmanship why then is the political opposition in germany suddenly demanding a referendum on the eu constitution ?
particularly the christian democratic opposition , which rejected every push to introduce national referendums in the past ?
it 's a transparent maneuver : the referendum is an instrument to try to corner their political opponents .
the social democratic-green government rightly sees no need for action and dismisses a plebiscite , which our constitution does n't even provide for . but within the governing party too , some are saying that a referendum throughout the european union would be fully acceptable .
that , however , is irresponsible and diverts attention from the real question : how long can the political elites afford to continue putting so little effort into convincing people of the european project ? in the long run , the eu will only work if people are persuaded that it 's advantageous and necessary .
to that end , we need a deep and active debate about the spirit of the eu constitution .
so far there has n't been one among the german public .
if the politicians who have n't made such an effort so far instead demand a referendum now , it 's nothing more than cheap populism . verica spaskovska -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair confirms brits to vote on eu constitution in a major reversal of policy , british prime minister tony blair said tuesday he will call a british referendum on the eu constitution following months of pressure from the euroskeptic opposition conservatives .

just after tony blair announced britain would vote on the eu constitution , german opposition politicians started calling for a referendum .
but the opposition 's demand is really just political gamesmanship . the convinced european , however , fears that if the people reject the eu constitution the european project could become unhinged .
despite all the eu euphoria , you ca n't overlook the fact that the majority of the eu states ' populaces supports neither the euro nor eastward expansion . in germany too , polls have shown that the majority is hardly interested in european politics , feels inadequately informed and quite critically appraises the national usefulness of the european union .
of course , they do n't question the need for the community .
but interest in the european union 's design is very limited for the most part . bypassing the people so far , mainly political decision makers have implemented " project europe " - occasionally against the majority 's will , which the introduction of the euro showed ; it certainly would n't have been introduced if the mood among the germans had been taken into account .
still , the political elite took action according to the principle : once the common currency is established , people will automatically accept it . at the same time as criticizing politicians in a democracy avoiding referendums , you realize looking back that the strategy panned out .
the european union is a success story that contributed fundamentally to healing the wounds of a continent plagued by war . gamesmanship why then is the political opposition in germany suddenly demanding a referendum on the eu constitution ?
particularly the christian democratic opposition , which rejected every push to introduce national referendums in the past ?
it 's a transparent maneuver : the referendum is an instrument to try to corner their political opponents .
the social democratic-green government rightly sees no need for action and dismisses a plebiscite , which our constitution does n't even provide for . but within the governing party too , some are saying that a referendum throughout the european union would be fully acceptable .
that , however , is irresponsible and diverts attention from the real question : how long can the political elites afford to continue putting so little effort into convincing people of the european project ? in the long run , the eu will only work if people are persuaded that it 's advantageous and necessary .
to that end , we need a deep and active debate about the spirit of the eu constitution .
so far there has n't been one among the german public .
if the politicians who have n't made such an effort so far instead demand a referendum now , it 's nothing more than cheap populism . verica spaskovska -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair confirms brits to vote on eu constitution in a major reversal of policy , british prime minister tony blair said tuesday he will call a british referendum on the eu constitution following months of pressure from the euroskeptic opposition conservatives .

the french-german pharmaceutical group aventis has agreed to merge with its french rival sanofi-synthelabo in a move that is expected to create the world 's third-largest drugs company . aventis and sanofi announced on monday they have agreed to merge , ending months of hostilities and government pressure against a potential third party bidder .
the board of aventis accepted a raised takeover offer from its smaller rival , who had upped its bid by 14 percent .
sanofi-synthelabo said that the french-german drug maker had agreed to the terms and that it had now launched a friendly bid of € 54.5 billion -lrb- $ 64.31 billion -rrb- in place of the previously rejected hostile bid of € 47.8 billion .
the french government immediately welcomed the deal between the country 's two main pharmaceutical groups , which would lead to the creation of the world 's third largest behind u.s. giant pfizer and britain 's glaxosmithkline .
government pressure the merger follows a three-month takeover battle in which the french government of prime minister jean-pierre raffarin had actively applied pressure to aventis to accept a local merger solution .
only last week paris had harshly criticized the french-german company 's attempts to negotiate a friendly merger with switzerland 's much larger novartis ag .
a french government official , who asked not to be named , told the associated press that finance minister nicolas sarkozy had put heavy pressure on sanofi to raise its bid for aventis after it became known that novartis was in the running .
the swiss company , however , withdrew from the bidding race late sunday , signaling an unwillingness to be pulled into a battle for aventis against its government-backed rival .
" following aventis ' decision to engage in discussions with sanofi , at the strong intervention of the french government , novartis decided not to proceed , " the company said in an official statement .
on monday raffarin hailed the sanofi-aventis deal , saying it would " maintain decision-making centers and jobs in france and europe . "
german chancellor gerhard schröder and swiss president joseph deiss expressed irritation over paris ' mingling in the business affairs of the pharmaceutical groups , according to french press reports .
politics has no role to play in companies ' decision making processes , schröder was quoted as saying .
aventis , which itself was created from a merger of france 's rhone-poulenc and germany 's hoechst in 1999 , employs about 69,000 people , some 9,000 of whom work in germany . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de novartis to join merger talks with aventis swiss pharmaceutical giant novartis said on thursday it would enter merger talks with france 's aventis , possibly preventing a bid by rival sanofi-synthelabo which is backed by the french government .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 26.04.2004 eu hits greek cypriots in pocketbook after ' no ' vote großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brussels says it will reward turk cypriots for approving reunion angered by greek cypriots ' vote against reunification , eu foreign ministers pledge to help push the divided island 's turkish residents back into the international fold . at a meeting in luxembourg on monday , the eu 's top diplomats praised turkish cypriots for their affirmative vote on a united nations plan to reunite the island .
the vote came in the face of a landslide rejection of the same referendum by greek cypriots on the southern half of the island .
in a diplomatic slap at greek cypriots , the foreign ministers also ordered that the € 259 million -lrb- $ 307 million -rrb- that had been earmarked for implementing a settlement between the greeks and turks on the island instead be placed in an economic development fund for the turkish half of the island , which has been the subject of an international embargo since turkey invaded cyprus in 1974 .
' an affront to europe ' though turks on the island voted in favor of reunification , the greeks rejected it , meaning the southern half will be the only part of cyprus to enter the eu on may 1 .
" this is an affront to europe , " belgian foreign minister louis michel told the news agency reuters .
" those who campaigned ' no ' may perhaps not have measured all the consequences . "
in a joint statement , the eu council " expressed its determination to ensure that the people of cyprus will soon achieve their shared destiny as citizens of a united cyprus in the european union . "
an audibly irritated günter verheugen , the eu 's commissioner for enlargement , said : " under no circumstances should we allow a situation in which turkish cypriots would be punished for the fact that a settlement could not be reached .
we will have to cooperate with the authorities in the north . "
among the options being considered by the eu is the opening of an official mission in northern cyprus .
unification : so close , so far away never in the 30 years of the island 's divided history had reunification been so close , yet so far . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people read newspapers in central nicosia , cyprus the greek cypriots simply did n't want it , and brashly underlined the fact by voting against with an overwhelming 76 percent .

recognized only by turkey , the northern part of the divided island can only export to one country - turkey . the ballot is a major blow for the impoverished north , where per capita income is currently four times less than that of greek cypriots . anger and frustration the sentiment of " missed opportunity " has been echoed around the world , but the reality is that it leaves the eu looking pretty silly .
eu enlargement commissioner , günter verheugen has sharply criticized the outcome of the vote , reminding the greek-cypriot government that it was the greek government which had pushed for a unified cyprus in the first place , and that the greek side had pledged to bring its people to agree to the un reunification plan , with the pay-off that cyprus would be accepted into the union . if ever there were any fears that the plan , designed by un secretary general kofi annan , might be rejected , it was that the turkish cypriots might not play along .
but the tables turned and 65 percent voted in favor of joining with their greek neighbors . ultimately the greek cypriots objected to the plan on the grounds that it would not allow greek cypriots who fled south in 1974 to return home , and that it would allow turkish troops to stay on the island for too long , which in turn raised security concerns .
that was all it took for what could have been a united future to become history .
verheugen slammed the reasoning .
" no-one can seriously believe that an eu member state could be threatened by turkish troops , " he said .
" citing inadequate security guarantees is so far removed from reality that i just do n't believe it . " second chance ? in response to the poll , greek cypriot president tassos papandopoulos stressed that his people meant the turkish cypriots no ill will .
he added that his government would make specific proposals to the eu ministers to enable the turkish cypriots to enjoy the benefits of their country 's accession to the eu as much as possible .
he also urged them not to abandon efforts to reunite the island within the eu .

the vote came in the face of a landslide rejection of the same referendum by greek cypriots on the southern half of the island .
in a diplomatic slap at greek cypriots , the foreign ministers also ordered that the € 259 million -lrb- $ 307 million -rrb- that had been earmarked for implementing a settlement between the greeks and turks on the island instead be placed in an economic development fund for the turkish half of the island , which has been the subject of an international embargo since turkey invaded cyprus in 1974 .

the vote came in the face of a landslide rejection of the same referendum by greek cypriots on the southern half of the island .
in a diplomatic slap at greek cypriots , the foreign ministers also ordered that the € 259 million -lrb- $ 307 million -rrb- that had been earmarked for implementing a settlement between the greeks and turks on the island instead be placed in an economic development fund for the turkish half of the island , which has been the subject of an international embargo since turkey invaded cyprus in 1974 .
' an affront to europe ' though turks on the island voted in favor of reunification , the greeks rejected it , meaning the southern half will be the only part of cyprus to enter the eu on may 1 .
" this is an affront to europe , " belgian foreign minister louis michel told the news agency reuters .
" those who campaigned ' no ' may perhaps not have measured all the consequences . "
in a joint statement , the eu council " expressed its determination to ensure that the people of cyprus will soon achieve their shared destiny as citizens of a united cyprus in the european union . "
an audibly irritated günter verheugen , the eu 's commissioner for enlargement , said : " under no circumstances should we allow a situation in which turkish cypriots would be punished for the fact that a settlement could not be reached .
we will have to cooperate with the authorities in the north . "
among the options being considered by the eu is the opening of an official mission in northern cyprus .
unification : so close , so far away never in the 30 years of the island 's divided history had reunification been so close , yet so far . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people read newspapers in central nicosia , cyprus the greek cypriots simply did n't want it , and brashly underlined the fact by voting against with an overwhelming 76 percent .
their ' no ' spells out the end of turkish cypriots ' hopes to become eu citizens on may 1 and keeps them locked on the far side of the free-trade barrier .
recognized only by turkey , the northern part of the divided island can only export to one country - turkey . the ballot is a major blow for the impoverished north , where per capita income is currently four times less than that of greek cypriots . anger and frustration the sentiment of " missed opportunity " has been echoed around the world , but the reality is that it leaves the eu looking pretty silly .
eu enlargement commissioner , günter verheugen has sharply criticized the outcome of the vote , reminding the greek-cypriot government that it was the greek government which had pushed for a unified cyprus in the first place , and that the greek side had pledged to bring its people to agree to the un reunification plan , with the pay-off that cyprus would be accepted into the union . if ever there were any fears that the plan , designed by un secretary general kofi annan , might be rejected , it was that the turkish cypriots might not play along .
but the tables turned and 65 percent voted in favor of joining with their greek neighbors . ultimately the greek cypriots objected to the plan on the grounds that it would not allow greek cypriots who fled south in 1974 to return home , and that it would allow turkish troops to stay on the island for too long , which in turn raised security concerns .
that was all it took for what could have been a united future to become history .
verheugen slammed the reasoning .
" no-one can seriously believe that an eu member state could be threatened by turkish troops , " he said .
" citing inadequate security guarantees is so far removed from reality that i just do n't believe it . " second chance ? in response to the poll , greek cypriot president tassos papandopoulos stressed that his people meant the turkish cypriots no ill will .
he added that his government would make specific proposals to the eu ministers to enable the turkish cypriots to enjoy the benefits of their country 's accession to the eu as much as possible .
he also urged them not to abandon efforts to reunite the island within the eu .

just after tony blair announced britain would vote on the eu constitution , german opposition politicians started calling for a referendum .
but the opposition 's demand is really just political gamesmanship . the convinced european , however , fears that if the people reject the eu constitution the european project could become unhinged .
despite all the eu euphoria , you ca n't overlook the fact that the majority of the eu states ' populaces supports neither the euro nor eastward expansion . in germany too , polls have shown that the majority is hardly interested in european politics , feels inadequately informed and quite critically appraises the national usefulness of the european union .
of course , they do n't question the need for the community .
but interest in the european union 's design is very limited for the most part . bypassing the people so far , mainly political decision makers have implemented " project europe " - occasionally against the majority 's will , which the introduction of the euro showed ; it certainly would n't have been introduced if the mood among the germans had been taken into account .
still , the political elite took action according to the principle : once the common currency is established , people will automatically accept it . at the same time as criticizing politicians in a democracy avoiding referendums , you realize looking back that the strategy panned out .
the european union is a success story that contributed fundamentally to healing the wounds of a continent plagued by war . gamesmanship why then is the political opposition in germany suddenly demanding a referendum on the eu constitution ?
particularly the christian democratic opposition , which rejected every push to introduce national referendums in the past ?
it 's a transparent maneuver : the referendum is an instrument to try to corner their political opponents .
the social democratic-green government rightly sees no need for action and dismisses a plebiscite , which our constitution does n't even provide for . but within the governing party too , some are saying that a referendum throughout the european union would be fully acceptable .
that , however , is irresponsible and diverts attention from the real question : how long can the political elites afford to continue putting so little effort into convincing people of the european project ? in the long run , the eu will only work if people are persuaded that it 's advantageous and necessary .
to that end , we need a deep and active debate about the spirit of the eu constitution .
so far there has n't been one among the german public .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 26.04.2004 -pipe- 17:00 utc business index jumps unexpectedly the respected ifo business climate index rose beyond economists ' expectations in april after two consecutive monthly declines .
the munich-based economics institute , which based its findings of a survey of 7,000 companies , said the index rose from 95.4 in march to 96.3 in april .
the increase suggests that germany 's slow economic recovery is still on track , although ifo president hans werner sinn said it was too early to speak about a solid upturn .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 26.04.2004 -pipe- 09:00 utc gadhafi to visit brussels the libyan leader 's trip signals a deepening of ties with the eu and is expected to be accompanied by the announcement that libya will join the eu 's partnership with mediterranean countries .
the colonel , who has ruled libya since the overthrow of the monarchy in 1969 , is expected to meet with commission president romano prodi .
in autumn last year , the libyan leader said that the country would abandon its nuclear weapons programme heralding a period of rapprochement with the west .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 26.04.2004 -pipe- 14:00 utc retailers : longer shop hours might not help economy the german retailers association hde , which represents 100,000 retailers , has said plans by economics minster wolfgang clement to allow stores to stay open 24 hours from monday to saturday may fail to boost consumer spending and employment .
the shop hours proposal is part of a 34-point government strategy to cut red tape and encourage economic growth and job creation .
but the hde said experience had shown that long shop hours do not automatically bring about an increase in business .
it said sales had not risen markedly since stores were allowed to stay open longer on saturdays almost a year ago .
" people wo n't buy new television sets even if stores give them more time to do so , " holger wenzel , managing director of the hde , said in an interview .
he expects retail sales to stagnate in 2004 after three years of decline .
germany 's verdi labor union , which represents 2.8 million retail workers , has come out against the plan and said last year 's shopping hours extension actually cut jobs by squeezing profits at smaller shops .
clement is also proposing allowing germany 's 16 federal states to determine whether and how long shops can stay open sundays .
a 54-year-old law currently on the books allows only a few stores , such as gas stations and shops in train stations , to operate on sunday . more briefs 26.04.2004 -pipe- mitsubishi motors head steps down 23.04.2004 -pipe- abu dhabi interested in buying large stake in vw 23.04.2004 -pipe- daimlerchrysler drops mitsubishi 23.04.2004 -pipe- gasoline prices in germany hit postwar high 23.04.2004 -pipe- infineon to expand virginia chip factory 22.04.2004 -pipe- atm maker to go public 22.04.2004 -pipe- volkswagen downbeat over car market 22.04.2004 -pipe- german firm sues gucci over perfume licenses 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 26.04.2004 eu hits greek cypriots in pocketbook after ' no ' vote großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brussels says it will reward turk cypriots for approving reunion angered by greek cypriots ' vote against reunification , eu foreign ministers pledge to help push the divided island 's turkish residents back into the international fold . at a meeting in luxembourg on monday , the eu 's top diplomats praised turkish cypriots for their affirmative vote on a united nations plan to reunite the island .
the vote came in the face of a landslide rejection of the same referendum by greek cypriots on the southern half of the island .
in a diplomatic slap at greek cypriots , the foreign ministers also ordered that the € 259 million -lrb- $ 307 million -rrb- that had been earmarked for implementing a settlement between the greeks and turks on the island instead be placed in an economic development fund for the turkish half of the island , which has been the subject of an international embargo since turkey invaded cyprus in 1974 .
' an affront to europe ' though turks on the island voted in favor of reunification , the greeks rejected it , meaning the southern half will be the only part of cyprus to enter the eu on may 1 .
" this is an affront to europe , " belgian foreign minister louis michel told the news agency reuters .
" those who campaigned ' no ' may perhaps not have measured all the consequences . "
in a joint statement , the eu council " expressed its determination to ensure that the people of cyprus will soon achieve their shared destiny as citizens of a united cyprus in the european union . "
an audibly irritated günter verheugen , the eu 's commissioner for enlargement , said : " under no circumstances should we allow a situation in which turkish cypriots would be punished for the fact that a settlement could not be reached .
we will have to cooperate with the authorities in the north . "
among the options being considered by the eu is the opening of an official mission in northern cyprus .
unification : so close , so far away never in the 30 years of the island 's divided history had reunification been so close , yet so far . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people read newspapers in central nicosia , cyprus the greek cypriots simply did n't want it , and brashly underlined the fact by voting against with an overwhelming 76 percent .
their ' no ' spells out the end of turkish cypriots ' hopes to become eu citizens on may 1 and keeps them locked on the far side of the free-trade barrier .
recognized only by turkey , the northern part of the divided island can only export to one country - turkey . the ballot is a major blow for the impoverished north , where per capita income is currently four times less than that of greek cypriots . anger and frustration the sentiment of " missed opportunity " has been echoed around the world , but the reality is that it leaves the eu looking pretty silly .
eu enlargement commissioner , günter verheugen has sharply criticized the outcome of the vote , reminding the greek-cypriot government that it was the greek government which had pushed for a unified cyprus in the first place , and that the greek side had pledged to bring its people to agree to the un reunification plan , with the pay-off that cyprus would be accepted into the union . if ever there were any fears that the plan , designed by un secretary general kofi annan , might be rejected , it was that the turkish cypriots might not play along .
but the tables turned and 65 percent voted in favor of joining with their greek neighbors . ultimately the greek cypriots objected to the plan on the grounds that it would not allow greek cypriots who fled south in 1974 to return home , and that it would allow turkish troops to stay on the island for too long , which in turn raised security concerns .
that was all it took for what could have been a united future to become history .
verheugen slammed the reasoning .
" no-one can seriously believe that an eu member state could be threatened by turkish troops , " he said .
" citing inadequate security guarantees is so far removed from reality that i just do n't believe it . " second chance ? in response to the poll , greek cypriot president tassos papandopoulos stressed that his people meant the turkish cypriots no ill will .
he added that his government would make specific proposals to the eu ministers to enable the turkish cypriots to enjoy the benefits of their country 's accession to the eu as much as possible .
he also urged them not to abandon efforts to reunite the island within the eu .
but günter verheugen said he believed the opportunity has passed . " my impression is that there will be no new united nations initiative and i do n't see any chance to negotiate , " he said .
" i do n't know who could lead negotiations and moreover i do n't see any further opportunity for compromise .
what is on the table is the best possible result .

the vote came in the face of a landslide rejection of the same referendum by greek cypriots on the southern half of the island .
in a diplomatic slap at greek cypriots , the foreign ministers also ordered that the € 259 million -lrb- $ 307 million -rrb- that had been earmarked for implementing a settlement between the greeks and turks on the island instead be placed in an economic development fund for the turkish half of the island , which has been the subject of an international embargo since turkey invaded cyprus in 1974 .
' an affront to europe ' though turks on the island voted in favor of reunification , the greeks rejected it , meaning the southern half will be the only part of cyprus to enter the eu on may 1 .
" this is an affront to europe , " belgian foreign minister louis michel told the news agency reuters .
" those who campaigned ' no ' may perhaps not have measured all the consequences . "
in a joint statement , the eu council " expressed its determination to ensure that the people of cyprus will soon achieve their shared destiny as citizens of a united cyprus in the european union . "
an audibly irritated günter verheugen , the eu 's commissioner for enlargement , said : " under no circumstances should we allow a situation in which turkish cypriots would be punished for the fact that a settlement could not be reached .
we will have to cooperate with the authorities in the north . "
among the options being considered by the eu is the opening of an official mission in northern cyprus .
unification : so close , so far away never in the 30 years of the island 's divided history had reunification been so close , yet so far . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people read newspapers in central nicosia , cyprus the greek cypriots simply did n't want it , and brashly underlined the fact by voting against with an overwhelming 76 percent .
their ' no ' spells out the end of turkish cypriots ' hopes to become eu citizens on may 1 and keeps them locked on the far side of the free-trade barrier .
recognized only by turkey , the northern part of the divided island can only export to one country - turkey . the ballot is a major blow for the impoverished north , where per capita income is currently four times less than that of greek cypriots . anger and frustration the sentiment of " missed opportunity " has been echoed around the world , but the reality is that it leaves the eu looking pretty silly .
eu enlargement commissioner , günter verheugen has sharply criticized the outcome of the vote , reminding the greek-cypriot government that it was the greek government which had pushed for a unified cyprus in the first place , and that the greek side had pledged to bring its people to agree to the un reunification plan , with the pay-off that cyprus would be accepted into the union . if ever there were any fears that the plan , designed by un secretary general kofi annan , might be rejected , it was that the turkish cypriots might not play along .
but the tables turned and 65 percent voted in favor of joining with their greek neighbors . ultimately the greek cypriots objected to the plan on the grounds that it would not allow greek cypriots who fled south in 1974 to return home , and that it would allow turkish troops to stay on the island for too long , which in turn raised security concerns .
that was all it took for what could have been a united future to become history .
verheugen slammed the reasoning .
" no-one can seriously believe that an eu member state could be threatened by turkish troops , " he said .
" citing inadequate security guarantees is so far removed from reality that i just do n't believe it . " second chance ? in response to the poll , greek cypriot president tassos papandopoulos stressed that his people meant the turkish cypriots no ill will .
he added that his government would make specific proposals to the eu ministers to enable the turkish cypriots to enjoy the benefits of their country 's accession to the eu as much as possible .
he also urged them not to abandon efforts to reunite the island within the eu .
but günter verheugen said he believed the opportunity has passed . " my impression is that there will be no new united nations initiative and i do n't see any chance to negotiate , " he said .
" i do n't know who could lead negotiations and moreover i do n't see any further opportunity for compromise .
what is on the table is the best possible result . " dw staff -lrb- dsl / tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de greek cypriots say " no " to reunification greek cypriots on saturday voted overwhelmingly against reunification with turkish cypriots , sounding the death knell for a un-backed peace plan to end a 30-year division of the island .
-lrb- 24 april 2004 -rrb- cyprus misses " an historic opportunity " world leaders reacted with disappointment and anger to greek cypriots ' rejection of a u.n. peace plan to reunite their island .

the french-german pharmaceutical group aventis has agreed to merge with its french rival sanofi-synthelabo in a move that is expected to create the world 's third-largest drugs company . aventis and sanofi announced on monday they have agreed to merge , ending months of hostilities and government pressure against a potential third party bidder .
the board of aventis accepted a raised takeover offer from its smaller rival , who had upped its bid by 14 percent .
sanofi-synthelabo said that the french-german drug maker had agreed to the terms and that it had now launched a friendly bid of € 54.5 billion -lrb- $ 64.31 billion -rrb- in place of the previously rejected hostile bid of € 47.8 billion .
the french government immediately welcomed the deal between the country 's two main pharmaceutical groups , which would lead to the creation of the world 's third largest behind u.s. giant pfizer and britain 's glaxosmithkline .
government pressure the merger follows a three-month takeover battle in which the french government of prime minister jean-pierre raffarin had actively applied pressure to aventis to accept a local merger solution .
only last week paris had harshly criticized the french-german company 's attempts to negotiate a friendly merger with switzerland 's much larger novartis ag .
a french government official , who asked not to be named , told the associated press that finance minister nicolas sarkozy had put heavy pressure on sanofi to raise its bid for aventis after it became known that novartis was in the running .
the swiss company , however , withdrew from the bidding race late sunday , signaling an unwillingness to be pulled into a battle for aventis against its government-backed rival .
" following aventis ' decision to engage in discussions with sanofi , at the strong intervention of the french government , novartis decided not to proceed , " the company said in an official statement .
on monday raffarin hailed the sanofi-aventis deal , saying it would " maintain decision-making centers and jobs in france and europe . "
german chancellor gerhard schröder and swiss president joseph deiss expressed irritation over paris ' mingling in the business affairs of the pharmaceutical groups , according to french press reports .
politics has no role to play in companies ' decision making processes , schröder was quoted as saying .
aventis , which itself was created from a merger of france 's rhone-poulenc and germany 's hoechst in 1999 , employs about 69,000 people , some 9,000 of whom work in germany . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de novartis to join merger talks with aventis swiss pharmaceutical giant novartis said on thursday it would enter merger talks with france 's aventis , possibly preventing a bid by rival sanofi-synthelabo which is backed by the french government .

there 's still a glimmer of hope that the world 's largest techno music party will survive .
but just in case it does n't , many dw-world readers expressed their sorrow over the parade 's demise . i am sad to hear of the cancellation of the love parade .
i live in new york and was actually planning to come over to berlin for it .
i agree with the decline of techno music in the united states here as well .
out of my friends , i am the only one who listens to it .
yet , when i was in europe , i found this to be untrue .
it still seems to be very popular over there .
there is still a following in the u.s. , yet it seems to be more underground .
maybe next year they will revive the love parade ! - gina bouchard , usa i was planning to visit berlin this summer and attend the love parade .
if it 's cancelled , berlin will be excluded of my tour , maybe the entire country .

the french-german pharmaceutical group aventis has agreed to merge with its french rival sanofi-synthelabo in a move that is expected to create the world 's third-largest drugs company . aventis and sanofi announced on monday they have agreed to merge , ending months of hostilities and government pressure against a potential third party bidder .
the board of aventis accepted a raised takeover offer from its smaller rival , who had upped its bid by 14 percent .
sanofi-synthelabo said that the french-german drug maker had agreed to the terms and that it had now launched a friendly bid of € 54.5 billion -lrb- $ 64.31 billion -rrb- in place of the previously rejected hostile bid of € 47.8 billion .
the french government immediately welcomed the deal between the country 's two main pharmaceutical groups , which would lead to the creation of the world 's third largest behind u.s. giant pfizer and britain 's glaxosmithkline .
government pressure the merger follows a three-month takeover battle in which the french government of prime minister jean-pierre raffarin had actively applied pressure to aventis to accept a local merger solution .
only last week paris had harshly criticized the french-german company 's attempts to negotiate a friendly merger with switzerland 's much larger novartis ag .
a french government official , who asked not to be named , told the associated press that finance minister nicolas sarkozy had put heavy pressure on sanofi to raise its bid for aventis after it became known that novartis was in the running .
the swiss company , however , withdrew from the bidding race late sunday , signaling an unwillingness to be pulled into a battle for aventis against its government-backed rival .
" following aventis ' decision to engage in discussions with sanofi , at the strong intervention of the french government , novartis decided not to proceed , " the company said in an official statement .
on monday raffarin hailed the sanofi-aventis deal , saying it would " maintain decision-making centers and jobs in france and europe . "
german chancellor gerhard schröder and swiss president joseph deiss expressed irritation over paris ' mingling in the business affairs of the pharmaceutical groups , according to french press reports .
politics has no role to play in companies ' decision making processes , schröder was quoted as saying .
aventis , which itself was created from a merger of france 's rhone-poulenc and germany 's hoechst in 1999 , employs about 69,000 people , some 9,000 of whom work in germany . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de novartis to join merger talks with aventis swiss pharmaceutical giant novartis said on thursday it would enter merger talks with france 's aventis , possibly preventing a bid by rival sanofi-synthelabo which is backed by the french government .
-lrb- april 22 , 2004 -rrb- aventis moves to prevent hostile takeover french pharmaceutical company sanofi-synthelabo wants to acquire the franco-german drug-maker aventis in a hostile takeover .
if the € 50 billion merger is successful , it would create the world 's third-largest pharma firm .

the vote came in the face of a landslide rejection of the same referendum by greek cypriots on the southern half of the island .
in a diplomatic slap at greek cypriots , the foreign ministers also ordered that the € 259 million -lrb- $ 307 million -rrb- that had been earmarked for implementing a settlement between the greeks and turks on the island instead be placed in an economic development fund for the turkish half of the island , which has been the subject of an international embargo since turkey invaded cyprus in 1974 .
' an affront to europe ' though turks on the island voted in favor of reunification , the greeks rejected it , meaning the southern half will be the only part of cyprus to enter the eu on may 1 .
" this is an affront to europe , " belgian foreign minister louis michel told the news agency reuters .
" those who campaigned ' no ' may perhaps not have measured all the consequences . "
in a joint statement , the eu council " expressed its determination to ensure that the people of cyprus will soon achieve their shared destiny as citizens of a united cyprus in the european union . "
an audibly irritated günter verheugen , the eu 's commissioner for enlargement , said : " under no circumstances should we allow a situation in which turkish cypriots would be punished for the fact that a settlement could not be reached .
we will have to cooperate with the authorities in the north . "
among the options being considered by the eu is the opening of an official mission in northern cyprus .
unification : so close , so far away never in the 30 years of the island 's divided history had reunification been so close , yet so far . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people read newspapers in central nicosia , cyprus the greek cypriots simply did n't want it , and brashly underlined the fact by voting against with an overwhelming 76 percent .
their ' no ' spells out the end of turkish cypriots ' hopes to become eu citizens on may 1 and keeps them locked on the far side of the free-trade barrier .
recognized only by turkey , the northern part of the divided island can only export to one country - turkey . the ballot is a major blow for the impoverished north , where per capita income is currently four times less than that of greek cypriots . anger and frustration the sentiment of " missed opportunity " has been echoed around the world , but the reality is that it leaves the eu looking pretty silly .
eu enlargement commissioner , günter verheugen has sharply criticized the outcome of the vote , reminding the greek-cypriot government that it was the greek government which had pushed for a unified cyprus in the first place , and that the greek side had pledged to bring its people to agree to the un reunification plan , with the pay-off that cyprus would be accepted into the union . if ever there were any fears that the plan , designed by un secretary general kofi annan , might be rejected , it was that the turkish cypriots might not play along .
but the tables turned and 65 percent voted in favor of joining with their greek neighbors . ultimately the greek cypriots objected to the plan on the grounds that it would not allow greek cypriots who fled south in 1974 to return home , and that it would allow turkish troops to stay on the island for too long , which in turn raised security concerns .
that was all it took for what could have been a united future to become history .
verheugen slammed the reasoning .
" no-one can seriously believe that an eu member state could be threatened by turkish troops , " he said .
" citing inadequate security guarantees is so far removed from reality that i just do n't believe it . " second chance ? in response to the poll , greek cypriot president tassos papandopoulos stressed that his people meant the turkish cypriots no ill will .
he added that his government would make specific proposals to the eu ministers to enable the turkish cypriots to enjoy the benefits of their country 's accession to the eu as much as possible .
he also urged them not to abandon efforts to reunite the island within the eu .
but günter verheugen said he believed the opportunity has passed . " my impression is that there will be no new united nations initiative and i do n't see any chance to negotiate , " he said .
" i do n't know who could lead negotiations and moreover i do n't see any further opportunity for compromise .

there 's still a glimmer of hope that the world 's largest techno music party will survive .
but just in case it does n't , many dw-world readers expressed their sorrow over the parade 's demise . i am sad to hear of the cancellation of the love parade .
i live in new york and was actually planning to come over to berlin for it .
i agree with the decline of techno music in the united states here as well .
out of my friends , i am the only one who listens to it .
yet , when i was in europe , i found this to be untrue .
it still seems to be very popular over there .
there is still a following in the u.s. , yet it seems to be more underground .
maybe next year they will revive the love parade ! - gina bouchard , usa i was planning to visit berlin this summer and attend the love parade .
if it 's cancelled , berlin will be excluded of my tour , maybe the entire country .
i 'm sure that this party will survive , if not in berlin , in another more progressive city -lrb- paris ? -rrb- . - marcelo , chile techno music will be alive in our hearts forever .
save the love parade , the biggest techno manifestation in the world .
berlin never will be the same without love parade and will be eliminated from out list of holiday destinations . - alejandro oyarzún , chile so the first time i come to berlin for the love parade , it has been cancelled .
an event like the love parade can become a world event , indeed it already is , rather like the rio carnival or the new orleans mardi gras .
of course the berlin authorities should bankroll the event : think of the tourism funds !
berlin is a beautiful city and needs to become a great tourist city like paris and london . - graham smith thank god , the love parade is finished - at least i hope so .
what a degrading spectacle it was .
it should have been banned years ago .
it was disgusting all aspects .
the garbage left behind was unbelieveable and the illegal drugs just showed you how far germany has fallen in the gutter . - erni stetz i am absolutely gutted to hear that this year 's parade has been cancelled .
i have always wanted to go but never got round to it .
i finally booked flights and now i cancelled them .
techno music is far from being dead and i think it should still go ahead . - hayley peckett it would be a shame if the love parade was gone .
i lived in berlin for a while and plan to return , i was hoping to attend the parade when i do .
the love parade was a large part of the capital 's pulse and without it , berlin will be lessened .
i know how much germans love to party , so i am sure something will take its place , but it probably wo n't be the same kind of youthful celebration .
the love parade does need to evolve as tastes change , that could be the saving of it , but only if the organizers will make those changes .
i certainly hope that they do , if the love parade dies , it will be a loss for berlin . - dawn rae send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de is the party over for the love parade ?
the organizers of the love parade , the world 's biggest techno music parade , say the event wo n't happen this year .
the mass party , which at its peak had 1.5 million dancing through berlin 's streets , ca n't find financing .

the vote came in the face of a landslide rejection of the same referendum by greek cypriots on the southern half of the island .
in a diplomatic slap at greek cypriots , the foreign ministers also ordered that the € 259 million -lrb- $ 307 million -rrb- that had been earmarked for implementing a settlement between the greeks and turks on the island instead be placed in an economic development fund for the turkish half of the island , which has been the subject of an international embargo since turkey invaded cyprus in 1974 .
' an affront to europe ' though turks on the island voted in favor of reunification , the greeks rejected it , meaning the southern half will be the only part of cyprus to enter the eu on may 1 .
" this is an affront to europe , " belgian foreign minister louis michel told the news agency reuters .
" those who campaigned ' no ' may perhaps not have measured all the consequences . "
in a joint statement , the eu council " expressed its determination to ensure that the people of cyprus will soon achieve their shared destiny as citizens of a united cyprus in the european union . "
an audibly irritated günter verheugen , the eu 's commissioner for enlargement , said : " under no circumstances should we allow a situation in which turkish cypriots would be punished for the fact that a settlement could not be reached .
we will have to cooperate with the authorities in the north . "
among the options being considered by the eu is the opening of an official mission in northern cyprus .
unification : so close , so far away never in the 30 years of the island 's divided history had reunification been so close , yet so far . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people read newspapers in central nicosia , cyprus the greek cypriots simply did n't want it , and brashly underlined the fact by voting against with an overwhelming 76 percent .
their ' no ' spells out the end of turkish cypriots ' hopes to become eu citizens on may 1 and keeps them locked on the far side of the free-trade barrier .
recognized only by turkey , the northern part of the divided island can only export to one country - turkey . the ballot is a major blow for the impoverished north , where per capita income is currently four times less than that of greek cypriots . anger and frustration the sentiment of " missed opportunity " has been echoed around the world , but the reality is that it leaves the eu looking pretty silly .
eu enlargement commissioner , günter verheugen has sharply criticized the outcome of the vote , reminding the greek-cypriot government that it was the greek government which had pushed for a unified cyprus in the first place , and that the greek side had pledged to bring its people to agree to the un reunification plan , with the pay-off that cyprus would be accepted into the union . if ever there were any fears that the plan , designed by un secretary general kofi annan , might be rejected , it was that the turkish cypriots might not play along .
but the tables turned and 65 percent voted in favor of joining with their greek neighbors . ultimately the greek cypriots objected to the plan on the grounds that it would not allow greek cypriots who fled south in 1974 to return home , and that it would allow turkish troops to stay on the island for too long , which in turn raised security concerns .
that was all it took for what could have been a united future to become history .
verheugen slammed the reasoning .
" no-one can seriously believe that an eu member state could be threatened by turkish troops , " he said .
" citing inadequate security guarantees is so far removed from reality that i just do n't believe it . " second chance ? in response to the poll , greek cypriot president tassos papandopoulos stressed that his people meant the turkish cypriots no ill will .
he added that his government would make specific proposals to the eu ministers to enable the turkish cypriots to enjoy the benefits of their country 's accession to the eu as much as possible .
he also urged them not to abandon efforts to reunite the island within the eu .
but günter verheugen said he believed the opportunity has passed . " my impression is that there will be no new united nations initiative and i do n't see any chance to negotiate , " he said .
" i do n't know who could lead negotiations and moreover i do n't see any further opportunity for compromise .
what is on the table is the best possible result .

there 's still a glimmer of hope that the world 's largest techno music party will survive .
but just in case it does n't , many dw-world readers expressed their sorrow over the parade 's demise . i am sad to hear of the cancellation of the love parade .
i live in new york and was actually planning to come over to berlin for it .
i agree with the decline of techno music in the united states here as well .
out of my friends , i am the only one who listens to it .
yet , when i was in europe , i found this to be untrue .
it still seems to be very popular over there .
there is still a following in the u.s. , yet it seems to be more underground .
maybe next year they will revive the love parade ! - gina bouchard , usa i was planning to visit berlin this summer and attend the love parade .
if it 's cancelled , berlin will be excluded of my tour , maybe the entire country .
i 'm sure that this party will survive , if not in berlin , in another more progressive city -lrb- paris ? -rrb- . - marcelo , chile techno music will be alive in our hearts forever .

the french-german pharmaceutical group aventis has agreed to merge with its french rival sanofi-synthelabo in a move that is expected to create the world 's third-largest drugs company . aventis and sanofi announced on monday they have agreed to merge , ending months of hostilities and government pressure against a potential third party bidder .
the board of aventis accepted a raised takeover offer from its smaller rival , who had upped its bid by 14 percent .
sanofi-synthelabo said that the french-german drug maker had agreed to the terms and that it had now launched a friendly bid of € 54.5 billion -lrb- $ 64.31 billion -rrb- in place of the previously rejected hostile bid of € 47.8 billion .
the french government immediately welcomed the deal between the country 's two main pharmaceutical groups , which would lead to the creation of the world 's third largest behind u.s. giant pfizer and britain 's glaxosmithkline .
government pressure the merger follows a three-month takeover battle in which the french government of prime minister jean-pierre raffarin had actively applied pressure to aventis to accept a local merger solution .
only last week paris had harshly criticized the french-german company 's attempts to negotiate a friendly merger with switzerland 's much larger novartis ag .
a french government official , who asked not to be named , told the associated press that finance minister nicolas sarkozy had put heavy pressure on sanofi to raise its bid for aventis after it became known that novartis was in the running .
the swiss company , however , withdrew from the bidding race late sunday , signaling an unwillingness to be pulled into a battle for aventis against its government-backed rival .
" following aventis ' decision to engage in discussions with sanofi , at the strong intervention of the french government , novartis decided not to proceed , " the company said in an official statement .
on monday raffarin hailed the sanofi-aventis deal , saying it would " maintain decision-making centers and jobs in france and europe . "
german chancellor gerhard schröder and swiss president joseph deiss expressed irritation over paris ' mingling in the business affairs of the pharmaceutical groups , according to french press reports .
politics has no role to play in companies ' decision making processes , schröder was quoted as saying .
aventis , which itself was created from a merger of france 's rhone-poulenc and germany 's hoechst in 1999 , employs about 69,000 people , some 9,000 of whom work in germany . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de novartis to join merger talks with aventis swiss pharmaceutical giant novartis said on thursday it would enter merger talks with france 's aventis , possibly preventing a bid by rival sanofi-synthelabo which is backed by the french government .

the swiss company , however , withdrew from the bidding race late sunday , signaling an unwillingness to be pulled into a battle for aventis against its government-backed rival .
" following aventis ' decision to engage in discussions with sanofi , at the strong intervention of the french government , novartis decided not to proceed , " the company said in an official statement .
on monday raffarin hailed the sanofi-aventis deal , saying it would " maintain decision-making centers and jobs in france and europe . "
german chancellor gerhard schröder and swiss president joseph deiss expressed irritation over paris ' mingling in the business affairs of the pharmaceutical groups , according to french press reports .
politics has no role to play in companies ' decision making processes , schröder was quoted as saying .
aventis , which itself was created from a merger of france 's rhone-poulenc and germany 's hoechst in 1999 , employs about 69,000 people , some 9,000 of whom work in germany . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de novartis to join merger talks with aventis swiss pharmaceutical giant novartis said on thursday it would enter merger talks with france 's aventis , possibly preventing a bid by rival sanofi-synthelabo which is backed by the french government .
-lrb- april 22 , 2004 -rrb- aventis moves to prevent hostile takeover french pharmaceutical company sanofi-synthelabo wants to acquire the franco-german drug-maker aventis in a hostile takeover .
if the € 50 billion merger is successful , it would create the world 's third-largest pharma firm .

the shop hours proposal is part of a 34-point government strategy to cut red tape and encourage economic growth and job creation .
but the hde said experience had shown that long shop hours do not automatically bring about an increase in business .
it said sales had not risen markedly since stores were allowed to stay open longer on saturdays almost a year ago .
" people wo n't buy new television sets even if stores give them more time to do so , " holger wenzel , managing director of the hde , said in an interview .
he expects retail sales to stagnate in 2004 after three years of decline .
germany 's verdi labor union , which represents 2.8 million retail workers , has come out against the plan and said last year 's shopping hours extension actually cut jobs by squeezing profits at smaller shops .
clement is also proposing allowing germany 's 16 federal states to determine whether and how long shops can stay open sundays .

there 's still a glimmer of hope that the world 's largest techno music party will survive .
but just in case it does n't , many dw-world readers expressed their sorrow over the parade 's demise . i am sad to hear of the cancellation of the love parade .
i live in new york and was actually planning to come over to berlin for it .
i agree with the decline of techno music in the united states here as well .
out of my friends , i am the only one who listens to it .
yet , when i was in europe , i found this to be untrue .
it still seems to be very popular over there .
there is still a following in the u.s. , yet it seems to be more underground .
maybe next year they will revive the love parade ! - gina bouchard , usa i was planning to visit berlin this summer and attend the love parade .
if it 's cancelled , berlin will be excluded of my tour , maybe the entire country .
i 'm sure that this party will survive , if not in berlin , in another more progressive city -lrb- paris ? -rrb- . - marcelo , chile techno music will be alive in our hearts forever .
save the love parade , the biggest techno manifestation in the world .
berlin never will be the same without love parade and will be eliminated from out list of holiday destinations . - alejandro oyarzún , chile so the first time i come to berlin for the love parade , it has been cancelled .
an event like the love parade can become a world event , indeed it already is , rather like the rio carnival or the new orleans mardi gras .
of course the berlin authorities should bankroll the event : think of the tourism funds !
berlin is a beautiful city and needs to become a great tourist city like paris and london . - graham smith thank god , the love parade is finished - at least i hope so .
what a degrading spectacle it was .
it should have been banned years ago .
it was disgusting all aspects .
the garbage left behind was unbelieveable and the illegal drugs just showed you how far germany has fallen in the gutter . - erni stetz i am absolutely gutted to hear that this year 's parade has been cancelled .
i have always wanted to go but never got round to it .
i finally booked flights and now i cancelled them .
techno music is far from being dead and i think it should still go ahead . - hayley peckett it would be a shame if the love parade was gone .
i lived in berlin for a while and plan to return , i was hoping to attend the parade when i do .
the love parade was a large part of the capital 's pulse and without it , berlin will be lessened .
i know how much germans love to party , so i am sure something will take its place , but it probably wo n't be the same kind of youthful celebration .
the love parade does need to evolve as tastes change , that could be the saving of it , but only if the organizers will make those changes .
i certainly hope that they do , if the love parade dies , it will be a loss for berlin . - dawn rae send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de is the party over for the love parade ?
the organizers of the love parade , the world 's biggest techno music parade , say the event wo n't happen this year .
the mass party , which at its peak had 1.5 million dancing through berlin 's streets , ca n't find financing .

the vote came in the face of a landslide rejection of the same referendum by greek cypriots on the southern half of the island .
in a diplomatic slap at greek cypriots , the foreign ministers also ordered that the € 259 million -lrb- $ 307 million -rrb- that had been earmarked for implementing a settlement between the greeks and turks on the island instead be placed in an economic development fund for the turkish half of the island , which has been the subject of an international embargo since turkey invaded cyprus in 1974 .
' an affront to europe ' though turks on the island voted in favor of reunification , the greeks rejected it , meaning the southern half will be the only part of cyprus to enter the eu on may 1 .
" this is an affront to europe , " belgian foreign minister louis michel told the news agency reuters .
" those who campaigned ' no ' may perhaps not have measured all the consequences . "
in a joint statement , the eu council " expressed its determination to ensure that the people of cyprus will soon achieve their shared destiny as citizens of a united cyprus in the european union . "
an audibly irritated günter verheugen , the eu 's commissioner for enlargement , said : " under no circumstances should we allow a situation in which turkish cypriots would be punished for the fact that a settlement could not be reached .
we will have to cooperate with the authorities in the north . "
among the options being considered by the eu is the opening of an official mission in northern cyprus .
unification : so close , so far away never in the 30 years of the island 's divided history had reunification been so close , yet so far . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people read newspapers in central nicosia , cyprus the greek cypriots simply did n't want it , and brashly underlined the fact by voting against with an overwhelming 76 percent .
their ' no ' spells out the end of turkish cypriots ' hopes to become eu citizens on may 1 and keeps them locked on the far side of the free-trade barrier .
recognized only by turkey , the northern part of the divided island can only export to one country - turkey . the ballot is a major blow for the impoverished north , where per capita income is currently four times less than that of greek cypriots . anger and frustration the sentiment of " missed opportunity " has been echoed around the world , but the reality is that it leaves the eu looking pretty silly .
eu enlargement commissioner , günter verheugen has sharply criticized the outcome of the vote , reminding the greek-cypriot government that it was the greek government which had pushed for a unified cyprus in the first place , and that the greek side had pledged to bring its people to agree to the un reunification plan , with the pay-off that cyprus would be accepted into the union . if ever there were any fears that the plan , designed by un secretary general kofi annan , might be rejected , it was that the turkish cypriots might not play along .
but the tables turned and 65 percent voted in favor of joining with their greek neighbors . ultimately the greek cypriots objected to the plan on the grounds that it would not allow greek cypriots who fled south in 1974 to return home , and that it would allow turkish troops to stay on the island for too long , which in turn raised security concerns .
that was all it took for what could have been a united future to become history .
verheugen slammed the reasoning .
" no-one can seriously believe that an eu member state could be threatened by turkish troops , " he said .
" citing inadequate security guarantees is so far removed from reality that i just do n't believe it . " second chance ? in response to the poll , greek cypriot president tassos papandopoulos stressed that his people meant the turkish cypriots no ill will .
he added that his government would make specific proposals to the eu ministers to enable the turkish cypriots to enjoy the benefits of their country 's accession to the eu as much as possible .
he also urged them not to abandon efforts to reunite the island within the eu .
but günter verheugen said he believed the opportunity has passed . " my impression is that there will be no new united nations initiative and i do n't see any chance to negotiate , " he said .
" i do n't know who could lead negotiations and moreover i do n't see any further opportunity for compromise .

there 's still a glimmer of hope that the world 's largest techno music party will survive .
but just in case it does n't , many dw-world readers expressed their sorrow over the parade 's demise . i am sad to hear of the cancellation of the love parade .
i live in new york and was actually planning to come over to berlin for it .
i agree with the decline of techno music in the united states here as well .
out of my friends , i am the only one who listens to it .
yet , when i was in europe , i found this to be untrue .
it still seems to be very popular over there .
there is still a following in the u.s. , yet it seems to be more underground .
maybe next year they will revive the love parade ! - gina bouchard , usa i was planning to visit berlin this summer and attend the love parade .
if it 's cancelled , berlin will be excluded of my tour , maybe the entire country .
i 'm sure that this party will survive , if not in berlin , in another more progressive city -lrb- paris ? -rrb- . - marcelo , chile techno music will be alive in our hearts forever .
save the love parade , the biggest techno manifestation in the world .
berlin never will be the same without love parade and will be eliminated from out list of holiday destinations . - alejandro oyarzún , chile so the first time i come to berlin for the love parade , it has been cancelled .
an event like the love parade can become a world event , indeed it already is , rather like the rio carnival or the new orleans mardi gras .
of course the berlin authorities should bankroll the event : think of the tourism funds !
berlin is a beautiful city and needs to become a great tourist city like paris and london . - graham smith thank god , the love parade is finished - at least i hope so .
what a degrading spectacle it was .
it should have been banned years ago .
it was disgusting all aspects .
the garbage left behind was unbelieveable and the illegal drugs just showed you how far germany has fallen in the gutter . - erni stetz i am absolutely gutted to hear that this year 's parade has been cancelled .
i have always wanted to go but never got round to it .
i finally booked flights and now i cancelled them .
techno music is far from being dead and i think it should still go ahead . - hayley peckett it would be a shame if the love parade was gone .
i lived in berlin for a while and plan to return , i was hoping to attend the parade when i do .
the love parade was a large part of the capital 's pulse and without it , berlin will be lessened .
i know how much germans love to party , so i am sure something will take its place , but it probably wo n't be the same kind of youthful celebration .
the love parade does need to evolve as tastes change , that could be the saving of it , but only if the organizers will make those changes .
i certainly hope that they do , if the love parade dies , it will be a loss for berlin . - dawn rae send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de is the party over for the love parade ?
the organizers of the love parade , the world 's biggest techno music parade , say the event wo n't happen this year .
the mass party , which at its peak had 1.5 million dancing through berlin 's streets , ca n't find financing .

russian fears are both practical and emotional .
at the popular level , there is a widespread perception that a new " wall " is appearing in europe - one separating the increasingly prosperous " new europe " from russia , as well as its allies , belarus and ukraine .
there is a realisation in russia that the eu 's eastwards expansion will have a much greater immediate impact on russia than nato encroachment , which has been at the centre of russian policy almost since the end of communism .
russian rhetoric over nato expansion has n't changed much - with the country 's defence minister even threatening recently to bolster the nuclear arsenal in response .
but in private , officials are much more sanguine about nato , and preoccupied with the economic impact of eu expansion .
compensation blues in the short term , it is likely to involve economic pain for russia .
the neighbouring countries - the key markets for russian goods - will be obliged to introduce eu quotas and tariffs . "
an eu policy paper suggested eu-russia relations were close to - or had already hit - a post-soviet low " that could hit some of the major russian exports to the region - most importantly , agricultural produce and metals .
russia has asked for millions of euros in compensation to make up for these annual trade losses .
they have not been forthcoming .
russia and the eu interact on many fronts , and the relationship is institutionalised in an impressive number of working committees and inter-state agreements .
but there are some russians who feel europe sees russia as a second-class state and as little more than a source of cheap energy .
and real tensions remain on both sides .
new depths in february , the eu released a policy paper which suggested eu-russia relations were close to - or had already hit - a post-soviet low .
the eu cited , among other factors , human rights abuses in chechnya , the apparent backsliding over democracy and russia 's refusal to sign the kyoto protocol .
russian liberals were happy that the eu had woken up to the fact that russia is not a liberal democracy .
they have been disappointed by the apparent unwillingness of the eu 's leaders to speak out over what they say are mr putin 's authoritarian methods .
it is a situation that russia has used to its advantage .
policy moves raising the stakes dramatically , russia said earlier this year that it would not extend the russia-eu agreement on partnership and cooperation to the new member-states until the eu had met its concerns .
some have been seen before , such as insisting that the eu does more to protect the rights of ethnic russians in the baltic states .
but some are new , like the proposal that russians should enjoy visa-free travel in the eu .
that has been cold-shouldered by the eu , already nervous about russia 's porous borders .
the difficulties with the eu appear to have produced a number of changes in how russian foreign policy is developed - in particular , the appearance of a sharper , more coherent " eu policy " .
until now , russia has preferred dealing directly with - and usually in isolation - london , paris or berlin .
that was a policy which caused suspicion in central europe that russia might try to play the big member states off against the newer , smaller ones , where anti-russian sentiment remains strong .

the whole circle line and the district line between earls court and whitechapel will shut for repairs for 12 weekends between 1 may and december .
district line manager bob thorogood pointed out problems from the driver 's cab , explaining that parts of the track dated back to the 1860s .
the poor condition of some sections means 10 mph limits are imposed .
driver clynt sandford , who was also on the tour , said : " the system has deteriorated considerably over the last 20 years . "
track , ballast and sleepers will be replaced during the major renewal programme which london underground says will mean a smoother journey for passengers .
no work will be carried out during the weekends of the wimbledon tennis championships or during the notting hill carnival .
the line will also shut for five weekends in 2005 .
sections of both lines had to close over the weekend because of a collapsed drain at central london station victoria , which threatened to flood part of the network .

vale of glamorgan mp john smith will hold a public meeting in barry on monday to raise awareness of the problems caused by asbestos exposure .
mr smith claims the barry area is a potential ' hot spot ' for asbestos-related illnesses due to its use in the area 's power stations and docks .
more than 3,000 people a year currently die in the uk from asbestos-related diseases .
mr smith said : " we are likely to see a major upsurge in industrial diseases over the next few years particularly those linked to exposure to asbestos .
we do not know what is out there and what will prove to be dangerous in the future lawyer michael imperato " i hope the meeting will highlight the problem and raise awareness .
" this is going to be a major health issue for this part of wales and the problem will only get worse before it gets better . "
asbestos diseases are caused by inhaling asbestos dust , a mineral commonly used in the construction industry until the 1970s .
workers affected asbestos fibres can lay dormant in the lungs for 30 years or more and victims may be symptom-free for that period of time .
common conditions linked with asbestos are asbestosis , a progressive respiratory disease , lung cancer and mesothelioma -lrb- cancer of the lining of the chest and lungs -rrb- and pleural disease .
more than 3,000 people a year die of the disease in the uk and numbers are predicted to rise to 10,000 a year by 2020 .
those infected are mainly builders , plumbers and shipyard workers , but teachers , children and nurses are believed to have been put at risk since asbestos was used in the construction of some schools and hospitals .
south wales-based industrial disease lawyer michael imperato , who will also be at the meeting to advise potential claimants for industrial injury compensation , added : " many people will have worked in conditions that could affect their health .
" they might not discover this until years later .
" asbestos-related disease is an obvious example of this but it is certainly not the only illness .
" we do not know what is out there and what will prove to be dangerous in the future . "
the meeting will take place at bedwas hall , barry memorial hall at 1900 bst on monday .

vale of glamorgan mp john smith will hold a public meeting in barry on monday to raise awareness of the problems caused by asbestos exposure .
mr smith claims the barry area is a potential ' hot spot ' for asbestos-related illnesses due to its use in the area 's power stations and docks .
more than 3,000 people a year currently die in the uk from asbestos-related diseases .
mr smith said : " we are likely to see a major upsurge in industrial diseases over the next few years particularly those linked to exposure to asbestos .
we do not know what is out there and what will prove to be dangerous in the future lawyer michael imperato " i hope the meeting will highlight the problem and raise awareness .
" this is going to be a major health issue for this part of wales and the problem will only get worse before it gets better . "
asbestos diseases are caused by inhaling asbestos dust , a mineral commonly used in the construction industry until the 1970s .
workers affected asbestos fibres can lay dormant in the lungs for 30 years or more and victims may be symptom-free for that period of time .
common conditions linked with asbestos are asbestosis , a progressive respiratory disease , lung cancer and mesothelioma -lrb- cancer of the lining of the chest and lungs -rrb- and pleural disease .
more than 3,000 people a year die of the disease in the uk and numbers are predicted to rise to 10,000 a year by 2020 .
those infected are mainly builders , plumbers and shipyard workers , but teachers , children and nurses are believed to have been put at risk since asbestos was used in the construction of some schools and hospitals .
south wales-based industrial disease lawyer michael imperato , who will also be at the meeting to advise potential claimants for industrial injury compensation , added : " many people will have worked in conditions that could affect their health .
" they might not discover this until years later .
" asbestos-related disease is an obvious example of this but it is certainly not the only illness .
" we do not know what is out there and what will prove to be dangerous in the future . "

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- outsiders want seat at imf table home news sport radio tv weather languages low graphics -pipe- accessibility help one-minute world news news services your news when you want it news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk business market data economy companies health science & environment technology entertainment also in the news - video and audio - programmes have your say in pictures country profiles special reports related bbc sites sport weather on this day editors ' blog last updated : monday , 26 april , 2004 , 06:37 gmt 07:37 uk e-mail this to a friend printable version outsiders want seat at imf table by andrew walker bbc economics correspondent in washington there is a very clear front runner to take over as managing director of the international monetary fund - the former finance minister of spain , rodrigo rato .
there has been a lot of praise for him personally , but real resentment about the process which will probably end with his appointment .
the root of the problem is an informal deal dating back to the early days of the imf and the world bank in the 1940s .
the unwritten rule is that the imf boss is a western european , the world bank president an american .
line up needless to say , countries outside this little magic circle think it indefensible .
most of them are developing countries , but there are some rich ones too who do n't much like it .
japan , for example , nominated one of its own finance officials when the job last came up for grabs in 2000 .
he did n't get it .
every imf managing director has indeed been european .
mr rato would continue that tradition .
and his candidature emerged in the first instance from the european union , after a period of wrangling between eu members over whether the french national in charge of the european bank for reconstruction and development , jean lemierre , should be the eu candidate .
top slot finance officials from many countries have said pointedly that the new boss should be the best candidate for the job , regardless of nationality .
they have also said the process should be transparent .
there have been five nominations , including mr rato .
three were put forward by the egyptian executive director at the imf .
two of them are non-european -lrb- up to a point at least . -rrb-
one is an egyptian , who is also said to have french nationality ; the other was born in zambia , but now has american nationality .
also nominated are a british former finance official and the bulgarian finance minister .
more say for many developing countries , the selection process is part of a more general grievance about what they consider an inadequate voice in the imf and the world bank .
developing countries want more say at the imf table the boards where most decisions are taken have weighted voting systems .
the weights are very crudely related to economic size , certainly not to population .
the united states for example has 17 % of the vote in the imf .
india with more than three times the population has only 2 % .
contested votes are very rare in the boards of the organisations but it still annoys those who feel under-represented .
many feel that in practice those formal voting weights do represent the real balance of power in the two organisations .
a study published in 2002 by the imf , written by a former senior imf official -lrb- though not representing official imf views -rrb- described the voting arrangements as a " system that requires greater equity " .
doing the rounds other member countries of the imf have been consulted about mr rato .
gordon brown , the british chancellor of the exchequer , has been doing that on behalf of the eu .

his drawings - many of them for roald dahl 's children 's books - are on show at the harris museum in preston .
blake 's first published illustration was carried in punch in 1949 , while he was still at school .
he said he had been delighted at the time , but had no idea it would lead to such a long career .
speaking at the exhibition , blake revealed : " at that age , just getting a drawing published was something very , very special .
" that was the end as far as i was concerned . "
senior exhibitions officer james green said the exhibition was attracting double the usual number of visitors .
it is the only exhibition to display blake 's work outside the capital .
mr green said : " quentin 's work has been popular with generations of adults and children .
" his style is instantly familiar and his images are full of colour , inventiveness and movement . "
blake became an obe in the 1990s and was appointed the uk 's first children 's laureate in 1999 .

former president nyerere was a pillar of the union it may have been a normal saturday afternoon match , but it was one which has taken on a new significance .
the football association of zanzibar has recently been told that it can be a full member of fifa , world football 's governing body , rather than coming under the umbrella of tanzania .
it may seem a small concession but for fiercely proud zanzibaris it 's an important move , a chance to put their island on the world map .

capitalist system these are both small but highly symbolic developments , perhaps a sign as the 40th anniversary of the union of tanganyika and zanzibar is marked , that the latter wants more than ever before to exert its own identity .

" the people of zanzibar have all the rights of the union , they can travel freely and can do business .
zanzibaris recognise the value of this and so have always supported the union , " said mr moyo .
the union deal has allowed zanzibar to remain semi-autonomous with its own president , while benefiting from the economic and political clout of the mainland .
it has outlasted huge political change not least the move away from a socialist to a capitalist system .
poor infrastructure there are no credible moves towards withdrawing zanzibar from the union and going independent , but there are dissenting voices .
the main opposition party feels the union has been unfair to zanzibar one is the main opposition party in tanzania , the civic united front , -lrb- cuf -rrb- which has its stronghold in zanzibar .

" we have less political power now than when the union was formed .
our economy has been suppressed and our development has been held back by 100 years , " she said .
the drop in living standards , the deterioration in infrastructure , schools and medical care are common complaints from zanzibaris .
mining royalties but mainlanders too have similar gripes , according to professor haroub othman , a political analyst at the university of dar es salaam .
" the mainlanders also complain of not getting good deal from union .
this probably reflects the poor state of the tanzanian economy in recent years , " said prof othman .
the tanzanian economy is beginning to push its way out this decline , on the back of huge revenues from tourism in zanzibar and the mainland as well as royalties from mining activities .
if an improving economy translates into better living standards across tanzania , the union will probably attract less criticism .
zanzibar will then have to make do with exerting its own identity through its new national flag and football team .

mouths to feed tasmeen adamji , the owner of african quest safaris , said last year was one of the hardest in her 18 years in the tourism industry .
some of her biggest-spending clients had been american " incentive travellers " who had won an all-expenses-paid trip from their employer for their good performance .
incentive travel accounted for only 5 % of overall customers , but the business accounted for a far greater share of overall revenue , so the effect of the slowdown has been " massive " , ms adamji said .
" you could see the expression on people 's faces , they were desperate .
" a lot of people lost jobs and did not get them back .
" every kenyan employed feeds ten , so if you look at 15,000 jobs lost you have 150,000 mouths to feed , " she said .
glory days khuldip sondhi built reef hotels on the north coast of mombasa in 1971 .
he now looks back in fondness at the glory days of kenyan tourism .
the hope for the future is that the economy will recover and that coast tourism will boom again , but i reckon it will take another two to three years khuldip sondhi owner of reef hotels in mombasa " it was an exotic new destination - we had no competition from anyone , " he said .
the american travel advisory put a complete halt to business , he said .
mr sondhi 's hotel is , however , clearly busy .
on the day we met , the vast majority of people in the hotel were attending an action aid conference on aids awareness for muslims .
conferences now provide about 80 % of mr sondhi 's business .
but unlike overseas tourists , conference goers do not want to lie on the beach or spend money at the bar .
these new customers provide less added value , but they have been a " survival kit for hotels " , mr sondhi said , insisting that mombasa 's hoteliers need to diversify .
optimism high other business people believe that overseas tourists will return to kenya , sooner rather than later .
european charter tourists have long been the coast 's ' bread and butter " , especially for tour operators .
khalid shapi , managing director of pollman 's , the kenyan operator for tui -lrb- thomson -rrb- said he expects charter flights from the uk to resume in november .
this would mean another " badly needed " 540 seats flying to mombasa each week , he said .
his optimism is shared by major william kamunge , chairman of the kenya tourism federation , who believes the travel advisory will be softened and the next season will be better .
fundamental problems but the problems of kenyan tourism are not limited to the attitude of overseas flyers , according to mr kamunge .
kenya needs to invest heavily in tourism , which contributes to 12 % of the country 's economic output , he said .
even if the travel advisory is lifted , kenya needs to improve its tourism product to attract younger travellers , ms adamji said .
reef hotel owner mr sondhi said money needs to be put into improving roads and bringing down the cost of electricity , factors which make kenya an expensive destination .
" the hope for the future is that the economy will recover and that coast tourism will boom again , but i reckon it will take another two to three years , " he said .
