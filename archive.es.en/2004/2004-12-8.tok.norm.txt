in troubled economic times , their subsidies are being slashed or cut altogether .
one berlin-based orchestra may have found a unique way to survive . cultural institutions around germany are struggling with the country 's new economic realities .
with stagnant growth and high unemployment , many of the country 's most esteemed opera houses , museums and orchestras are being forced to tighten their belts . smaller groups in berlin , a city classified as broke by even optimists , have been particularly hard hit .
now , following the berlin senate 's decision this past summer to cut subsidies , the berliner symphoniker , the smallest of the city 's eight official orchestras , is looking to start anew - as germany 's first private orchestra . in doing so , the director is hoping to return to solvency and set an example for germany 's other struggling cultural institutions . " we 're gonna make it on our own " this past summer , the berlin senate , hard pressed to plug holes in the city 's hemorrhaging budget , voted to cut the symphoniker 's € 3 million -lrb- $ 4 million -rrb- in subsidies .
it did n't take long for the 55-strong orchestra to hit the skids , and by september it officially declared insolvency . this week , the orchestra 's director , andreas moritz , and the lawyer overseeing the bankruptcy proceedings , christian köhler-ma , announced plans to make a comeback as germany 's first independent orchestra . in additional to the traditional cost-cutting measures - lower wages , longer hours - at the heart of the turnaround is an aggressive marketing campaign aimed at rebranding the orchestra as young , hip and unconventional . challenging the image of an orchestra bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another poster from the fundraising campaign in its new life as a private orchestra , the berliner symphoniker will challenge traditional notions and look to broaden its profit-oriented horizons .
as such , nothing is being ruled out , according to köhler-ma , who thinks so-called " crossover " ventures with pop stars may be part of the way forward . " ideally , we could plan concerts with robin gibb , metallica , nena or the scorpions , " he told the weekly newsmagazine der spiegel . in addition , the orchestra has hired a flashy marketing company to make sure everyone knows about the " new " symphoniker . moritz , the director , hopes his orchestra 's success as a private enterprise will serve as an example to other cultural institutions struggling with the new economic realities .
" this is a huge chance for us to set an example , and we are convinced we can survive as a private orchestra , " he told the daily die tageszeitung . the first challenge already looms : moritz and company still need to come up with the € 300,000 transitional funds needed to take the first step forward .
they are hoping to find a major sponsor . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the real drama of berlin opera berlin 's three opera houses are no strangers to eluding closure and nursing the wounds of financial incision .
although they are currently on safe ground , they 're having to learn to sing for their supper in unison .
-lrb- november 11 , 2004 -rrb- music to suit your taste carved out carrots , tuned up turnips and a rattle of radish are not exactly your typical orchestra instruments .
but a group from vienna is proving that veggies not only taste good , they sound good too .
-lrb- may 25 , 2004 -rrb- a violent , drug-addled , hooker-filled opera angers sponsors berlin 's theatre-goers are notoriously hard to shock .
but spanish director calixto bieito 's production of mozart 's " abduction from the seraglio " has got audiences pretty hot under the collar .

the team presidencies , which are part of the new constitution , foresee three countries co-operating over 18 months under the control of a council president .
slovenia was chosen as the first new member state because it is " one of the countries whose preparations are out in front , " an eu official said .
all groupings have been chosen so that they do not consist of only new member states ; have at least one large member state ; and are not concentrated in one geographical area .
so poland , denmark and cyprus have been put together as have italy , latvia and luxembourg .
the next new member state up for the job is the czech republic -lrb- along with france and sweden -rrb- in 2008 . " we are consulting with ireland and the netherlands , " said a spokesperson for the slovene mission in brussels .
ireland ran a very successful presidency in the first half of this year while the netherlands currently holds the eu presidency .
lithuania , which will not get a crack at the presidency until 2013 - along with greece and ireland - has also already started its preliminary preparations , said a spokesman .
a hefty administrative exercise - particularly for small member states - the eu presidency involves organizing and chairing the hundreds of meetings and councils that take place in the eu in any given six months .
however , it is also a chance to showcase the host country as ministers and their entourages descend upon different parts of the country to attend meetings .

the team presidencies , which are part of the new constitution , foresee three countries co-operating over 18 months under the control of a council president .
slovenia was chosen as the first new member state because it is " one of the countries whose preparations are out in front , " an eu official said .
all groupings have been chosen so that they do not consist of only new member states ; have at least one large member state ; and are not concentrated in one geographical area .
so poland , denmark and cyprus have been put together as have italy , latvia and luxembourg .
the next new member state up for the job is the czech republic -lrb- along with france and sweden -rrb- in 2008 . " we are consulting with ireland and the netherlands , " said a spokesperson for the slovene mission in brussels .
ireland ran a very successful presidency in the first half of this year while the netherlands currently holds the eu presidency .
lithuania , which will not get a crack at the presidency until 2013 - along with greece and ireland - has also already started its preliminary preparations , said a spokesman .
a hefty administrative exercise - particularly for small member states - the eu presidency involves organizing and chairing the hundreds of meetings and councils that take place in the eu in any given six months .
however , it is also a chance to showcase the host country as ministers and their entourages descend upon different parts of the country to attend meetings .

recent reports of mobbing - bullying - in the german army , the bundeswehr , have caused the nation to look at the phenomenon more closely .
but it is by no means a purely german occurrence . while the german government attempts to get to the bottom of allegations that training officers carried out staged hostage-takings on a number of young army recruits at a camp in western germany and overstepped the boundary to abuse , the british ministry of defense -lrb- mod -rrb- is trying to fight off the latest mobbing claims levelled at its own army .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how violent is the truth ?
at the center of those allegations are the deaths of four young recruits who trained at the deepcut military barracks between 1995 and 2001 .
internal investigations revealed four counts of suicide , but relatives of the dead claimed the soldiers fell prey to a culture of fear and violence , and have called for a public inquiry .
despite a police report investigating abuse at deepcut , which besides the four fatalities , uncovered a further 173 allegations of rape , racism , and beatings , armed services minister adam ingram has so far ruled out the idea of commissioning an independent inquiry .
calling for help this reluctance to allow an independent body to poke about in the armed forces has come as no surprise to malcolm thorn , who is trying to convince the mod to officially recognize his organization called " forces helpline . "
thorn set up his helpline in response to what he recognized as a need among soldiers to seek confidential advice on bullying , and he 's been overwhelmed at the response .
" i 've had thousands of people contacting me , not only from the uk , but also from germany , holland and even new zealand , " thorn told dw-world .
the willingness on the part of soldiers to speak out about incidents of military mobbing seems to be growing . just last week , soldiers in the austrian army shocked the public with their revelations of torture during training sessions intended to prepare them for hostage situations .
that the training got way out of hand was documented on a video tape showing extreme tactics resembling those reported at the us-controlled abu ghraib prison in iraq , where the recruits were stripped , hooded and dragged across the ground .
more than toughening up recruits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a britischer soldier at a uk army infantry training school although the recent incidents of torture in austria , germany and britain have hit the headlines owing to their shock value , thorn said the usual range of allegations , which are largely lodged by young recruits , reflect his own experiences of military mobbing .
" i joined the army when i was 18 .
i was a bit of a wimp and i wanted to be toughened up , but i got beaten to a pulp , " thorn said .
while he confirmed that physical horrors , such as hanging recruits out of the window by their boot laces or bathing them in freezing cold water mixed with human excrement are practices which still go on in the army , he said that mental mobbing has just the same power to break a man .
the power of words it 's a view shared by sven knüppel , who , now a reservist lieutenant in the bundeswehr , has two decades of experience in the ranks of the german armed forces .
" a soldier might be able to withstand serious physical exertion , but if he is constantly subjected to verbal degradation , no matter how small , that can take its toll , " knüppel told dw-world .
bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr has slipped into an uncomfortable limelight that said , he does n't believe there is a strong culture of bullying in the german military .
" the british army has a very different structure to the bundeswehr , in that its tradition has not been broken for many , many years .
after 1945 , the german forces were rebuilt in a completely different way .
yet that is not to say that these things do n't happen , because there are always some crazy people who let their personal style flow back down through the ranks , " knüppel said .
but do the armed forces have a disproportionate number of bullies ?
patrick tissington , a psychologist who has researched the phenomenon , told dw-world he did n't think the army particularly attracts bullies .
" but because of the physical nature of the work , the effects of military mobbing tend to be more dramatic , " he said .
" and what is also very different , is that there is no way to go home . "
a widespread phenomenon although there is nothing remotely new about bullying , it is now more squarely in the mainframe of the collective consciousness than ever before and is recognized as a problem which not everyone can forget about even once they leave the school yard .
bullying is certainly not just limited to the barracks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hospitals are a hotbed of mobbing activity official statistics from a " mobbing report " commissioned by germany 's federal institute for occupational safety and health documented that one in nine germans will be mobbed at the office at least once during their working life .
the highest number of cases are in hospitals , closely followed by employees in social professions such as caregivers for the elderly , public servants and employees of the church .
" this is the human condition .
there is a capability of this kind of thing in all of us .
we tend to follow with the crowd , and if the crowd is n't stopped from bullying , it just continues .
of course it 's about power , about picking on the weak , but it 's also about a desire to be in control of our environment .

recent reports of mobbing - bullying - in the german army , the bundeswehr , have caused the nation to look at the phenomenon more closely .
but it is by no means a purely german occurrence . while the german government attempts to get to the bottom of allegations that training officers carried out staged hostage-takings on a number of young army recruits at a camp in western germany and overstepped the boundary to abuse , the british ministry of defense -lrb- mod -rrb- is trying to fight off the latest mobbing claims levelled at its own army .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how violent is the truth ?
at the center of those allegations are the deaths of four young recruits who trained at the deepcut military barracks between 1995 and 2001 .
internal investigations revealed four counts of suicide , but relatives of the dead claimed the soldiers fell prey to a culture of fear and violence , and have called for a public inquiry .

in troubled economic times , their subsidies are being slashed or cut altogether .
one berlin-based orchestra may have found a unique way to survive . cultural institutions around germany are struggling with the country 's new economic realities .
with stagnant growth and high unemployment , many of the country 's most esteemed opera houses , museums and orchestras are being forced to tighten their belts . smaller groups in berlin , a city classified as broke by even optimists , have been particularly hard hit .
now , following the berlin senate 's decision this past summer to cut subsidies , the berliner symphoniker , the smallest of the city 's eight official orchestras , is looking to start anew - as germany 's first private orchestra . in doing so , the director is hoping to return to solvency and set an example for germany 's other struggling cultural institutions . " we 're gonna make it on our own " this past summer , the berlin senate , hard pressed to plug holes in the city 's hemorrhaging budget , voted to cut the symphoniker 's € 3 million -lrb- $ 4 million -rrb- in subsidies .
it did n't take long for the 55-strong orchestra to hit the skids , and by september it officially declared insolvency . this week , the orchestra 's director , andreas moritz , and the lawyer overseeing the bankruptcy proceedings , christian köhler-ma , announced plans to make a comeback as germany 's first independent orchestra . in additional to the traditional cost-cutting measures - lower wages , longer hours - at the heart of the turnaround is an aggressive marketing campaign aimed at rebranding the orchestra as young , hip and unconventional . challenging the image of an orchestra bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another poster from the fundraising campaign in its new life as a private orchestra , the berliner symphoniker will challenge traditional notions and look to broaden its profit-oriented horizons .
as such , nothing is being ruled out , according to köhler-ma , who thinks so-called " crossover " ventures with pop stars may be part of the way forward . " ideally , we could plan concerts with robin gibb , metallica , nena or the scorpions , " he told the weekly newsmagazine der spiegel . in addition , the orchestra has hired a flashy marketing company to make sure everyone knows about the " new " symphoniker . moritz , the director , hopes his orchestra 's success as a private enterprise will serve as an example to other cultural institutions struggling with the new economic realities .
" this is a huge chance for us to set an example , and we are convinced we can survive as a private orchestra , " he told the daily die tageszeitung . the first challenge already looms : moritz and company still need to come up with the € 300,000 transitional funds needed to take the first step forward .

recent reports of mobbing - bullying - in the german army , the bundeswehr , have caused the nation to look at the phenomenon more closely .
but it is by no means a purely german occurrence . while the german government attempts to get to the bottom of allegations that training officers carried out staged hostage-takings on a number of young army recruits at a camp in western germany and overstepped the boundary to abuse , the british ministry of defense -lrb- mod -rrb- is trying to fight off the latest mobbing claims levelled at its own army .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how violent is the truth ?
at the center of those allegations are the deaths of four young recruits who trained at the deepcut military barracks between 1995 and 2001 .
internal investigations revealed four counts of suicide , but relatives of the dead claimed the soldiers fell prey to a culture of fear and violence , and have called for a public inquiry .
despite a police report investigating abuse at deepcut , which besides the four fatalities , uncovered a further 173 allegations of rape , racism , and beatings , armed services minister adam ingram has so far ruled out the idea of commissioning an independent inquiry .
calling for help this reluctance to allow an independent body to poke about in the armed forces has come as no surprise to malcolm thorn , who is trying to convince the mod to officially recognize his organization called " forces helpline . "
thorn set up his helpline in response to what he recognized as a need among soldiers to seek confidential advice on bullying , and he 's been overwhelmed at the response .
" i 've had thousands of people contacting me , not only from the uk , but also from germany , holland and even new zealand , " thorn told dw-world .
the willingness on the part of soldiers to speak out about incidents of military mobbing seems to be growing . just last week , soldiers in the austrian army shocked the public with their revelations of torture during training sessions intended to prepare them for hostage situations .
that the training got way out of hand was documented on a video tape showing extreme tactics resembling those reported at the us-controlled abu ghraib prison in iraq , where the recruits were stripped , hooded and dragged across the ground .
more than toughening up recruits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a britischer soldier at a uk army infantry training school although the recent incidents of torture in austria , germany and britain have hit the headlines owing to their shock value , thorn said the usual range of allegations , which are largely lodged by young recruits , reflect his own experiences of military mobbing .
" i joined the army when i was 18 .
i was a bit of a wimp and i wanted to be toughened up , but i got beaten to a pulp , " thorn said .
while he confirmed that physical horrors , such as hanging recruits out of the window by their boot laces or bathing them in freezing cold water mixed with human excrement are practices which still go on in the army , he said that mental mobbing has just the same power to break a man .
the power of words it 's a view shared by sven knüppel , who , now a reservist lieutenant in the bundeswehr , has two decades of experience in the ranks of the german armed forces .
" a soldier might be able to withstand serious physical exertion , but if he is constantly subjected to verbal degradation , no matter how small , that can take its toll , " knüppel told dw-world .
bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr has slipped into an uncomfortable limelight that said , he does n't believe there is a strong culture of bullying in the german military .
" the british army has a very different structure to the bundeswehr , in that its tradition has not been broken for many , many years .
after 1945 , the german forces were rebuilt in a completely different way .
yet that is not to say that these things do n't happen , because there are always some crazy people who let their personal style flow back down through the ranks , " knüppel said .
but do the armed forces have a disproportionate number of bullies ?
patrick tissington , a psychologist who has researched the phenomenon , told dw-world he did n't think the army particularly attracts bullies .
" but because of the physical nature of the work , the effects of military mobbing tend to be more dramatic , " he said .
" and what is also very different , is that there is no way to go home . "
a widespread phenomenon although there is nothing remotely new about bullying , it is now more squarely in the mainframe of the collective consciousness than ever before and is recognized as a problem which not everyone can forget about even once they leave the school yard .
bullying is certainly not just limited to the barracks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hospitals are a hotbed of mobbing activity official statistics from a " mobbing report " commissioned by germany 's federal institute for occupational safety and health documented that one in nine germans will be mobbed at the office at least once during their working life .
the highest number of cases are in hospitals , closely followed by employees in social professions such as caregivers for the elderly , public servants and employees of the church .
" this is the human condition .
there is a capability of this kind of thing in all of us .
we tend to follow with the crowd , and if the crowd is n't stopped from bullying , it just continues .
of course it 's about power , about picking on the weak , but it 's also about a desire to be in control of our environment .

recent reports of mobbing - bullying - in the german army , the bundeswehr , have caused the nation to look at the phenomenon more closely .
but it is by no means a purely german occurrence . while the german government attempts to get to the bottom of allegations that training officers carried out staged hostage-takings on a number of young army recruits at a camp in western germany and overstepped the boundary to abuse , the british ministry of defense -lrb- mod -rrb- is trying to fight off the latest mobbing claims levelled at its own army .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how violent is the truth ?
at the center of those allegations are the deaths of four young recruits who trained at the deepcut military barracks between 1995 and 2001 .
internal investigations revealed four counts of suicide , but relatives of the dead claimed the soldiers fell prey to a culture of fear and violence , and have called for a public inquiry .
despite a police report investigating abuse at deepcut , which besides the four fatalities , uncovered a further 173 allegations of rape , racism , and beatings , armed services minister adam ingram has so far ruled out the idea of commissioning an independent inquiry .
calling for help this reluctance to allow an independent body to poke about in the armed forces has come as no surprise to malcolm thorn , who is trying to convince the mod to officially recognize his organization called " forces helpline . "
thorn set up his helpline in response to what he recognized as a need among soldiers to seek confidential advice on bullying , and he 's been overwhelmed at the response .
" i 've had thousands of people contacting me , not only from the uk , but also from germany , holland and even new zealand , " thorn told dw-world .
the willingness on the part of soldiers to speak out about incidents of military mobbing seems to be growing . just last week , soldiers in the austrian army shocked the public with their revelations of torture during training sessions intended to prepare them for hostage situations .
that the training got way out of hand was documented on a video tape showing extreme tactics resembling those reported at the us-controlled abu ghraib prison in iraq , where the recruits were stripped , hooded and dragged across the ground .

more than toughening up recruits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a britischer soldier at a uk army infantry training school although the recent incidents of torture in austria , germany and britain have hit the headlines owing to their shock value , thorn said the usual range of allegations , which are largely lodged by young recruits , reflect his own experiences of military mobbing .
" i joined the army when i was 18 .
i was a bit of a wimp and i wanted to be toughened up , but i got beaten to a pulp , " thorn said .
while he confirmed that physical horrors , such as hanging recruits out of the window by their boot laces or bathing them in freezing cold water mixed with human excrement are practices which still go on in the army , he said that mental mobbing has just the same power to break a man .
the power of words it 's a view shared by sven knüppel , who , now a reservist lieutenant in the bundeswehr , has two decades of experience in the ranks of the german armed forces .
" a soldier might be able to withstand serious physical exertion , but if he is constantly subjected to verbal degradation , no matter how small , that can take its toll , " knüppel told dw-world .
bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr has slipped into an uncomfortable limelight that said , he does n't believe there is a strong culture of bullying in the german military .
" the british army has a very different structure to the bundeswehr , in that its tradition has not been broken for many , many years .
after 1945 , the german forces were rebuilt in a completely different way .
yet that is not to say that these things do n't happen , because there are always some crazy people who let their personal style flow back down through the ranks , " knüppel said .
but do the armed forces have a disproportionate number of bullies ?
patrick tissington , a psychologist who has researched the phenomenon , told dw-world he did n't think the army particularly attracts bullies .
" but because of the physical nature of the work , the effects of military mobbing tend to be more dramatic , " he said .
" and what is also very different , is that there is no way to go home . "
a widespread phenomenon although there is nothing remotely new about bullying , it is now more squarely in the mainframe of the collective consciousness than ever before and is recognized as a problem which not everyone can forget about even once they leave the school yard .
bullying is certainly not just limited to the barracks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hospitals are a hotbed of mobbing activity official statistics from a " mobbing report " commissioned by germany 's federal institute for occupational safety and health documented that one in nine germans will be mobbed at the office at least once during their working life .
the highest number of cases are in hospitals , closely followed by employees in social professions such as caregivers for the elderly , public servants and employees of the church .
" this is the human condition .
there is a capability of this kind of thing in all of us .
we tend to follow with the crowd , and if the crowd is n't stopped from bullying , it just continues .
of course it 's about power , about picking on the weak , but it 's also about a desire to be in control of our environment .
what are needed are good leaders , who deal with the problems early on , " tissington said . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de british army faces own abuse scandal as germany investigates allegations of abuse in its armed forces , in britain , a similar scandal is unfolding .

following the news that greece intentionally and repeatedly doctored budget data submitted to brussels , the european union has now been confronted with revelations that italy has done the same thing . italian opera fans might wave a dismissing hand over the accusations from brussels and say " cosi fan tutte – that ’ s what everybody does , " but finance minister domenico siniscalco found himself hard pressed at an eu meeting in brussels on tuesday over a european commission study that appears to cast serious doubt on his government 's budget data . after closely reviewing italy ’ s finances , eu economic affairs commissioner joaquin almunia expressed alarm over the unreliability of italy 's deficit figures and called for urgent clarification of the country ’ s finances .
meeting with siniscalo , the brussels budget chief said he was concerned with rome ’ s ability to cut taxes and introduce deficit reduction plans . according to official figures from the italian government , annual public deficits since 1997 have never exceeded the eu limit of three percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- – a stipulation of the euro zone ’ s stability and growth pact .
but a regular commission review of the figures has shown that given italy 's snail-like progress in reducing its national debt , the deficit figures should actually be higher . figures don ’ t compare the commission 's report focuses on so-called " stock-flow adjustments " that compare the debt and deficit levels .
over time , these should compensate for each other .
but in italy 's case , the calculations have persistently fallen below the amount of cash the government actually borrowed to finance the deficits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's figures do n't add up , according to the eu commission .
the commission found that every year since 1997 , italy had borrowed more than the eu deficit ceiling , with figures reaching 4.3 percent of gdp in 2001 and 4.1 percent in 2003 , compared to rome 's official forecast of 2.9 percent this year . the commission has also been trying to work out why italy 's public debt , second only to greece 's at 106 percent of gdp and well in excess of the eu ceiling of 60 percent , has been falling more slowly than expected . an eu-wide phenomena ? concern over italy 's budget data comes a week after the commission launched legal action against greece for drastically underreporting its public deficit .
had the correct figures been known at the time , athens would not have been allowed to join the euro zone in 2001 . following the greek case , the revelations about italy have heightened concern about the ability of eu institutions to monitor its member states . german finance minister hans eichel has called for clarification of italy 's figures , but left open what consequences should be implemented if intentional misrepresentation is found .
berlin ’ s hesitancy may not be without self-interest considering that it too is one of the biggest culprits when it comes to failing to conform to eu budget guidelines .
germany , like france , has broken the three-percent stability pact ceiling for the past three years and is risking a fourth infringement . gregg benzow -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european commission to loosen stability pact the european commission on friday unveiled a plan to introduce more flexibility in the stability and growth pact , saying it was vital to restore the credibility of its much-flouted budget discipline rules .

the news may spell trouble for the euro 's stability .

in troubled economic times , their subsidies are being slashed or cut altogether .
one berlin-based orchestra may have found a unique way to survive . cultural institutions around germany are struggling with the country 's new economic realities .
with stagnant growth and high unemployment , many of the country 's most esteemed opera houses , museums and orchestras are being forced to tighten their belts . smaller groups in berlin , a city classified as broke by even optimists , have been particularly hard hit .
now , following the berlin senate 's decision this past summer to cut subsidies , the berliner symphoniker , the smallest of the city 's eight official orchestras , is looking to start anew - as germany 's first private orchestra . in doing so , the director is hoping to return to solvency and set an example for germany 's other struggling cultural institutions . " we 're gonna make it on our own " this past summer , the berlin senate , hard pressed to plug holes in the city 's hemorrhaging budget , voted to cut the symphoniker 's € 3 million -lrb- $ 4 million -rrb- in subsidies .
it did n't take long for the 55-strong orchestra to hit the skids , and by september it officially declared insolvency . this week , the orchestra 's director , andreas moritz , and the lawyer overseeing the bankruptcy proceedings , christian köhler-ma , announced plans to make a comeback as germany 's first independent orchestra . in additional to the traditional cost-cutting measures - lower wages , longer hours - at the heart of the turnaround is an aggressive marketing campaign aimed at rebranding the orchestra as young , hip and unconventional . challenging the image of an orchestra bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another poster from the fundraising campaign in its new life as a private orchestra , the berliner symphoniker will challenge traditional notions and look to broaden its profit-oriented horizons .
as such , nothing is being ruled out , according to köhler-ma , who thinks so-called " crossover " ventures with pop stars may be part of the way forward . " ideally , we could plan concerts with robin gibb , metallica , nena or the scorpions , " he told the weekly newsmagazine der spiegel . in addition , the orchestra has hired a flashy marketing company to make sure everyone knows about the " new " symphoniker . moritz , the director , hopes his orchestra 's success as a private enterprise will serve as an example to other cultural institutions struggling with the new economic realities .
" this is a huge chance for us to set an example , and we are convinced we can survive as a private orchestra , " he told the daily die tageszeitung . the first challenge already looms : moritz and company still need to come up with the € 300,000 transitional funds needed to take the first step forward .

one berlin-based orchestra may have found a unique way to survive . cultural institutions around germany are struggling with the country 's new economic realities .
with stagnant growth and high unemployment , many of the country 's most esteemed opera houses , museums and orchestras are being forced to tighten their belts . smaller groups in berlin , a city classified as broke by even optimists , have been particularly hard hit .
now , following the berlin senate 's decision this past summer to cut subsidies , the berliner symphoniker , the smallest of the city 's eight official orchestras , is looking to start anew - as germany 's first private orchestra . in doing so , the director is hoping to return to solvency and set an example for germany 's other struggling cultural institutions . " we 're gonna make it on our own " this past summer , the berlin senate , hard pressed to plug holes in the city 's hemorrhaging budget , voted to cut the symphoniker 's € 3 million -lrb- $ 4 million -rrb- in subsidies .
it did n't take long for the 55-strong orchestra to hit the skids , and by september it officially declared insolvency . this week , the orchestra 's director , andreas moritz , and the lawyer overseeing the bankruptcy proceedings , christian köhler-ma , announced plans to make a comeback as germany 's first independent orchestra . in additional to the traditional cost-cutting measures - lower wages , longer hours - at the heart of the turnaround is an aggressive marketing campaign aimed at rebranding the orchestra as young , hip and unconventional . challenging the image of an orchestra bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another poster from the fundraising campaign in its new life as a private orchestra , the berliner symphoniker will challenge traditional notions and look to broaden its profit-oriented horizons .
as such , nothing is being ruled out , according to köhler-ma , who thinks so-called " crossover " ventures with pop stars may be part of the way forward . " ideally , we could plan concerts with robin gibb , metallica , nena or the scorpions , " he told the weekly newsmagazine der spiegel . in addition , the orchestra has hired a flashy marketing company to make sure everyone knows about the " new " symphoniker . moritz , the director , hopes his orchestra 's success as a private enterprise will serve as an example to other cultural institutions struggling with the new economic realities .
" this is a huge chance for us to set an example , and we are convinced we can survive as a private orchestra , " he told the daily die tageszeitung . the first challenge already looms : moritz and company still need to come up with the € 300,000 transitional funds needed to take the first step forward .
they are hoping to find a major sponsor . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the real drama of berlin opera berlin 's three opera houses are no strangers to eluding closure and nursing the wounds of financial incision .
although they are currently on safe ground , they 're having to learn to sing for their supper in unison .
-lrb- november 11 , 2004 -rrb- music to suit your taste carved out carrots , tuned up turnips and a rattle of radish are not exactly your typical orchestra instruments .
but a group from vienna is proving that veggies not only taste good , they sound good too .

" the example of structural reforms in eastern germany after reunification shows that privatization can be successful , " he said in changchun at the tail end of an annual visit that focused on the two countries ' growing trade ties . china has become the eu 's second largest trading partner , and the conference in the hague is expected to be dominated by talk of ending europe 's 15-year-old arms embargo to china , a move supported by berlin . schröder flew on to tokyo wednesday , where he 'll be meeting prime minister junichiro koizumi to discuss economic relations and germany and japan 's common interest in permanent seats on the un security council .
an audience with japanese emperor akihito is also on the agenda . demoted to second favourite relations between japan and germany , the world 's second and third largest economies , are friendly , if reserved .
while schröder has visited china six times in the last six years , wednesday 's trip marks just his second official visit to japan since becoming chancellor in 1998 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- second left -rrb- shovels dirt to lay the cornerstone for a new mercedes-benz manufacturing plant in beijing on monday now that german business is booming in china , with trade set to double by 2010 , the country has overtaken japan as germany 's main asian trading partner .
since arriving in beijing monday , schröder signed business contracts worth € 1.4 billion -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- - but he wo n't be getting the same red carpet treatment from japan 's business community . less economics , more politics chancellor schröder 's agenda in japan will be less about economics and more about politics . while berlin has stood firm on its non-participatory stance in iraq , tokyo has sent troops to as part of the reconstruction effort .
after all , with the threat of neighboring north korea on its doorstep , japan is keen to cultivate the us as a political ally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian prime minister manmohan singh -lrb- left -rrb- , japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi -lrb- second from left -rrb- , brazilian president luiz inacio lula da silva -lrb- second form right -rrb- and german foreign minister joschka fischer in new york in september what the two countries do share , however , is an interest in the un 's upcoming reforms .
together with brazil and india , germany and japan recently launched a joint bid for permanent seats on the un security council . tokyo , which would like to see the body extended to 24 members with veto rights , is confident of acceptance - especially given that japan pays more money into the un coffers than any nation except the us .
moreover , asia is under-represented on the security council and tokyo enjoys a close relationship with washington . concern over north korea is one of japan 's chief reasons for pushing for greater influence in the un , where so far , it has been excluded from negotiations on the secret state 's controversial nuclear program - unlike permanent security council member china , north korea 's most important partner . personal rapport the issue will no doubt be the main topic of conversation when schröder and koizumi get together thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and koizumi arriving for the wagner music festival in bayreuth politics aside , the two leaders have already proved they have a certain rapport .
in 2002 , they attended the brazil-germany match at the soccer world cup in yokohama , while the chancellor also invited his japanese counterpart along to the richard wagner opera " tannhäuser " in bayreuth a year later . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder 's packed asian agenda on sunday , german chancellor gerhard schröder embarks on a five-day asian tour to china and japan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.12.2004 eu to work toward ending china arms ban großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pledges of cooperation , but no lifting yet at an eu-china summit on wednesday , the eu said now was not the time to lift its arms embargo on china .
however , eu leaders held out the prospect of ending the ban perhaps next year , despite opposition from the us . the subject of lifting the fifteen-year old eu arms embargo imposed on china in the wake of the bloody crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in tiananmen square took center stage at the 7th annual eu-china summit in the netherlands on wednesday . though eu officials did not name a specific date - delaying an ultimate decision - they did pledge to continue working towards lifting the ban .
in short , they gave a positive signal , but made no promises . " the eu side confirmed its political will to continue to work towards lifting the embargo , " a joint eu-china statement issued at the summit in the hague said . eu representatives in attendance included the dutch foreign minister bernard bot , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , and jose manuel barroso , president of the european commission .
beijing representatives included china 's prime minister wen jiabao and li zhaoxing , the foreign minister . wait and see attitude en route to a meeting with premier jiabao , bot told reporters , " we are working assiduously but … the time is not right to lift the embargo . " european countries , led by britain and sweden , are looking for china to demonstrate progress on human rights and provide assurances that a massive weapons build-up , which could destabilize the entire region , is not planned . premier jiabao denied his country was planning such a build-up .
" lifting the embargo does not mean china would start buying lots of arms in the eu , " he told reporters at a press conference .

ties between the two exporting countries have faded in the last years , as germany looks more towards china . when chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s plane touched down in tokyo on wednesday , it was only the second time the german leader had paid an official state visit to japan since taking office .
compared to six visits in so many years to neighboring china , schröder and his government have not been nearly as attentive of the only asian member of the g8 club of wealthy nations . even during his current asia tour , the message was clear : germany is in china fever and clearly aims to be the number one foreign player in the rapidly growing asian market . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor schröder arrived in japan on wednesday with some 20-plus business contracts signed and in the bag , schröder headed to japan , where not a single trade issue landed on the agenda .
that the two-day stop-over and visit with prime minister junichiro koizumi was not regarded as an economic highlight became clear when 10 of the 40-some business leaders traveling with schröder headed home after meetings in beijing . reliable but boring after enjoying decades of positive relations with tokyo , the interest in negotiating new business deals linking japan and germany has become little more than routine . viewed from the perspective of tokyo the relationship doesn ’ t look much better . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is a beer-drinking country , but does it offer anything else ?
“ the japanese regard germany more as a museum and not as an example for a modern industrial economy , ” said franz waldenberger , economist and professor at the japan center in munich .
“ even the cultural image of germany is reduced to the old clichés of beer drinking , sausages and soccer . ” although business continues to run smoothly between the two countries , japan and germany have both re-orientated themselves .
according to waldenberger , while germans look more towards china , japanese business leaders are discovering eastern europe .
does that mean japan has become germany 's second-tier trading partner in asia ?
not necessarily , said waldenberger . despite all the new-found enthusiasm for china and all the high-profile contracts linking the two countries , one thing remains clear : german companies on average continue to turn bigger profits in the land of the rising sun than the people ’ s republic , waldenberger said . mid-size firms are the key in the third quarter of 2004 , germany exported goods worth € 3.3 billion to japan , some 8.4 percent higher than during the same period a year before .
for waldenbeger , that ’ s reason enough not to view the fading official relations as an indicator of declining economic interest . “ economic ties to japan are quite mature , ” the japan expert said .
“ it ’ s now up to small and mid-size companies to venture into the japanese market , and that ’ s not something that can be encouraged through political framework .
german companies have to play an active role and take advantage of the opportunities available . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japan 's economy may not be booming like china 's , but it is stable .
although the japanese market will never again experience a boom like the current one in china , there ’ s still quite a bit of room for german companies to get their foot in the door .
they have especially good chances of succeeding in the areas of construction , environment and medical technology , and unlike china , german investors don ’ t have to worry about a sudden collapse of the economy , waldenberger said .
the japanese economy is currently on the upswing . keeping the friendship alive just to make sure the message is getting out that germany has not completely neglected its old trading partner and is still interested in doing business in japan , the government is launching a new image campaign in 2005 entitled “ germany in japan . ” regardless of developing ties elsewhere , berlin wants to make sure the world ’ s second and third largest economies continue to enjoy good cultural and economic relations .

ties between the two exporting countries have faded in the last years , as germany looks more towards china . when chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s plane touched down in tokyo on wednesday , it was only the second time the german leader had paid an official state visit to japan since taking office .
compared to six visits in so many years to neighboring china , schröder and his government have not been nearly as attentive of the only asian member of the g8 club of wealthy nations . even during his current asia tour , the message was clear : germany is in china fever and clearly aims to be the number one foreign player in the rapidly growing asian market . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor schröder arrived in japan on wednesday with some 20-plus business contracts signed and in the bag , schröder headed to japan , where not a single trade issue landed on the agenda .
that the two-day stop-over and visit with prime minister junichiro koizumi was not regarded as an economic highlight became clear when 10 of the 40-some business leaders traveling with schröder headed home after meetings in beijing . reliable but boring after enjoying decades of positive relations with tokyo , the interest in negotiating new business deals linking japan and germany has become little more than routine . viewed from the perspective of tokyo the relationship doesn ’ t look much better . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is a beer-drinking country , but does it offer anything else ?
“ the japanese regard germany more as a museum and not as an example for a modern industrial economy , ” said franz waldenberger , economist and professor at the japan center in munich .
“ even the cultural image of germany is reduced to the old clichés of beer drinking , sausages and soccer . ” although business continues to run smoothly between the two countries , japan and germany have both re-orientated themselves .
according to waldenberger , while germans look more towards china , japanese business leaders are discovering eastern europe .
does that mean japan has become germany 's second-tier trading partner in asia ?
not necessarily , said waldenberger . despite all the new-found enthusiasm for china and all the high-profile contracts linking the two countries , one thing remains clear : german companies on average continue to turn bigger profits in the land of the rising sun than the people ’ s republic , waldenberger said . mid-size firms are the key in the third quarter of 2004 , germany exported goods worth € 3.3 billion to japan , some 8.4 percent higher than during the same period a year before .
for waldenbeger , that ’ s reason enough not to view the fading official relations as an indicator of declining economic interest . “ economic ties to japan are quite mature , ” the japan expert said .
“ it ’ s now up to small and mid-size companies to venture into the japanese market , and that ’ s not something that can be encouraged through political framework .
german companies have to play an active role and take advantage of the opportunities available . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japan 's economy may not be booming like china 's , but it is stable .
although the japanese market will never again experience a boom like the current one in china , there ’ s still quite a bit of room for german companies to get their foot in the door .
they have especially good chances of succeeding in the areas of construction , environment and medical technology , and unlike china , german investors don ’ t have to worry about a sudden collapse of the economy , waldenberger said .
the japanese economy is currently on the upswing . keeping the friendship alive just to make sure the message is getting out that germany has not completely neglected its old trading partner and is still interested in doing business in japan , the government is launching a new image campaign in 2005 entitled “ germany in japan . ” regardless of developing ties elsewhere , berlin wants to make sure the world ’ s second and third largest economies continue to enjoy good cultural and economic relations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 08.12.2004 japan : germany ’ s weaker asian link großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japan 's image in germany has faded recently the german-japan connection is not what it used to be , neither culturally nor economically .
ties between the two exporting countries have faded in the last years , as germany looks more towards china . when chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s plane touched down in tokyo on wednesday , it was only the second time the german leader had paid an official state visit to japan since taking office .
compared to six visits in so many years to neighboring china , schröder and his government have not been nearly as attentive of the only asian member of the g8 club of wealthy nations . even during his current asia tour , the message was clear : germany is in china fever and clearly aims to be the number one foreign player in the rapidly growing asian market . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor schröder arrived in japan on wednesday with some 20-plus business contracts signed and in the bag , schröder headed to japan , where not a single trade issue landed on the agenda .
that the two-day stop-over and visit with prime minister junichiro koizumi was not regarded as an economic highlight became clear when 10 of the 40-some business leaders traveling with schröder headed home after meetings in beijing . reliable but boring after enjoying decades of positive relations with tokyo , the interest in negotiating new business deals linking japan and germany has become little more than routine . viewed from the perspective of tokyo the relationship doesn ’ t look much better . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is a beer-drinking country , but does it offer anything else ?
“ the japanese regard germany more as a museum and not as an example for a modern industrial economy , ” said franz waldenberger , economist and professor at the japan center in munich .
“ even the cultural image of germany is reduced to the old clichés of beer drinking , sausages and soccer . ” although business continues to run smoothly between the two countries , japan and germany have both re-orientated themselves .
according to waldenberger , while germans look more towards china , japanese business leaders are discovering eastern europe .
does that mean japan has become germany 's second-tier trading partner in asia ?
not necessarily , said waldenberger . despite all the new-found enthusiasm for china and all the high-profile contracts linking the two countries , one thing remains clear : german companies on average continue to turn bigger profits in the land of the rising sun than the people ’ s republic , waldenberger said . mid-size firms are the key in the third quarter of 2004 , germany exported goods worth € 3.3 billion to japan , some 8.4 percent higher than during the same period a year before .
for waldenbeger , that ’ s reason enough not to view the fading official relations as an indicator of declining economic interest . “ economic ties to japan are quite mature , ” the japan expert said .
“ it ’ s now up to small and mid-size companies to venture into the japanese market , and that ’ s not something that can be encouraged through political framework .
german companies have to play an active role and take advantage of the opportunities available . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japan 's economy may not be booming like china 's , but it is stable .
although the japanese market will never again experience a boom like the current one in china , there ’ s still quite a bit of room for german companies to get their foot in the door .
they have especially good chances of succeeding in the areas of construction , environment and medical technology , and unlike china , german investors don ’ t have to worry about a sudden collapse of the economy , waldenberger said .
the japanese economy is currently on the upswing . keeping the friendship alive just to make sure the message is getting out that germany has not completely neglected its old trading partner and is still interested in doing business in japan , the government is launching a new image campaign in 2005 entitled “ germany in japan . ” regardless of developing ties elsewhere , berlin wants to make sure the world ’ s second and third largest economies continue to enjoy good cultural and economic relations .

meeting with siniscalo , the brussels budget chief said he was concerned with rome ’ s ability to cut taxes and introduce deficit reduction plans . according to official figures from the italian government , annual public deficits since 1997 have never exceeded the eu limit of three percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- – a stipulation of the euro zone ’ s stability and growth pact .
but a regular commission review of the figures has shown that given italy 's snail-like progress in reducing its national debt , the deficit figures should actually be higher . figures don ’ t compare the commission 's report focuses on so-called " stock-flow adjustments " that compare the debt and deficit levels .

but in italy 's case , the calculations have persistently fallen below the amount of cash the government actually borrowed to finance the deficits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's figures do n't add up , according to the eu commission .
the commission found that every year since 1997 , italy had borrowed more than the eu deficit ceiling , with figures reaching 4.3 percent of gdp in 2001 and 4.1 percent in 2003 , compared to rome 's official forecast of 2.9 percent this year . the commission has also been trying to work out why italy 's public debt , second only to greece 's at 106 percent of gdp and well in excess of the eu ceiling of 60 percent , has been falling more slowly than expected . an eu-wide phenomena ? concern over italy 's budget data comes a week after the commission launched legal action against greece for drastically underreporting its public deficit .

recent reports of mobbing - bullying - in the german army , the bundeswehr , have caused the nation to look at the phenomenon more closely .
but it is by no means a purely german occurrence . while the german government attempts to get to the bottom of allegations that training officers carried out staged hostage-takings on a number of young army recruits at a camp in western germany and overstepped the boundary to abuse , the british ministry of defense -lrb- mod -rrb- is trying to fight off the latest mobbing claims levelled at its own army .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how violent is the truth ?
at the center of those allegations are the deaths of four young recruits who trained at the deepcut military barracks between 1995 and 2001 .
internal investigations revealed four counts of suicide , but relatives of the dead claimed the soldiers fell prey to a culture of fear and violence , and have called for a public inquiry .
despite a police report investigating abuse at deepcut , which besides the four fatalities , uncovered a further 173 allegations of rape , racism , and beatings , armed services minister adam ingram has so far ruled out the idea of commissioning an independent inquiry .
calling for help this reluctance to allow an independent body to poke about in the armed forces has come as no surprise to malcolm thorn , who is trying to convince the mod to officially recognize his organization called " forces helpline . "
thorn set up his helpline in response to what he recognized as a need among soldiers to seek confidential advice on bullying , and he 's been overwhelmed at the response .
" i 've had thousands of people contacting me , not only from the uk , but also from germany , holland and even new zealand , " thorn told dw-world .
the willingness on the part of soldiers to speak out about incidents of military mobbing seems to be growing . just last week , soldiers in the austrian army shocked the public with their revelations of torture during training sessions intended to prepare them for hostage situations .
that the training got way out of hand was documented on a video tape showing extreme tactics resembling those reported at the us-controlled abu ghraib prison in iraq , where the recruits were stripped , hooded and dragged across the ground .
more than toughening up recruits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a britischer soldier at a uk army infantry training school although the recent incidents of torture in austria , germany and britain have hit the headlines owing to their shock value , thorn said the usual range of allegations , which are largely lodged by young recruits , reflect his own experiences of military mobbing .
" i joined the army when i was 18 .
i was a bit of a wimp and i wanted to be toughened up , but i got beaten to a pulp , " thorn said .
while he confirmed that physical horrors , such as hanging recruits out of the window by their boot laces or bathing them in freezing cold water mixed with human excrement are practices which still go on in the army , he said that mental mobbing has just the same power to break a man .
the power of words it 's a view shared by sven knüppel , who , now a reservist lieutenant in the bundeswehr , has two decades of experience in the ranks of the german armed forces .
" a soldier might be able to withstand serious physical exertion , but if he is constantly subjected to verbal degradation , no matter how small , that can take its toll , " knüppel told dw-world .
bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr has slipped into an uncomfortable limelight that said , he does n't believe there is a strong culture of bullying in the german military .
" the british army has a very different structure to the bundeswehr , in that its tradition has not been broken for many , many years .
after 1945 , the german forces were rebuilt in a completely different way .
yet that is not to say that these things do n't happen , because there are always some crazy people who let their personal style flow back down through the ranks , " knüppel said .
but do the armed forces have a disproportionate number of bullies ?
patrick tissington , a psychologist who has researched the phenomenon , told dw-world he did n't think the army particularly attracts bullies .
" but because of the physical nature of the work , the effects of military mobbing tend to be more dramatic , " he said .
" and what is also very different , is that there is no way to go home . "
a widespread phenomenon although there is nothing remotely new about bullying , it is now more squarely in the mainframe of the collective consciousness than ever before and is recognized as a problem which not everyone can forget about even once they leave the school yard .
bullying is certainly not just limited to the barracks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hospitals are a hotbed of mobbing activity official statistics from a " mobbing report " commissioned by germany 's federal institute for occupational safety and health documented that one in nine germans will be mobbed at the office at least once during their working life .
the highest number of cases are in hospitals , closely followed by employees in social professions such as caregivers for the elderly , public servants and employees of the church .
" this is the human condition .
there is a capability of this kind of thing in all of us .
we tend to follow with the crowd , and if the crowd is n't stopped from bullying , it just continues .
of course it 's about power , about picking on the weak , but it 's also about a desire to be in control of our environment .
what are needed are good leaders , who deal with the problems early on , " tissington said . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de british army faces own abuse scandal as germany investigates allegations of abuse in its armed forces , in britain , a similar scandal is unfolding .

recent reports of mobbing - bullying - in the german army , the bundeswehr , have caused the nation to look at the phenomenon more closely .
but it is by no means a purely german occurrence . while the german government attempts to get to the bottom of allegations that training officers carried out staged hostage-takings on a number of young army recruits at a camp in western germany and overstepped the boundary to abuse , the british ministry of defense -lrb- mod -rrb- is trying to fight off the latest mobbing claims levelled at its own army .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how violent is the truth ?
at the center of those allegations are the deaths of four young recruits who trained at the deepcut military barracks between 1995 and 2001 .
internal investigations revealed four counts of suicide , but relatives of the dead claimed the soldiers fell prey to a culture of fear and violence , and have called for a public inquiry .
despite a police report investigating abuse at deepcut , which besides the four fatalities , uncovered a further 173 allegations of rape , racism , and beatings , armed services minister adam ingram has so far ruled out the idea of commissioning an independent inquiry .
calling for help this reluctance to allow an independent body to poke about in the armed forces has come as no surprise to malcolm thorn , who is trying to convince the mod to officially recognize his organization called " forces helpline . "
thorn set up his helpline in response to what he recognized as a need among soldiers to seek confidential advice on bullying , and he 's been overwhelmed at the response .
" i 've had thousands of people contacting me , not only from the uk , but also from germany , holland and even new zealand , " thorn told dw-world .
the willingness on the part of soldiers to speak out about incidents of military mobbing seems to be growing . just last week , soldiers in the austrian army shocked the public with their revelations of torture during training sessions intended to prepare them for hostage situations .
that the training got way out of hand was documented on a video tape showing extreme tactics resembling those reported at the us-controlled abu ghraib prison in iraq , where the recruits were stripped , hooded and dragged across the ground .
more than toughening up recruits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a britischer soldier at a uk army infantry training school although the recent incidents of torture in austria , germany and britain have hit the headlines owing to their shock value , thorn said the usual range of allegations , which are largely lodged by young recruits , reflect his own experiences of military mobbing .
" i joined the army when i was 18 .
i was a bit of a wimp and i wanted to be toughened up , but i got beaten to a pulp , " thorn said .
while he confirmed that physical horrors , such as hanging recruits out of the window by their boot laces or bathing them in freezing cold water mixed with human excrement are practices which still go on in the army , he said that mental mobbing has just the same power to break a man .
the power of words it 's a view shared by sven knüppel , who , now a reservist lieutenant in the bundeswehr , has two decades of experience in the ranks of the german armed forces .
" a soldier might be able to withstand serious physical exertion , but if he is constantly subjected to verbal degradation , no matter how small , that can take its toll , " knüppel told dw-world .
bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr has slipped into an uncomfortable limelight that said , he does n't believe there is a strong culture of bullying in the german military .
" the british army has a very different structure to the bundeswehr , in that its tradition has not been broken for many , many years .
after 1945 , the german forces were rebuilt in a completely different way .
yet that is not to say that these things do n't happen , because there are always some crazy people who let their personal style flow back down through the ranks , " knüppel said .
but do the armed forces have a disproportionate number of bullies ?
patrick tissington , a psychologist who has researched the phenomenon , told dw-world he did n't think the army particularly attracts bullies .
" but because of the physical nature of the work , the effects of military mobbing tend to be more dramatic , " he said .
" and what is also very different , is that there is no way to go home . "
a widespread phenomenon although there is nothing remotely new about bullying , it is now more squarely in the mainframe of the collective consciousness than ever before and is recognized as a problem which not everyone can forget about even once they leave the school yard .
bullying is certainly not just limited to the barracks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hospitals are a hotbed of mobbing activity official statistics from a " mobbing report " commissioned by germany 's federal institute for occupational safety and health documented that one in nine germans will be mobbed at the office at least once during their working life .
the highest number of cases are in hospitals , closely followed by employees in social professions such as caregivers for the elderly , public servants and employees of the church .
" this is the human condition .
there is a capability of this kind of thing in all of us .
we tend to follow with the crowd , and if the crowd is n't stopped from bullying , it just continues .
of course it 's about power , about picking on the weak , but it 's also about a desire to be in control of our environment .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.12.2004 eu to work toward ending china arms ban großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pledges of cooperation , but no lifting yet at an eu-china summit on wednesday , the eu said now was not the time to lift its arms embargo on china .
however , eu leaders held out the prospect of ending the ban perhaps next year , despite opposition from the us . the subject of lifting the fifteen-year old eu arms embargo imposed on china in the wake of the bloody crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in tiananmen square took center stage at the 7th annual eu-china summit in the netherlands on wednesday . though eu officials did not name a specific date - delaying an ultimate decision - they did pledge to continue working towards lifting the ban .
in short , they gave a positive signal , but made no promises . " the eu side confirmed its political will to continue to work towards lifting the embargo , " a joint eu-china statement issued at the summit in the hague said . eu representatives in attendance included the dutch foreign minister bernard bot , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , and jose manuel barroso , president of the european commission .
beijing representatives included china 's prime minister wen jiabao and li zhaoxing , the foreign minister . wait and see attitude en route to a meeting with premier jiabao , bot told reporters , " we are working assiduously but … the time is not right to lift the embargo . " european countries , led by britain and sweden , are looking for china to demonstrate progress on human rights and provide assurances that a massive weapons build-up , which could destabilize the entire region , is not planned . premier jiabao denied his country was planning such a build-up .
" lifting the embargo does not mean china would start buying lots of arms in the eu , " he told reporters at a press conference .
" the embargo means getting rid of political discrimination against china . " " remnant of the cold war " china has pushed hard in its dealings with the eu to end the embargo , which it considers a relic of the cold war . with a massive , increasingly affluent domestic market which european businesses are eager to exploit , chinese officials have been able to exercise more leverage with european leaders .
the eu has become china 's largest trading partner , but an eu trade deficit of € 64.2 -lrb- $ 86.34 -rrb- billion still remains . u.s. and rights groups critical human rights groups and the united states , however , are fiercely opposed to the eu lifting the weapons ban .
groups like human rights watch have serious concerns over china 's commitment to improving its human rights record . the eu should not let " business interests trump its longstanding proclaimed commitment to human rights in china , " it warned in a statement released shortly before the start of the summit . us officials are worried that lifting the embargo would prompt china to go on a buying spree to accumulate weapons it can use to intimidate its neighbors , like taiwan . in an effort to appease both sides , the eu and china discussed a joint declaration on non-proliferation issues and the eu promised to set up a new code of conduct , should the embargo be lifted .
it would aim to ensure arms imported from the eu are not intended for domestic oppression or regional conflicts . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de arms , cars top schröder ’ s china trip german chancellor gerhard schröder arrived in beijing on monday for a three-day visit focusing on expanding trade ties and the european union ’ s ban on arms sales to china .

to ensure they 'll last that long , iraqi trainees are also given talks on technical expertise , relayed via interpreters .
another contingent of iraqi soldiers is receiving mechanical training to enable them to carry out tank maintenance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trainee program peter struck -lrb- photo -rrb- will be visiting is part of nato 's iraqi aid package .
the speed with which germany began implementing the plan agreed in june is due first and foremost to berlin 's good ties with the united arab emirates , where german detectives have already been training iraqi police for the last several months . in both training programs , the two countries are sharing responsibilities - with the united arab emirates providing military barracks and training grounds , organizing and funding the transport of iraqi soldiers to abu dhabi and shipping trucks to iraq . keeping germans out of iraq as far as berlin is concerned , the collaboration has one major advantage : german soldiers wo n't actually be deployed on iraqi soil , but are nonetheless providing valuable aid .
the german government has refused to deploy bundeswehr soldiers in nato units in the war-torn country , which means its training services are a welcome compromise . in return , iraqi troops are happy to take advantage of training programs in safe conditions , unlike their colleagues in iraq who repeatedly find themselves the target of insurgent attacks .
in fact , even abu dhabi is not entirely secure - which is why participating soldiers remain anonymous and filming on the grounds is prohibited . extending aid ? the first training programs in the united arab emirates are set to wrap up by christmas .
further military training projects are in the pipeline , with the iraqi army expressing interest in bundeswehr expertise in weapons clearance as well as engineering . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : during iraqi prime minister ayad allawi 's -lrb- photo -rrb- recent visit to berlin , chancellor gerhard schröder again offered the services of german troops in training iraqi soldiers in weapons ' clearance .

however , eu leaders held out the prospect of ending the ban perhaps next year , despite opposition from the us . the subject of lifting the fifteen-year old eu arms embargo imposed on china in the wake of the bloody crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in tiananmen square took center stage at the 7th annual eu-china summit in the netherlands on wednesday . though eu officials did not name a specific date - delaying an ultimate decision - they did pledge to continue working towards lifting the ban .

more leisure time came in second place , with 26 percent preferring to loaf around more .
only a paltry 6 percent of respondents said more sex in 2005 would trump either money or time . according to the survey , it is those in their forties who seem to have largely replaced their interest in sex and with a lust for legal tender - 67 percent of this group opted for more cash .
residents of the state of hesse also qualified as cold fish .
only 1 percent of them said sex beat out money . women also came off as less enthusiastic about sex than men .
while 10 percent of men reported more sex was a priority , only 2 percent of women did .

following the news that greece intentionally and repeatedly doctored budget data submitted to brussels , the european union has now been confronted with revelations that italy has done the same thing . italian opera fans might wave a dismissing hand over the accusations from brussels and say " cosi fan tutte – that ’ s what everybody does , " but finance minister domenico siniscalco found himself hard pressed at an eu meeting in brussels on tuesday over a european commission study that appears to cast serious doubt on his government 's budget data . after closely reviewing italy ’ s finances , eu economic affairs commissioner joaquin almunia expressed alarm over the unreliability of italy 's deficit figures and called for urgent clarification of the country ’ s finances .
meeting with siniscalo , the brussels budget chief said he was concerned with rome ’ s ability to cut taxes and introduce deficit reduction plans . according to official figures from the italian government , annual public deficits since 1997 have never exceeded the eu limit of three percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- – a stipulation of the euro zone ’ s stability and growth pact .
but a regular commission review of the figures has shown that given italy 's snail-like progress in reducing its national debt , the deficit figures should actually be higher . figures don ’ t compare the commission 's report focuses on so-called " stock-flow adjustments " that compare the debt and deficit levels .
over time , these should compensate for each other .
but in italy 's case , the calculations have persistently fallen below the amount of cash the government actually borrowed to finance the deficits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's figures do n't add up , according to the eu commission .
the commission found that every year since 1997 , italy had borrowed more than the eu deficit ceiling , with figures reaching 4.3 percent of gdp in 2001 and 4.1 percent in 2003 , compared to rome 's official forecast of 2.9 percent this year . the commission has also been trying to work out why italy 's public debt , second only to greece 's at 106 percent of gdp and well in excess of the eu ceiling of 60 percent , has been falling more slowly than expected . an eu-wide phenomena ? concern over italy 's budget data comes a week after the commission launched legal action against greece for drastically underreporting its public deficit .
had the correct figures been known at the time , athens would not have been allowed to join the euro zone in 2001 . following the greek case , the revelations about italy have heightened concern about the ability of eu institutions to monitor its member states . german finance minister hans eichel has called for clarification of italy 's figures , but left open what consequences should be implemented if intentional misrepresentation is found .

meeting with siniscalo , the brussels budget chief said he was concerned with rome ’ s ability to cut taxes and introduce deficit reduction plans . according to official figures from the italian government , annual public deficits since 1997 have never exceeded the eu limit of three percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- – a stipulation of the euro zone ’ s stability and growth pact .
but a regular commission review of the figures has shown that given italy 's snail-like progress in reducing its national debt , the deficit figures should actually be higher . figures don ’ t compare the commission 's report focuses on so-called " stock-flow adjustments " that compare the debt and deficit levels .
over time , these should compensate for each other .
but in italy 's case , the calculations have persistently fallen below the amount of cash the government actually borrowed to finance the deficits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's figures do n't add up , according to the eu commission .
the commission found that every year since 1997 , italy had borrowed more than the eu deficit ceiling , with figures reaching 4.3 percent of gdp in 2001 and 4.1 percent in 2003 , compared to rome 's official forecast of 2.9 percent this year . the commission has also been trying to work out why italy 's public debt , second only to greece 's at 106 percent of gdp and well in excess of the eu ceiling of 60 percent , has been falling more slowly than expected . an eu-wide phenomena ? concern over italy 's budget data comes a week after the commission launched legal action against greece for drastically underreporting its public deficit .
had the correct figures been known at the time , athens would not have been allowed to join the euro zone in 2001 . following the greek case , the revelations about italy have heightened concern about the ability of eu institutions to monitor its member states . german finance minister hans eichel has called for clarification of italy 's figures , but left open what consequences should be implemented if intentional misrepresentation is found .

recent reports of mobbing - bullying - in the german army , the bundeswehr , have caused the nation to look at the phenomenon more closely .
but it is by no means a purely german occurrence . while the german government attempts to get to the bottom of allegations that training officers carried out staged hostage-takings on a number of young army recruits at a camp in western germany and overstepped the boundary to abuse , the british ministry of defense -lrb- mod -rrb- is trying to fight off the latest mobbing claims levelled at its own army .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how violent is the truth ?
at the center of those allegations are the deaths of four young recruits who trained at the deepcut military barracks between 1995 and 2001 .
internal investigations revealed four counts of suicide , but relatives of the dead claimed the soldiers fell prey to a culture of fear and violence , and have called for a public inquiry .
despite a police report investigating abuse at deepcut , which besides the four fatalities , uncovered a further 173 allegations of rape , racism , and beatings , armed services minister adam ingram has so far ruled out the idea of commissioning an independent inquiry .
calling for help this reluctance to allow an independent body to poke about in the armed forces has come as no surprise to malcolm thorn , who is trying to convince the mod to officially recognize his organization called " forces helpline . "
thorn set up his helpline in response to what he recognized as a need among soldiers to seek confidential advice on bullying , and he 's been overwhelmed at the response .
" i 've had thousands of people contacting me , not only from the uk , but also from germany , holland and even new zealand , " thorn told dw-world .
the willingness on the part of soldiers to speak out about incidents of military mobbing seems to be growing . just last week , soldiers in the austrian army shocked the public with their revelations of torture during training sessions intended to prepare them for hostage situations .
that the training got way out of hand was documented on a video tape showing extreme tactics resembling those reported at the us-controlled abu ghraib prison in iraq , where the recruits were stripped , hooded and dragged across the ground .
more than toughening up recruits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a britischer soldier at a uk army infantry training school although the recent incidents of torture in austria , germany and britain have hit the headlines owing to their shock value , thorn said the usual range of allegations , which are largely lodged by young recruits , reflect his own experiences of military mobbing .
" i joined the army when i was 18 .
i was a bit of a wimp and i wanted to be toughened up , but i got beaten to a pulp , " thorn said .
while he confirmed that physical horrors , such as hanging recruits out of the window by their boot laces or bathing them in freezing cold water mixed with human excrement are practices which still go on in the army , he said that mental mobbing has just the same power to break a man .
the power of words it 's a view shared by sven knüppel , who , now a reservist lieutenant in the bundeswehr , has two decades of experience in the ranks of the german armed forces .
" a soldier might be able to withstand serious physical exertion , but if he is constantly subjected to verbal degradation , no matter how small , that can take its toll , " knüppel told dw-world .
bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr has slipped into an uncomfortable limelight that said , he does n't believe there is a strong culture of bullying in the german military .
" the british army has a very different structure to the bundeswehr , in that its tradition has not been broken for many , many years .
after 1945 , the german forces were rebuilt in a completely different way .
yet that is not to say that these things do n't happen , because there are always some crazy people who let their personal style flow back down through the ranks , " knüppel said .
but do the armed forces have a disproportionate number of bullies ?
patrick tissington , a psychologist who has researched the phenomenon , told dw-world he did n't think the army particularly attracts bullies .
" but because of the physical nature of the work , the effects of military mobbing tend to be more dramatic , " he said .
" and what is also very different , is that there is no way to go home . "
a widespread phenomenon although there is nothing remotely new about bullying , it is now more squarely in the mainframe of the collective consciousness than ever before and is recognized as a problem which not everyone can forget about even once they leave the school yard .
bullying is certainly not just limited to the barracks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hospitals are a hotbed of mobbing activity official statistics from a " mobbing report " commissioned by germany 's federal institute for occupational safety and health documented that one in nine germans will be mobbed at the office at least once during their working life .
the highest number of cases are in hospitals , closely followed by employees in social professions such as caregivers for the elderly , public servants and employees of the church .
" this is the human condition .
there is a capability of this kind of thing in all of us .
we tend to follow with the crowd , and if the crowd is n't stopped from bullying , it just continues .
of course it 's about power , about picking on the weak , but it 's also about a desire to be in control of our environment .
what are needed are good leaders , who deal with the problems early on , " tissington said . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de british army faces own abuse scandal as germany investigates allegations of abuse in its armed forces , in britain , a similar scandal is unfolding .

recent reports of mobbing - bullying - in the german army , the bundeswehr , have caused the nation to look at the phenomenon more closely .
but it is by no means a purely german occurrence . while the german government attempts to get to the bottom of allegations that training officers carried out staged hostage-takings on a number of young army recruits at a camp in western germany and overstepped the boundary to abuse , the british ministry of defense -lrb- mod -rrb- is trying to fight off the latest mobbing claims levelled at its own army .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how violent is the truth ?
at the center of those allegations are the deaths of four young recruits who trained at the deepcut military barracks between 1995 and 2001 .
internal investigations revealed four counts of suicide , but relatives of the dead claimed the soldiers fell prey to a culture of fear and violence , and have called for a public inquiry .
despite a police report investigating abuse at deepcut , which besides the four fatalities , uncovered a further 173 allegations of rape , racism , and beatings , armed services minister adam ingram has so far ruled out the idea of commissioning an independent inquiry .
calling for help this reluctance to allow an independent body to poke about in the armed forces has come as no surprise to malcolm thorn , who is trying to convince the mod to officially recognize his organization called " forces helpline . "
thorn set up his helpline in response to what he recognized as a need among soldiers to seek confidential advice on bullying , and he 's been overwhelmed at the response .
" i 've had thousands of people contacting me , not only from the uk , but also from germany , holland and even new zealand , " thorn told dw-world .
the willingness on the part of soldiers to speak out about incidents of military mobbing seems to be growing . just last week , soldiers in the austrian army shocked the public with their revelations of torture during training sessions intended to prepare them for hostage situations .
that the training got way out of hand was documented on a video tape showing extreme tactics resembling those reported at the us-controlled abu ghraib prison in iraq , where the recruits were stripped , hooded and dragged across the ground .
more than toughening up recruits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a britischer soldier at a uk army infantry training school although the recent incidents of torture in austria , germany and britain have hit the headlines owing to their shock value , thorn said the usual range of allegations , which are largely lodged by young recruits , reflect his own experiences of military mobbing .
" i joined the army when i was 18 .
i was a bit of a wimp and i wanted to be toughened up , but i got beaten to a pulp , " thorn said .
while he confirmed that physical horrors , such as hanging recruits out of the window by their boot laces or bathing them in freezing cold water mixed with human excrement are practices which still go on in the army , he said that mental mobbing has just the same power to break a man .
the power of words it 's a view shared by sven knüppel , who , now a reservist lieutenant in the bundeswehr , has two decades of experience in the ranks of the german armed forces .
" a soldier might be able to withstand serious physical exertion , but if he is constantly subjected to verbal degradation , no matter how small , that can take its toll , " knüppel told dw-world .
bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr has slipped into an uncomfortable limelight that said , he does n't believe there is a strong culture of bullying in the german military .
" the british army has a very different structure to the bundeswehr , in that its tradition has not been broken for many , many years .
after 1945 , the german forces were rebuilt in a completely different way .
yet that is not to say that these things do n't happen , because there are always some crazy people who let their personal style flow back down through the ranks , " knüppel said .
but do the armed forces have a disproportionate number of bullies ?
patrick tissington , a psychologist who has researched the phenomenon , told dw-world he did n't think the army particularly attracts bullies .
" but because of the physical nature of the work , the effects of military mobbing tend to be more dramatic , " he said .
" and what is also very different , is that there is no way to go home . "
a widespread phenomenon although there is nothing remotely new about bullying , it is now more squarely in the mainframe of the collective consciousness than ever before and is recognized as a problem which not everyone can forget about even once they leave the school yard .
bullying is certainly not just limited to the barracks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hospitals are a hotbed of mobbing activity official statistics from a " mobbing report " commissioned by germany 's federal institute for occupational safety and health documented that one in nine germans will be mobbed at the office at least once during their working life .
the highest number of cases are in hospitals , closely followed by employees in social professions such as caregivers for the elderly , public servants and employees of the church .
" this is the human condition .
there is a capability of this kind of thing in all of us .
we tend to follow with the crowd , and if the crowd is n't stopped from bullying , it just continues .

recent reports of mobbing - bullying - in the german army , the bundeswehr , have caused the nation to look at the phenomenon more closely .
but it is by no means a purely german occurrence . while the german government attempts to get to the bottom of allegations that training officers carried out staged hostage-takings on a number of young army recruits at a camp in western germany and overstepped the boundary to abuse , the british ministry of defense -lrb- mod -rrb- is trying to fight off the latest mobbing claims levelled at its own army .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how violent is the truth ?
at the center of those allegations are the deaths of four young recruits who trained at the deepcut military barracks between 1995 and 2001 .
internal investigations revealed four counts of suicide , but relatives of the dead claimed the soldiers fell prey to a culture of fear and violence , and have called for a public inquiry .
despite a police report investigating abuse at deepcut , which besides the four fatalities , uncovered a further 173 allegations of rape , racism , and beatings , armed services minister adam ingram has so far ruled out the idea of commissioning an independent inquiry .
calling for help this reluctance to allow an independent body to poke about in the armed forces has come as no surprise to malcolm thorn , who is trying to convince the mod to officially recognize his organization called " forces helpline . "
thorn set up his helpline in response to what he recognized as a need among soldiers to seek confidential advice on bullying , and he 's been overwhelmed at the response .
" i 've had thousands of people contacting me , not only from the uk , but also from germany , holland and even new zealand , " thorn told dw-world .
the willingness on the part of soldiers to speak out about incidents of military mobbing seems to be growing . just last week , soldiers in the austrian army shocked the public with their revelations of torture during training sessions intended to prepare them for hostage situations .
that the training got way out of hand was documented on a video tape showing extreme tactics resembling those reported at the us-controlled abu ghraib prison in iraq , where the recruits were stripped , hooded and dragged across the ground .
more than toughening up recruits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a britischer soldier at a uk army infantry training school although the recent incidents of torture in austria , germany and britain have hit the headlines owing to their shock value , thorn said the usual range of allegations , which are largely lodged by young recruits , reflect his own experiences of military mobbing .
" i joined the army when i was 18 .
i was a bit of a wimp and i wanted to be toughened up , but i got beaten to a pulp , " thorn said .
while he confirmed that physical horrors , such as hanging recruits out of the window by their boot laces or bathing them in freezing cold water mixed with human excrement are practices which still go on in the army , he said that mental mobbing has just the same power to break a man .
the power of words it 's a view shared by sven knüppel , who , now a reservist lieutenant in the bundeswehr , has two decades of experience in the ranks of the german armed forces .
" a soldier might be able to withstand serious physical exertion , but if he is constantly subjected to verbal degradation , no matter how small , that can take its toll , " knüppel told dw-world .
bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr has slipped into an uncomfortable limelight that said , he does n't believe there is a strong culture of bullying in the german military .
" the british army has a very different structure to the bundeswehr , in that its tradition has not been broken for many , many years .
after 1945 , the german forces were rebuilt in a completely different way .
yet that is not to say that these things do n't happen , because there are always some crazy people who let their personal style flow back down through the ranks , " knüppel said .
but do the armed forces have a disproportionate number of bullies ?
patrick tissington , a psychologist who has researched the phenomenon , told dw-world he did n't think the army particularly attracts bullies .
" but because of the physical nature of the work , the effects of military mobbing tend to be more dramatic , " he said .
" and what is also very different , is that there is no way to go home . "
a widespread phenomenon although there is nothing remotely new about bullying , it is now more squarely in the mainframe of the collective consciousness than ever before and is recognized as a problem which not everyone can forget about even once they leave the school yard .
bullying is certainly not just limited to the barracks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hospitals are a hotbed of mobbing activity official statistics from a " mobbing report " commissioned by germany 's federal institute for occupational safety and health documented that one in nine germans will be mobbed at the office at least once during their working life .
the highest number of cases are in hospitals , closely followed by employees in social professions such as caregivers for the elderly , public servants and employees of the church .
" this is the human condition .
there is a capability of this kind of thing in all of us .
we tend to follow with the crowd , and if the crowd is n't stopped from bullying , it just continues .
of course it 's about power , about picking on the weak , but it 's also about a desire to be in control of our environment .

recent reports of mobbing - bullying - in the german army , the bundeswehr , have caused the nation to look at the phenomenon more closely .
but it is by no means a purely german occurrence . while the german government attempts to get to the bottom of allegations that training officers carried out staged hostage-takings on a number of young army recruits at a camp in western germany and overstepped the boundary to abuse , the british ministry of defense -lrb- mod -rrb- is trying to fight off the latest mobbing claims levelled at its own army .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how violent is the truth ?
at the center of those allegations are the deaths of four young recruits who trained at the deepcut military barracks between 1995 and 2001 .
internal investigations revealed four counts of suicide , but relatives of the dead claimed the soldiers fell prey to a culture of fear and violence , and have called for a public inquiry .
despite a police report investigating abuse at deepcut , which besides the four fatalities , uncovered a further 173 allegations of rape , racism , and beatings , armed services minister adam ingram has so far ruled out the idea of commissioning an independent inquiry .
calling for help this reluctance to allow an independent body to poke about in the armed forces has come as no surprise to malcolm thorn , who is trying to convince the mod to officially recognize his organization called " forces helpline . "
thorn set up his helpline in response to what he recognized as a need among soldiers to seek confidential advice on bullying , and he 's been overwhelmed at the response .
" i 've had thousands of people contacting me , not only from the uk , but also from germany , holland and even new zealand , " thorn told dw-world .
the willingness on the part of soldiers to speak out about incidents of military mobbing seems to be growing . just last week , soldiers in the austrian army shocked the public with their revelations of torture during training sessions intended to prepare them for hostage situations .
that the training got way out of hand was documented on a video tape showing extreme tactics resembling those reported at the us-controlled abu ghraib prison in iraq , where the recruits were stripped , hooded and dragged across the ground .
more than toughening up recruits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a britischer soldier at a uk army infantry training school although the recent incidents of torture in austria , germany and britain have hit the headlines owing to their shock value , thorn said the usual range of allegations , which are largely lodged by young recruits , reflect his own experiences of military mobbing .
" i joined the army when i was 18 .
i was a bit of a wimp and i wanted to be toughened up , but i got beaten to a pulp , " thorn said .
while he confirmed that physical horrors , such as hanging recruits out of the window by their boot laces or bathing them in freezing cold water mixed with human excrement are practices which still go on in the army , he said that mental mobbing has just the same power to break a man .
the power of words it 's a view shared by sven knüppel , who , now a reservist lieutenant in the bundeswehr , has two decades of experience in the ranks of the german armed forces .
" a soldier might be able to withstand serious physical exertion , but if he is constantly subjected to verbal degradation , no matter how small , that can take its toll , " knüppel told dw-world .
bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr has slipped into an uncomfortable limelight that said , he does n't believe there is a strong culture of bullying in the german military .
" the british army has a very different structure to the bundeswehr , in that its tradition has not been broken for many , many years .

yet that is not to say that these things do n't happen , because there are always some crazy people who let their personal style flow back down through the ranks , " knüppel said .
but do the armed forces have a disproportionate number of bullies ?
patrick tissington , a psychologist who has researched the phenomenon , told dw-world he did n't think the army particularly attracts bullies .

a widespread phenomenon although there is nothing remotely new about bullying , it is now more squarely in the mainframe of the collective consciousness than ever before and is recognized as a problem which not everyone can forget about even once they leave the school yard .
bullying is certainly not just limited to the barracks .

however , eu leaders held out the prospect of ending the ban perhaps next year , despite opposition from the us . the subject of lifting the fifteen-year old eu arms embargo imposed on china in the wake of the bloody crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in tiananmen square took center stage at the 7th annual eu-china summit in the netherlands on wednesday . though eu officials did not name a specific date - delaying an ultimate decision - they did pledge to continue working towards lifting the ban .
in short , they gave a positive signal , but made no promises . " the eu side confirmed its political will to continue to work towards lifting the embargo , " a joint eu-china statement issued at the summit in the hague said . eu representatives in attendance included the dutch foreign minister bernard bot , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , and jose manuel barroso , president of the european commission .
beijing representatives included china 's prime minister wen jiabao and li zhaoxing , the foreign minister . wait and see attitude en route to a meeting with premier jiabao , bot told reporters , " we are working assiduously but … the time is not right to lift the embargo . " european countries , led by britain and sweden , are looking for china to demonstrate progress on human rights and provide assurances that a massive weapons build-up , which could destabilize the entire region , is not planned . premier jiabao denied his country was planning such a build-up .
" lifting the embargo does not mean china would start buying lots of arms in the eu , " he told reporters at a press conference .
" the embargo means getting rid of political discrimination against china . " " remnant of the cold war " china has pushed hard in its dealings with the eu to end the embargo , which it considers a relic of the cold war . with a massive , increasingly affluent domestic market which european businesses are eager to exploit , chinese officials have been able to exercise more leverage with european leaders .
the eu has become china 's largest trading partner , but an eu trade deficit of € 64.2 -lrb- $ 86.34 -rrb- billion still remains . u.s. and rights groups critical human rights groups and the united states , however , are fiercely opposed to the eu lifting the weapons ban .

however , eu leaders held out the prospect of ending the ban perhaps next year , despite opposition from the us . the subject of lifting the fifteen-year old eu arms embargo imposed on china in the wake of the bloody crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in tiananmen square took center stage at the 7th annual eu-china summit in the netherlands on wednesday . though eu officials did not name a specific date - delaying an ultimate decision - they did pledge to continue working towards lifting the ban .
in short , they gave a positive signal , but made no promises . " the eu side confirmed its political will to continue to work towards lifting the embargo , " a joint eu-china statement issued at the summit in the hague said . eu representatives in attendance included the dutch foreign minister bernard bot , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , and jose manuel barroso , president of the european commission .
beijing representatives included china 's prime minister wen jiabao and li zhaoxing , the foreign minister . wait and see attitude en route to a meeting with premier jiabao , bot told reporters , " we are working assiduously but … the time is not right to lift the embargo . " european countries , led by britain and sweden , are looking for china to demonstrate progress on human rights and provide assurances that a massive weapons build-up , which could destabilize the entire region , is not planned . premier jiabao denied his country was planning such a build-up .
" lifting the embargo does not mean china would start buying lots of arms in the eu , " he told reporters at a press conference .

recent reports of mobbing - bullying - in the german army , the bundeswehr , have caused the nation to look at the phenomenon more closely .
but it is by no means a purely german occurrence . while the german government attempts to get to the bottom of allegations that training officers carried out staged hostage-takings on a number of young army recruits at a camp in western germany and overstepped the boundary to abuse , the british ministry of defense -lrb- mod -rrb- is trying to fight off the latest mobbing claims levelled at its own army .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how violent is the truth ?
at the center of those allegations are the deaths of four young recruits who trained at the deepcut military barracks between 1995 and 2001 .
internal investigations revealed four counts of suicide , but relatives of the dead claimed the soldiers fell prey to a culture of fear and violence , and have called for a public inquiry .
despite a police report investigating abuse at deepcut , which besides the four fatalities , uncovered a further 173 allegations of rape , racism , and beatings , armed services minister adam ingram has so far ruled out the idea of commissioning an independent inquiry .
calling for help this reluctance to allow an independent body to poke about in the armed forces has come as no surprise to malcolm thorn , who is trying to convince the mod to officially recognize his organization called " forces helpline . "
thorn set up his helpline in response to what he recognized as a need among soldiers to seek confidential advice on bullying , and he 's been overwhelmed at the response .
" i 've had thousands of people contacting me , not only from the uk , but also from germany , holland and even new zealand , " thorn told dw-world .
the willingness on the part of soldiers to speak out about incidents of military mobbing seems to be growing . just last week , soldiers in the austrian army shocked the public with their revelations of torture during training sessions intended to prepare them for hostage situations .
that the training got way out of hand was documented on a video tape showing extreme tactics resembling those reported at the us-controlled abu ghraib prison in iraq , where the recruits were stripped , hooded and dragged across the ground .
more than toughening up recruits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a britischer soldier at a uk army infantry training school although the recent incidents of torture in austria , germany and britain have hit the headlines owing to their shock value , thorn said the usual range of allegations , which are largely lodged by young recruits , reflect his own experiences of military mobbing .
" i joined the army when i was 18 .
i was a bit of a wimp and i wanted to be toughened up , but i got beaten to a pulp , " thorn said .
while he confirmed that physical horrors , such as hanging recruits out of the window by their boot laces or bathing them in freezing cold water mixed with human excrement are practices which still go on in the army , he said that mental mobbing has just the same power to break a man .
the power of words it 's a view shared by sven knüppel , who , now a reservist lieutenant in the bundeswehr , has two decades of experience in the ranks of the german armed forces .
" a soldier might be able to withstand serious physical exertion , but if he is constantly subjected to verbal degradation , no matter how small , that can take its toll , " knüppel told dw-world .
bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr has slipped into an uncomfortable limelight that said , he does n't believe there is a strong culture of bullying in the german military .
" the british army has a very different structure to the bundeswehr , in that its tradition has not been broken for many , many years .
after 1945 , the german forces were rebuilt in a completely different way .
yet that is not to say that these things do n't happen , because there are always some crazy people who let their personal style flow back down through the ranks , " knüppel said .
but do the armed forces have a disproportionate number of bullies ?
patrick tissington , a psychologist who has researched the phenomenon , told dw-world he did n't think the army particularly attracts bullies .
" but because of the physical nature of the work , the effects of military mobbing tend to be more dramatic , " he said .
" and what is also very different , is that there is no way to go home . "
a widespread phenomenon although there is nothing remotely new about bullying , it is now more squarely in the mainframe of the collective consciousness than ever before and is recognized as a problem which not everyone can forget about even once they leave the school yard .
bullying is certainly not just limited to the barracks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hospitals are a hotbed of mobbing activity official statistics from a " mobbing report " commissioned by germany 's federal institute for occupational safety and health documented that one in nine germans will be mobbed at the office at least once during their working life .
the highest number of cases are in hospitals , closely followed by employees in social professions such as caregivers for the elderly , public servants and employees of the church .
" this is the human condition .
there is a capability of this kind of thing in all of us .
we tend to follow with the crowd , and if the crowd is n't stopped from bullying , it just continues .
of course it 's about power , about picking on the weak , but it 's also about a desire to be in control of our environment .
what are needed are good leaders , who deal with the problems early on , " tissington said . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de british army faces own abuse scandal as germany investigates allegations of abuse in its armed forces , in britain , a similar scandal is unfolding .

despite a police report investigating abuse at deepcut , which besides the four fatalities , uncovered a further 173 allegations of rape , racism , and beatings , armed services minister adam ingram has so far ruled out the idea of commissioning an independent inquiry .
calling for help this reluctance to allow an independent body to poke about in the armed forces has come as no surprise to malcolm thorn , who is trying to convince the mod to officially recognize his organization called " forces helpline . "
thorn set up his helpline in response to what he recognized as a need among soldiers to seek confidential advice on bullying , and he 's been overwhelmed at the response .
" i 've had thousands of people contacting me , not only from the uk , but also from germany , holland and even new zealand , " thorn told dw-world .
the willingness on the part of soldiers to speak out about incidents of military mobbing seems to be growing . just last week , soldiers in the austrian army shocked the public with their revelations of torture during training sessions intended to prepare them for hostage situations .
that the training got way out of hand was documented on a video tape showing extreme tactics resembling those reported at the us-controlled abu ghraib prison in iraq , where the recruits were stripped , hooded and dragged across the ground .
more than toughening up recruits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a britischer soldier at a uk army infantry training school although the recent incidents of torture in austria , germany and britain have hit the headlines owing to their shock value , thorn said the usual range of allegations , which are largely lodged by young recruits , reflect his own experiences of military mobbing .
" i joined the army when i was 18 .
i was a bit of a wimp and i wanted to be toughened up , but i got beaten to a pulp , " thorn said .
while he confirmed that physical horrors , such as hanging recruits out of the window by their boot laces or bathing them in freezing cold water mixed with human excrement are practices which still go on in the army , he said that mental mobbing has just the same power to break a man .
the power of words it 's a view shared by sven knüppel , who , now a reservist lieutenant in the bundeswehr , has two decades of experience in the ranks of the german armed forces .
" a soldier might be able to withstand serious physical exertion , but if he is constantly subjected to verbal degradation , no matter how small , that can take its toll , " knüppel told dw-world .
bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr has slipped into an uncomfortable limelight that said , he does n't believe there is a strong culture of bullying in the german military .
" the british army has a very different structure to the bundeswehr , in that its tradition has not been broken for many , many years .
after 1945 , the german forces were rebuilt in a completely different way .
yet that is not to say that these things do n't happen , because there are always some crazy people who let their personal style flow back down through the ranks , " knüppel said .
but do the armed forces have a disproportionate number of bullies ?
patrick tissington , a psychologist who has researched the phenomenon , told dw-world he did n't think the army particularly attracts bullies .
" but because of the physical nature of the work , the effects of military mobbing tend to be more dramatic , " he said .
" and what is also very different , is that there is no way to go home . "
a widespread phenomenon although there is nothing remotely new about bullying , it is now more squarely in the mainframe of the collective consciousness than ever before and is recognized as a problem which not everyone can forget about even once they leave the school yard .
bullying is certainly not just limited to the barracks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hospitals are a hotbed of mobbing activity official statistics from a " mobbing report " commissioned by germany 's federal institute for occupational safety and health documented that one in nine germans will be mobbed at the office at least once during their working life .
the highest number of cases are in hospitals , closely followed by employees in social professions such as caregivers for the elderly , public servants and employees of the church .
" this is the human condition .
there is a capability of this kind of thing in all of us .
we tend to follow with the crowd , and if the crowd is n't stopped from bullying , it just continues .
of course it 's about power , about picking on the weak , but it 's also about a desire to be in control of our environment .
what are needed are good leaders , who deal with the problems early on , " tissington said . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de british army faces own abuse scandal as germany investigates allegations of abuse in its armed forces , in britain , a similar scandal is unfolding .

one berlin-based orchestra may have found a unique way to survive . cultural institutions around germany are struggling with the country 's new economic realities .
with stagnant growth and high unemployment , many of the country 's most esteemed opera houses , museums and orchestras are being forced to tighten their belts . smaller groups in berlin , a city classified as broke by even optimists , have been particularly hard hit .
now , following the berlin senate 's decision this past summer to cut subsidies , the berliner symphoniker , the smallest of the city 's eight official orchestras , is looking to start anew - as germany 's first private orchestra . in doing so , the director is hoping to return to solvency and set an example for germany 's other struggling cultural institutions . " we 're gonna make it on our own " this past summer , the berlin senate , hard pressed to plug holes in the city 's hemorrhaging budget , voted to cut the symphoniker 's € 3 million -lrb- $ 4 million -rrb- in subsidies .
it did n't take long for the 55-strong orchestra to hit the skids , and by september it officially declared insolvency . this week , the orchestra 's director , andreas moritz , and the lawyer overseeing the bankruptcy proceedings , christian köhler-ma , announced plans to make a comeback as germany 's first independent orchestra . in additional to the traditional cost-cutting measures - lower wages , longer hours - at the heart of the turnaround is an aggressive marketing campaign aimed at rebranding the orchestra as young , hip and unconventional . challenging the image of an orchestra bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another poster from the fundraising campaign in its new life as a private orchestra , the berliner symphoniker will challenge traditional notions and look to broaden its profit-oriented horizons .

" ideally , we could plan concerts with robin gibb , metallica , nena or the scorpions , " he told the weekly newsmagazine der spiegel . in addition , the orchestra has hired a flashy marketing company to make sure everyone knows about the " new " symphoniker . moritz , the director , hopes his orchestra 's success as a private enterprise will serve as an example to other cultural institutions struggling with the new economic realities .
" this is a huge chance for us to set an example , and we are convinced we can survive as a private orchestra , " he told the daily die tageszeitung . the first challenge already looms : moritz and company still need to come up with the € 300,000 transitional funds needed to take the first step forward .

to ensure they 'll last that long , iraqi trainees are also given talks on technical expertise , relayed via interpreters .
another contingent of iraqi soldiers is receiving mechanical training to enable them to carry out tank maintenance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trainee program peter struck -lrb- photo -rrb- will be visiting is part of nato 's iraqi aid package .
the speed with which germany began implementing the plan agreed in june is due first and foremost to berlin 's good ties with the united arab emirates , where german detectives have already been training iraqi police for the last several months . in both training programs , the two countries are sharing responsibilities - with the united arab emirates providing military barracks and training grounds , organizing and funding the transport of iraqi soldiers to abu dhabi and shipping trucks to iraq . keeping germans out of iraq as far as berlin is concerned , the collaboration has one major advantage : german soldiers wo n't actually be deployed on iraqi soil , but are nonetheless providing valuable aid .
the german government has refused to deploy bundeswehr soldiers in nato units in the war-torn country , which means its training services are a welcome compromise . in return , iraqi troops are happy to take advantage of training programs in safe conditions , unlike their colleagues in iraq who repeatedly find themselves the target of insurgent attacks .
in fact , even abu dhabi is not entirely secure - which is why participating soldiers remain anonymous and filming on the grounds is prohibited . extending aid ? the first training programs in the united arab emirates are set to wrap up by christmas .
further military training projects are in the pipeline , with the iraqi army expressing interest in bundeswehr expertise in weapons clearance as well as engineering . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : during iraqi prime minister ayad allawi 's -lrb- photo -rrb- recent visit to berlin , chancellor gerhard schröder again offered the services of german troops in training iraqi soldiers in weapons ' clearance .

following the news that greece intentionally and repeatedly doctored budget data submitted to brussels , the european union has now been confronted with revelations that italy has done the same thing . italian opera fans might wave a dismissing hand over the accusations from brussels and say " cosi fan tutte – that ’ s what everybody does , " but finance minister domenico siniscalco found himself hard pressed at an eu meeting in brussels on tuesday over a european commission study that appears to cast serious doubt on his government 's budget data . after closely reviewing italy ’ s finances , eu economic affairs commissioner joaquin almunia expressed alarm over the unreliability of italy 's deficit figures and called for urgent clarification of the country ’ s finances .
meeting with siniscalo , the brussels budget chief said he was concerned with rome ’ s ability to cut taxes and introduce deficit reduction plans . according to official figures from the italian government , annual public deficits since 1997 have never exceeded the eu limit of three percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- – a stipulation of the euro zone ’ s stability and growth pact .
but a regular commission review of the figures has shown that given italy 's snail-like progress in reducing its national debt , the deficit figures should actually be higher . figures don ’ t compare the commission 's report focuses on so-called " stock-flow adjustments " that compare the debt and deficit levels .

more leisure time came in second place , with 26 percent preferring to loaf around more .
only a paltry 6 percent of respondents said more sex in 2005 would trump either money or time . according to the survey , it is those in their forties who seem to have largely replaced their interest in sex and with a lust for legal tender - 67 percent of this group opted for more cash .

recent reports of mobbing - bullying - in the german army , the bundeswehr , have caused the nation to look at the phenomenon more closely .
but it is by no means a purely german occurrence . while the german government attempts to get to the bottom of allegations that training officers carried out staged hostage-takings on a number of young army recruits at a camp in western germany and overstepped the boundary to abuse , the british ministry of defense -lrb- mod -rrb- is trying to fight off the latest mobbing claims levelled at its own army .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how violent is the truth ?
at the center of those allegations are the deaths of four young recruits who trained at the deepcut military barracks between 1995 and 2001 .
internal investigations revealed four counts of suicide , but relatives of the dead claimed the soldiers fell prey to a culture of fear and violence , and have called for a public inquiry .
despite a police report investigating abuse at deepcut , which besides the four fatalities , uncovered a further 173 allegations of rape , racism , and beatings , armed services minister adam ingram has so far ruled out the idea of commissioning an independent inquiry .
calling for help this reluctance to allow an independent body to poke about in the armed forces has come as no surprise to malcolm thorn , who is trying to convince the mod to officially recognize his organization called " forces helpline . "
thorn set up his helpline in response to what he recognized as a need among soldiers to seek confidential advice on bullying , and he 's been overwhelmed at the response .
" i 've had thousands of people contacting me , not only from the uk , but also from germany , holland and even new zealand , " thorn told dw-world .
the willingness on the part of soldiers to speak out about incidents of military mobbing seems to be growing . just last week , soldiers in the austrian army shocked the public with their revelations of torture during training sessions intended to prepare them for hostage situations .
that the training got way out of hand was documented on a video tape showing extreme tactics resembling those reported at the us-controlled abu ghraib prison in iraq , where the recruits were stripped , hooded and dragged across the ground .
more than toughening up recruits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a britischer soldier at a uk army infantry training school although the recent incidents of torture in austria , germany and britain have hit the headlines owing to their shock value , thorn said the usual range of allegations , which are largely lodged by young recruits , reflect his own experiences of military mobbing .
" i joined the army when i was 18 .
i was a bit of a wimp and i wanted to be toughened up , but i got beaten to a pulp , " thorn said .
while he confirmed that physical horrors , such as hanging recruits out of the window by their boot laces or bathing them in freezing cold water mixed with human excrement are practices which still go on in the army , he said that mental mobbing has just the same power to break a man .
the power of words it 's a view shared by sven knüppel , who , now a reservist lieutenant in the bundeswehr , has two decades of experience in the ranks of the german armed forces .
" a soldier might be able to withstand serious physical exertion , but if he is constantly subjected to verbal degradation , no matter how small , that can take its toll , " knüppel told dw-world .
bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr has slipped into an uncomfortable limelight that said , he does n't believe there is a strong culture of bullying in the german military .
" the british army has a very different structure to the bundeswehr , in that its tradition has not been broken for many , many years .
after 1945 , the german forces were rebuilt in a completely different way .
yet that is not to say that these things do n't happen , because there are always some crazy people who let their personal style flow back down through the ranks , " knüppel said .
but do the armed forces have a disproportionate number of bullies ?
patrick tissington , a psychologist who has researched the phenomenon , told dw-world he did n't think the army particularly attracts bullies .
" but because of the physical nature of the work , the effects of military mobbing tend to be more dramatic , " he said .
" and what is also very different , is that there is no way to go home . "
a widespread phenomenon although there is nothing remotely new about bullying , it is now more squarely in the mainframe of the collective consciousness than ever before and is recognized as a problem which not everyone can forget about even once they leave the school yard .
bullying is certainly not just limited to the barracks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hospitals are a hotbed of mobbing activity official statistics from a " mobbing report " commissioned by germany 's federal institute for occupational safety and health documented that one in nine germans will be mobbed at the office at least once during their working life .
the highest number of cases are in hospitals , closely followed by employees in social professions such as caregivers for the elderly , public servants and employees of the church .
" this is the human condition .

we tend to follow with the crowd , and if the crowd is n't stopped from bullying , it just continues .

internal investigations revealed four counts of suicide , but relatives of the dead claimed the soldiers fell prey to a culture of fear and violence , and have called for a public inquiry .
despite a police report investigating abuse at deepcut , which besides the four fatalities , uncovered a further 173 allegations of rape , racism , and beatings , armed services minister adam ingram has so far ruled out the idea of commissioning an independent inquiry .
calling for help this reluctance to allow an independent body to poke about in the armed forces has come as no surprise to malcolm thorn , who is trying to convince the mod to officially recognize his organization called " forces helpline . "
thorn set up his helpline in response to what he recognized as a need among soldiers to seek confidential advice on bullying , and he 's been overwhelmed at the response .
" i 've had thousands of people contacting me , not only from the uk , but also from germany , holland and even new zealand , " thorn told dw-world .
the willingness on the part of soldiers to speak out about incidents of military mobbing seems to be growing . just last week , soldiers in the austrian army shocked the public with their revelations of torture during training sessions intended to prepare them for hostage situations .
that the training got way out of hand was documented on a video tape showing extreme tactics resembling those reported at the us-controlled abu ghraib prison in iraq , where the recruits were stripped , hooded and dragged across the ground .
more than toughening up recruits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a britischer soldier at a uk army infantry training school although the recent incidents of torture in austria , germany and britain have hit the headlines owing to their shock value , thorn said the usual range of allegations , which are largely lodged by young recruits , reflect his own experiences of military mobbing .
" i joined the army when i was 18 .
i was a bit of a wimp and i wanted to be toughened up , but i got beaten to a pulp , " thorn said .
while he confirmed that physical horrors , such as hanging recruits out of the window by their boot laces or bathing them in freezing cold water mixed with human excrement are practices which still go on in the army , he said that mental mobbing has just the same power to break a man .
the power of words it 's a view shared by sven knüppel , who , now a reservist lieutenant in the bundeswehr , has two decades of experience in the ranks of the german armed forces .
" a soldier might be able to withstand serious physical exertion , but if he is constantly subjected to verbal degradation , no matter how small , that can take its toll , " knüppel told dw-world .
bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr has slipped into an uncomfortable limelight that said , he does n't believe there is a strong culture of bullying in the german military .
" the british army has a very different structure to the bundeswehr , in that its tradition has not been broken for many , many years .
after 1945 , the german forces were rebuilt in a completely different way .
yet that is not to say that these things do n't happen , because there are always some crazy people who let their personal style flow back down through the ranks , " knüppel said .
but do the armed forces have a disproportionate number of bullies ?
patrick tissington , a psychologist who has researched the phenomenon , told dw-world he did n't think the army particularly attracts bullies .
" but because of the physical nature of the work , the effects of military mobbing tend to be more dramatic , " he said .
" and what is also very different , is that there is no way to go home . "
a widespread phenomenon although there is nothing remotely new about bullying , it is now more squarely in the mainframe of the collective consciousness than ever before and is recognized as a problem which not everyone can forget about even once they leave the school yard .
bullying is certainly not just limited to the barracks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hospitals are a hotbed of mobbing activity official statistics from a " mobbing report " commissioned by germany 's federal institute for occupational safety and health documented that one in nine germans will be mobbed at the office at least once during their working life .
the highest number of cases are in hospitals , closely followed by employees in social professions such as caregivers for the elderly , public servants and employees of the church .
" this is the human condition .
there is a capability of this kind of thing in all of us .
we tend to follow with the crowd , and if the crowd is n't stopped from bullying , it just continues .
of course it 's about power , about picking on the weak , but it 's also about a desire to be in control of our environment .
what are needed are good leaders , who deal with the problems early on , " tissington said . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de british army faces own abuse scandal as germany investigates allegations of abuse in its armed forces , in britain , a similar scandal is unfolding .

following the news that greece intentionally and repeatedly doctored budget data submitted to brussels , the european union has now been confronted with revelations that italy has done the same thing . italian opera fans might wave a dismissing hand over the accusations from brussels and say " cosi fan tutte – that ’ s what everybody does , " but finance minister domenico siniscalco found himself hard pressed at an eu meeting in brussels on tuesday over a european commission study that appears to cast serious doubt on his government 's budget data . after closely reviewing italy ’ s finances , eu economic affairs commissioner joaquin almunia expressed alarm over the unreliability of italy 's deficit figures and called for urgent clarification of the country ’ s finances .
meeting with siniscalo , the brussels budget chief said he was concerned with rome ’ s ability to cut taxes and introduce deficit reduction plans . according to official figures from the italian government , annual public deficits since 1997 have never exceeded the eu limit of three percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- – a stipulation of the euro zone ’ s stability and growth pact .
but a regular commission review of the figures has shown that given italy 's snail-like progress in reducing its national debt , the deficit figures should actually be higher . figures don ’ t compare the commission 's report focuses on so-called " stock-flow adjustments " that compare the debt and deficit levels .
over time , these should compensate for each other .
but in italy 's case , the calculations have persistently fallen below the amount of cash the government actually borrowed to finance the deficits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's figures do n't add up , according to the eu commission .
the commission found that every year since 1997 , italy had borrowed more than the eu deficit ceiling , with figures reaching 4.3 percent of gdp in 2001 and 4.1 percent in 2003 , compared to rome 's official forecast of 2.9 percent this year . the commission has also been trying to work out why italy 's public debt , second only to greece 's at 106 percent of gdp and well in excess of the eu ceiling of 60 percent , has been falling more slowly than expected . an eu-wide phenomena ? concern over italy 's budget data comes a week after the commission launched legal action against greece for drastically underreporting its public deficit .
had the correct figures been known at the time , athens would not have been allowed to join the euro zone in 2001 . following the greek case , the revelations about italy have heightened concern about the ability of eu institutions to monitor its member states . german finance minister hans eichel has called for clarification of italy 's figures , but left open what consequences should be implemented if intentional misrepresentation is found .
berlin ’ s hesitancy may not be without self-interest considering that it too is one of the biggest culprits when it comes to failing to conform to eu budget guidelines .
germany , like france , has broken the three-percent stability pact ceiling for the past three years and is risking a fourth infringement . gregg benzow -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european commission to loosen stability pact the european commission on friday unveiled a plan to introduce more flexibility in the stability and growth pact , saying it was vital to restore the credibility of its much-flouted budget discipline rules .

however , eu leaders held out the prospect of ending the ban perhaps next year , despite opposition from the us . the subject of lifting the fifteen-year old eu arms embargo imposed on china in the wake of the bloody crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in tiananmen square took center stage at the 7th annual eu-china summit in the netherlands on wednesday . though eu officials did not name a specific date - delaying an ultimate decision - they did pledge to continue working towards lifting the ban .
in short , they gave a positive signal , but made no promises . " the eu side confirmed its political will to continue to work towards lifting the embargo , " a joint eu-china statement issued at the summit in the hague said . eu representatives in attendance included the dutch foreign minister bernard bot , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , and jose manuel barroso , president of the european commission .
beijing representatives included china 's prime minister wen jiabao and li zhaoxing , the foreign minister . wait and see attitude en route to a meeting with premier jiabao , bot told reporters , " we are working assiduously but … the time is not right to lift the embargo . " european countries , led by britain and sweden , are looking for china to demonstrate progress on human rights and provide assurances that a massive weapons build-up , which could destabilize the entire region , is not planned . premier jiabao denied his country was planning such a build-up .
" lifting the embargo does not mean china would start buying lots of arms in the eu , " he told reporters at a press conference .

however , eu leaders held out the prospect of ending the ban perhaps next year , despite opposition from the us . the subject of lifting the fifteen-year old eu arms embargo imposed on china in the wake of the bloody crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in tiananmen square took center stage at the 7th annual eu-china summit in the netherlands on wednesday . though eu officials did not name a specific date - delaying an ultimate decision - they did pledge to continue working towards lifting the ban .
in short , they gave a positive signal , but made no promises . " the eu side confirmed its political will to continue to work towards lifting the embargo , " a joint eu-china statement issued at the summit in the hague said . eu representatives in attendance included the dutch foreign minister bernard bot , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , and jose manuel barroso , president of the european commission .
beijing representatives included china 's prime minister wen jiabao and li zhaoxing , the foreign minister . wait and see attitude en route to a meeting with premier jiabao , bot told reporters , " we are working assiduously but … the time is not right to lift the embargo . " european countries , led by britain and sweden , are looking for china to demonstrate progress on human rights and provide assurances that a massive weapons build-up , which could destabilize the entire region , is not planned . premier jiabao denied his country was planning such a build-up .
" lifting the embargo does not mean china would start buying lots of arms in the eu , " he told reporters at a press conference .

following the news that greece intentionally and repeatedly doctored budget data submitted to brussels , the european union has now been confronted with revelations that italy has done the same thing . italian opera fans might wave a dismissing hand over the accusations from brussels and say " cosi fan tutte – that ’ s what everybody does , " but finance minister domenico siniscalco found himself hard pressed at an eu meeting in brussels on tuesday over a european commission study that appears to cast serious doubt on his government 's budget data . after closely reviewing italy ’ s finances , eu economic affairs commissioner joaquin almunia expressed alarm over the unreliability of italy 's deficit figures and called for urgent clarification of the country ’ s finances .
meeting with siniscalo , the brussels budget chief said he was concerned with rome ’ s ability to cut taxes and introduce deficit reduction plans . according to official figures from the italian government , annual public deficits since 1997 have never exceeded the eu limit of three percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- – a stipulation of the euro zone ’ s stability and growth pact .
but a regular commission review of the figures has shown that given italy 's snail-like progress in reducing its national debt , the deficit figures should actually be higher . figures don ’ t compare the commission 's report focuses on so-called " stock-flow adjustments " that compare the debt and deficit levels .

but in italy 's case , the calculations have persistently fallen below the amount of cash the government actually borrowed to finance the deficits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's figures do n't add up , according to the eu commission .
the commission found that every year since 1997 , italy had borrowed more than the eu deficit ceiling , with figures reaching 4.3 percent of gdp in 2001 and 4.1 percent in 2003 , compared to rome 's official forecast of 2.9 percent this year . the commission has also been trying to work out why italy 's public debt , second only to greece 's at 106 percent of gdp and well in excess of the eu ceiling of 60 percent , has been falling more slowly than expected . an eu-wide phenomena ? concern over italy 's budget data comes a week after the commission launched legal action against greece for drastically underreporting its public deficit .
had the correct figures been known at the time , athens would not have been allowed to join the euro zone in 2001 . following the greek case , the revelations about italy have heightened concern about the ability of eu institutions to monitor its member states . german finance minister hans eichel has called for clarification of italy 's figures , but left open what consequences should be implemented if intentional misrepresentation is found .

recent reports of mobbing - bullying - in the german army , the bundeswehr , have caused the nation to look at the phenomenon more closely .
but it is by no means a purely german occurrence . while the german government attempts to get to the bottom of allegations that training officers carried out staged hostage-takings on a number of young army recruits at a camp in western germany and overstepped the boundary to abuse , the british ministry of defense -lrb- mod -rrb- is trying to fight off the latest mobbing claims levelled at its own army .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how violent is the truth ?
at the center of those allegations are the deaths of four young recruits who trained at the deepcut military barracks between 1995 and 2001 .
internal investigations revealed four counts of suicide , but relatives of the dead claimed the soldiers fell prey to a culture of fear and violence , and have called for a public inquiry .
despite a police report investigating abuse at deepcut , which besides the four fatalities , uncovered a further 173 allegations of rape , racism , and beatings , armed services minister adam ingram has so far ruled out the idea of commissioning an independent inquiry .
calling for help this reluctance to allow an independent body to poke about in the armed forces has come as no surprise to malcolm thorn , who is trying to convince the mod to officially recognize his organization called " forces helpline . "
thorn set up his helpline in response to what he recognized as a need among soldiers to seek confidential advice on bullying , and he 's been overwhelmed at the response .
" i 've had thousands of people contacting me , not only from the uk , but also from germany , holland and even new zealand , " thorn told dw-world .
the willingness on the part of soldiers to speak out about incidents of military mobbing seems to be growing . just last week , soldiers in the austrian army shocked the public with their revelations of torture during training sessions intended to prepare them for hostage situations .
that the training got way out of hand was documented on a video tape showing extreme tactics resembling those reported at the us-controlled abu ghraib prison in iraq , where the recruits were stripped , hooded and dragged across the ground .
more than toughening up recruits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a britischer soldier at a uk army infantry training school although the recent incidents of torture in austria , germany and britain have hit the headlines owing to their shock value , thorn said the usual range of allegations , which are largely lodged by young recruits , reflect his own experiences of military mobbing .
" i joined the army when i was 18 .
i was a bit of a wimp and i wanted to be toughened up , but i got beaten to a pulp , " thorn said .
while he confirmed that physical horrors , such as hanging recruits out of the window by their boot laces or bathing them in freezing cold water mixed with human excrement are practices which still go on in the army , he said that mental mobbing has just the same power to break a man .
the power of words it 's a view shared by sven knüppel , who , now a reservist lieutenant in the bundeswehr , has two decades of experience in the ranks of the german armed forces .
" a soldier might be able to withstand serious physical exertion , but if he is constantly subjected to verbal degradation , no matter how small , that can take its toll , " knüppel told dw-world .
bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr has slipped into an uncomfortable limelight that said , he does n't believe there is a strong culture of bullying in the german military .
" the british army has a very different structure to the bundeswehr , in that its tradition has not been broken for many , many years .
after 1945 , the german forces were rebuilt in a completely different way .
yet that is not to say that these things do n't happen , because there are always some crazy people who let their personal style flow back down through the ranks , " knüppel said .
but do the armed forces have a disproportionate number of bullies ?
patrick tissington , a psychologist who has researched the phenomenon , told dw-world he did n't think the army particularly attracts bullies .
" but because of the physical nature of the work , the effects of military mobbing tend to be more dramatic , " he said .
" and what is also very different , is that there is no way to go home . "
a widespread phenomenon although there is nothing remotely new about bullying , it is now more squarely in the mainframe of the collective consciousness than ever before and is recognized as a problem which not everyone can forget about even once they leave the school yard .
bullying is certainly not just limited to the barracks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hospitals are a hotbed of mobbing activity official statistics from a " mobbing report " commissioned by germany 's federal institute for occupational safety and health documented that one in nine germans will be mobbed at the office at least once during their working life .
the highest number of cases are in hospitals , closely followed by employees in social professions such as caregivers for the elderly , public servants and employees of the church .
" this is the human condition .
there is a capability of this kind of thing in all of us .
we tend to follow with the crowd , and if the crowd is n't stopped from bullying , it just continues .
of course it 's about power , about picking on the weak , but it 's also about a desire to be in control of our environment .

recent reports of mobbing - bullying - in the german army , the bundeswehr , have caused the nation to look at the phenomenon more closely .
but it is by no means a purely german occurrence . while the german government attempts to get to the bottom of allegations that training officers carried out staged hostage-takings on a number of young army recruits at a camp in western germany and overstepped the boundary to abuse , the british ministry of defense -lrb- mod -rrb- is trying to fight off the latest mobbing claims levelled at its own army .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how violent is the truth ?
at the center of those allegations are the deaths of four young recruits who trained at the deepcut military barracks between 1995 and 2001 .
internal investigations revealed four counts of suicide , but relatives of the dead claimed the soldiers fell prey to a culture of fear and violence , and have called for a public inquiry .
despite a police report investigating abuse at deepcut , which besides the four fatalities , uncovered a further 173 allegations of rape , racism , and beatings , armed services minister adam ingram has so far ruled out the idea of commissioning an independent inquiry .
calling for help this reluctance to allow an independent body to poke about in the armed forces has come as no surprise to malcolm thorn , who is trying to convince the mod to officially recognize his organization called " forces helpline . "
thorn set up his helpline in response to what he recognized as a need among soldiers to seek confidential advice on bullying , and he 's been overwhelmed at the response .
" i 've had thousands of people contacting me , not only from the uk , but also from germany , holland and even new zealand , " thorn told dw-world .

however , eu leaders held out the prospect of ending the ban perhaps next year , despite opposition from the us . the subject of lifting the fifteen-year old eu arms embargo imposed on china in the wake of the bloody crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in tiananmen square took center stage at the 7th annual eu-china summit in the netherlands on wednesday . though eu officials did not name a specific date - delaying an ultimate decision - they did pledge to continue working towards lifting the ban .
in short , they gave a positive signal , but made no promises . " the eu side confirmed its political will to continue to work towards lifting the embargo , " a joint eu-china statement issued at the summit in the hague said . eu representatives in attendance included the dutch foreign minister bernard bot , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , and jose manuel barroso , president of the european commission .
beijing representatives included china 's prime minister wen jiabao and li zhaoxing , the foreign minister . wait and see attitude en route to a meeting with premier jiabao , bot told reporters , " we are working assiduously but … the time is not right to lift the embargo .

groups like human rights watch have serious concerns over china 's commitment to improving its human rights record . the eu should not let " business interests trump its longstanding proclaimed commitment to human rights in china , " it warned in a statement released shortly before the start of the summit . us officials are worried that lifting the embargo would prompt china to go on a buying spree to accumulate weapons it can use to intimidate its neighbors , like taiwan . in an effort to appease both sides , the eu and china discussed a joint declaration on non-proliferation issues and the eu promised to set up a new code of conduct , should the embargo be lifted .

more leisure time came in second place , with 26 percent preferring to loaf around more .
only a paltry 6 percent of respondents said more sex in 2005 would trump either money or time . according to the survey , it is those in their forties who seem to have largely replaced their interest in sex and with a lust for legal tender - 67 percent of this group opted for more cash .
residents of the state of hesse also qualified as cold fish .
only 1 percent of them said sex beat out money . women also came off as less enthusiastic about sex than men .

in short , they gave a positive signal , but made no promises . " the eu side confirmed its political will to continue to work towards lifting the embargo , " a joint eu-china statement issued at the summit in the hague said . eu representatives in attendance included the dutch foreign minister bernard bot , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , and jose manuel barroso , president of the european commission .
beijing representatives included china 's prime minister wen jiabao and li zhaoxing , the foreign minister . wait and see attitude en route to a meeting with premier jiabao , bot told reporters , " we are working assiduously but … the time is not right to lift the embargo . " european countries , led by britain and sweden , are looking for china to demonstrate progress on human rights and provide assurances that a massive weapons build-up , which could destabilize the entire region , is not planned . premier jiabao denied his country was planning such a build-up .
" lifting the embargo does not mean china would start buying lots of arms in the eu , " he told reporters at a press conference .
" the embargo means getting rid of political discrimination against china .

groups like human rights watch have serious concerns over china 's commitment to improving its human rights record . the eu should not let " business interests trump its longstanding proclaimed commitment to human rights in china , " it warned in a statement released shortly before the start of the summit . us officials are worried that lifting the embargo would prompt china to go on a buying spree to accumulate weapons it can use to intimidate its neighbors , like taiwan . in an effort to appease both sides , the eu and china discussed a joint declaration on non-proliferation issues and the eu promised to set up a new code of conduct , should the embargo be lifted .

following the news that greece intentionally and repeatedly doctored budget data submitted to brussels , the european union has now been confronted with revelations that italy has done the same thing . italian opera fans might wave a dismissing hand over the accusations from brussels and say " cosi fan tutte – that ’ s what everybody does , " but finance minister domenico siniscalco found himself hard pressed at an eu meeting in brussels on tuesday over a european commission study that appears to cast serious doubt on his government 's budget data . after closely reviewing italy ’ s finances , eu economic affairs commissioner joaquin almunia expressed alarm over the unreliability of italy 's deficit figures and called for urgent clarification of the country ’ s finances .
meeting with siniscalo , the brussels budget chief said he was concerned with rome ’ s ability to cut taxes and introduce deficit reduction plans . according to official figures from the italian government , annual public deficits since 1997 have never exceeded the eu limit of three percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- – a stipulation of the euro zone ’ s stability and growth pact .
but a regular commission review of the figures has shown that given italy 's snail-like progress in reducing its national debt , the deficit figures should actually be higher . figures don ’ t compare the commission 's report focuses on so-called " stock-flow adjustments " that compare the debt and deficit levels .

but in italy 's case , the calculations have persistently fallen below the amount of cash the government actually borrowed to finance the deficits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's figures do n't add up , according to the eu commission .
the commission found that every year since 1997 , italy had borrowed more than the eu deficit ceiling , with figures reaching 4.3 percent of gdp in 2001 and 4.1 percent in 2003 , compared to rome 's official forecast of 2.9 percent this year . the commission has also been trying to work out why italy 's public debt , second only to greece 's at 106 percent of gdp and well in excess of the eu ceiling of 60 percent , has been falling more slowly than expected . an eu-wide phenomena ? concern over italy 's budget data comes a week after the commission launched legal action against greece for drastically underreporting its public deficit .
had the correct figures been known at the time , athens would not have been allowed to join the euro zone in 2001 . following the greek case , the revelations about italy have heightened concern about the ability of eu institutions to monitor its member states . german finance minister hans eichel has called for clarification of italy 's figures , but left open what consequences should be implemented if intentional misrepresentation is found .

following the news that greece intentionally and repeatedly doctored budget data submitted to brussels , the european union has now been confronted with revelations that italy has done the same thing . italian opera fans might wave a dismissing hand over the accusations from brussels and say " cosi fan tutte – that ’ s what everybody does , " but finance minister domenico siniscalco found himself hard pressed at an eu meeting in brussels on tuesday over a european commission study that appears to cast serious doubt on his government 's budget data . after closely reviewing italy ’ s finances , eu economic affairs commissioner joaquin almunia expressed alarm over the unreliability of italy 's deficit figures and called for urgent clarification of the country ’ s finances .
meeting with siniscalo , the brussels budget chief said he was concerned with rome ’ s ability to cut taxes and introduce deficit reduction plans . according to official figures from the italian government , annual public deficits since 1997 have never exceeded the eu limit of three percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- – a stipulation of the euro zone ’ s stability and growth pact .
but a regular commission review of the figures has shown that given italy 's snail-like progress in reducing its national debt , the deficit figures should actually be higher . figures don ’ t compare the commission 's report focuses on so-called " stock-flow adjustments " that compare the debt and deficit levels .
over time , these should compensate for each other .
but in italy 's case , the calculations have persistently fallen below the amount of cash the government actually borrowed to finance the deficits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's figures do n't add up , according to the eu commission .
the commission found that every year since 1997 , italy had borrowed more than the eu deficit ceiling , with figures reaching 4.3 percent of gdp in 2001 and 4.1 percent in 2003 , compared to rome 's official forecast of 2.9 percent this year . the commission has also been trying to work out why italy 's public debt , second only to greece 's at 106 percent of gdp and well in excess of the eu ceiling of 60 percent , has been falling more slowly than expected . an eu-wide phenomena ? concern over italy 's budget data comes a week after the commission launched legal action against greece for drastically underreporting its public deficit .
had the correct figures been known at the time , athens would not have been allowed to join the euro zone in 2001 . following the greek case , the revelations about italy have heightened concern about the ability of eu institutions to monitor its member states . german finance minister hans eichel has called for clarification of italy 's figures , but left open what consequences should be implemented if intentional misrepresentation is found .
berlin ’ s hesitancy may not be without self-interest considering that it too is one of the biggest culprits when it comes to failing to conform to eu budget guidelines .
germany , like france , has broken the three-percent stability pact ceiling for the past three years and is risking a fourth infringement . gregg benzow -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european commission to loosen stability pact the european commission on friday unveiled a plan to introduce more flexibility in the stability and growth pact , saying it was vital to restore the credibility of its much-flouted budget discipline rules .

recent reports of mobbing - bullying - in the german army , the bundeswehr , have caused the nation to look at the phenomenon more closely .
but it is by no means a purely german occurrence . while the german government attempts to get to the bottom of allegations that training officers carried out staged hostage-takings on a number of young army recruits at a camp in western germany and overstepped the boundary to abuse , the british ministry of defense -lrb- mod -rrb- is trying to fight off the latest mobbing claims levelled at its own army .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how violent is the truth ?
at the center of those allegations are the deaths of four young recruits who trained at the deepcut military barracks between 1995 and 2001 .
internal investigations revealed four counts of suicide , but relatives of the dead claimed the soldiers fell prey to a culture of fear and violence , and have called for a public inquiry .
despite a police report investigating abuse at deepcut , which besides the four fatalities , uncovered a further 173 allegations of rape , racism , and beatings , armed services minister adam ingram has so far ruled out the idea of commissioning an independent inquiry .
calling for help this reluctance to allow an independent body to poke about in the armed forces has come as no surprise to malcolm thorn , who is trying to convince the mod to officially recognize his organization called " forces helpline . "
thorn set up his helpline in response to what he recognized as a need among soldiers to seek confidential advice on bullying , and he 's been overwhelmed at the response .
" i 've had thousands of people contacting me , not only from the uk , but also from germany , holland and even new zealand , " thorn told dw-world .
the willingness on the part of soldiers to speak out about incidents of military mobbing seems to be growing . just last week , soldiers in the austrian army shocked the public with their revelations of torture during training sessions intended to prepare them for hostage situations .
that the training got way out of hand was documented on a video tape showing extreme tactics resembling those reported at the us-controlled abu ghraib prison in iraq , where the recruits were stripped , hooded and dragged across the ground .
more than toughening up recruits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a britischer soldier at a uk army infantry training school although the recent incidents of torture in austria , germany and britain have hit the headlines owing to their shock value , thorn said the usual range of allegations , which are largely lodged by young recruits , reflect his own experiences of military mobbing .
" i joined the army when i was 18 .
i was a bit of a wimp and i wanted to be toughened up , but i got beaten to a pulp , " thorn said .
while he confirmed that physical horrors , such as hanging recruits out of the window by their boot laces or bathing them in freezing cold water mixed with human excrement are practices which still go on in the army , he said that mental mobbing has just the same power to break a man .
the power of words it 's a view shared by sven knüppel , who , now a reservist lieutenant in the bundeswehr , has two decades of experience in the ranks of the german armed forces .
" a soldier might be able to withstand serious physical exertion , but if he is constantly subjected to verbal degradation , no matter how small , that can take its toll , " knüppel told dw-world .
bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr has slipped into an uncomfortable limelight that said , he does n't believe there is a strong culture of bullying in the german military .
" the british army has a very different structure to the bundeswehr , in that its tradition has not been broken for many , many years .
after 1945 , the german forces were rebuilt in a completely different way .
yet that is not to say that these things do n't happen , because there are always some crazy people who let their personal style flow back down through the ranks , " knüppel said .
but do the armed forces have a disproportionate number of bullies ?
patrick tissington , a psychologist who has researched the phenomenon , told dw-world he did n't think the army particularly attracts bullies .
" but because of the physical nature of the work , the effects of military mobbing tend to be more dramatic , " he said .
" and what is also very different , is that there is no way to go home . "
a widespread phenomenon although there is nothing remotely new about bullying , it is now more squarely in the mainframe of the collective consciousness than ever before and is recognized as a problem which not everyone can forget about even once they leave the school yard .
bullying is certainly not just limited to the barracks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hospitals are a hotbed of mobbing activity official statistics from a " mobbing report " commissioned by germany 's federal institute for occupational safety and health documented that one in nine germans will be mobbed at the office at least once during their working life .
the highest number of cases are in hospitals , closely followed by employees in social professions such as caregivers for the elderly , public servants and employees of the church .
" this is the human condition .
there is a capability of this kind of thing in all of us .
we tend to follow with the crowd , and if the crowd is n't stopped from bullying , it just continues .
of course it 's about power , about picking on the weak , but it 's also about a desire to be in control of our environment .

recent reports of mobbing - bullying - in the german army , the bundeswehr , have caused the nation to look at the phenomenon more closely .
but it is by no means a purely german occurrence . while the german government attempts to get to the bottom of allegations that training officers carried out staged hostage-takings on a number of young army recruits at a camp in western germany and overstepped the boundary to abuse , the british ministry of defense -lrb- mod -rrb- is trying to fight off the latest mobbing claims levelled at its own army .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how violent is the truth ?
at the center of those allegations are the deaths of four young recruits who trained at the deepcut military barracks between 1995 and 2001 .
internal investigations revealed four counts of suicide , but relatives of the dead claimed the soldiers fell prey to a culture of fear and violence , and have called for a public inquiry .
despite a police report investigating abuse at deepcut , which besides the four fatalities , uncovered a further 173 allegations of rape , racism , and beatings , armed services minister adam ingram has so far ruled out the idea of commissioning an independent inquiry .
calling for help this reluctance to allow an independent body to poke about in the armed forces has come as no surprise to malcolm thorn , who is trying to convince the mod to officially recognize his organization called " forces helpline . "
thorn set up his helpline in response to what he recognized as a need among soldiers to seek confidential advice on bullying , and he 's been overwhelmed at the response .
" i 've had thousands of people contacting me , not only from the uk , but also from germany , holland and even new zealand , " thorn told dw-world .
the willingness on the part of soldiers to speak out about incidents of military mobbing seems to be growing . just last week , soldiers in the austrian army shocked the public with their revelations of torture during training sessions intended to prepare them for hostage situations .
that the training got way out of hand was documented on a video tape showing extreme tactics resembling those reported at the us-controlled abu ghraib prison in iraq , where the recruits were stripped , hooded and dragged across the ground .
more than toughening up recruits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a britischer soldier at a uk army infantry training school although the recent incidents of torture in austria , germany and britain have hit the headlines owing to their shock value , thorn said the usual range of allegations , which are largely lodged by young recruits , reflect his own experiences of military mobbing .
" i joined the army when i was 18 .
i was a bit of a wimp and i wanted to be toughened up , but i got beaten to a pulp , " thorn said .
while he confirmed that physical horrors , such as hanging recruits out of the window by their boot laces or bathing them in freezing cold water mixed with human excrement are practices which still go on in the army , he said that mental mobbing has just the same power to break a man .
the power of words it 's a view shared by sven knüppel , who , now a reservist lieutenant in the bundeswehr , has two decades of experience in the ranks of the german armed forces .
" a soldier might be able to withstand serious physical exertion , but if he is constantly subjected to verbal degradation , no matter how small , that can take its toll , " knüppel told dw-world .
bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr has slipped into an uncomfortable limelight that said , he does n't believe there is a strong culture of bullying in the german military .
" the british army has a very different structure to the bundeswehr , in that its tradition has not been broken for many , many years .
after 1945 , the german forces were rebuilt in a completely different way .
yet that is not to say that these things do n't happen , because there are always some crazy people who let their personal style flow back down through the ranks , " knüppel said .
but do the armed forces have a disproportionate number of bullies ?
patrick tissington , a psychologist who has researched the phenomenon , told dw-world he did n't think the army particularly attracts bullies .
" but because of the physical nature of the work , the effects of military mobbing tend to be more dramatic , " he said .
" and what is also very different , is that there is no way to go home . "
a widespread phenomenon although there is nothing remotely new about bullying , it is now more squarely in the mainframe of the collective consciousness than ever before and is recognized as a problem which not everyone can forget about even once they leave the school yard .
bullying is certainly not just limited to the barracks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hospitals are a hotbed of mobbing activity official statistics from a " mobbing report " commissioned by germany 's federal institute for occupational safety and health documented that one in nine germans will be mobbed at the office at least once during their working life .
the highest number of cases are in hospitals , closely followed by employees in social professions such as caregivers for the elderly , public servants and employees of the church .
" this is the human condition .
there is a capability of this kind of thing in all of us .
we tend to follow with the crowd , and if the crowd is n't stopped from bullying , it just continues .

recent reports of mobbing - bullying - in the german army , the bundeswehr , have caused the nation to look at the phenomenon more closely .
but it is by no means a purely german occurrence . while the german government attempts to get to the bottom of allegations that training officers carried out staged hostage-takings on a number of young army recruits at a camp in western germany and overstepped the boundary to abuse , the british ministry of defense -lrb- mod -rrb- is trying to fight off the latest mobbing claims levelled at its own army .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how violent is the truth ?
at the center of those allegations are the deaths of four young recruits who trained at the deepcut military barracks between 1995 and 2001 .
internal investigations revealed four counts of suicide , but relatives of the dead claimed the soldiers fell prey to a culture of fear and violence , and have called for a public inquiry .
despite a police report investigating abuse at deepcut , which besides the four fatalities , uncovered a further 173 allegations of rape , racism , and beatings , armed services minister adam ingram has so far ruled out the idea of commissioning an independent inquiry .
calling for help this reluctance to allow an independent body to poke about in the armed forces has come as no surprise to malcolm thorn , who is trying to convince the mod to officially recognize his organization called " forces helpline . "
thorn set up his helpline in response to what he recognized as a need among soldiers to seek confidential advice on bullying , and he 's been overwhelmed at the response .
" i 've had thousands of people contacting me , not only from the uk , but also from germany , holland and even new zealand , " thorn told dw-world .
the willingness on the part of soldiers to speak out about incidents of military mobbing seems to be growing . just last week , soldiers in the austrian army shocked the public with their revelations of torture during training sessions intended to prepare them for hostage situations .
that the training got way out of hand was documented on a video tape showing extreme tactics resembling those reported at the us-controlled abu ghraib prison in iraq , where the recruits were stripped , hooded and dragged across the ground .
more than toughening up recruits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a britischer soldier at a uk army infantry training school although the recent incidents of torture in austria , germany and britain have hit the headlines owing to their shock value , thorn said the usual range of allegations , which are largely lodged by young recruits , reflect his own experiences of military mobbing .
" i joined the army when i was 18 .
i was a bit of a wimp and i wanted to be toughened up , but i got beaten to a pulp , " thorn said .
while he confirmed that physical horrors , such as hanging recruits out of the window by their boot laces or bathing them in freezing cold water mixed with human excrement are practices which still go on in the army , he said that mental mobbing has just the same power to break a man .
the power of words it 's a view shared by sven knüppel , who , now a reservist lieutenant in the bundeswehr , has two decades of experience in the ranks of the german armed forces .
" a soldier might be able to withstand serious physical exertion , but if he is constantly subjected to verbal degradation , no matter how small , that can take its toll , " knüppel told dw-world .
bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr has slipped into an uncomfortable limelight that said , he does n't believe there is a strong culture of bullying in the german military .
" the british army has a very different structure to the bundeswehr , in that its tradition has not been broken for many , many years .
after 1945 , the german forces were rebuilt in a completely different way .
yet that is not to say that these things do n't happen , because there are always some crazy people who let their personal style flow back down through the ranks , " knüppel said .
but do the armed forces have a disproportionate number of bullies ?
patrick tissington , a psychologist who has researched the phenomenon , told dw-world he did n't think the army particularly attracts bullies .
" but because of the physical nature of the work , the effects of military mobbing tend to be more dramatic , " he said .
" and what is also very different , is that there is no way to go home . "
a widespread phenomenon although there is nothing remotely new about bullying , it is now more squarely in the mainframe of the collective consciousness than ever before and is recognized as a problem which not everyone can forget about even once they leave the school yard .
bullying is certainly not just limited to the barracks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hospitals are a hotbed of mobbing activity official statistics from a " mobbing report " commissioned by germany 's federal institute for occupational safety and health documented that one in nine germans will be mobbed at the office at least once during their working life .
the highest number of cases are in hospitals , closely followed by employees in social professions such as caregivers for the elderly , public servants and employees of the church .
" this is the human condition .
there is a capability of this kind of thing in all of us .
we tend to follow with the crowd , and if the crowd is n't stopped from bullying , it just continues .
of course it 's about power , about picking on the weak , but it 's also about a desire to be in control of our environment .
what are needed are good leaders , who deal with the problems early on , " tissington said . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de british army faces own abuse scandal as germany investigates allegations of abuse in its armed forces , in britain , a similar scandal is unfolding .

in troubled economic times , their subsidies are being slashed or cut altogether .
one berlin-based orchestra may have found a unique way to survive . cultural institutions around germany are struggling with the country 's new economic realities .
with stagnant growth and high unemployment , many of the country 's most esteemed opera houses , museums and orchestras are being forced to tighten their belts . smaller groups in berlin , a city classified as broke by even optimists , have been particularly hard hit .
now , following the berlin senate 's decision this past summer to cut subsidies , the berliner symphoniker , the smallest of the city 's eight official orchestras , is looking to start anew - as germany 's first private orchestra . in doing so , the director is hoping to return to solvency and set an example for germany 's other struggling cultural institutions . " we 're gonna make it on our own " this past summer , the berlin senate , hard pressed to plug holes in the city 's hemorrhaging budget , voted to cut the symphoniker 's € 3 million -lrb- $ 4 million -rrb- in subsidies .
it did n't take long for the 55-strong orchestra to hit the skids , and by september it officially declared insolvency . this week , the orchestra 's director , andreas moritz , and the lawyer overseeing the bankruptcy proceedings , christian köhler-ma , announced plans to make a comeback as germany 's first independent orchestra . in additional to the traditional cost-cutting measures - lower wages , longer hours - at the heart of the turnaround is an aggressive marketing campaign aimed at rebranding the orchestra as young , hip and unconventional . challenging the image of an orchestra bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another poster from the fundraising campaign in its new life as a private orchestra , the berliner symphoniker will challenge traditional notions and look to broaden its profit-oriented horizons .
as such , nothing is being ruled out , according to köhler-ma , who thinks so-called " crossover " ventures with pop stars may be part of the way forward . " ideally , we could plan concerts with robin gibb , metallica , nena or the scorpions , " he told the weekly newsmagazine der spiegel . in addition , the orchestra has hired a flashy marketing company to make sure everyone knows about the " new " symphoniker . moritz , the director , hopes his orchestra 's success as a private enterprise will serve as an example to other cultural institutions struggling with the new economic realities .
" this is a huge chance for us to set an example , and we are convinced we can survive as a private orchestra , " he told the daily die tageszeitung . the first challenge already looms : moritz and company still need to come up with the € 300,000 transitional funds needed to take the first step forward .
they are hoping to find a major sponsor . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the real drama of berlin opera berlin 's three opera houses are no strangers to eluding closure and nursing the wounds of financial incision .

many will go on to develop serious liver disease .
so today the government is launching a campaign to raise awareness but doctors warn it 's too little too late .
on breakfast , this morning : we discussed the issue with charles gore of the hepatitis c trust , and with catherine goldsmith who has the disease. click here to watch charles gore and catherine goldsmith catherine goldsmith described her symptoms catherine goldsmith described her symptoms and said how traumatised she felt when she found out she had hepatitis c. she also said there was a lack of information and even her doctor did n't really know much about her illness .
we also discussed the issue with our resident gp dr rosemary leonard and pip forbes adam - who is in long-term remission from the virus .. click here to watch the above discussion what causes hepatitis c ?
there are several forms of hepatitis which literally means inflammation of the liver .
3 % of the world 's population is thought to have the virus but not everyone develops symptoms which makes it difficult to give a precise figure .
drinking too much alcohol and some drugs and chemicals can also lead to inflammation of the liver .
how is the disease passed on ?
infection takes place when blood - which can be a tiny amount - passes from an infected person to someone who is n't , usually entering their bloodstream by an open wound or cut .
hepatitis c : symptoms mild to severe fatigue anxiety weight loss loss of appetite alcohol intolerance pain in the area of the liver concentration problems nausea flu-like symptoms jaundice nowadays , blood for transfusion is screened so the virus should n't normally be spread this way .
very occasionally , the virus can be passed on by sexual contact .
an unfortunate consequence of the virus is that it can be easily spread to drug users who share needles .
it ca n't be passed on through saliva but oral hygiene is important and it 's wise not to share a toothbrush with someone who is infected .
symptoms hepatitis c can be acute or chronic with symptoms often coming and going .
it can appear as a flu like illness and sometimes , although rarely includes symptoms of nausea , vomiting , a pain in the liver region of the body or jaundice. when the liver becomes inflamed over a lengthy period of time , it can develop scar tissue known as cirrhosis .
it is not possible to be vaccinated against hepatitis c , testing for the infection involves a blood test , liver function test or possibly a biopsy to check for serious damage .
in its worst case , a patient with hepatitis c may vomit or pass blood during bowel motions and if this is the case urgent medical attention should be sought .
launch the chief medical officer , sir liam donaldson will launch a publicity campaign this morning which it 's hoped will raise awareness into the condition .
he 'll outline details during a visit to the liver and anti viral centre , at st mary 's nhs trust in west london .

the british medical association poll found 84 % of people in scotland would not mind seeing a nurse or paramedic .
from january , gps can opt out of out-of-hours care , passing responsibility to local primary care trusts .
but critics say the new system means patients are denied access to gps , and are often forced to go to a & e. the changes in out-of-hours provision are expected to relieve the pressure on gps .
the latest poll , by developing patient partnerships -lrb- dpp -rrb- , found that 79 % felt reducing the pressure on gps was important .
at times when they need to see a gp they can rest assured that they will be able to do so dr david wrigley dpp spokesman and 80 % of people in scotland thought it was reasonable for most patients to go to a health centre for care when their surgery is closed .
uk-wide research also revealed that 71 % of gps believed the move would attract more gps into the profession .
the dpp has launched the step by step campaign to help patients decide what service they need when they are ill and explaining the changes to out-of-hours services .
dr david wrigley , dpp spokesman , said : " encouragingly , 85 % of scots feel confident that they would get a good service from the nhs if they needed it and their surgery was closed .
" what we need to ensure is that patients are able to make the best use of these services by being informed about which service they use when they are ill and what to expect from these services .
need for resources " this is key to ensuring that people make the right decision at the right time .
at times when they need to see a gp they can rest assured that they will be able to do so . "
dr david love , joint chairman of the bma 's scottish general practitioners committee , said : " many parts of scotland have already successfully transferred responsibility for out-of-hours care to the local nhs board .
" however , it is important that the public is aware of these changes and how they can access appropriate health services , particularly during the holiday season . "
he added : " this survey shows that the public recognises the problems of a shortage of gps and the pressures that exist in primary care , but it is important that nhs boards put sufficient resources into the out-of-hours services they are providing in order to maintain quality of care for patients .
