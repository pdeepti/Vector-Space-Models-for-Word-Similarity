finding takers is a problem . on a sunny winter morning , emel algan drives up in a black mini car to the office of her islamic women 's organization in berlin 's largely turkish kreuzberg district , her pixie-like face framed by a swath of striking pink fabric . indoors , algan -lrb- photo -rrb- does a quick fashion show as she exchanges her cleverly-woven bright hood cum scarf for a jaunty shaded green silk hat with an attached piece of fabric that buttons under the chin and flows to the chest and a floral patterned bandanna-like creation that gathers in at the back of the head .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emel algan " it looks so colorful and yet it 's just so practical , " algan says .
" it does away with the thousands of safety pins that you need for a conventional muslim headscarf and at the same time covers the throat , hair and ears , " she adds .
tradition and modernity the latter is important for 43-year-old algan , a religious muslim and mother of six , who has worn the traditional muslim hijab or headscarf since her childhood spent in small towns in germany .
in recent months , the muslim headscarf has been the subject of sometimes heated debate in germany about its place in society , and in particular in state-run institutions . algan herself incorporates a mixture of tradition and modernity .
she studied english language and literature at college and now heads a muslim women 's organization .
she began toying with fashionable alternatives to the conventional headscarf a year ago .
" i was unhappy with the widespread prejudices in germany against headscarf-wearing muslim women , prejudices like ' they 're dumb and servile . '
i had nothing to do with all that but i felt like i was being branded the same on account of my headscarf , " algan explains .
search for the neutral islamic headscarf the turmoil brought algan last year to the doorstep of milliner susanne gäbel , who runs a hat shop in the upscale charlottenburg neighborhood .
" i 'm no designer , all i knew is that i wanted something functional yet attractive that would n't look like the traditional headscarf , " algan says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emel algan gäbel says the request was an unusual one .
" i did n't have any experience with islamic headscarves , though i had done something traditional for jewish customers and for women who had undergone chemotherapy and wanted to cover their heads , " she says .
the search for the neutral , non-radical islamic headscarf has resulted in a series of nine innovative headscarf models in varying colors and materials .
some resemble charleston hats , others nordic felt caps , and they all meet the needs of those muslim women who interpret the koran as requiring they cover their hair , ears and throat .
" most of them are like ski caps or hoods with ear flaps that can be simply slipped over the head without needing any buttons or zips .
the fabric has to be elastic like jersey and felt , " gäbel explains .
the alternative headscarves start at € 50 and are custom-made for each individual .
a new person algan , who has now permanently swapped her conventional hijab for the alternative headscarf , says it 's made her feel like a different person .
" every morning when i get up i ask myself what i want to wear because i can now combine my wardrobe with my colorful headgear , " she says .
the change is n't just external either .
" with the new headscarf i feel like i 'm more accepted in a positive sense .
it could be just a banal conversation with the cashier at the supermarket about the weather , but now non-muslims actually notice me and are n't afraid of contact , " she says .
strict social controls algan adds she has no plans to sell the headgear on a commercial basis , but wants to convince younger muslim girls and women to try it out and in doing so , sidestep a proposed ban on the islamic headscarf in state-run institutions in berlin .
she 's now started a women 's discussion group to that purpose .
" i 'm doing all this to just provide some ideas for muslim women , to provide them with an alternative - after all as far as islam goes , there are no rules dictating how we should dress .
we can wear what we want as long as we cover ourselves , " algan says .
but delivering the message is proving harder than expected .
" the reactions have been very reserved so far .
unfortunately , social controls are so strong in muslim society that even if the girls are interested , they do n't have the freedom to express themselves .
they 're worried about what their husbands and mothers-in-law will think , " algan says .
" this traditional thinking is still deeply-ingrained in muslims here though four generations of them now live here .

"
gerhard schröder is no stranger to taking on the press when its coverage of him does n't pass muster .
but now that he 's decided to give the nation 's best-selling tabloid the cold shoulder , journalists are fighting back . gerhard schröder 's latest tussle with the media bears an uncanny resemblance to a schoolyard brawl .
germany 's biggest-selling daily , bild zeitung , prints some critical stories about schröder 's economic and social reforms . the chancellor , nose clearly out of joint , responds by saying he 's no longer talking to bild .
his spokesman , bela anda - a former bild journalist himself - criticizes the paper 's reporting style , calling it " a mixture of malice , agitation and contempt for the politicians , garnished with half-truths . " following the accusations , made last week , the tabloid remained cool , saying the decision only made schröder 's government look bad .
then , several bild journalists accused the government of excluding them from accompanying the chancellor on trips .
anda denies any such boycott , and says if bild reporters have to stay home , it 's because of lack of space on schröder 's plane . reporters fight for their rights sensing that the weaker party is being bullied , the german journalists ' union , djv , stepped in on monday to flex some muscle .
its head , michael konken , wrote a letter to anda , accusing the government of being overly sensitive and high-handed .
the exclusion of journalists , he says , is " a blatant transgression against the freedom of the press and their duty to report information . " " the only party responsible for the current critical nature of reports in the media is the government 's unprofessional public relations department , which seems incapable of communicating the strategies of the politicians to the media and the people in this country , " konken wrote . media chancellor ? schröder 's decision to stop granting interviews to bild bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder 's government accuses " bild " of bias. did n't exactly come out of nowhere .

"
gerhard schröder is no stranger to taking on the press when its coverage of him does n't pass muster .
but now that he 's decided to give the nation 's best-selling tabloid the cold shoulder , journalists are fighting back . gerhard schröder 's latest tussle with the media bears an uncanny resemblance to a schoolyard brawl .
germany 's biggest-selling daily , bild zeitung , prints some critical stories about schröder 's economic and social reforms . the chancellor , nose clearly out of joint , responds by saying he 's no longer talking to bild .
his spokesman , bela anda - a former bild journalist himself - criticizes the paper 's reporting style , calling it " a mixture of malice , agitation and contempt for the politicians , garnished with half-truths . " following the accusations , made last week , the tabloid remained cool , saying the decision only made schröder 's government look bad .
then , several bild journalists accused the government of excluding them from accompanying the chancellor on trips .
anda denies any such boycott , and says if bild reporters have to stay home , it 's because of lack of space on schröder 's plane . reporters fight for their rights sensing that the weaker party is being bullied , the german journalists ' union , djv , stepped in on monday to flex some muscle .
its head , michael konken , wrote a letter to anda , accusing the government of being overly sensitive and high-handed .
the exclusion of journalists , he says , is " a blatant transgression against the freedom of the press and their duty to report information . " " the only party responsible for the current critical nature of reports in the media is the government 's unprofessional public relations department , which seems incapable of communicating the strategies of the politicians to the media and the people in this country , " konken wrote . media chancellor ? schröder 's decision to stop granting interviews to bild bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder 's government accuses " bild " of bias. did n't exactly come out of nowhere .
the chancellor has been disgruntled with the paper 's political coverage for weeks .
last month , he requested his social democrat parliamentarians to show more restraint when speaking with bild reporters . nor is schröder 's move without precedence .
former chancellor helmut kohl , for example , refused to grant interviews to der spiegel , after accusing the news magazine of distorting its coverage of him . but schröder is germany 's self-proclaimed " media chancellor " - the man who once said that all he needed to govern were the tabloids and television .
as such , some would say he ought to know better .
this is n't the first time schröder has taken on the media for running unflattering stories about him .
but despite winning past battles , there 's a general sense that schröder is a bad sport . last year , the chancellor won a court order to stop speculation in the press about whether or not he dyed his hair -lrb- he does n't , by the way -rrb- . schröder 's lawyers also won an injunction against the british tabloid mail on sunday after it alleged that schröder 's fourth marriage was on the rocks . depending on how far schröder 's tiff with bild stretches , the tables could soon be turned .

the german ferrari pilot raced across the finish line just ahead of his teammate rubens barrichello . six-time world champion michael schumacher proved on sunday he is once again the man to beat this season as he led his ferrari team to a one-two victory in the formula one opener in melbourne , australia .
as the german racer took the checkered flag at albert park only 13.605 seconds ahead of his brazilian teammate rubens barrichello , the clock seemed to roll back to 2002 , when the ferrari duo roared to 15 wins in 17 races .

with a record time of 1:24:15.757 hours , the rest of the field paled in comparison to schumi and barrichello .
in third place was the spaniard fernando alonso for renault .
the bmw-williams team disappointed with a fourth and fifth place by ralf schumacher and the colombian juan pablo montoya .
" ferrari was in a class of its own , " said norbert haug , motor sport boss for mclaren-mercendes , which only managed to pull off an 8th place with david coulthard .

for formula one ringmaster , bernie ecclestone , a return of a one-two ferrari sweep spells nothing but disaster .
after new regulations did nothing to slow the italian steed or bring out a new contending champion , the sport 's commercial supremo is worried 2004 could bring a return of the 2002 " formula yawn " when television audiences switched off in droves because the results were foreseeable .

germany 's ruling social democrats and opposition conservatives thrashed out the details of long-debated immigration legislation on monday .
though there 's no talk of a breakthrough , the two sides did make progress . after almost four years of turbulent negotiations , germany 's floundering immigration legislation received a slight boost on monday when a seven-member expert group drawn from the main political parties said it made some progress on finding common ground . german interior minister otto schily of the ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- spoke of an improvement .
" the objectives are n't that far apart anymore , " he said . peter müller of the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- added that the two sides had made progress in the controversial areas of labor-market migration and humanitarian immigration , though details were n't released . müller added they discussed further tricky issues such as the integration of foreigners already in germany as well as the situation of ethnic germans and security . security a sticking point the latter point in particular proved to be a contentious one during monday 's discussions .
the conservatives have been pushing for tighter security measures ever since the discovery that terrorists involved in the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the united states had lived and studied in germany for years and had hatched the plot during that time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily on monday , schily -lrb- photo -rrb- signaled his willingness to facilitate expulsion procedures in the draft law for immigrants suspected of terrorist activities .
" it goes without saying that we do n't want to tolerate immigrants who pose a threat to german security .
we agree that there must be clear provisions that govern the residential status and possible expulsion procedures for such persons , " schily said . gulf between spd and cdu positions the immigration issue has been plagued by the widely divergent positions of the ruling coalition , made up of the spd and the green party , and the opposition cdu and its bavarian sister party csu . while the spd and the greens are in favor of a law aimed at simplifying regulations governing residency permits and making it easier for highly-qualified foreigners to work and live in germany , the cdu / csu argues that in light of germany 's high unemployment rate it would be rash to open its gates to an influx of labor from abroad .
it claims the country has enough problems integrating the seven million foreigners already in the country . the issue first attracted attention when schröder launched a scheme in 2000 to give permits to up to 20,000 computer specialists from india and central europe to work in germany on five-year contracts .
it has been lent new urgency by statistics showing germany faces a demographic time bomb with an increasingly ageing population and declining birth rates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian software expert in addition , german business and industry experts have repeatedly warned that the country faces a severe crunch of scientists and engineers and that highly-qualified foreigners were badly needed in the fields .
immigration is also necessary , they say , for economic growth and the funding of germany 's generous welfare state . signs of compromise schröder 's government came close to sealing germany 's first-ever immigration law in 2002 but suffered a severe setback in december that year when germany 's highest court ruled that it was unconstitutional .
despite the lows , in recent weeks , both sides have loosened their entrenched positions and signaled a willingness to compromise . the spd and greens have agreed to give up demands for a point system , such as in canada or new zealand , that would have allowed immigrants access to the german labor market without proof of a concrete job .
instead , permission would have been based an immigrant 's qualifications , skills and german language knowledge . the ruling coalition insists , though , that a general ban on hiring foreigners from outside the eu , which took effect in 1973 after the massive immigration wave of the 1960s , should be lifted .
this demand is expected to be a major sticking point between the two sides . for its part , the cdu has hinted that it might make concessions to the greens on drawing up a more humanitarian asylum law . clock ticking experts believe if nothing else , time pressure will ensure that the two sides are forced to reach agreement on the immigration law .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 09.03.2004 car design à la lady großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the revolutionary all-female creation , the ycc even in this achingly modern 21st century , prejudice and preconception about dreaded " women drivers " still abound .
but there 's news for these macho male roadsters : women design cars . actually the news is anything but new .
more than a century ago , one mary anderson of the united states got the ball rolling when she registered a patent for the indispensable - especially in northern europe - windshield wipers .
and what a trendsetter she turned out to be .
the motoring association auto club europe also credits women with the invention of spiked tires and dipping headlights . it all goes to show that women quite evidently have a more meaningful relationship with cars than their bikini-clad romps on top of them might suggest , but the partnership has never been quite as serious as now .
at this year 's geneva motor show , swedish car manufacturer volvo unveiled a super-slick , stunningly-stylish new car called " your concept car " or " ycc . "
designed to fit the needs of what volvo claims to be the most demanding customer of all , the independent professional woman , it has everything a man might want plus all the added extras which women have long been screaming for . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inside of the ycc like the professional woman , the ycc coupé looks cool and graceful .
sexily sophisticated , it really has everything a woman wants : a special handbag compartment within easy reach of the drivers seat , a fool-proof little gizmo which will help even the most horrifying female parkers give their male counterparts a run for their money , elegant electric doors and special paint which works like a teflon frying pan to keep dirt from sticking to the body work , hence reducing the need for women to get down and dirty with a sponge , bucket and tin of wax .
but perhaps the greatest beauty of the car is that everything moves , adjusts , folds up and down , detaches and rotates , making it the perfect vehicle for anyone who ca n't quite decide just how it should look .
now would that be men or women ? dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de geneva motor show hopes to rev up car industry the first signs of spring may be slow in coming to europe this year , but german auto makers are hoping the geneva motor show will help spark new life into the beleaguered industry .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 09.03.2004 trade union boss reproaches " oppressive " discount stores großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : discount supermarkets lidl and aldi are among those accused of compromising their workers rights .
frank bsirske , the chairman of german trade union verdi , spoke out publicly against three of germany 's biggest discount retailers on monday and criticized their working conditions and perceived lack of employee rights . choosing international women 's day to launch his scathing criticism of the working practices of german discount supermarkets aldi and lidl and no-frills chemist chain schlecker , frank bsirske named and shamed those companies considered by his union to rule their empires with iron fists and a culture of fear , accusing them of using " intimidation as a commercial model . "
the timing of his outburst was carefully considered .
according to the verdi trade union boss about 100,000 german women work in the 10,500 schlecker shops , 3,500 aldis and 2,500 lidl branches nationwide , mostly in part-time positions and mostly in conditions unacceptable in this modern age .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verdi chief frank bsirske " the success of the discounters bathes in the sun , " said bsirske -lrb- photo -rrb- at a protest against working conditions outside a schlecker outlet in hanau on monday .
" but the terms of employment for the employee remains in shadow . "
accusing the discount giants of operating like the industrial tyrants of the 19th century , bsirske added that rate of pay contracts had been ignored , resulting in staff wages under the national average and hours of overtime that often go unpaid .
talk of unions met with threats those employees considering joining a union had been intimidated out of doing so , with many companies actively blocking any action by works committees throughout their branches , the verdi chairman declared .
" threats are not isolated cases in the climate of fear , " he said , calling the treatment of many workers " degrading . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : discounters command a 30 percent share of the german retail market but may find their control slipping if verdi carries out its threats to take action against those companies it sees as being the main offenders .
leading the union 's hit-list is lidl , the german supermarket sector 's second largest concern .
big names facing the " last resort " according to the union , lidl has refused every collaboration with verdi , completely banning trade unionists throughout its empire .
verdi has stated that , if lidl refuses to admit organized works committee elections in its establishments and assigned branches , the union will be forced to apply its " last resort . "
that could be a referral to the federal board of trade and a subsequent investigation .
a similar fate could await aldi whose southern division is also accused of suppressing union activity throughout its branches .
attempts to create committee initiatives for the rights of workers have been " strangled by massive pressure , " according to bsirske , even in central offices where the number of employees is much higher than on the shop floor .
employees under stress and suspicion however , while verdi is concerned about the lack of union representation in discount businesses , bsirske said that the state of employment conditions is worse than the massive impediment to works committee initiatives in all three named discounters .
lack of adequate numbers of staff , extended working hours and frequent loneliness in stores has caused stress and achievement pressure in many employees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to the union , some employees have also complained about frequent controls at the cash registers , about searches of handbags and lockers and about " house visits " by superiors after a staff member has called in sick or after a union engagement .
verdi also claims the price war between the discount chains is causing more and more pressure on their staff members with little or no extra reward for the increased workload and stress .

frank bsirske , the chairman of german trade union verdi , spoke out publicly against three of germany 's biggest discount retailers on monday and criticized their working conditions and perceived lack of employee rights . choosing international women 's day to launch his scathing criticism of the working practices of german discount supermarkets aldi and lidl and no-frills chemist chain schlecker , frank bsirske named and shamed those companies considered by his union to rule their empires with iron fists and a culture of fear , accusing them of using " intimidation as a commercial model . "
the timing of his outburst was carefully considered .
according to the verdi trade union boss about 100,000 german women work in the 10,500 schlecker shops , 3,500 aldis and 2,500 lidl branches nationwide , mostly in part-time positions and mostly in conditions unacceptable in this modern age .

" but the terms of employment for the employee remains in shadow . "
accusing the discount giants of operating like the industrial tyrants of the 19th century , bsirske added that rate of pay contracts had been ignored , resulting in staff wages under the national average and hours of overtime that often go unpaid .
talk of unions met with threats those employees considering joining a union had been intimidated out of doing so , with many companies actively blocking any action by works committees throughout their branches , the verdi chairman declared .
" threats are not isolated cases in the climate of fear , " he said , calling the treatment of many workers " degrading . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 09.03.2004 giving the headscarf a makeover großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daring to be different - emel algan even as the headscarf row simmers in germany , a berlin muslim has designed colorful alternative headgear that serves the purpose of a traditional hijab but looks like anything but .
finding takers is a problem . on a sunny winter morning , emel algan drives up in a black mini car to the office of her islamic women 's organization in berlin 's largely turkish kreuzberg district , her pixie-like face framed by a swath of striking pink fabric . indoors , algan -lrb- photo -rrb- does a quick fashion show as she exchanges her cleverly-woven bright hood cum scarf for a jaunty shaded green silk hat with an attached piece of fabric that buttons under the chin and flows to the chest and a floral patterned bandanna-like creation that gathers in at the back of the head .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emel algan " it looks so colorful and yet it 's just so practical , " algan says .
" it does away with the thousands of safety pins that you need for a conventional muslim headscarf and at the same time covers the throat , hair and ears , " she adds .
tradition and modernity the latter is important for 43-year-old algan , a religious muslim and mother of six , who has worn the traditional muslim hijab or headscarf since her childhood spent in small towns in germany .
in recent months , the muslim headscarf has been the subject of sometimes heated debate in germany about its place in society , and in particular in state-run institutions . algan herself incorporates a mixture of tradition and modernity .
she studied english language and literature at college and now heads a muslim women 's organization .
she began toying with fashionable alternatives to the conventional headscarf a year ago .
" i was unhappy with the widespread prejudices in germany against headscarf-wearing muslim women , prejudices like ' they 're dumb and servile . '
i had nothing to do with all that but i felt like i was being branded the same on account of my headscarf , " algan explains .
search for the neutral islamic headscarf the turmoil brought algan last year to the doorstep of milliner susanne gäbel , who runs a hat shop in the upscale charlottenburg neighborhood .
" i 'm no designer , all i knew is that i wanted something functional yet attractive that would n't look like the traditional headscarf , " algan says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emel algan gäbel says the request was an unusual one .
" i did n't have any experience with islamic headscarves , though i had done something traditional for jewish customers and for women who had undergone chemotherapy and wanted to cover their heads , " she says .
the search for the neutral , non-radical islamic headscarf has resulted in a series of nine innovative headscarf models in varying colors and materials .
some resemble charleston hats , others nordic felt caps , and they all meet the needs of those muslim women who interpret the koran as requiring they cover their hair , ears and throat .
" most of them are like ski caps or hoods with ear flaps that can be simply slipped over the head without needing any buttons or zips .
the fabric has to be elastic like jersey and felt , " gäbel explains .
the alternative headscarves start at € 50 and are custom-made for each individual .
a new person algan , who has now permanently swapped her conventional hijab for the alternative headscarf , says it 's made her feel like a different person .
" every morning when i get up i ask myself what i want to wear because i can now combine my wardrobe with my colorful headgear , " she says .
the change is n't just external either .
" with the new headscarf i feel like i 'm more accepted in a positive sense .
it could be just a banal conversation with the cashier at the supermarket about the weather , but now non-muslims actually notice me and are n't afraid of contact , " she says .
strict social controls algan adds she has no plans to sell the headgear on a commercial basis , but wants to convince younger muslim girls and women to try it out and in doing so , sidestep a proposed ban on the islamic headscarf in state-run institutions in berlin .
she 's now started a women 's discussion group to that purpose .
" i 'm doing all this to just provide some ideas for muslim women , to provide them with an alternative - after all as far as islam goes , there are no rules dictating how we should dress .
we can wear what we want as long as we cover ourselves , " algan says .
but delivering the message is proving harder than expected .
" the reactions have been very reserved so far .
unfortunately , social controls are so strong in muslim society that even if the girls are interested , they do n't have the freedom to express themselves .
they 're worried about what their husbands and mothers-in-law will think , " algan says .
" this traditional thinking is still deeply-ingrained in muslims here though four generations of them now live here . " sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de headscarf issue rears its head again the decisive thing is not what ’ s on the head , but what ’ s in it , ” says a group of prominent german women who have launched a campaign against the government ’ s headscarf ban for muslim teachers .

finding takers is a problem . on a sunny winter morning , emel algan drives up in a black mini car to the office of her islamic women 's organization in berlin 's largely turkish kreuzberg district , her pixie-like face framed by a swath of striking pink fabric . indoors , algan -lrb- photo -rrb- does a quick fashion show as she exchanges her cleverly-woven bright hood cum scarf for a jaunty shaded green silk hat with an attached piece of fabric that buttons under the chin and flows to the chest and a floral patterned bandanna-like creation that gathers in at the back of the head .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emel algan " it looks so colorful and yet it 's just so practical , " algan says .
" it does away with the thousands of safety pins that you need for a conventional muslim headscarf and at the same time covers the throat , hair and ears , " she adds .
tradition and modernity the latter is important for 43-year-old algan , a religious muslim and mother of six , who has worn the traditional muslim hijab or headscarf since her childhood spent in small towns in germany .
in recent months , the muslim headscarf has been the subject of sometimes heated debate in germany about its place in society , and in particular in state-run institutions . algan herself incorporates a mixture of tradition and modernity .
she studied english language and literature at college and now heads a muslim women 's organization .
she began toying with fashionable alternatives to the conventional headscarf a year ago .
" i was unhappy with the widespread prejudices in germany against headscarf-wearing muslim women , prejudices like ' they 're dumb and servile . '
i had nothing to do with all that but i felt like i was being branded the same on account of my headscarf , " algan explains .
search for the neutral islamic headscarf the turmoil brought algan last year to the doorstep of milliner susanne gäbel , who runs a hat shop in the upscale charlottenburg neighborhood .
" i 'm no designer , all i knew is that i wanted something functional yet attractive that would n't look like the traditional headscarf , " algan says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emel algan gäbel says the request was an unusual one .
" i did n't have any experience with islamic headscarves , though i had done something traditional for jewish customers and for women who had undergone chemotherapy and wanted to cover their heads , " she says .
the search for the neutral , non-radical islamic headscarf has resulted in a series of nine innovative headscarf models in varying colors and materials .
some resemble charleston hats , others nordic felt caps , and they all meet the needs of those muslim women who interpret the koran as requiring they cover their hair , ears and throat .
" most of them are like ski caps or hoods with ear flaps that can be simply slipped over the head without needing any buttons or zips .
the fabric has to be elastic like jersey and felt , " gäbel explains .
the alternative headscarves start at € 50 and are custom-made for each individual .
a new person algan , who has now permanently swapped her conventional hijab for the alternative headscarf , says it 's made her feel like a different person .
" every morning when i get up i ask myself what i want to wear because i can now combine my wardrobe with my colorful headgear , " she says .
the change is n't just external either .
" with the new headscarf i feel like i 'm more accepted in a positive sense .
it could be just a banal conversation with the cashier at the supermarket about the weather , but now non-muslims actually notice me and are n't afraid of contact , " she says .
strict social controls algan adds she has no plans to sell the headgear on a commercial basis , but wants to convince younger muslim girls and women to try it out and in doing so , sidestep a proposed ban on the islamic headscarf in state-run institutions in berlin .
she 's now started a women 's discussion group to that purpose .
" i 'm doing all this to just provide some ideas for muslim women , to provide them with an alternative - after all as far as islam goes , there are no rules dictating how we should dress .
we can wear what we want as long as we cover ourselves , " algan says .
but delivering the message is proving harder than expected .
" the reactions have been very reserved so far .
unfortunately , social controls are so strong in muslim society that even if the girls are interested , they do n't have the freedom to express themselves .
they 're worried about what their husbands and mothers-in-law will think , " algan says .
" this traditional thinking is still deeply-ingrained in muslims here though four generations of them now live here .

it is something upon which iraq can build , and from which it can draw strength .

finding takers is a problem . on a sunny winter morning , emel algan drives up in a black mini car to the office of her islamic women 's organization in berlin 's largely turkish kreuzberg district , her pixie-like face framed by a swath of striking pink fabric . indoors , algan -lrb- photo -rrb- does a quick fashion show as she exchanges her cleverly-woven bright hood cum scarf for a jaunty shaded green silk hat with an attached piece of fabric that buttons under the chin and flows to the chest and a floral patterned bandanna-like creation that gathers in at the back of the head .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emel algan " it looks so colorful and yet it 's just so practical , " algan says .
" it does away with the thousands of safety pins that you need for a conventional muslim headscarf and at the same time covers the throat , hair and ears , " she adds .
tradition and modernity the latter is important for 43-year-old algan , a religious muslim and mother of six , who has worn the traditional muslim hijab or headscarf since her childhood spent in small towns in germany .
in recent months , the muslim headscarf has been the subject of sometimes heated debate in germany about its place in society , and in particular in state-run institutions . algan herself incorporates a mixture of tradition and modernity .
she studied english language and literature at college and now heads a muslim women 's organization .
she began toying with fashionable alternatives to the conventional headscarf a year ago .
" i was unhappy with the widespread prejudices in germany against headscarf-wearing muslim women , prejudices like ' they 're dumb and servile . '
i had nothing to do with all that but i felt like i was being branded the same on account of my headscarf , " algan explains .
search for the neutral islamic headscarf the turmoil brought algan last year to the doorstep of milliner susanne gäbel , who runs a hat shop in the upscale charlottenburg neighborhood .
" i 'm no designer , all i knew is that i wanted something functional yet attractive that would n't look like the traditional headscarf , " algan says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emel algan gäbel says the request was an unusual one .
" i did n't have any experience with islamic headscarves , though i had done something traditional for jewish customers and for women who had undergone chemotherapy and wanted to cover their heads , " she says .
the search for the neutral , non-radical islamic headscarf has resulted in a series of nine innovative headscarf models in varying colors and materials .
some resemble charleston hats , others nordic felt caps , and they all meet the needs of those muslim women who interpret the koran as requiring they cover their hair , ears and throat .
" most of them are like ski caps or hoods with ear flaps that can be simply slipped over the head without needing any buttons or zips .
the fabric has to be elastic like jersey and felt , " gäbel explains .
the alternative headscarves start at € 50 and are custom-made for each individual .
a new person algan , who has now permanently swapped her conventional hijab for the alternative headscarf , says it 's made her feel like a different person .
" every morning when i get up i ask myself what i want to wear because i can now combine my wardrobe with my colorful headgear , " she says .
the change is n't just external either .
" with the new headscarf i feel like i 'm more accepted in a positive sense .
it could be just a banal conversation with the cashier at the supermarket about the weather , but now non-muslims actually notice me and are n't afraid of contact , " she says .
strict social controls algan adds she has no plans to sell the headgear on a commercial basis , but wants to convince younger muslim girls and women to try it out and in doing so , sidestep a proposed ban on the islamic headscarf in state-run institutions in berlin .
she 's now started a women 's discussion group to that purpose .
" i 'm doing all this to just provide some ideas for muslim women , to provide them with an alternative - after all as far as islam goes , there are no rules dictating how we should dress .
we can wear what we want as long as we cover ourselves , " algan says .
but delivering the message is proving harder than expected .
" the reactions have been very reserved so far .
unfortunately , social controls are so strong in muslim society that even if the girls are interested , they do n't have the freedom to express themselves .
they 're worried about what their husbands and mothers-in-law will think , " algan says .
" this traditional thinking is still deeply-ingrained in muslims here though four generations of them now live here . " sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de headscarf issue rears its head again the decisive thing is not what ’ s on the head , but what ’ s in it , ” says a group of prominent german women who have launched a campaign against the government ’ s headscarf ban for muslim teachers .

gerhard schröder is no stranger to taking on the press when its coverage of him does n't pass muster .
but now that he 's decided to give the nation 's best-selling tabloid the cold shoulder , journalists are fighting back . gerhard schröder 's latest tussle with the media bears an uncanny resemblance to a schoolyard brawl .
germany 's biggest-selling daily , bild zeitung , prints some critical stories about schröder 's economic and social reforms . the chancellor , nose clearly out of joint , responds by saying he 's no longer talking to bild .
his spokesman , bela anda - a former bild journalist himself - criticizes the paper 's reporting style , calling it " a mixture of malice , agitation and contempt for the politicians , garnished with half-truths . " following the accusations , made last week , the tabloid remained cool , saying the decision only made schröder 's government look bad .

its head , michael konken , wrote a letter to anda , accusing the government of being overly sensitive and high-handed .
the exclusion of journalists , he says , is " a blatant transgression against the freedom of the press and their duty to report information . " " the only party responsible for the current critical nature of reports in the media is the government 's unprofessional public relations department , which seems incapable of communicating the strategies of the politicians to the media and the people in this country , " konken wrote . media chancellor ? schröder 's decision to stop granting interviews to bild bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder 's government accuses " bild " of bias. did n't exactly come out of nowhere .

former chancellor helmut kohl , for example , refused to grant interviews to der spiegel , after accusing the news magazine of distorting its coverage of him . but schröder is germany 's self-proclaimed " media chancellor " - the man who once said that all he needed to govern were the tabloids and television .

germany 's ruling social democrats and opposition conservatives thrashed out the details of long-debated immigration legislation on monday .
though there 's no talk of a breakthrough , the two sides did make progress . after almost four years of turbulent negotiations , germany 's floundering immigration legislation received a slight boost on monday when a seven-member expert group drawn from the main political parties said it made some progress on finding common ground . german interior minister otto schily of the ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- spoke of an improvement .
" the objectives are n't that far apart anymore , " he said . peter müller of the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- added that the two sides had made progress in the controversial areas of labor-market migration and humanitarian immigration , though details were n't released . müller added they discussed further tricky issues such as the integration of foreigners already in germany as well as the situation of ethnic germans and security . security a sticking point the latter point in particular proved to be a contentious one during monday 's discussions .
the conservatives have been pushing for tighter security measures ever since the discovery that terrorists involved in the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the united states had lived and studied in germany for years and had hatched the plot during that time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily on monday , schily -lrb- photo -rrb- signaled his willingness to facilitate expulsion procedures in the draft law for immigrants suspected of terrorist activities .
" it goes without saying that we do n't want to tolerate immigrants who pose a threat to german security .
we agree that there must be clear provisions that govern the residential status and possible expulsion procedures for such persons , " schily said . gulf between spd and cdu positions the immigration issue has been plagued by the widely divergent positions of the ruling coalition , made up of the spd and the green party , and the opposition cdu and its bavarian sister party csu . while the spd and the greens are in favor of a law aimed at simplifying regulations governing residency permits and making it easier for highly-qualified foreigners to work and live in germany , the cdu / csu argues that in light of germany 's high unemployment rate it would be rash to open its gates to an influx of labor from abroad .
it claims the country has enough problems integrating the seven million foreigners already in the country . the issue first attracted attention when schröder launched a scheme in 2000 to give permits to up to 20,000 computer specialists from india and central europe to work in germany on five-year contracts .
it has been lent new urgency by statistics showing germany faces a demographic time bomb with an increasingly ageing population and declining birth rates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian software expert in addition , german business and industry experts have repeatedly warned that the country faces a severe crunch of scientists and engineers and that highly-qualified foreigners were badly needed in the fields .
immigration is also necessary , they say , for economic growth and the funding of germany 's generous welfare state . signs of compromise schröder 's government came close to sealing germany 's first-ever immigration law in 2002 but suffered a severe setback in december that year when germany 's highest court ruled that it was unconstitutional .
despite the lows , in recent weeks , both sides have loosened their entrenched positions and signaled a willingness to compromise . the spd and greens have agreed to give up demands for a point system , such as in canada or new zealand , that would have allowed immigrants access to the german labor market without proof of a concrete job .
instead , permission would have been based an immigrant 's qualifications , skills and german language knowledge . the ruling coalition insists , though , that a general ban on hiring foreigners from outside the eu , which took effect in 1973 after the massive immigration wave of the 1960s , should be lifted .
this demand is expected to be a major sticking point between the two sides . for its part , the cdu has hinted that it might make concessions to the greens on drawing up a more humanitarian asylum law . clock ticking experts believe if nothing else , time pressure will ensure that the two sides are forced to reach agreement on the immigration law .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asylum-seekers in frankfurt it 's not just germany 's own economic and labor problems that are demanding attention , but even brussels is pushing germany to clear its stance on asylum policies before may 1 to make way for the implementation of a common european policy on asylum protection before it takes in the 10 new eastern and southern european members . the parties will meet again on friday to continue negotiations on the immigration law . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany offers newcomers " how to " book the german government has released a handbook for immigrants aimed to serve as a guide through the labyrinth of german ways .

"
gerhard schröder is no stranger to taking on the press when its coverage of him does n't pass muster .
but now that he 's decided to give the nation 's best-selling tabloid the cold shoulder , journalists are fighting back . gerhard schröder 's latest tussle with the media bears an uncanny resemblance to a schoolyard brawl .
germany 's biggest-selling daily , bild zeitung , prints some critical stories about schröder 's economic and social reforms . the chancellor , nose clearly out of joint , responds by saying he 's no longer talking to bild .
his spokesman , bela anda - a former bild journalist himself - criticizes the paper 's reporting style , calling it " a mixture of malice , agitation and contempt for the politicians , garnished with half-truths . " following the accusations , made last week , the tabloid remained cool , saying the decision only made schröder 's government look bad .
then , several bild journalists accused the government of excluding them from accompanying the chancellor on trips .
anda denies any such boycott , and says if bild reporters have to stay home , it 's because of lack of space on schröder 's plane . reporters fight for their rights sensing that the weaker party is being bullied , the german journalists ' union , djv , stepped in on monday to flex some muscle .
its head , michael konken , wrote a letter to anda , accusing the government of being overly sensitive and high-handed .
the exclusion of journalists , he says , is " a blatant transgression against the freedom of the press and their duty to report information . " " the only party responsible for the current critical nature of reports in the media is the government 's unprofessional public relations department , which seems incapable of communicating the strategies of the politicians to the media and the people in this country , " konken wrote . media chancellor ? schröder 's decision to stop granting interviews to bild bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder 's government accuses " bild " of bias. did n't exactly come out of nowhere .
the chancellor has been disgruntled with the paper 's political coverage for weeks .

former chancellor helmut kohl , for example , refused to grant interviews to der spiegel , after accusing the news magazine of distorting its coverage of him . but schröder is germany 's self-proclaimed " media chancellor " - the man who once said that all he needed to govern were the tabloids and television .
as such , some would say he ought to know better .
this is n't the first time schröder has taken on the media for running unflattering stories about him .
but despite winning past battles , there 's a general sense that schröder is a bad sport . last year , the chancellor won a court order to stop speculation in the press about whether or not he dyed his hair -lrb- he does n't , by the way -rrb- . schröder 's lawyers also won an injunction against the british tabloid mail on sunday after it alleged that schröder 's fourth marriage was on the rocks . depending on how far schröder 's tiff with bild stretches , the tables could soon be turned .

"
gerhard schröder is no stranger to taking on the press when its coverage of him does n't pass muster .
but now that he 's decided to give the nation 's best-selling tabloid the cold shoulder , journalists are fighting back . gerhard schröder 's latest tussle with the media bears an uncanny resemblance to a schoolyard brawl .
germany 's biggest-selling daily , bild zeitung , prints some critical stories about schröder 's economic and social reforms . the chancellor , nose clearly out of joint , responds by saying he 's no longer talking to bild .
his spokesman , bela anda - a former bild journalist himself - criticizes the paper 's reporting style , calling it " a mixture of malice , agitation and contempt for the politicians , garnished with half-truths . " following the accusations , made last week , the tabloid remained cool , saying the decision only made schröder 's government look bad .
then , several bild journalists accused the government of excluding them from accompanying the chancellor on trips .
anda denies any such boycott , and says if bild reporters have to stay home , it 's because of lack of space on schröder 's plane . reporters fight for their rights sensing that the weaker party is being bullied , the german journalists ' union , djv , stepped in on monday to flex some muscle .
its head , michael konken , wrote a letter to anda , accusing the government of being overly sensitive and high-handed .
the exclusion of journalists , he says , is " a blatant transgression against the freedom of the press and their duty to report information . " " the only party responsible for the current critical nature of reports in the media is the government 's unprofessional public relations department , which seems incapable of communicating the strategies of the politicians to the media and the people in this country , " konken wrote . media chancellor ? schröder 's decision to stop granting interviews to bild bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder 's government accuses " bild " of bias. did n't exactly come out of nowhere .
the chancellor has been disgruntled with the paper 's political coverage for weeks .
last month , he requested his social democrat parliamentarians to show more restraint when speaking with bild reporters . nor is schröder 's move without precedence .
former chancellor helmut kohl , for example , refused to grant interviews to der spiegel , after accusing the news magazine of distorting its coverage of him . but schröder is germany 's self-proclaimed " media chancellor " - the man who once said that all he needed to govern were the tabloids and television .
as such , some would say he ought to know better .
this is n't the first time schröder has taken on the media for running unflattering stories about him .
but despite winning past battles , there 's a general sense that schröder is a bad sport . last year , the chancellor won a court order to stop speculation in the press about whether or not he dyed his hair -lrb- he does n't , by the way -rrb- . schröder 's lawyers also won an injunction against the british tabloid mail on sunday after it alleged that schröder 's fourth marriage was on the rocks . depending on how far schröder 's tiff with bild stretches , the tables could soon be turned .

the defense lawyer for imprisoned russian oil magnate mikhail khodorkovsky visited berlin on monday to raise awareness for the case , as his client allegedly stands no chance of receiving a fair trial . a fair trial is all that mikhail khodorkovsky wants , however , according to robert amsterdam , his canadian lawyer , khodorkovsky , the former ceo of yukos oil company , who has been charged with fraud and tax evasion , has rejected any offers by supporters to buy his freedom with yukos shares . " i have n't received any instructions but to take every legal action possible , " amsterdam said during a dw-world interview .
while he has not been able to see his client in private since his arrest last october , the lawyer said contact still existed . asked whether he believed the kremlin could reverse its attitude towards the case after the march 14 presidential elections , which putin is all but certain to win , amsterdam said he had no idea what would happen : " the one thing i 've learned about russia is : ' do n't even try to predict tomorrow because you do n't even understand yesterday . " ' a political decision ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mikhail khodorkovsky in prison last november .
a positive outcome for khodorkovsky -lrb- photo -rrb- would have to be sanctioned by the kremlin , amsterdam said .
he claimed moscow 's basmanny court , which is handling the case , was not independent in its decisions . " basmanny justice means no justice at all , " he said , adding that khodorkovsky 's potential release on bail after a march 25 hearing could only happen with the government 's approval .
" this will be a political decision , " amsterdam said , adding that resolution of the situation would take " many months . " in berlin to drum up foreign support for his client 's cause , amsterdam said germans had tremendous influence in russia and should stand up to demand a fair trial . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin -lrb- left -rrb- with german chancellor gerhard schröder at a meeting in moscow last year .

" and yet with putin there is a sensibility i ca n't even begin to describe . " testing the rule of law in russia he added that khodorkovsky was faced with the possibility of a conviction .
" i think he 's taking a terrible risk , but he 's a russian , " amsterdam said .
" he did n't want to leave when everyone told him to leave . " while adding that khodorkovsky saw his case as a test of the rule of law in russia , amsterdam said , " i don ’ t believe the rule of law is anywhere near this case . " amsterdam also refuted claims by some that khodorkovsky is a single case and not the sign of the kremlin 's crackdown on businesses in russia .
" these types of things are viral , " he said , pointing to monday 's announcement by russia 's interior ministry that international accounting firm deloitte and touche was accused of tax evasion . " there are no one-offs , " he said , adding that he believed others were vulnerable to similar prosecution as well . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans troubled by russian oil tycoon ’ s case berlin has asked vladimir putin to reassure russia ’ s biggest trading partner that it will apply rule of law in its case against yukos chairman mikhail khodorkovsky .

frank bsirske , the chairman of german trade union verdi , spoke out publicly against three of germany 's biggest discount retailers on monday and criticized their working conditions and perceived lack of employee rights . choosing international women 's day to launch his scathing criticism of the working practices of german discount supermarkets aldi and lidl and no-frills chemist chain schlecker , frank bsirske named and shamed those companies considered by his union to rule their empires with iron fists and a culture of fear , accusing them of using " intimidation as a commercial model . "
the timing of his outburst was carefully considered .
according to the verdi trade union boss about 100,000 german women work in the 10,500 schlecker shops , 3,500 aldis and 2,500 lidl branches nationwide , mostly in part-time positions and mostly in conditions unacceptable in this modern age .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verdi chief frank bsirske " the success of the discounters bathes in the sun , " said bsirske -lrb- photo -rrb- at a protest against working conditions outside a schlecker outlet in hanau on monday .
" but the terms of employment for the employee remains in shadow . "
accusing the discount giants of operating like the industrial tyrants of the 19th century , bsirske added that rate of pay contracts had been ignored , resulting in staff wages under the national average and hours of overtime that often go unpaid .
talk of unions met with threats those employees considering joining a union had been intimidated out of doing so , with many companies actively blocking any action by works committees throughout their branches , the verdi chairman declared .
" threats are not isolated cases in the climate of fear , " he said , calling the treatment of many workers " degrading . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : discounters command a 30 percent share of the german retail market but may find their control slipping if verdi carries out its threats to take action against those companies it sees as being the main offenders .
leading the union 's hit-list is lidl , the german supermarket sector 's second largest concern .
big names facing the " last resort " according to the union , lidl has refused every collaboration with verdi , completely banning trade unionists throughout its empire .
verdi has stated that , if lidl refuses to admit organized works committee elections in its establishments and assigned branches , the union will be forced to apply its " last resort . "
that could be a referral to the federal board of trade and a subsequent investigation .
a similar fate could await aldi whose southern division is also accused of suppressing union activity throughout its branches .
attempts to create committee initiatives for the rights of workers have been " strangled by massive pressure , " according to bsirske , even in central offices where the number of employees is much higher than on the shop floor .
employees under stress and suspicion however , while verdi is concerned about the lack of union representation in discount businesses , bsirske said that the state of employment conditions is worse than the massive impediment to works committee initiatives in all three named discounters .
lack of adequate numbers of staff , extended working hours and frequent loneliness in stores has caused stress and achievement pressure in many employees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to the union , some employees have also complained about frequent controls at the cash registers , about searches of handbags and lockers and about " house visits " by superiors after a staff member has called in sick or after a union engagement .
verdi also claims the price war between the discount chains is causing more and more pressure on their staff members with little or no extra reward for the increased workload and stress .
with verdi members currently picketing discount store branches and distributing leaflets to staff members , the war of words seems set to continue . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the american way of aldi a u.s. business magazine telling americans to “ buy german ? ”

employees under stress and suspicion however , while verdi is concerned about the lack of union representation in discount businesses , bsirske said that the state of employment conditions is worse than the massive impediment to works committee initiatives in all three named discounters .
lack of adequate numbers of staff , extended working hours and frequent loneliness in stores has caused stress and achievement pressure in many employees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to the union , some employees have also complained about frequent controls at the cash registers , about searches of handbags and lockers and about " house visits " by superiors after a staff member has called in sick or after a union engagement .
verdi also claims the price war between the discount chains is causing more and more pressure on their staff members with little or no extra reward for the increased workload and stress .

germany 's ruling social democrats and opposition conservatives thrashed out the details of long-debated immigration legislation on monday .
though there 's no talk of a breakthrough , the two sides did make progress . after almost four years of turbulent negotiations , germany 's floundering immigration legislation received a slight boost on monday when a seven-member expert group drawn from the main political parties said it made some progress on finding common ground . german interior minister otto schily of the ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- spoke of an improvement .
" the objectives are n't that far apart anymore , " he said . peter müller of the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- added that the two sides had made progress in the controversial areas of labor-market migration and humanitarian immigration , though details were n't released . müller added they discussed further tricky issues such as the integration of foreigners already in germany as well as the situation of ethnic germans and security . security a sticking point the latter point in particular proved to be a contentious one during monday 's discussions .
the conservatives have been pushing for tighter security measures ever since the discovery that terrorists involved in the sept .

" it goes without saying that we do n't want to tolerate immigrants who pose a threat to german security .
we agree that there must be clear provisions that govern the residential status and possible expulsion procedures for such persons , " schily said . gulf between spd and cdu positions the immigration issue has been plagued by the widely divergent positions of the ruling coalition , made up of the spd and the green party , and the opposition cdu and its bavarian sister party csu . while the spd and the greens are in favor of a law aimed at simplifying regulations governing residency permits and making it easier for highly-qualified foreigners to work and live in germany , the cdu / csu argues that in light of germany 's high unemployment rate it would be rash to open its gates to an influx of labor from abroad .
it claims the country has enough problems integrating the seven million foreigners already in the country . the issue first attracted attention when schröder launched a scheme in 2000 to give permits to up to 20,000 computer specialists from india and central europe to work in germany on five-year contracts .
it has been lent new urgency by statistics showing germany faces a demographic time bomb with an increasingly ageing population and declining birth rates .

immigration is also necessary , they say , for economic growth and the funding of germany 's generous welfare state . signs of compromise schröder 's government came close to sealing germany 's first-ever immigration law in 2002 but suffered a severe setback in december that year when germany 's highest court ruled that it was unconstitutional .
despite the lows , in recent weeks , both sides have loosened their entrenched positions and signaled a willingness to compromise . the spd and greens have agreed to give up demands for a point system , such as in canada or new zealand , that would have allowed immigrants access to the german labor market without proof of a concrete job .
instead , permission would have been based an immigrant 's qualifications , skills and german language knowledge . the ruling coalition insists , though , that a general ban on hiring foreigners from outside the eu , which took effect in 1973 after the massive immigration wave of the 1960s , should be lifted .
this demand is expected to be a major sticking point between the two sides . for its part , the cdu has hinted that it might make concessions to the greens on drawing up a more humanitarian asylum law . clock ticking experts believe if nothing else , time pressure will ensure that the two sides are forced to reach agreement on the immigration law .

frank bsirske , the chairman of german trade union verdi , spoke out publicly against three of germany 's biggest discount retailers on monday and criticized their working conditions and perceived lack of employee rights . choosing international women 's day to launch his scathing criticism of the working practices of german discount supermarkets aldi and lidl and no-frills chemist chain schlecker , frank bsirske named and shamed those companies considered by his union to rule their empires with iron fists and a culture of fear , accusing them of using " intimidation as a commercial model . "
the timing of his outburst was carefully considered .
according to the verdi trade union boss about 100,000 german women work in the 10,500 schlecker shops , 3,500 aldis and 2,500 lidl branches nationwide , mostly in part-time positions and mostly in conditions unacceptable in this modern age .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verdi chief frank bsirske " the success of the discounters bathes in the sun , " said bsirske -lrb- photo -rrb- at a protest against working conditions outside a schlecker outlet in hanau on monday .
" but the terms of employment for the employee remains in shadow . "
accusing the discount giants of operating like the industrial tyrants of the 19th century , bsirske added that rate of pay contracts had been ignored , resulting in staff wages under the national average and hours of overtime that often go unpaid .
talk of unions met with threats those employees considering joining a union had been intimidated out of doing so , with many companies actively blocking any action by works committees throughout their branches , the verdi chairman declared .
" threats are not isolated cases in the climate of fear , " he said , calling the treatment of many workers " degrading . "

big names facing the " last resort " according to the union , lidl has refused every collaboration with verdi , completely banning trade unionists throughout its empire .
verdi has stated that , if lidl refuses to admit organized works committee elections in its establishments and assigned branches , the union will be forced to apply its " last resort . "
that could be a referral to the federal board of trade and a subsequent investigation .

according to the verdi trade union boss about 100,000 german women work in the 10,500 schlecker shops , 3,500 aldis and 2,500 lidl branches nationwide , mostly in part-time positions and mostly in conditions unacceptable in this modern age .

" but the terms of employment for the employee remains in shadow . "
accusing the discount giants of operating like the industrial tyrants of the 19th century , bsirske added that rate of pay contracts had been ignored , resulting in staff wages under the national average and hours of overtime that often go unpaid .
talk of unions met with threats those employees considering joining a union had been intimidated out of doing so , with many companies actively blocking any action by works committees throughout their branches , the verdi chairman declared .
" threats are not isolated cases in the climate of fear , " he said , calling the treatment of many workers " degrading . "

that could be a referral to the federal board of trade and a subsequent investigation .
a similar fate could await aldi whose southern division is also accused of suppressing union activity throughout its branches .
attempts to create committee initiatives for the rights of workers have been " strangled by massive pressure , " according to bsirske , even in central offices where the number of employees is much higher than on the shop floor .

frank bsirske , the chairman of german trade union verdi , spoke out publicly against three of germany 's biggest discount retailers on monday and criticized their working conditions and perceived lack of employee rights . choosing international women 's day to launch his scathing criticism of the working practices of german discount supermarkets aldi and lidl and no-frills chemist chain schlecker , frank bsirske named and shamed those companies considered by his union to rule their empires with iron fists and a culture of fear , accusing them of using " intimidation as a commercial model .

finding takers is a problem . on a sunny winter morning , emel algan drives up in a black mini car to the office of her islamic women 's organization in berlin 's largely turkish kreuzberg district , her pixie-like face framed by a swath of striking pink fabric . indoors , algan -lrb- photo -rrb- does a quick fashion show as she exchanges her cleverly-woven bright hood cum scarf for a jaunty shaded green silk hat with an attached piece of fabric that buttons under the chin and flows to the chest and a floral patterned bandanna-like creation that gathers in at the back of the head .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emel algan " it looks so colorful and yet it 's just so practical , " algan says .
" it does away with the thousands of safety pins that you need for a conventional muslim headscarf and at the same time covers the throat , hair and ears , " she adds .
tradition and modernity the latter is important for 43-year-old algan , a religious muslim and mother of six , who has worn the traditional muslim hijab or headscarf since her childhood spent in small towns in germany .
in recent months , the muslim headscarf has been the subject of sometimes heated debate in germany about its place in society , and in particular in state-run institutions . algan herself incorporates a mixture of tradition and modernity .
she studied english language and literature at college and now heads a muslim women 's organization .
she began toying with fashionable alternatives to the conventional headscarf a year ago .
" i was unhappy with the widespread prejudices in germany against headscarf-wearing muslim women , prejudices like ' they 're dumb and servile . '
i had nothing to do with all that but i felt like i was being branded the same on account of my headscarf , " algan explains .
search for the neutral islamic headscarf the turmoil brought algan last year to the doorstep of milliner susanne gäbel , who runs a hat shop in the upscale charlottenburg neighborhood .
" i 'm no designer , all i knew is that i wanted something functional yet attractive that would n't look like the traditional headscarf , " algan says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emel algan gäbel says the request was an unusual one .
" i did n't have any experience with islamic headscarves , though i had done something traditional for jewish customers and for women who had undergone chemotherapy and wanted to cover their heads , " she says .
the search for the neutral , non-radical islamic headscarf has resulted in a series of nine innovative headscarf models in varying colors and materials .
some resemble charleston hats , others nordic felt caps , and they all meet the needs of those muslim women who interpret the koran as requiring they cover their hair , ears and throat .
" most of them are like ski caps or hoods with ear flaps that can be simply slipped over the head without needing any buttons or zips .
the fabric has to be elastic like jersey and felt , " gäbel explains .
the alternative headscarves start at € 50 and are custom-made for each individual .
a new person algan , who has now permanently swapped her conventional hijab for the alternative headscarf , says it 's made her feel like a different person .
" every morning when i get up i ask myself what i want to wear because i can now combine my wardrobe with my colorful headgear , " she says .
the change is n't just external either .
" with the new headscarf i feel like i 'm more accepted in a positive sense .
it could be just a banal conversation with the cashier at the supermarket about the weather , but now non-muslims actually notice me and are n't afraid of contact , " she says .
strict social controls algan adds she has no plans to sell the headgear on a commercial basis , but wants to convince younger muslim girls and women to try it out and in doing so , sidestep a proposed ban on the islamic headscarf in state-run institutions in berlin .
she 's now started a women 's discussion group to that purpose .
" i 'm doing all this to just provide some ideas for muslim women , to provide them with an alternative - after all as far as islam goes , there are no rules dictating how we should dress .
we can wear what we want as long as we cover ourselves , " algan says .
but delivering the message is proving harder than expected .
" the reactions have been very reserved so far .
unfortunately , social controls are so strong in muslim society that even if the girls are interested , they do n't have the freedom to express themselves .
they 're worried about what their husbands and mothers-in-law will think , " algan says .

finding takers is a problem . on a sunny winter morning , emel algan drives up in a black mini car to the office of her islamic women 's organization in berlin 's largely turkish kreuzberg district , her pixie-like face framed by a swath of striking pink fabric . indoors , algan -lrb- photo -rrb- does a quick fashion show as she exchanges her cleverly-woven bright hood cum scarf for a jaunty shaded green silk hat with an attached piece of fabric that buttons under the chin and flows to the chest and a floral patterned bandanna-like creation that gathers in at the back of the head .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emel algan " it looks so colorful and yet it 's just so practical , " algan says .
" it does away with the thousands of safety pins that you need for a conventional muslim headscarf and at the same time covers the throat , hair and ears , " she adds .
tradition and modernity the latter is important for 43-year-old algan , a religious muslim and mother of six , who has worn the traditional muslim hijab or headscarf since her childhood spent in small towns in germany .
in recent months , the muslim headscarf has been the subject of sometimes heated debate in germany about its place in society , and in particular in state-run institutions . algan herself incorporates a mixture of tradition and modernity .
she studied english language and literature at college and now heads a muslim women 's organization .
she began toying with fashionable alternatives to the conventional headscarf a year ago .
" i was unhappy with the widespread prejudices in germany against headscarf-wearing muslim women , prejudices like ' they 're dumb and servile . '
i had nothing to do with all that but i felt like i was being branded the same on account of my headscarf , " algan explains .
search for the neutral islamic headscarf the turmoil brought algan last year to the doorstep of milliner susanne gäbel , who runs a hat shop in the upscale charlottenburg neighborhood .
" i 'm no designer , all i knew is that i wanted something functional yet attractive that would n't look like the traditional headscarf , " algan says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emel algan gäbel says the request was an unusual one .
" i did n't have any experience with islamic headscarves , though i had done something traditional for jewish customers and for women who had undergone chemotherapy and wanted to cover their heads , " she says .
the search for the neutral , non-radical islamic headscarf has resulted in a series of nine innovative headscarf models in varying colors and materials .
some resemble charleston hats , others nordic felt caps , and they all meet the needs of those muslim women who interpret the koran as requiring they cover their hair , ears and throat .
" most of them are like ski caps or hoods with ear flaps that can be simply slipped over the head without needing any buttons or zips .
the fabric has to be elastic like jersey and felt , " gäbel explains .
the alternative headscarves start at € 50 and are custom-made for each individual .
a new person algan , who has now permanently swapped her conventional hijab for the alternative headscarf , says it 's made her feel like a different person .
" every morning when i get up i ask myself what i want to wear because i can now combine my wardrobe with my colorful headgear , " she says .
the change is n't just external either .
" with the new headscarf i feel like i 'm more accepted in a positive sense .
it could be just a banal conversation with the cashier at the supermarket about the weather , but now non-muslims actually notice me and are n't afraid of contact , " she says .

germany 's ruling social democrats and opposition conservatives thrashed out the details of long-debated immigration legislation on monday .
though there 's no talk of a breakthrough , the two sides did make progress . after almost four years of turbulent negotiations , germany 's floundering immigration legislation received a slight boost on monday when a seven-member expert group drawn from the main political parties said it made some progress on finding common ground . german interior minister otto schily of the ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- spoke of an improvement .
" the objectives are n't that far apart anymore , " he said . peter müller of the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- added that the two sides had made progress in the controversial areas of labor-market migration and humanitarian immigration , though details were n't released . müller added they discussed further tricky issues such as the integration of foreigners already in germany as well as the situation of ethnic germans and security . security a sticking point the latter point in particular proved to be a contentious one during monday 's discussions .
the conservatives have been pushing for tighter security measures ever since the discovery that terrorists involved in the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the united states had lived and studied in germany for years and had hatched the plot during that time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily on monday , schily -lrb- photo -rrb- signaled his willingness to facilitate expulsion procedures in the draft law for immigrants suspected of terrorist activities .
" it goes without saying that we do n't want to tolerate immigrants who pose a threat to german security .
we agree that there must be clear provisions that govern the residential status and possible expulsion procedures for such persons , " schily said . gulf between spd and cdu positions the immigration issue has been plagued by the widely divergent positions of the ruling coalition , made up of the spd and the green party , and the opposition cdu and its bavarian sister party csu . while the spd and the greens are in favor of a law aimed at simplifying regulations governing residency permits and making it easier for highly-qualified foreigners to work and live in germany , the cdu / csu argues that in light of germany 's high unemployment rate it would be rash to open its gates to an influx of labor from abroad .
it claims the country has enough problems integrating the seven million foreigners already in the country . the issue first attracted attention when schröder launched a scheme in 2000 to give permits to up to 20,000 computer specialists from india and central europe to work in germany on five-year contracts .
it has been lent new urgency by statistics showing germany faces a demographic time bomb with an increasingly ageing population and declining birth rates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian software expert in addition , german business and industry experts have repeatedly warned that the country faces a severe crunch of scientists and engineers and that highly-qualified foreigners were badly needed in the fields .
immigration is also necessary , they say , for economic growth and the funding of germany 's generous welfare state . signs of compromise schröder 's government came close to sealing germany 's first-ever immigration law in 2002 but suffered a severe setback in december that year when germany 's highest court ruled that it was unconstitutional .
despite the lows , in recent weeks , both sides have loosened their entrenched positions and signaled a willingness to compromise . the spd and greens have agreed to give up demands for a point system , such as in canada or new zealand , that would have allowed immigrants access to the german labor market without proof of a concrete job .
instead , permission would have been based an immigrant 's qualifications , skills and german language knowledge . the ruling coalition insists , though , that a general ban on hiring foreigners from outside the eu , which took effect in 1973 after the massive immigration wave of the 1960s , should be lifted .
this demand is expected to be a major sticking point between the two sides . for its part , the cdu has hinted that it might make concessions to the greens on drawing up a more humanitarian asylum law . clock ticking experts believe if nothing else , time pressure will ensure that the two sides are forced to reach agreement on the immigration law .

" the eu has taken a series of very important decisions : deciding to reunify europe , reform our institutions , launch the euro , aim to become the most competitive economy in the world , organize a system of defense and justice .
and moreover , all of this has broken down .
in these areas , europe is even going backwards ! "
the spanish leader asserted , " it has been a long time since the european leaders discussed these matters in depth .
recently , we hardly talk about anything . "
after he steps down as spain 's premier following elections on sunday , aznar said he hoped " europe would find again its ability to seal deals , that it will rediscover leadership and that certain decisions will finally be taken . "
the statesman insisted , " we can not complain every day about the american system and have slower growth , be less flexible , less competitive and create fewer jobs than them .
let 's stop complaining and let 's do better . "
still , he pronounced the eu is " a great success " and warned that " contrary to certain ideas , what is good for europe is not necessarily rooted in opposition to the united states . "

after he steps down as spain 's premier following elections on sunday , aznar said he hoped " europe would find again its ability to seal deals , that it will rediscover leadership and that certain decisions will finally be taken . "
the statesman insisted , " we can not complain every day about the american system and have slower growth , be less flexible , less competitive and create fewer jobs than them .
let 's stop complaining and let 's do better . "

berlin signaled it was prepared to consider a new voting proposal floated by the eu 's irish presidency that would reduce the power of big member states to block eu initiatives and increase the clout of smaller member states , thus making it easier to reach decisions .
berlin 's initiative is also expected to prod other key members - notably spain and poland - to move from their entrenched positions .
talks on a new eu constitution collapsed amid acrimony last december mainly over the question of new voting arrangements in the council of ministers once the eu enlarges to 25 members .
rainder steenblock , european affairs spokesman of the green party , the junior member of germany 's ruling coalition told financial times , " we can not hope to persuade spain and poland to accept this constitution if we are completely inflexible .

berlin signaled it was prepared to consider a new voting proposal floated by the eu 's irish presidency that would reduce the power of big member states to block eu initiatives and increase the clout of smaller member states , thus making it easier to reach decisions .
berlin 's initiative is also expected to prod other key members - notably spain and poland - to move from their entrenched positions .
talks on a new eu constitution collapsed amid acrimony last december mainly over the question of new voting arrangements in the council of ministers once the eu enlarges to 25 members .

speaking in duesseldorf this week , the president of the association of german retailers -lrb- hde -rrb- hermann franzen , said that 50,000 jobs had been slashed in the retail branch in 2003 , and 35,000 traders had either gone bust or thrown in the towel .
he said it was the first time since the end of wwii that the sector had suffered such radical job cuts , adding that the hde was expecting a further 30,000 retail job losses through the course of this year .
he attributes the trend to continued reluctance among consumers to spend their money , and the ruinous battle to offer rock-bottom prices .
that said , the hde believes this year will see turnover stabilizing , paving the way for growth next year . more briefs 09.03.2004 -pipe- fate of bayer division to be decided 09.03.2004 -pipe- daimlerchrysler admits road toll system mistakes 08.03.2004 -pipe- eads returns to profit 08.03.2004 -pipe- volkswagen denies plans for hiring freeze 08.03.2004 -pipe- heidelberger to sell printing units to kodak 05.03.2004 -pipe- tax cuts leave germans cold 05.03.2004 -pipe- industry calls for tax reductions 05.03.2004 -pipe- chancellor defends apprenticeship penalty plan radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

one of the members of the six-member board , eugenio domingo solans from spain is due to step down at the end of may , and the appointment of his successor has become politically charged .
italy , germany and france are backing another spaniard for the job - jose manuel gonzalez-paramo - even though candidates from ireland and belgium have been put forward and a treaty requires the post to rotate to another state .
in backing gonzalez-paramo , the big countries are hoping to enshrine the principle that a big country should always have a seat on the board .
the appointment is significant because member states with a representative on the executive board have two votes on how interest rates in the 12-country euro-zone develop .
the president of the ecb , jean-claude trichet said in a press conference last week that the " professional qualifications " of the candidate would be the only criterion taken into account but political wrangling is expected to take over .
euro-zone finance ministers have decided to postpone the appointment until the he spring summit , which begins on march 25 .

one of the members of the six-member board , eugenio domingo solans from spain is due to step down at the end of may , and the appointment of his successor has become politically charged .
italy , germany and france are backing another spaniard for the job - jose manuel gonzalez-paramo - even though candidates from ireland and belgium have been put forward and a treaty requires the post to rotate to another state .
in backing gonzalez-paramo , the big countries are hoping to enshrine the principle that a big country should always have a seat on the board .
the appointment is significant because member states with a representative on the executive board have two votes on how interest rates in the 12-country euro-zone develop .
the president of the ecb , jean-claude trichet said in a press conference last week that the " professional qualifications " of the candidate would be the only criterion taken into account but political wrangling is expected to take over .
euro-zone finance ministers have decided to postpone the appointment until the he spring summit , which begins on march 25 .

"
gerhard schröder is no stranger to taking on the press when its coverage of him does n't pass muster .
but now that he 's decided to give the nation 's best-selling tabloid the cold shoulder , journalists are fighting back . gerhard schröder 's latest tussle with the media bears an uncanny resemblance to a schoolyard brawl .
germany 's biggest-selling daily , bild zeitung , prints some critical stories about schröder 's economic and social reforms . the chancellor , nose clearly out of joint , responds by saying he 's no longer talking to bild .
his spokesman , bela anda - a former bild journalist himself - criticizes the paper 's reporting style , calling it " a mixture of malice , agitation and contempt for the politicians , garnished with half-truths . " following the accusations , made last week , the tabloid remained cool , saying the decision only made schröder 's government look bad .
then , several bild journalists accused the government of excluding them from accompanying the chancellor on trips .
anda denies any such boycott , and says if bild reporters have to stay home , it 's because of lack of space on schröder 's plane . reporters fight for their rights sensing that the weaker party is being bullied , the german journalists ' union , djv , stepped in on monday to flex some muscle .
its head , michael konken , wrote a letter to anda , accusing the government of being overly sensitive and high-handed .
the exclusion of journalists , he says , is " a blatant transgression against the freedom of the press and their duty to report information . " " the only party responsible for the current critical nature of reports in the media is the government 's unprofessional public relations department , which seems incapable of communicating the strategies of the politicians to the media and the people in this country , " konken wrote . media chancellor ? schröder 's decision to stop granting interviews to bild bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder 's government accuses " bild " of bias. did n't exactly come out of nowhere .
the chancellor has been disgruntled with the paper 's political coverage for weeks .
last month , he requested his social democrat parliamentarians to show more restraint when speaking with bild reporters . nor is schröder 's move without precedence .
former chancellor helmut kohl , for example , refused to grant interviews to der spiegel , after accusing the news magazine of distorting its coverage of him . but schröder is germany 's self-proclaimed " media chancellor " - the man who once said that all he needed to govern were the tabloids and television .
as such , some would say he ought to know better .
this is n't the first time schröder has taken on the media for running unflattering stories about him .

gerhard schröder is no stranger to taking on the press when its coverage of him does n't pass muster .
but now that he 's decided to give the nation 's best-selling tabloid the cold shoulder , journalists are fighting back . gerhard schröder 's latest tussle with the media bears an uncanny resemblance to a schoolyard brawl .
germany 's biggest-selling daily , bild zeitung , prints some critical stories about schröder 's economic and social reforms . the chancellor , nose clearly out of joint , responds by saying he 's no longer talking to bild .
his spokesman , bela anda - a former bild journalist himself - criticizes the paper 's reporting style , calling it " a mixture of malice , agitation and contempt for the politicians , garnished with half-truths . " following the accusations , made last week , the tabloid remained cool , saying the decision only made schröder 's government look bad .
then , several bild journalists accused the government of excluding them from accompanying the chancellor on trips .
anda denies any such boycott , and says if bild reporters have to stay home , it 's because of lack of space on schröder 's plane . reporters fight for their rights sensing that the weaker party is being bullied , the german journalists ' union , djv , stepped in on monday to flex some muscle .
its head , michael konken , wrote a letter to anda , accusing the government of being overly sensitive and high-handed .
the exclusion of journalists , he says , is " a blatant transgression against the freedom of the press and their duty to report information . " " the only party responsible for the current critical nature of reports in the media is the government 's unprofessional public relations department , which seems incapable of communicating the strategies of the politicians to the media and the people in this country , " konken wrote . media chancellor ? schröder 's decision to stop granting interviews to bild bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder 's government accuses " bild " of bias. did n't exactly come out of nowhere .

"
gerhard schröder is no stranger to taking on the press when its coverage of him does n't pass muster .
but now that he 's decided to give the nation 's best-selling tabloid the cold shoulder , journalists are fighting back . gerhard schröder 's latest tussle with the media bears an uncanny resemblance to a schoolyard brawl .
germany 's biggest-selling daily , bild zeitung , prints some critical stories about schröder 's economic and social reforms . the chancellor , nose clearly out of joint , responds by saying he 's no longer talking to bild .
his spokesman , bela anda - a former bild journalist himself - criticizes the paper 's reporting style , calling it " a mixture of malice , agitation and contempt for the politicians , garnished with half-truths . " following the accusations , made last week , the tabloid remained cool , saying the decision only made schröder 's government look bad .
then , several bild journalists accused the government of excluding them from accompanying the chancellor on trips .
anda denies any such boycott , and says if bild reporters have to stay home , it 's because of lack of space on schröder 's plane . reporters fight for their rights sensing that the weaker party is being bullied , the german journalists ' union , djv , stepped in on monday to flex some muscle .
its head , michael konken , wrote a letter to anda , accusing the government of being overly sensitive and high-handed .
the exclusion of journalists , he says , is " a blatant transgression against the freedom of the press and their duty to report information . " " the only party responsible for the current critical nature of reports in the media is the government 's unprofessional public relations department , which seems incapable of communicating the strategies of the politicians to the media and the people in this country , " konken wrote . media chancellor ? schröder 's decision to stop granting interviews to bild bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder 's government accuses " bild " of bias. did n't exactly come out of nowhere .
the chancellor has been disgruntled with the paper 's political coverage for weeks .
last month , he requested his social democrat parliamentarians to show more restraint when speaking with bild reporters . nor is schröder 's move without precedence .
former chancellor helmut kohl , for example , refused to grant interviews to der spiegel , after accusing the news magazine of distorting its coverage of him . but schröder is germany 's self-proclaimed " media chancellor " - the man who once said that all he needed to govern were the tabloids and television .
as such , some would say he ought to know better .
this is n't the first time schröder has taken on the media for running unflattering stories about him .
but despite winning past battles , there 's a general sense that schröder is a bad sport . last year , the chancellor won a court order to stop speculation in the press about whether or not he dyed his hair -lrb- he does n't , by the way -rrb- . schröder 's lawyers also won an injunction against the british tabloid mail on sunday after it alleged that schröder 's fourth marriage was on the rocks . depending on how far schröder 's tiff with bild stretches , the tables could soon be turned .

" the eu has taken a series of very important decisions : deciding to reunify europe , reform our institutions , launch the euro , aim to become the most competitive economy in the world , organize a system of defense and justice .
and moreover , all of this has broken down .
in these areas , europe is even going backwards ! "
the spanish leader asserted , " it has been a long time since the european leaders discussed these matters in depth .
recently , we hardly talk about anything . "
after he steps down as spain 's premier following elections on sunday , aznar said he hoped " europe would find again its ability to seal deals , that it will rediscover leadership and that certain decisions will finally be taken . "
the statesman insisted , " we can not complain every day about the american system and have slower growth , be less flexible , less competitive and create fewer jobs than them .
let 's stop complaining and let 's do better . "
still , he pronounced the eu is " a great success " and warned that " contrary to certain ideas , what is good for europe is not necessarily rooted in opposition to the united states . "

and moreover , all of this has broken down .
in these areas , europe is even going backwards ! "
the spanish leader asserted , " it has been a long time since the european leaders discussed these matters in depth .
recently , we hardly talk about anything . "
after he steps down as spain 's premier following elections on sunday , aznar said he hoped " europe would find again its ability to seal deals , that it will rediscover leadership and that certain decisions will finally be taken . "
the statesman insisted , " we can not complain every day about the american system and have slower growth , be less flexible , less competitive and create fewer jobs than them .
let 's stop complaining and let 's do better . "
still , he pronounced the eu is " a great success " and warned that " contrary to certain ideas , what is good for europe is not necessarily rooted in opposition to the united states . "

finding takers is a problem . on a sunny winter morning , emel algan drives up in a black mini car to the office of her islamic women 's organization in berlin 's largely turkish kreuzberg district , her pixie-like face framed by a swath of striking pink fabric . indoors , algan -lrb- photo -rrb- does a quick fashion show as she exchanges her cleverly-woven bright hood cum scarf for a jaunty shaded green silk hat with an attached piece of fabric that buttons under the chin and flows to the chest and a floral patterned bandanna-like creation that gathers in at the back of the head .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emel algan " it looks so colorful and yet it 's just so practical , " algan says .
" it does away with the thousands of safety pins that you need for a conventional muslim headscarf and at the same time covers the throat , hair and ears , " she adds .
tradition and modernity the latter is important for 43-year-old algan , a religious muslim and mother of six , who has worn the traditional muslim hijab or headscarf since her childhood spent in small towns in germany .
in recent months , the muslim headscarf has been the subject of sometimes heated debate in germany about its place in society , and in particular in state-run institutions . algan herself incorporates a mixture of tradition and modernity .
she studied english language and literature at college and now heads a muslim women 's organization .
she began toying with fashionable alternatives to the conventional headscarf a year ago .
" i was unhappy with the widespread prejudices in germany against headscarf-wearing muslim women , prejudices like ' they 're dumb and servile . '
i had nothing to do with all that but i felt like i was being branded the same on account of my headscarf , " algan explains .
search for the neutral islamic headscarf the turmoil brought algan last year to the doorstep of milliner susanne gäbel , who runs a hat shop in the upscale charlottenburg neighborhood .
" i 'm no designer , all i knew is that i wanted something functional yet attractive that would n't look like the traditional headscarf , " algan says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emel algan gäbel says the request was an unusual one .
" i did n't have any experience with islamic headscarves , though i had done something traditional for jewish customers and for women who had undergone chemotherapy and wanted to cover their heads , " she says .
the search for the neutral , non-radical islamic headscarf has resulted in a series of nine innovative headscarf models in varying colors and materials .
some resemble charleston hats , others nordic felt caps , and they all meet the needs of those muslim women who interpret the koran as requiring they cover their hair , ears and throat .
" most of them are like ski caps or hoods with ear flaps that can be simply slipped over the head without needing any buttons or zips .
the fabric has to be elastic like jersey and felt , " gäbel explains .
the alternative headscarves start at € 50 and are custom-made for each individual .
a new person algan , who has now permanently swapped her conventional hijab for the alternative headscarf , says it 's made her feel like a different person .
" every morning when i get up i ask myself what i want to wear because i can now combine my wardrobe with my colorful headgear , " she says .
the change is n't just external either .
" with the new headscarf i feel like i 'm more accepted in a positive sense .
it could be just a banal conversation with the cashier at the supermarket about the weather , but now non-muslims actually notice me and are n't afraid of contact , " she says .
strict social controls algan adds she has no plans to sell the headgear on a commercial basis , but wants to convince younger muslim girls and women to try it out and in doing so , sidestep a proposed ban on the islamic headscarf in state-run institutions in berlin .
she 's now started a women 's discussion group to that purpose .
" i 'm doing all this to just provide some ideas for muslim women , to provide them with an alternative - after all as far as islam goes , there are no rules dictating how we should dress .
we can wear what we want as long as we cover ourselves , " algan says .
but delivering the message is proving harder than expected .
" the reactions have been very reserved so far .
unfortunately , social controls are so strong in muslim society that even if the girls are interested , they do n't have the freedom to express themselves .
they 're worried about what their husbands and mothers-in-law will think , " algan says .

the original date for the referendums , april 21 , would mark the 37th anniversary of the overthrow of democracy in greece by a military junta , an event that could be considered to have set off the cyprus conflict .
the military coup in athens prompted turkey to invade the north of cyprus in 1974 .
the un hopes the referendum date will act as a deadline , pressing the two sides to reach agreement before cyprus is due to enter the eu on may 1 .
cypriots from the turkish and greek communities are locked in negotiations to reunify the island .
so far progress has been slow and popular support for any deal is not assured .
the talks are set to continue until a march 22 , when the turkish and greek government expected to join the discussions .
a week later un secretary general kofi annan is scheduled to start " filling in the blanks " of the agreement .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 09.03.2004 trade union boss reproaches " oppressive " discount stores großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : discount supermarkets lidl and aldi are among those accused of compromising their workers rights .
frank bsirske , the chairman of german trade union verdi , spoke out publicly against three of germany 's biggest discount retailers on monday and criticized their working conditions and perceived lack of employee rights . choosing international women 's day to launch his scathing criticism of the working practices of german discount supermarkets aldi and lidl and no-frills chemist chain schlecker , frank bsirske named and shamed those companies considered by his union to rule their empires with iron fists and a culture of fear , accusing them of using " intimidation as a commercial model . "
the timing of his outburst was carefully considered .
according to the verdi trade union boss about 100,000 german women work in the 10,500 schlecker shops , 3,500 aldis and 2,500 lidl branches nationwide , mostly in part-time positions and mostly in conditions unacceptable in this modern age .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verdi chief frank bsirske " the success of the discounters bathes in the sun , " said bsirske -lrb- photo -rrb- at a protest against working conditions outside a schlecker outlet in hanau on monday .
" but the terms of employment for the employee remains in shadow . "
accusing the discount giants of operating like the industrial tyrants of the 19th century , bsirske added that rate of pay contracts had been ignored , resulting in staff wages under the national average and hours of overtime that often go unpaid .

frank bsirske , the chairman of german trade union verdi , spoke out publicly against three of germany 's biggest discount retailers on monday and criticized their working conditions and perceived lack of employee rights . choosing international women 's day to launch his scathing criticism of the working practices of german discount supermarkets aldi and lidl and no-frills chemist chain schlecker , frank bsirske named and shamed those companies considered by his union to rule their empires with iron fists and a culture of fear , accusing them of using " intimidation as a commercial model . "
the timing of his outburst was carefully considered .
according to the verdi trade union boss about 100,000 german women work in the 10,500 schlecker shops , 3,500 aldis and 2,500 lidl branches nationwide , mostly in part-time positions and mostly in conditions unacceptable in this modern age .

" but the terms of employment for the employee remains in shadow . "
accusing the discount giants of operating like the industrial tyrants of the 19th century , bsirske added that rate of pay contracts had been ignored , resulting in staff wages under the national average and hours of overtime that often go unpaid .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 09.03.2004 trade union boss reproaches " oppressive " discount stores großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : discount supermarkets lidl and aldi are among those accused of compromising their workers rights .
frank bsirske , the chairman of german trade union verdi , spoke out publicly against three of germany 's biggest discount retailers on monday and criticized their working conditions and perceived lack of employee rights . choosing international women 's day to launch his scathing criticism of the working practices of german discount supermarkets aldi and lidl and no-frills chemist chain schlecker , frank bsirske named and shamed those companies considered by his union to rule their empires with iron fists and a culture of fear , accusing them of using " intimidation as a commercial model . "
the timing of his outburst was carefully considered .
according to the verdi trade union boss about 100,000 german women work in the 10,500 schlecker shops , 3,500 aldis and 2,500 lidl branches nationwide , mostly in part-time positions and mostly in conditions unacceptable in this modern age .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verdi chief frank bsirske " the success of the discounters bathes in the sun , " said bsirske -lrb- photo -rrb- at a protest against working conditions outside a schlecker outlet in hanau on monday .
" but the terms of employment for the employee remains in shadow . "
accusing the discount giants of operating like the industrial tyrants of the 19th century , bsirske added that rate of pay contracts had been ignored , resulting in staff wages under the national average and hours of overtime that often go unpaid .
talk of unions met with threats those employees considering joining a union had been intimidated out of doing so , with many companies actively blocking any action by works committees throughout their branches , the verdi chairman declared .
" threats are not isolated cases in the climate of fear , " he said , calling the treatment of many workers " degrading . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : discounters command a 30 percent share of the german retail market but may find their control slipping if verdi carries out its threats to take action against those companies it sees as being the main offenders .
leading the union 's hit-list is lidl , the german supermarket sector 's second largest concern .
big names facing the " last resort " according to the union , lidl has refused every collaboration with verdi , completely banning trade unionists throughout its empire .
verdi has stated that , if lidl refuses to admit organized works committee elections in its establishments and assigned branches , the union will be forced to apply its " last resort . "
that could be a referral to the federal board of trade and a subsequent investigation .
a similar fate could await aldi whose southern division is also accused of suppressing union activity throughout its branches .
attempts to create committee initiatives for the rights of workers have been " strangled by massive pressure , " according to bsirske , even in central offices where the number of employees is much higher than on the shop floor .
employees under stress and suspicion however , while verdi is concerned about the lack of union representation in discount businesses , bsirske said that the state of employment conditions is worse than the massive impediment to works committee initiatives in all three named discounters .
lack of adequate numbers of staff , extended working hours and frequent loneliness in stores has caused stress and achievement pressure in many employees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to the union , some employees have also complained about frequent controls at the cash registers , about searches of handbags and lockers and about " house visits " by superiors after a staff member has called in sick or after a union engagement .
verdi also claims the price war between the discount chains is causing more and more pressure on their staff members with little or no extra reward for the increased workload and stress .
with verdi members currently picketing discount store branches and distributing leaflets to staff members , the war of words seems set to continue . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the american way of aldi a u.s. business magazine telling americans to “ buy german ? ”

the timing of his outburst was carefully considered .
according to the verdi trade union boss about 100,000 german women work in the 10,500 schlecker shops , 3,500 aldis and 2,500 lidl branches nationwide , mostly in part-time positions and mostly in conditions unacceptable in this modern age .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verdi chief frank bsirske " the success of the discounters bathes in the sun , " said bsirske -lrb- photo -rrb- at a protest against working conditions outside a schlecker outlet in hanau on monday .
" but the terms of employment for the employee remains in shadow . "
accusing the discount giants of operating like the industrial tyrants of the 19th century , bsirske added that rate of pay contracts had been ignored , resulting in staff wages under the national average and hours of overtime that often go unpaid .
talk of unions met with threats those employees considering joining a union had been intimidated out of doing so , with many companies actively blocking any action by works committees throughout their branches , the verdi chairman declared .
" threats are not isolated cases in the climate of fear , " he said , calling the treatment of many workers " degrading . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : discounters command a 30 percent share of the german retail market but may find their control slipping if verdi carries out its threats to take action against those companies it sees as being the main offenders .
leading the union 's hit-list is lidl , the german supermarket sector 's second largest concern .
big names facing the " last resort " according to the union , lidl has refused every collaboration with verdi , completely banning trade unionists throughout its empire .
verdi has stated that , if lidl refuses to admit organized works committee elections in its establishments and assigned branches , the union will be forced to apply its " last resort . "
that could be a referral to the federal board of trade and a subsequent investigation .
a similar fate could await aldi whose southern division is also accused of suppressing union activity throughout its branches .
attempts to create committee initiatives for the rights of workers have been " strangled by massive pressure , " according to bsirske , even in central offices where the number of employees is much higher than on the shop floor .
employees under stress and suspicion however , while verdi is concerned about the lack of union representation in discount businesses , bsirske said that the state of employment conditions is worse than the massive impediment to works committee initiatives in all three named discounters .
lack of adequate numbers of staff , extended working hours and frequent loneliness in stores has caused stress and achievement pressure in many employees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to the union , some employees have also complained about frequent controls at the cash registers , about searches of handbags and lockers and about " house visits " by superiors after a staff member has called in sick or after a union engagement .
verdi also claims the price war between the discount chains is causing more and more pressure on their staff members with little or no extra reward for the increased workload and stress .
with verdi members currently picketing discount store branches and distributing leaflets to staff members , the war of words seems set to continue . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the american way of aldi a u.s. business magazine telling americans to “ buy german ? ”

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 09.03.2004 car design à la lady großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the revolutionary all-female creation , the ycc even in this achingly modern 21st century , prejudice and preconception about dreaded " women drivers " still abound .
but there 's news for these macho male roadsters : women design cars . actually the news is anything but new .
more than a century ago , one mary anderson of the united states got the ball rolling when she registered a patent for the indispensable - especially in northern europe - windshield wipers .
and what a trendsetter she turned out to be .
the motoring association auto club europe also credits women with the invention of spiked tires and dipping headlights . it all goes to show that women quite evidently have a more meaningful relationship with cars than their bikini-clad romps on top of them might suggest , but the partnership has never been quite as serious as now .
at this year 's geneva motor show , swedish car manufacturer volvo unveiled a super-slick , stunningly-stylish new car called " your concept car " or " ycc . "
designed to fit the needs of what volvo claims to be the most demanding customer of all , the independent professional woman , it has everything a man might want plus all the added extras which women have long been screaming for . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inside of the ycc like the professional woman , the ycc coupé looks cool and graceful .
sexily sophisticated , it really has everything a woman wants : a special handbag compartment within easy reach of the drivers seat , a fool-proof little gizmo which will help even the most horrifying female parkers give their male counterparts a run for their money , elegant electric doors and special paint which works like a teflon frying pan to keep dirt from sticking to the body work , hence reducing the need for women to get down and dirty with a sponge , bucket and tin of wax .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 09.03.2004 european press review : a tough road ahead for greece european editorialists weighed in on the challenges facing greece 's newly-elected government on tuesday , from the upcoming olympic games to the reunification of cyprus . some good news for once , wrote germany 's handelsblatt .
iraq now has its own constitution , more or less on the first anniversary of the start of the war .
this is a welcome , visible step on the road to sovereignty and democracy .
it is something upon which iraq can build , and from which it can draw strength .
every new component that is added to the new order makes it more difficult for terrorists to turn the clock back . the süddeutsche zeitung from munich said iraq now has a basic law that guarantees the individual citizen freedom of expression and protection from tyranny for the first time in decades .
but that does not automatically mean a peaceful future .
the long term objective of any iraqi government must be to rid the country of the occupiers .
the americans may be able to retrench themselves in the military bases , but their troubles will only be over once they have left the country .
the iraqis , as history has shown , have stamina . the french paper libération said it is difficult to criticize america 's objectives in iraq .
american promises of long term financial engagement in the country ca n't be dismissed lightly , but the bush administration is clumsy and easily causes offense .
george bush presented his plan for the modernization of the islamic world to a think-tank full of hawks , the american enterprise institute .
bush 's advisors suggested a parallel with american policy towards the old soviet union within the framework of the helsinki process , but the comparison between islam and communism has not met with universal approval . the financial times focused on sunday 's elections in greece , which ended in triumph for the conservatives under costas karamanlis .
the london paper claimed that the untested 48-year-old new democracy leader will need all the authority he can muster to confront the challenges - restoring fiscal discipline , peace-making in cyprus and organising this summer 's olympic games - crowding in on him . another british paper , the guardian , wrote that the crushing defeat of the socialists was an indication of the swing to the right across europe .
socialist candidate george papandreou tried to do too much too quickly and his campaign confused voters as much as it refreshed them .
a period in opposition might do the socialist party good and might eventually produce a statesman of european status . the italian paper la repubblica told its readers that fear of disastrous olympic games and the shabby condition of the socialist party helped karamanlis to win this election .
he has a stable majority , but it is far from certain whether he will be able to serve his full term .
the election of a new president next year could lead to early elections .
the paper also said that cyprus remains a major problem .
if agreement over reunification of the island has n't been reached by march 22 , it wo n't be possible to meet the deadlines for the cyprus ' accession to the european union . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de greek conservatives win election greece 's opposition conservatives won the country 's general election on sunday , ending over a decade of rule by the socialists .

germany 's ruling social democrats and opposition conservatives thrashed out the details of long-debated immigration legislation on monday .
though there 's no talk of a breakthrough , the two sides did make progress . after almost four years of turbulent negotiations , germany 's floundering immigration legislation received a slight boost on monday when a seven-member expert group drawn from the main political parties said it made some progress on finding common ground . german interior minister otto schily of the ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- spoke of an improvement .
" the objectives are n't that far apart anymore , " he said . peter müller of the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- added that the two sides had made progress in the controversial areas of labor-market migration and humanitarian immigration , though details were n't released . müller added they discussed further tricky issues such as the integration of foreigners already in germany as well as the situation of ethnic germans and security . security a sticking point the latter point in particular proved to be a contentious one during monday 's discussions .
the conservatives have been pushing for tighter security measures ever since the discovery that terrorists involved in the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the united states had lived and studied in germany for years and had hatched the plot during that time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily on monday , schily -lrb- photo -rrb- signaled his willingness to facilitate expulsion procedures in the draft law for immigrants suspected of terrorist activities .
" it goes without saying that we do n't want to tolerate immigrants who pose a threat to german security .
we agree that there must be clear provisions that govern the residential status and possible expulsion procedures for such persons , " schily said . gulf between spd and cdu positions the immigration issue has been plagued by the widely divergent positions of the ruling coalition , made up of the spd and the green party , and the opposition cdu and its bavarian sister party csu . while the spd and the greens are in favor of a law aimed at simplifying regulations governing residency permits and making it easier for highly-qualified foreigners to work and live in germany , the cdu / csu argues that in light of germany 's high unemployment rate it would be rash to open its gates to an influx of labor from abroad .
it claims the country has enough problems integrating the seven million foreigners already in the country . the issue first attracted attention when schröder launched a scheme in 2000 to give permits to up to 20,000 computer specialists from india and central europe to work in germany on five-year contracts .
it has been lent new urgency by statistics showing germany faces a demographic time bomb with an increasingly ageing population and declining birth rates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian software expert in addition , german business and industry experts have repeatedly warned that the country faces a severe crunch of scientists and engineers and that highly-qualified foreigners were badly needed in the fields .
immigration is also necessary , they say , for economic growth and the funding of germany 's generous welfare state . signs of compromise schröder 's government came close to sealing germany 's first-ever immigration law in 2002 but suffered a severe setback in december that year when germany 's highest court ruled that it was unconstitutional .
despite the lows , in recent weeks , both sides have loosened their entrenched positions and signaled a willingness to compromise . the spd and greens have agreed to give up demands for a point system , such as in canada or new zealand , that would have allowed immigrants access to the german labor market without proof of a concrete job .
instead , permission would have been based an immigrant 's qualifications , skills and german language knowledge . the ruling coalition insists , though , that a general ban on hiring foreigners from outside the eu , which took effect in 1973 after the massive immigration wave of the 1960s , should be lifted .
this demand is expected to be a major sticking point between the two sides . for its part , the cdu has hinted that it might make concessions to the greens on drawing up a more humanitarian asylum law . clock ticking experts believe if nothing else , time pressure will ensure that the two sides are forced to reach agreement on the immigration law .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 09.03.2004 trade union boss reproaches " oppressive " discount stores großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : discount supermarkets lidl and aldi are among those accused of compromising their workers rights .
frank bsirske , the chairman of german trade union verdi , spoke out publicly against three of germany 's biggest discount retailers on monday and criticized their working conditions and perceived lack of employee rights . choosing international women 's day to launch his scathing criticism of the working practices of german discount supermarkets aldi and lidl and no-frills chemist chain schlecker , frank bsirske named and shamed those companies considered by his union to rule their empires with iron fists and a culture of fear , accusing them of using " intimidation as a commercial model . "
the timing of his outburst was carefully considered .
according to the verdi trade union boss about 100,000 german women work in the 10,500 schlecker shops , 3,500 aldis and 2,500 lidl branches nationwide , mostly in part-time positions and mostly in conditions unacceptable in this modern age .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verdi chief frank bsirske " the success of the discounters bathes in the sun , " said bsirske -lrb- photo -rrb- at a protest against working conditions outside a schlecker outlet in hanau on monday .
" but the terms of employment for the employee remains in shadow . "
accusing the discount giants of operating like the industrial tyrants of the 19th century , bsirske added that rate of pay contracts had been ignored , resulting in staff wages under the national average and hours of overtime that often go unpaid .
talk of unions met with threats those employees considering joining a union had been intimidated out of doing so , with many companies actively blocking any action by works committees throughout their branches , the verdi chairman declared .
" threats are not isolated cases in the climate of fear , " he said , calling the treatment of many workers " degrading . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : discounters command a 30 percent share of the german retail market but may find their control slipping if verdi carries out its threats to take action against those companies it sees as being the main offenders .
leading the union 's hit-list is lidl , the german supermarket sector 's second largest concern .
big names facing the " last resort " according to the union , lidl has refused every collaboration with verdi , completely banning trade unionists throughout its empire .
verdi has stated that , if lidl refuses to admit organized works committee elections in its establishments and assigned branches , the union will be forced to apply its " last resort . "
that could be a referral to the federal board of trade and a subsequent investigation .
a similar fate could await aldi whose southern division is also accused of suppressing union activity throughout its branches .
attempts to create committee initiatives for the rights of workers have been " strangled by massive pressure , " according to bsirske , even in central offices where the number of employees is much higher than on the shop floor .
employees under stress and suspicion however , while verdi is concerned about the lack of union representation in discount businesses , bsirske said that the state of employment conditions is worse than the massive impediment to works committee initiatives in all three named discounters .
lack of adequate numbers of staff , extended working hours and frequent loneliness in stores has caused stress and achievement pressure in many employees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to the union , some employees have also complained about frequent controls at the cash registers , about searches of handbags and lockers and about " house visits " by superiors after a staff member has called in sick or after a union engagement .
verdi also claims the price war between the discount chains is causing more and more pressure on their staff members with little or no extra reward for the increased workload and stress .
with verdi members currently picketing discount store branches and distributing leaflets to staff members , the war of words seems set to continue . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the american way of aldi a u.s. business magazine telling americans to “ buy german ? ”

finding takers is a problem . on a sunny winter morning , emel algan drives up in a black mini car to the office of her islamic women 's organization in berlin 's largely turkish kreuzberg district , her pixie-like face framed by a swath of striking pink fabric . indoors , algan -lrb- photo -rrb- does a quick fashion show as she exchanges her cleverly-woven bright hood cum scarf for a jaunty shaded green silk hat with an attached piece of fabric that buttons under the chin and flows to the chest and a floral patterned bandanna-like creation that gathers in at the back of the head .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emel algan " it looks so colorful and yet it 's just so practical , " algan says .
" it does away with the thousands of safety pins that you need for a conventional muslim headscarf and at the same time covers the throat , hair and ears , " she adds .
tradition and modernity the latter is important for 43-year-old algan , a religious muslim and mother of six , who has worn the traditional muslim hijab or headscarf since her childhood spent in small towns in germany .
in recent months , the muslim headscarf has been the subject of sometimes heated debate in germany about its place in society , and in particular in state-run institutions . algan herself incorporates a mixture of tradition and modernity .
she studied english language and literature at college and now heads a muslim women 's organization .
she began toying with fashionable alternatives to the conventional headscarf a year ago .
" i was unhappy with the widespread prejudices in germany against headscarf-wearing muslim women , prejudices like ' they 're dumb and servile . '
i had nothing to do with all that but i felt like i was being branded the same on account of my headscarf , " algan explains .
search for the neutral islamic headscarf the turmoil brought algan last year to the doorstep of milliner susanne gäbel , who runs a hat shop in the upscale charlottenburg neighborhood .
" i 'm no designer , all i knew is that i wanted something functional yet attractive that would n't look like the traditional headscarf , " algan says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emel algan gäbel says the request was an unusual one .
" i did n't have any experience with islamic headscarves , though i had done something traditional for jewish customers and for women who had undergone chemotherapy and wanted to cover their heads , " she says .
the search for the neutral , non-radical islamic headscarf has resulted in a series of nine innovative headscarf models in varying colors and materials .
some resemble charleston hats , others nordic felt caps , and they all meet the needs of those muslim women who interpret the koran as requiring they cover their hair , ears and throat .
" most of them are like ski caps or hoods with ear flaps that can be simply slipped over the head without needing any buttons or zips .
the fabric has to be elastic like jersey and felt , " gäbel explains .
the alternative headscarves start at € 50 and are custom-made for each individual .
a new person algan , who has now permanently swapped her conventional hijab for the alternative headscarf , says it 's made her feel like a different person .
" every morning when i get up i ask myself what i want to wear because i can now combine my wardrobe with my colorful headgear , " she says .
the change is n't just external either .
" with the new headscarf i feel like i 'm more accepted in a positive sense .
it could be just a banal conversation with the cashier at the supermarket about the weather , but now non-muslims actually notice me and are n't afraid of contact , " she says .
strict social controls algan adds she has no plans to sell the headgear on a commercial basis , but wants to convince younger muslim girls and women to try it out and in doing so , sidestep a proposed ban on the islamic headscarf in state-run institutions in berlin .
she 's now started a women 's discussion group to that purpose .
" i 'm doing all this to just provide some ideas for muslim women , to provide them with an alternative - after all as far as islam goes , there are no rules dictating how we should dress .
we can wear what we want as long as we cover ourselves , " algan says .
but delivering the message is proving harder than expected .
" the reactions have been very reserved so far .
unfortunately , social controls are so strong in muslim society that even if the girls are interested , they do n't have the freedom to express themselves .
they 're worried about what their husbands and mothers-in-law will think , " algan says .
" this traditional thinking is still deeply-ingrained in muslims here though four generations of them now live here .

the defense lawyer for imprisoned russian oil magnate mikhail khodorkovsky visited berlin on monday to raise awareness for the case , as his client allegedly stands no chance of receiving a fair trial . a fair trial is all that mikhail khodorkovsky wants , however , according to robert amsterdam , his canadian lawyer , khodorkovsky , the former ceo of yukos oil company , who has been charged with fraud and tax evasion , has rejected any offers by supporters to buy his freedom with yukos shares . " i have n't received any instructions but to take every legal action possible , " amsterdam said during a dw-world interview .
while he has not been able to see his client in private since his arrest last october , the lawyer said contact still existed . asked whether he believed the kremlin could reverse its attitude towards the case after the march 14 presidential elections , which putin is all but certain to win , amsterdam said he had no idea what would happen : " the one thing i 've learned about russia is : ' do n't even try to predict tomorrow because you do n't even understand yesterday . " ' a political decision ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mikhail khodorkovsky in prison last november .

he claimed moscow 's basmanny court , which is handling the case , was not independent in its decisions . " basmanny justice means no justice at all , " he said , adding that khodorkovsky 's potential release on bail after a march 25 hearing could only happen with the government 's approval .
" this will be a political decision , " amsterdam said , adding that resolution of the situation would take " many months .

" and yet with putin there is a sensibility i ca n't even begin to describe . " testing the rule of law in russia he added that khodorkovsky was faced with the possibility of a conviction .
" i think he 's taking a terrible risk , but he 's a russian , " amsterdam said .
" he did n't want to leave when everyone told him to leave . " while adding that khodorkovsky saw his case as a test of the rule of law in russia , amsterdam said , " i don ’ t believe the rule of law is anywhere near this case . " amsterdam also refuted claims by some that khodorkovsky is a single case and not the sign of the kremlin 's crackdown on businesses in russia .
" these types of things are viral , " he said , pointing to monday 's announcement by russia 's interior ministry that international accounting firm deloitte and touche was accused of tax evasion .

germany 's ruling social democrats and opposition conservatives thrashed out the details of long-debated immigration legislation on monday .
though there 's no talk of a breakthrough , the two sides did make progress . after almost four years of turbulent negotiations , germany 's floundering immigration legislation received a slight boost on monday when a seven-member expert group drawn from the main political parties said it made some progress on finding common ground . german interior minister otto schily of the ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- spoke of an improvement .

germany 's ruling social democrats and opposition conservatives thrashed out the details of long-debated immigration legislation on monday .
though there 's no talk of a breakthrough , the two sides did make progress . after almost four years of turbulent negotiations , germany 's floundering immigration legislation received a slight boost on monday when a seven-member expert group drawn from the main political parties said it made some progress on finding common ground . german interior minister otto schily of the ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- spoke of an improvement .
" the objectives are n't that far apart anymore , " he said . peter müller of the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- added that the two sides had made progress in the controversial areas of labor-market migration and humanitarian immigration , though details were n't released . müller added they discussed further tricky issues such as the integration of foreigners already in germany as well as the situation of ethnic germans and security . security a sticking point the latter point in particular proved to be a contentious one during monday 's discussions .
the conservatives have been pushing for tighter security measures ever since the discovery that terrorists involved in the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the united states had lived and studied in germany for years and had hatched the plot during that time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily on monday , schily -lrb- photo -rrb- signaled his willingness to facilitate expulsion procedures in the draft law for immigrants suspected of terrorist activities .
" it goes without saying that we do n't want to tolerate immigrants who pose a threat to german security .
we agree that there must be clear provisions that govern the residential status and possible expulsion procedures for such persons , " schily said . gulf between spd and cdu positions the immigration issue has been plagued by the widely divergent positions of the ruling coalition , made up of the spd and the green party , and the opposition cdu and its bavarian sister party csu . while the spd and the greens are in favor of a law aimed at simplifying regulations governing residency permits and making it easier for highly-qualified foreigners to work and live in germany , the cdu / csu argues that in light of germany 's high unemployment rate it would be rash to open its gates to an influx of labor from abroad .
it claims the country has enough problems integrating the seven million foreigners already in the country . the issue first attracted attention when schröder launched a scheme in 2000 to give permits to up to 20,000 computer specialists from india and central europe to work in germany on five-year contracts .
it has been lent new urgency by statistics showing germany faces a demographic time bomb with an increasingly ageing population and declining birth rates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian software expert in addition , german business and industry experts have repeatedly warned that the country faces a severe crunch of scientists and engineers and that highly-qualified foreigners were badly needed in the fields .
immigration is also necessary , they say , for economic growth and the funding of germany 's generous welfare state . signs of compromise schröder 's government came close to sealing germany 's first-ever immigration law in 2002 but suffered a severe setback in december that year when germany 's highest court ruled that it was unconstitutional .
despite the lows , in recent weeks , both sides have loosened their entrenched positions and signaled a willingness to compromise . the spd and greens have agreed to give up demands for a point system , such as in canada or new zealand , that would have allowed immigrants access to the german labor market without proof of a concrete job .
instead , permission would have been based an immigrant 's qualifications , skills and german language knowledge . the ruling coalition insists , though , that a general ban on hiring foreigners from outside the eu , which took effect in 1973 after the massive immigration wave of the 1960s , should be lifted .
this demand is expected to be a major sticking point between the two sides . for its part , the cdu has hinted that it might make concessions to the greens on drawing up a more humanitarian asylum law . clock ticking experts believe if nothing else , time pressure will ensure that the two sides are forced to reach agreement on the immigration law .

the defense lawyer for imprisoned russian oil magnate mikhail khodorkovsky visited berlin on monday to raise awareness for the case , as his client allegedly stands no chance of receiving a fair trial . a fair trial is all that mikhail khodorkovsky wants , however , according to robert amsterdam , his canadian lawyer , khodorkovsky , the former ceo of yukos oil company , who has been charged with fraud and tax evasion , has rejected any offers by supporters to buy his freedom with yukos shares . " i have n't received any instructions but to take every legal action possible , " amsterdam said during a dw-world interview .
while he has not been able to see his client in private since his arrest last october , the lawyer said contact still existed . asked whether he believed the kremlin could reverse its attitude towards the case after the march 14 presidential elections , which putin is all but certain to win , amsterdam said he had no idea what would happen : " the one thing i 've learned about russia is : ' do n't even try to predict tomorrow because you do n't even understand yesterday .

germany 's ruling social democrats and opposition conservatives thrashed out the details of long-debated immigration legislation on monday .
though there 's no talk of a breakthrough , the two sides did make progress . after almost four years of turbulent negotiations , germany 's floundering immigration legislation received a slight boost on monday when a seven-member expert group drawn from the main political parties said it made some progress on finding common ground . german interior minister otto schily of the ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- spoke of an improvement .
" the objectives are n't that far apart anymore , " he said . peter müller of the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- added that the two sides had made progress in the controversial areas of labor-market migration and humanitarian immigration , though details were n't released . müller added they discussed further tricky issues such as the integration of foreigners already in germany as well as the situation of ethnic germans and security . security a sticking point the latter point in particular proved to be a contentious one during monday 's discussions .
the conservatives have been pushing for tighter security measures ever since the discovery that terrorists involved in the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the united states had lived and studied in germany for years and had hatched the plot during that time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily on monday , schily -lrb- photo -rrb- signaled his willingness to facilitate expulsion procedures in the draft law for immigrants suspected of terrorist activities .
" it goes without saying that we do n't want to tolerate immigrants who pose a threat to german security .
we agree that there must be clear provisions that govern the residential status and possible expulsion procedures for such persons , " schily said . gulf between spd and cdu positions the immigration issue has been plagued by the widely divergent positions of the ruling coalition , made up of the spd and the green party , and the opposition cdu and its bavarian sister party csu . while the spd and the greens are in favor of a law aimed at simplifying regulations governing residency permits and making it easier for highly-qualified foreigners to work and live in germany , the cdu / csu argues that in light of germany 's high unemployment rate it would be rash to open its gates to an influx of labor from abroad .
it claims the country has enough problems integrating the seven million foreigners already in the country . the issue first attracted attention when schröder launched a scheme in 2000 to give permits to up to 20,000 computer specialists from india and central europe to work in germany on five-year contracts .
it has been lent new urgency by statistics showing germany faces a demographic time bomb with an increasingly ageing population and declining birth rates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian software expert in addition , german business and industry experts have repeatedly warned that the country faces a severe crunch of scientists and engineers and that highly-qualified foreigners were badly needed in the fields .
immigration is also necessary , they say , for economic growth and the funding of germany 's generous welfare state . signs of compromise schröder 's government came close to sealing germany 's first-ever immigration law in 2002 but suffered a severe setback in december that year when germany 's highest court ruled that it was unconstitutional .
despite the lows , in recent weeks , both sides have loosened their entrenched positions and signaled a willingness to compromise . the spd and greens have agreed to give up demands for a point system , such as in canada or new zealand , that would have allowed immigrants access to the german labor market without proof of a concrete job .
instead , permission would have been based an immigrant 's qualifications , skills and german language knowledge . the ruling coalition insists , though , that a general ban on hiring foreigners from outside the eu , which took effect in 1973 after the massive immigration wave of the 1960s , should be lifted .
this demand is expected to be a major sticking point between the two sides . for its part , the cdu has hinted that it might make concessions to the greens on drawing up a more humanitarian asylum law . clock ticking experts believe if nothing else , time pressure will ensure that the two sides are forced to reach agreement on the immigration law .

according to hubbert , both industry and politicians are to blame for the launch failure .
" many points were n't worked on as carefully as they should have been , " hubbert told the newspaper .

frank bsirske , the chairman of german trade union verdi , spoke out publicly against three of germany 's biggest discount retailers on monday and criticized their working conditions and perceived lack of employee rights . choosing international women 's day to launch his scathing criticism of the working practices of german discount supermarkets aldi and lidl and no-frills chemist chain schlecker , frank bsirske named and shamed those companies considered by his union to rule their empires with iron fists and a culture of fear , accusing them of using " intimidation as a commercial model . "
the timing of his outburst was carefully considered .
according to the verdi trade union boss about 100,000 german women work in the 10,500 schlecker shops , 3,500 aldis and 2,500 lidl branches nationwide , mostly in part-time positions and mostly in conditions unacceptable in this modern age .

" but the terms of employment for the employee remains in shadow . "
accusing the discount giants of operating like the industrial tyrants of the 19th century , bsirske added that rate of pay contracts had been ignored , resulting in staff wages under the national average and hours of overtime that often go unpaid .
talk of unions met with threats those employees considering joining a union had been intimidated out of doing so , with many companies actively blocking any action by works committees throughout their branches , the verdi chairman declared .

leading the union 's hit-list is lidl , the german supermarket sector 's second largest concern .
big names facing the " last resort " according to the union , lidl has refused every collaboration with verdi , completely banning trade unionists throughout its empire .
verdi has stated that , if lidl refuses to admit organized works committee elections in its establishments and assigned branches , the union will be forced to apply its " last resort . "
that could be a referral to the federal board of trade and a subsequent investigation .
a similar fate could await aldi whose southern division is also accused of suppressing union activity throughout its branches .
attempts to create committee initiatives for the rights of workers have been " strangled by massive pressure , " according to bsirske , even in central offices where the number of employees is much higher than on the shop floor .
employees under stress and suspicion however , while verdi is concerned about the lack of union representation in discount businesses , bsirske said that the state of employment conditions is worse than the massive impediment to works committee initiatives in all three named discounters .
lack of adequate numbers of staff , extended working hours and frequent loneliness in stores has caused stress and achievement pressure in many employees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to the union , some employees have also complained about frequent controls at the cash registers , about searches of handbags and lockers and about " house visits " by superiors after a staff member has called in sick or after a union engagement .

the german ferrari pilot raced across the finish line just ahead of his teammate rubens barrichello . six-time world champion michael schumacher proved on sunday he is once again the man to beat this season as he led his ferrari team to a one-two victory in the formula one opener in melbourne , australia .
as the german racer took the checkered flag at albert park only 13.605 seconds ahead of his brazilian teammate rubens barrichello , the clock seemed to roll back to 2002 , when the ferrari duo roared to 15 wins in 17 races .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferrari driver rubens barrichello of brazil holds his trophy to celebrate his victory in the f-1 japanese grand prix at suzuka circuit in suzuka , japan , sunday , oct .
12 , 2003 .
with a record time of 1:24:15.757 hours , the rest of the field paled in comparison to schumi and barrichello .
in third place was the spaniard fernando alonso for renault .
the bmw-williams team disappointed with a fourth and fifth place by ralf schumacher and the colombian juan pablo montoya .
" ferrari was in a class of its own , " said norbert haug , motor sport boss for mclaren-mercendes , which only managed to pull off an 8th place with david coulthard .
" i think ferrari could probably have lapped everybody if they had wanted to ...
i hope 2002 is not coming back . "

14 , 2003 .
" if the headlines are ' ferrari again ' it is not going to be good , " a frustrated montoya said after his hopes of picking up with last year 's third place overall ranking were dashed .
but for the italian carmaker , the season could n't have started better .
" it was a grandiose performance from ferrari , crowned with an equally grandiose result , " boasted the team 's sporting director jean todt .
" the championship has got underway with a dream event . "
for formula one ringmaster , bernie ecclestone , a return of a one-two ferrari sweep spells nothing but disaster .
after new regulations did nothing to slow the italian steed or bring out a new contending champion , the sport 's commercial supremo is worried 2004 could bring a return of the 2002 " formula yawn " when television audiences switched off in droves because the results were foreseeable .
schumacher , however , cautioned his teammates about getting carried away with the glory of the moment .
it is just the first of 18 races , he said : " we need to keep our feet firmly on the ground .
the difficult ones are still to come . "
schumi 's reign continues for the star of the show , who sailed seemingly effortlessly to his 71st grand prix win , the australian opener showed he was still king of the track .
the 35-year old has dominated formula one since 1999 and has given no indication of wanting to hang up his helmet .
" i just love fighting on the circuit and it 's natural to me and as long as i am competitive and the love is there ...

the original date for the referendums , april 21 , would mark the 37th anniversary of the overthrow of democracy in greece by a military junta , an event that could be considered to have set off the cyprus conflict .
the military coup in athens prompted turkey to invade the north of cyprus in 1974 .
the un hopes the referendum date will act as a deadline , pressing the two sides to reach agreement before cyprus is due to enter the eu on may 1 .
cypriots from the turkish and greek communities are locked in negotiations to reunify the island .
so far progress has been slow and popular support for any deal is not assured .
the talks are set to continue until a march 22 , when the turkish and greek government expected to join the discussions .
a week later un secretary general kofi annan is scheduled to start " filling in the blanks " of the agreement .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 09.03.2004 giving the headscarf a makeover großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daring to be different - emel algan even as the headscarf row simmers in germany , a berlin muslim has designed colorful alternative headgear that serves the purpose of a traditional hijab but looks like anything but .
finding takers is a problem . on a sunny winter morning , emel algan drives up in a black mini car to the office of her islamic women 's organization in berlin 's largely turkish kreuzberg district , her pixie-like face framed by a swath of striking pink fabric . indoors , algan -lrb- photo -rrb- does a quick fashion show as she exchanges her cleverly-woven bright hood cum scarf for a jaunty shaded green silk hat with an attached piece of fabric that buttons under the chin and flows to the chest and a floral patterned bandanna-like creation that gathers in at the back of the head .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emel algan " it looks so colorful and yet it 's just so practical , " algan says .
" it does away with the thousands of safety pins that you need for a conventional muslim headscarf and at the same time covers the throat , hair and ears , " she adds .
tradition and modernity the latter is important for 43-year-old algan , a religious muslim and mother of six , who has worn the traditional muslim hijab or headscarf since her childhood spent in small towns in germany .
in recent months , the muslim headscarf has been the subject of sometimes heated debate in germany about its place in society , and in particular in state-run institutions . algan herself incorporates a mixture of tradition and modernity .
she studied english language and literature at college and now heads a muslim women 's organization .
she began toying with fashionable alternatives to the conventional headscarf a year ago .
" i was unhappy with the widespread prejudices in germany against headscarf-wearing muslim women , prejudices like ' they 're dumb and servile . '
i had nothing to do with all that but i felt like i was being branded the same on account of my headscarf , " algan explains .
search for the neutral islamic headscarf the turmoil brought algan last year to the doorstep of milliner susanne gäbel , who runs a hat shop in the upscale charlottenburg neighborhood .
" i 'm no designer , all i knew is that i wanted something functional yet attractive that would n't look like the traditional headscarf , " algan says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emel algan gäbel says the request was an unusual one .
" i did n't have any experience with islamic headscarves , though i had done something traditional for jewish customers and for women who had undergone chemotherapy and wanted to cover their heads , " she says .
the search for the neutral , non-radical islamic headscarf has resulted in a series of nine innovative headscarf models in varying colors and materials .
some resemble charleston hats , others nordic felt caps , and they all meet the needs of those muslim women who interpret the koran as requiring they cover their hair , ears and throat .
" most of them are like ski caps or hoods with ear flaps that can be simply slipped over the head without needing any buttons or zips .
the fabric has to be elastic like jersey and felt , " gäbel explains .
the alternative headscarves start at € 50 and are custom-made for each individual .
a new person algan , who has now permanently swapped her conventional hijab for the alternative headscarf , says it 's made her feel like a different person .
" every morning when i get up i ask myself what i want to wear because i can now combine my wardrobe with my colorful headgear , " she says .
the change is n't just external either .
" with the new headscarf i feel like i 'm more accepted in a positive sense .
it could be just a banal conversation with the cashier at the supermarket about the weather , but now non-muslims actually notice me and are n't afraid of contact , " she says .
strict social controls algan adds she has no plans to sell the headgear on a commercial basis , but wants to convince younger muslim girls and women to try it out and in doing so , sidestep a proposed ban on the islamic headscarf in state-run institutions in berlin .
she 's now started a women 's discussion group to that purpose .
" i 'm doing all this to just provide some ideas for muslim women , to provide them with an alternative - after all as far as islam goes , there are no rules dictating how we should dress .
we can wear what we want as long as we cover ourselves , " algan says .
but delivering the message is proving harder than expected .
" the reactions have been very reserved so far .
unfortunately , social controls are so strong in muslim society that even if the girls are interested , they do n't have the freedom to express themselves .
they 're worried about what their husbands and mothers-in-law will think , " algan says .

finding takers is a problem . on a sunny winter morning , emel algan drives up in a black mini car to the office of her islamic women 's organization in berlin 's largely turkish kreuzberg district , her pixie-like face framed by a swath of striking pink fabric . indoors , algan -lrb- photo -rrb- does a quick fashion show as she exchanges her cleverly-woven bright hood cum scarf for a jaunty shaded green silk hat with an attached piece of fabric that buttons under the chin and flows to the chest and a floral patterned bandanna-like creation that gathers in at the back of the head .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emel algan " it looks so colorful and yet it 's just so practical , " algan says .
" it does away with the thousands of safety pins that you need for a conventional muslim headscarf and at the same time covers the throat , hair and ears , " she adds .
tradition and modernity the latter is important for 43-year-old algan , a religious muslim and mother of six , who has worn the traditional muslim hijab or headscarf since her childhood spent in small towns in germany .
in recent months , the muslim headscarf has been the subject of sometimes heated debate in germany about its place in society , and in particular in state-run institutions . algan herself incorporates a mixture of tradition and modernity .
she studied english language and literature at college and now heads a muslim women 's organization .
she began toying with fashionable alternatives to the conventional headscarf a year ago .
" i was unhappy with the widespread prejudices in germany against headscarf-wearing muslim women , prejudices like ' they 're dumb and servile . '
i had nothing to do with all that but i felt like i was being branded the same on account of my headscarf , " algan explains .
search for the neutral islamic headscarf the turmoil brought algan last year to the doorstep of milliner susanne gäbel , who runs a hat shop in the upscale charlottenburg neighborhood .
" i 'm no designer , all i knew is that i wanted something functional yet attractive that would n't look like the traditional headscarf , " algan says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emel algan gäbel says the request was an unusual one .
" i did n't have any experience with islamic headscarves , though i had done something traditional for jewish customers and for women who had undergone chemotherapy and wanted to cover their heads , " she says .
the search for the neutral , non-radical islamic headscarf has resulted in a series of nine innovative headscarf models in varying colors and materials .
some resemble charleston hats , others nordic felt caps , and they all meet the needs of those muslim women who interpret the koran as requiring they cover their hair , ears and throat .
" most of them are like ski caps or hoods with ear flaps that can be simply slipped over the head without needing any buttons or zips .

search for the neutral islamic headscarf the turmoil brought algan last year to the doorstep of milliner susanne gäbel , who runs a hat shop in the upscale charlottenburg neighborhood .

the search for the neutral , non-radical islamic headscarf has resulted in a series of nine innovative headscarf models in varying colors and materials .
some resemble charleston hats , others nordic felt caps , and they all meet the needs of those muslim women who interpret the koran as requiring they cover their hair , ears and throat .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.03.2004 no breakthrough yet on immigration law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : multicultural germany , like it or not .
germany 's ruling social democrats and opposition conservatives thrashed out the details of long-debated immigration legislation on monday .
though there 's no talk of a breakthrough , the two sides did make progress . after almost four years of turbulent negotiations , germany 's floundering immigration legislation received a slight boost on monday when a seven-member expert group drawn from the main political parties said it made some progress on finding common ground . german interior minister otto schily of the ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- spoke of an improvement .
" the objectives are n't that far apart anymore , " he said . peter müller of the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- added that the two sides had made progress in the controversial areas of labor-market migration and humanitarian immigration , though details were n't released . müller added they discussed further tricky issues such as the integration of foreigners already in germany as well as the situation of ethnic germans and security . security a sticking point the latter point in particular proved to be a contentious one during monday 's discussions .
the conservatives have been pushing for tighter security measures ever since the discovery that terrorists involved in the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the united states had lived and studied in germany for years and had hatched the plot during that time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily on monday , schily -lrb- photo -rrb- signaled his willingness to facilitate expulsion procedures in the draft law for immigrants suspected of terrorist activities .
" it goes without saying that we do n't want to tolerate immigrants who pose a threat to german security .
we agree that there must be clear provisions that govern the residential status and possible expulsion procedures for such persons , " schily said . gulf between spd and cdu positions the immigration issue has been plagued by the widely divergent positions of the ruling coalition , made up of the spd and the green party , and the opposition cdu and its bavarian sister party csu . while the spd and the greens are in favor of a law aimed at simplifying regulations governing residency permits and making it easier for highly-qualified foreigners to work and live in germany , the cdu / csu argues that in light of germany 's high unemployment rate it would be rash to open its gates to an influx of labor from abroad .
it claims the country has enough problems integrating the seven million foreigners already in the country . the issue first attracted attention when schröder launched a scheme in 2000 to give permits to up to 20,000 computer specialists from india and central europe to work in germany on five-year contracts .
it has been lent new urgency by statistics showing germany faces a demographic time bomb with an increasingly ageing population and declining birth rates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian software expert in addition , german business and industry experts have repeatedly warned that the country faces a severe crunch of scientists and engineers and that highly-qualified foreigners were badly needed in the fields .
immigration is also necessary , they say , for economic growth and the funding of germany 's generous welfare state . signs of compromise schröder 's government came close to sealing germany 's first-ever immigration law in 2002 but suffered a severe setback in december that year when germany 's highest court ruled that it was unconstitutional .
despite the lows , in recent weeks , both sides have loosened their entrenched positions and signaled a willingness to compromise . the spd and greens have agreed to give up demands for a point system , such as in canada or new zealand , that would have allowed immigrants access to the german labor market without proof of a concrete job .
instead , permission would have been based an immigrant 's qualifications , skills and german language knowledge . the ruling coalition insists , though , that a general ban on hiring foreigners from outside the eu , which took effect in 1973 after the massive immigration wave of the 1960s , should be lifted .
this demand is expected to be a major sticking point between the two sides . for its part , the cdu has hinted that it might make concessions to the greens on drawing up a more humanitarian asylum law . clock ticking experts believe if nothing else , time pressure will ensure that the two sides are forced to reach agreement on the immigration law .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asylum-seekers in frankfurt it 's not just germany 's own economic and labor problems that are demanding attention , but even brussels is pushing germany to clear its stance on asylum policies before may 1 to make way for the implementation of a common european policy on asylum protection before it takes in the 10 new eastern and southern european members . the parties will meet again on friday to continue negotiations on the immigration law . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany offers newcomers " how to " book the german government has released a handbook for immigrants aimed to serve as a guide through the labyrinth of german ways .

"
gerhard schröder is no stranger to taking on the press when its coverage of him does n't pass muster .
but now that he 's decided to give the nation 's best-selling tabloid the cold shoulder , journalists are fighting back . gerhard schröder 's latest tussle with the media bears an uncanny resemblance to a schoolyard brawl .
germany 's biggest-selling daily , bild zeitung , prints some critical stories about schröder 's economic and social reforms . the chancellor , nose clearly out of joint , responds by saying he 's no longer talking to bild .

germany 's biggest-selling daily , bild zeitung , prints some critical stories about schröder 's economic and social reforms . the chancellor , nose clearly out of joint , responds by saying he 's no longer talking to bild .
his spokesman , bela anda - a former bild journalist himself - criticizes the paper 's reporting style , calling it " a mixture of malice , agitation and contempt for the politicians , garnished with half-truths . " following the accusations , made last week , the tabloid remained cool , saying the decision only made schröder 's government look bad .
then , several bild journalists accused the government of excluding them from accompanying the chancellor on trips .
anda denies any such boycott , and says if bild reporters have to stay home , it 's because of lack of space on schröder 's plane . reporters fight for their rights sensing that the weaker party is being bullied , the german journalists ' union , djv , stepped in on monday to flex some muscle .
its head , michael konken , wrote a letter to anda , accusing the government of being overly sensitive and high-handed .
the exclusion of journalists , he says , is " a blatant transgression against the freedom of the press and their duty to report information . " " the only party responsible for the current critical nature of reports in the media is the government 's unprofessional public relations department , which seems incapable of communicating the strategies of the politicians to the media and the people in this country , " konken wrote . media chancellor ? schröder 's decision to stop granting interviews to bild bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder 's government accuses " bild " of bias. did n't exactly come out of nowhere .
the chancellor has been disgruntled with the paper 's political coverage for weeks .
last month , he requested his social democrat parliamentarians to show more restraint when speaking with bild reporters . nor is schröder 's move without precedence .
former chancellor helmut kohl , for example , refused to grant interviews to der spiegel , after accusing the news magazine of distorting its coverage of him . but schröder is germany 's self-proclaimed " media chancellor " - the man who once said that all he needed to govern were the tabloids and television .
as such , some would say he ought to know better .
this is n't the first time schröder has taken on the media for running unflattering stories about him .
but despite winning past battles , there 's a general sense that schröder is a bad sport . last year , the chancellor won a court order to stop speculation in the press about whether or not he dyed his hair -lrb- he does n't , by the way -rrb- . schröder 's lawyers also won an injunction against the british tabloid mail on sunday after it alleged that schröder 's fourth marriage was on the rocks . depending on how far schröder 's tiff with bild stretches , the tables could soon be turned .
djv head michael konken 's advice to journalists who feel they 've been excluded from accompanying the chancellor on trips because they 're not " on message " ?

iraq now has its own constitution , more or less on the first anniversary of the start of the war .
this is a welcome , visible step on the road to sovereignty and democracy .
it is something upon which iraq can build , and from which it can draw strength .
every new component that is added to the new order makes it more difficult for terrorists to turn the clock back . the süddeutsche zeitung from munich said iraq now has a basic law that guarantees the individual citizen freedom of expression and protection from tyranny for the first time in decades .
but that does not automatically mean a peaceful future .
the long term objective of any iraqi government must be to rid the country of the occupiers .

the iraqis , as history has shown , have stamina . the french paper libération said it is difficult to criticize america 's objectives in iraq .
american promises of long term financial engagement in the country ca n't be dismissed lightly , but the bush administration is clumsy and easily causes offense .
george bush presented his plan for the modernization of the islamic world to a think-tank full of hawks , the american enterprise institute .
bush 's advisors suggested a parallel with american policy towards the old soviet union within the framework of the helsinki process , but the comparison between islam and communism has not met with universal approval . the financial times focused on sunday 's elections in greece , which ended in triumph for the conservatives under costas karamanlis .

though there 's no talk of a breakthrough , the two sides did make progress . after almost four years of turbulent negotiations , germany 's floundering immigration legislation received a slight boost on monday when a seven-member expert group drawn from the main political parties said it made some progress on finding common ground . german interior minister otto schily of the ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- spoke of an improvement .
" the objectives are n't that far apart anymore , " he said . peter müller of the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- added that the two sides had made progress in the controversial areas of labor-market migration and humanitarian immigration , though details were n't released . müller added they discussed further tricky issues such as the integration of foreigners already in germany as well as the situation of ethnic germans and security . security a sticking point the latter point in particular proved to be a contentious one during monday 's discussions .

" it goes without saying that we do n't want to tolerate immigrants who pose a threat to german security .
we agree that there must be clear provisions that govern the residential status and possible expulsion procedures for such persons , " schily said . gulf between spd and cdu positions the immigration issue has been plagued by the widely divergent positions of the ruling coalition , made up of the spd and the green party , and the opposition cdu and its bavarian sister party csu . while the spd and the greens are in favor of a law aimed at simplifying regulations governing residency permits and making it easier for highly-qualified foreigners to work and live in germany , the cdu / csu argues that in light of germany 's high unemployment rate it would be rash to open its gates to an influx of labor from abroad .
it claims the country has enough problems integrating the seven million foreigners already in the country . the issue first attracted attention when schröder launched a scheme in 2000 to give permits to up to 20,000 computer specialists from india and central europe to work in germany on five-year contracts .

immigration is also necessary , they say , for economic growth and the funding of germany 's generous welfare state . signs of compromise schröder 's government came close to sealing germany 's first-ever immigration law in 2002 but suffered a severe setback in december that year when germany 's highest court ruled that it was unconstitutional .
despite the lows , in recent weeks , both sides have loosened their entrenched positions and signaled a willingness to compromise . the spd and greens have agreed to give up demands for a point system , such as in canada or new zealand , that would have allowed immigrants access to the german labor market without proof of a concrete job .
instead , permission would have been based an immigrant 's qualifications , skills and german language knowledge . the ruling coalition insists , though , that a general ban on hiring foreigners from outside the eu , which took effect in 1973 after the massive immigration wave of the 1960s , should be lifted .
this demand is expected to be a major sticking point between the two sides . for its part , the cdu has hinted that it might make concessions to the greens on drawing up a more humanitarian asylum law . clock ticking experts believe if nothing else , time pressure will ensure that the two sides are forced to reach agreement on the immigration law .

instead , permission would have been based an immigrant 's qualifications , skills and german language knowledge . the ruling coalition insists , though , that a general ban on hiring foreigners from outside the eu , which took effect in 1973 after the massive immigration wave of the 1960s , should be lifted .
this demand is expected to be a major sticking point between the two sides . for its part , the cdu has hinted that it might make concessions to the greens on drawing up a more humanitarian asylum law . clock ticking experts believe if nothing else , time pressure will ensure that the two sides are forced to reach agreement on the immigration law .

the german ferrari pilot raced across the finish line just ahead of his teammate rubens barrichello . six-time world champion michael schumacher proved on sunday he is once again the man to beat this season as he led his ferrari team to a one-two victory in the formula one opener in melbourne , australia .
as the german racer took the checkered flag at albert park only 13.605 seconds ahead of his brazilian teammate rubens barrichello , the clock seemed to roll back to 2002 , when the ferrari duo roared to 15 wins in 17 races .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferrari driver rubens barrichello of brazil holds his trophy to celebrate his victory in the f-1 japanese grand prix at suzuka circuit in suzuka , japan , sunday , oct .

with a record time of 1:24:15.757 hours , the rest of the field paled in comparison to schumi and barrichello .
in third place was the spaniard fernando alonso for renault .
the bmw-williams team disappointed with a fourth and fifth place by ralf schumacher and the colombian juan pablo montoya .
" ferrari was in a class of its own , " said norbert haug , motor sport boss for mclaren-mercendes , which only managed to pull off an 8th place with david coulthard .
" i think ferrari could probably have lapped everybody if they had wanted to ...
i hope 2002 is not coming back . "

14 , 2003 .
" if the headlines are ' ferrari again ' it is not going to be good , " a frustrated montoya said after his hopes of picking up with last year 's third place overall ranking were dashed .
but for the italian carmaker , the season could n't have started better .
" it was a grandiose performance from ferrari , crowned with an equally grandiose result , " boasted the team 's sporting director jean todt .
" the championship has got underway with a dream event . "
for formula one ringmaster , bernie ecclestone , a return of a one-two ferrari sweep spells nothing but disaster .
after new regulations did nothing to slow the italian steed or bring out a new contending champion , the sport 's commercial supremo is worried 2004 could bring a return of the 2002 " formula yawn " when television audiences switched off in droves because the results were foreseeable .
schumacher , however , cautioned his teammates about getting carried away with the glory of the moment .
it is just the first of 18 races , he said : " we need to keep our feet firmly on the ground .
the difficult ones are still to come . "
schumi 's reign continues for the star of the show , who sailed seemingly effortlessly to his 71st grand prix win , the australian opener showed he was still king of the track .
the 35-year old has dominated formula one since 1999 and has given no indication of wanting to hang up his helmet .
" i just love fighting on the circuit and it 's natural to me and as long as i am competitive and the love is there ...
i 'll enjoy it as long as i can , " he vowed . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schumacher wins sixth title early sunday morning formula one fans in germany woke to see their home favorite , michael schumacher , beat out his stiffest rival kimi raikkonen to claim a historic sixth world championship in suzuka , japan .

frank bsirske , the chairman of german trade union verdi , spoke out publicly against three of germany 's biggest discount retailers on monday and criticized their working conditions and perceived lack of employee rights . choosing international women 's day to launch his scathing criticism of the working practices of german discount supermarkets aldi and lidl and no-frills chemist chain schlecker , frank bsirske named and shamed those companies considered by his union to rule their empires with iron fists and a culture of fear , accusing them of using " intimidation as a commercial model . "
the timing of his outburst was carefully considered .
according to the verdi trade union boss about 100,000 german women work in the 10,500 schlecker shops , 3,500 aldis and 2,500 lidl branches nationwide , mostly in part-time positions and mostly in conditions unacceptable in this modern age .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verdi chief frank bsirske " the success of the discounters bathes in the sun , " said bsirske -lrb- photo -rrb- at a protest against working conditions outside a schlecker outlet in hanau on monday .
" but the terms of employment for the employee remains in shadow . "
accusing the discount giants of operating like the industrial tyrants of the 19th century , bsirske added that rate of pay contracts had been ignored , resulting in staff wages under the national average and hours of overtime that often go unpaid .
talk of unions met with threats those employees considering joining a union had been intimidated out of doing so , with many companies actively blocking any action by works committees throughout their branches , the verdi chairman declared .
" threats are not isolated cases in the climate of fear , " he said , calling the treatment of many workers " degrading . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : discounters command a 30 percent share of the german retail market but may find their control slipping if verdi carries out its threats to take action against those companies it sees as being the main offenders .
leading the union 's hit-list is lidl , the german supermarket sector 's second largest concern .
big names facing the " last resort " according to the union , lidl has refused every collaboration with verdi , completely banning trade unionists throughout its empire .
verdi has stated that , if lidl refuses to admit organized works committee elections in its establishments and assigned branches , the union will be forced to apply its " last resort . "
that could be a referral to the federal board of trade and a subsequent investigation .
a similar fate could await aldi whose southern division is also accused of suppressing union activity throughout its branches .
attempts to create committee initiatives for the rights of workers have been " strangled by massive pressure , " according to bsirske , even in central offices where the number of employees is much higher than on the shop floor .
employees under stress and suspicion however , while verdi is concerned about the lack of union representation in discount businesses , bsirske said that the state of employment conditions is worse than the massive impediment to works committee initiatives in all three named discounters .
lack of adequate numbers of staff , extended working hours and frequent loneliness in stores has caused stress and achievement pressure in many employees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to the union , some employees have also complained about frequent controls at the cash registers , about searches of handbags and lockers and about " house visits " by superiors after a staff member has called in sick or after a union engagement .
verdi also claims the price war between the discount chains is causing more and more pressure on their staff members with little or no extra reward for the increased workload and stress .

frank bsirske , the chairman of german trade union verdi , spoke out publicly against three of germany 's biggest discount retailers on monday and criticized their working conditions and perceived lack of employee rights . choosing international women 's day to launch his scathing criticism of the working practices of german discount supermarkets aldi and lidl and no-frills chemist chain schlecker , frank bsirske named and shamed those companies considered by his union to rule their empires with iron fists and a culture of fear , accusing them of using " intimidation as a commercial model . "
the timing of his outburst was carefully considered .
according to the verdi trade union boss about 100,000 german women work in the 10,500 schlecker shops , 3,500 aldis and 2,500 lidl branches nationwide , mostly in part-time positions and mostly in conditions unacceptable in this modern age .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verdi chief frank bsirske " the success of the discounters bathes in the sun , " said bsirske -lrb- photo -rrb- at a protest against working conditions outside a schlecker outlet in hanau on monday .
" but the terms of employment for the employee remains in shadow . "
accusing the discount giants of operating like the industrial tyrants of the 19th century , bsirske added that rate of pay contracts had been ignored , resulting in staff wages under the national average and hours of overtime that often go unpaid .
talk of unions met with threats those employees considering joining a union had been intimidated out of doing so , with many companies actively blocking any action by works committees throughout their branches , the verdi chairman declared .
" threats are not isolated cases in the climate of fear , " he said , calling the treatment of many workers " degrading . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : discounters command a 30 percent share of the german retail market but may find their control slipping if verdi carries out its threats to take action against those companies it sees as being the main offenders .
leading the union 's hit-list is lidl , the german supermarket sector 's second largest concern .
big names facing the " last resort " according to the union , lidl has refused every collaboration with verdi , completely banning trade unionists throughout its empire .
verdi has stated that , if lidl refuses to admit organized works committee elections in its establishments and assigned branches , the union will be forced to apply its " last resort . "

finding takers is a problem . on a sunny winter morning , emel algan drives up in a black mini car to the office of her islamic women 's organization in berlin 's largely turkish kreuzberg district , her pixie-like face framed by a swath of striking pink fabric . indoors , algan -lrb- photo -rrb- does a quick fashion show as she exchanges her cleverly-woven bright hood cum scarf for a jaunty shaded green silk hat with an attached piece of fabric that buttons under the chin and flows to the chest and a floral patterned bandanna-like creation that gathers in at the back of the head .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emel algan " it looks so colorful and yet it 's just so practical , " algan says .
" it does away with the thousands of safety pins that you need for a conventional muslim headscarf and at the same time covers the throat , hair and ears , " she adds .
tradition and modernity the latter is important for 43-year-old algan , a religious muslim and mother of six , who has worn the traditional muslim hijab or headscarf since her childhood spent in small towns in germany .
in recent months , the muslim headscarf has been the subject of sometimes heated debate in germany about its place in society , and in particular in state-run institutions . algan herself incorporates a mixture of tradition and modernity .
she studied english language and literature at college and now heads a muslim women 's organization .
she began toying with fashionable alternatives to the conventional headscarf a year ago .
" i was unhappy with the widespread prejudices in germany against headscarf-wearing muslim women , prejudices like ' they 're dumb and servile . '
i had nothing to do with all that but i felt like i was being branded the same on account of my headscarf , " algan explains .
search for the neutral islamic headscarf the turmoil brought algan last year to the doorstep of milliner susanne gäbel , who runs a hat shop in the upscale charlottenburg neighborhood .
" i 'm no designer , all i knew is that i wanted something functional yet attractive that would n't look like the traditional headscarf , " algan says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emel algan gäbel says the request was an unusual one .
" i did n't have any experience with islamic headscarves , though i had done something traditional for jewish customers and for women who had undergone chemotherapy and wanted to cover their heads , " she says .
the search for the neutral , non-radical islamic headscarf has resulted in a series of nine innovative headscarf models in varying colors and materials .
some resemble charleston hats , others nordic felt caps , and they all meet the needs of those muslim women who interpret the koran as requiring they cover their hair , ears and throat .
" most of them are like ski caps or hoods with ear flaps that can be simply slipped over the head without needing any buttons or zips .
the fabric has to be elastic like jersey and felt , " gäbel explains .
the alternative headscarves start at € 50 and are custom-made for each individual .
a new person algan , who has now permanently swapped her conventional hijab for the alternative headscarf , says it 's made her feel like a different person .
" every morning when i get up i ask myself what i want to wear because i can now combine my wardrobe with my colorful headgear , " she says .
the change is n't just external either .
" with the new headscarf i feel like i 'm more accepted in a positive sense .
it could be just a banal conversation with the cashier at the supermarket about the weather , but now non-muslims actually notice me and are n't afraid of contact , " she says .
strict social controls algan adds she has no plans to sell the headgear on a commercial basis , but wants to convince younger muslim girls and women to try it out and in doing so , sidestep a proposed ban on the islamic headscarf in state-run institutions in berlin .
she 's now started a women 's discussion group to that purpose .
" i 'm doing all this to just provide some ideas for muslim women , to provide them with an alternative - after all as far as islam goes , there are no rules dictating how we should dress .
we can wear what we want as long as we cover ourselves , " algan says .
but delivering the message is proving harder than expected .
" the reactions have been very reserved so far .
unfortunately , social controls are so strong in muslim society that even if the girls are interested , they do n't have the freedom to express themselves .

finding takers is a problem . on a sunny winter morning , emel algan drives up in a black mini car to the office of her islamic women 's organization in berlin 's largely turkish kreuzberg district , her pixie-like face framed by a swath of striking pink fabric . indoors , algan -lrb- photo -rrb- does a quick fashion show as she exchanges her cleverly-woven bright hood cum scarf for a jaunty shaded green silk hat with an attached piece of fabric that buttons under the chin and flows to the chest and a floral patterned bandanna-like creation that gathers in at the back of the head .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emel algan " it looks so colorful and yet it 's just so practical , " algan says .
" it does away with the thousands of safety pins that you need for a conventional muslim headscarf and at the same time covers the throat , hair and ears , " she adds .
tradition and modernity the latter is important for 43-year-old algan , a religious muslim and mother of six , who has worn the traditional muslim hijab or headscarf since her childhood spent in small towns in germany .
in recent months , the muslim headscarf has been the subject of sometimes heated debate in germany about its place in society , and in particular in state-run institutions . algan herself incorporates a mixture of tradition and modernity .
she studied english language and literature at college and now heads a muslim women 's organization .
she began toying with fashionable alternatives to the conventional headscarf a year ago .
" i was unhappy with the widespread prejudices in germany against headscarf-wearing muslim women , prejudices like ' they 're dumb and servile . '
i had nothing to do with all that but i felt like i was being branded the same on account of my headscarf , " algan explains .
search for the neutral islamic headscarf the turmoil brought algan last year to the doorstep of milliner susanne gäbel , who runs a hat shop in the upscale charlottenburg neighborhood .
" i 'm no designer , all i knew is that i wanted something functional yet attractive that would n't look like the traditional headscarf , " algan says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emel algan gäbel says the request was an unusual one .
" i did n't have any experience with islamic headscarves , though i had done something traditional for jewish customers and for women who had undergone chemotherapy and wanted to cover their heads , " she says .
the search for the neutral , non-radical islamic headscarf has resulted in a series of nine innovative headscarf models in varying colors and materials .
some resemble charleston hats , others nordic felt caps , and they all meet the needs of those muslim women who interpret the koran as requiring they cover their hair , ears and throat .
" most of them are like ski caps or hoods with ear flaps that can be simply slipped over the head without needing any buttons or zips .
the fabric has to be elastic like jersey and felt , " gäbel explains .
the alternative headscarves start at € 50 and are custom-made for each individual .
a new person algan , who has now permanently swapped her conventional hijab for the alternative headscarf , says it 's made her feel like a different person .
" every morning when i get up i ask myself what i want to wear because i can now combine my wardrobe with my colorful headgear , " she says .
the change is n't just external either .
" with the new headscarf i feel like i 'm more accepted in a positive sense .
it could be just a banal conversation with the cashier at the supermarket about the weather , but now non-muslims actually notice me and are n't afraid of contact , " she says .
strict social controls algan adds she has no plans to sell the headgear on a commercial basis , but wants to convince younger muslim girls and women to try it out and in doing so , sidestep a proposed ban on the islamic headscarf in state-run institutions in berlin .
she 's now started a women 's discussion group to that purpose .
" i 'm doing all this to just provide some ideas for muslim women , to provide them with an alternative - after all as far as islam goes , there are no rules dictating how we should dress .
we can wear what we want as long as we cover ourselves , " algan says .
but delivering the message is proving harder than expected .
" the reactions have been very reserved so far .
unfortunately , social controls are so strong in muslim society that even if the girls are interested , they do n't have the freedom to express themselves .
they 're worried about what their husbands and mothers-in-law will think , " algan says .
" this traditional thinking is still deeply-ingrained in muslims here though four generations of them now live here .

germany 's ruling social democrats and opposition conservatives thrashed out the details of long-debated immigration legislation on monday .
though there 's no talk of a breakthrough , the two sides did make progress . after almost four years of turbulent negotiations , germany 's floundering immigration legislation received a slight boost on monday when a seven-member expert group drawn from the main political parties said it made some progress on finding common ground . german interior minister otto schily of the ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- spoke of an improvement .
" the objectives are n't that far apart anymore , " he said . peter müller of the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- added that the two sides had made progress in the controversial areas of labor-market migration and humanitarian immigration , though details were n't released . müller added they discussed further tricky issues such as the integration of foreigners already in germany as well as the situation of ethnic germans and security . security a sticking point the latter point in particular proved to be a contentious one during monday 's discussions .
the conservatives have been pushing for tighter security measures ever since the discovery that terrorists involved in the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the united states had lived and studied in germany for years and had hatched the plot during that time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily on monday , schily -lrb- photo -rrb- signaled his willingness to facilitate expulsion procedures in the draft law for immigrants suspected of terrorist activities .
" it goes without saying that we do n't want to tolerate immigrants who pose a threat to german security .
we agree that there must be clear provisions that govern the residential status and possible expulsion procedures for such persons , " schily said . gulf between spd and cdu positions the immigration issue has been plagued by the widely divergent positions of the ruling coalition , made up of the spd and the green party , and the opposition cdu and its bavarian sister party csu . while the spd and the greens are in favor of a law aimed at simplifying regulations governing residency permits and making it easier for highly-qualified foreigners to work and live in germany , the cdu / csu argues that in light of germany 's high unemployment rate it would be rash to open its gates to an influx of labor from abroad .
it claims the country has enough problems integrating the seven million foreigners already in the country . the issue first attracted attention when schröder launched a scheme in 2000 to give permits to up to 20,000 computer specialists from india and central europe to work in germany on five-year contracts .
it has been lent new urgency by statistics showing germany faces a demographic time bomb with an increasingly ageing population and declining birth rates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian software expert in addition , german business and industry experts have repeatedly warned that the country faces a severe crunch of scientists and engineers and that highly-qualified foreigners were badly needed in the fields .
immigration is also necessary , they say , for economic growth and the funding of germany 's generous welfare state . signs of compromise schröder 's government came close to sealing germany 's first-ever immigration law in 2002 but suffered a severe setback in december that year when germany 's highest court ruled that it was unconstitutional .
despite the lows , in recent weeks , both sides have loosened their entrenched positions and signaled a willingness to compromise . the spd and greens have agreed to give up demands for a point system , such as in canada or new zealand , that would have allowed immigrants access to the german labor market without proof of a concrete job .
instead , permission would have been based an immigrant 's qualifications , skills and german language knowledge . the ruling coalition insists , though , that a general ban on hiring foreigners from outside the eu , which took effect in 1973 after the massive immigration wave of the 1960s , should be lifted .
this demand is expected to be a major sticking point between the two sides . for its part , the cdu has hinted that it might make concessions to the greens on drawing up a more humanitarian asylum law . clock ticking experts believe if nothing else , time pressure will ensure that the two sides are forced to reach agreement on the immigration law .

but there 's news for these macho male roadsters : women design cars . actually the news is anything but new .
more than a century ago , one mary anderson of the united states got the ball rolling when she registered a patent for the indispensable - especially in northern europe - windshield wipers .
and what a trendsetter she turned out to be .
the motoring association auto club europe also credits women with the invention of spiked tires and dipping headlights . it all goes to show that women quite evidently have a more meaningful relationship with cars than their bikini-clad romps on top of them might suggest , but the partnership has never been quite as serious as now .
at this year 's geneva motor show , swedish car manufacturer volvo unveiled a super-slick , stunningly-stylish new car called " your concept car " or " ycc . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 09.03.2004 trade union boss reproaches " oppressive " discount stores großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : discount supermarkets lidl and aldi are among those accused of compromising their workers rights .
frank bsirske , the chairman of german trade union verdi , spoke out publicly against three of germany 's biggest discount retailers on monday and criticized their working conditions and perceived lack of employee rights . choosing international women 's day to launch his scathing criticism of the working practices of german discount supermarkets aldi and lidl and no-frills chemist chain schlecker , frank bsirske named and shamed those companies considered by his union to rule their empires with iron fists and a culture of fear , accusing them of using " intimidation as a commercial model . "
the timing of his outburst was carefully considered .
according to the verdi trade union boss about 100,000 german women work in the 10,500 schlecker shops , 3,500 aldis and 2,500 lidl branches nationwide , mostly in part-time positions and mostly in conditions unacceptable in this modern age .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verdi chief frank bsirske " the success of the discounters bathes in the sun , " said bsirske -lrb- photo -rrb- at a protest against working conditions outside a schlecker outlet in hanau on monday .
" but the terms of employment for the employee remains in shadow . "
accusing the discount giants of operating like the industrial tyrants of the 19th century , bsirske added that rate of pay contracts had been ignored , resulting in staff wages under the national average and hours of overtime that often go unpaid .
talk of unions met with threats those employees considering joining a union had been intimidated out of doing so , with many companies actively blocking any action by works committees throughout their branches , the verdi chairman declared .
" threats are not isolated cases in the climate of fear , " he said , calling the treatment of many workers " degrading . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : discounters command a 30 percent share of the german retail market but may find their control slipping if verdi carries out its threats to take action against those companies it sees as being the main offenders .
leading the union 's hit-list is lidl , the german supermarket sector 's second largest concern .
big names facing the " last resort " according to the union , lidl has refused every collaboration with verdi , completely banning trade unionists throughout its empire .
verdi has stated that , if lidl refuses to admit organized works committee elections in its establishments and assigned branches , the union will be forced to apply its " last resort . "
that could be a referral to the federal board of trade and a subsequent investigation .
a similar fate could await aldi whose southern division is also accused of suppressing union activity throughout its branches .
attempts to create committee initiatives for the rights of workers have been " strangled by massive pressure , " according to bsirske , even in central offices where the number of employees is much higher than on the shop floor .
employees under stress and suspicion however , while verdi is concerned about the lack of union representation in discount businesses , bsirske said that the state of employment conditions is worse than the massive impediment to works committee initiatives in all three named discounters .
lack of adequate numbers of staff , extended working hours and frequent loneliness in stores has caused stress and achievement pressure in many employees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to the union , some employees have also complained about frequent controls at the cash registers , about searches of handbags and lockers and about " house visits " by superiors after a staff member has called in sick or after a union engagement .
verdi also claims the price war between the discount chains is causing more and more pressure on their staff members with little or no extra reward for the increased workload and stress .
with verdi members currently picketing discount store branches and distributing leaflets to staff members , the war of words seems set to continue . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the american way of aldi a u.s. business magazine telling americans to “ buy german ? ”

gerhard schröder is no stranger to taking on the press when its coverage of him does n't pass muster .
but now that he 's decided to give the nation 's best-selling tabloid the cold shoulder , journalists are fighting back . gerhard schröder 's latest tussle with the media bears an uncanny resemblance to a schoolyard brawl .
germany 's biggest-selling daily , bild zeitung , prints some critical stories about schröder 's economic and social reforms . the chancellor , nose clearly out of joint , responds by saying he 's no longer talking to bild .
his spokesman , bela anda - a former bild journalist himself - criticizes the paper 's reporting style , calling it " a mixture of malice , agitation and contempt for the politicians , garnished with half-truths . " following the accusations , made last week , the tabloid remained cool , saying the decision only made schröder 's government look bad .
then , several bild journalists accused the government of excluding them from accompanying the chancellor on trips .
anda denies any such boycott , and says if bild reporters have to stay home , it 's because of lack of space on schröder 's plane . reporters fight for their rights sensing that the weaker party is being bullied , the german journalists ' union , djv , stepped in on monday to flex some muscle .
its head , michael konken , wrote a letter to anda , accusing the government of being overly sensitive and high-handed .
the exclusion of journalists , he says , is " a blatant transgression against the freedom of the press and their duty to report information . " " the only party responsible for the current critical nature of reports in the media is the government 's unprofessional public relations department , which seems incapable of communicating the strategies of the politicians to the media and the people in this country , " konken wrote . media chancellor ? schröder 's decision to stop granting interviews to bild bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder 's government accuses " bild " of bias. did n't exactly come out of nowhere .
the chancellor has been disgruntled with the paper 's political coverage for weeks .

"
gerhard schröder is no stranger to taking on the press when its coverage of him does n't pass muster .
but now that he 's decided to give the nation 's best-selling tabloid the cold shoulder , journalists are fighting back . gerhard schröder 's latest tussle with the media bears an uncanny resemblance to a schoolyard brawl .
germany 's biggest-selling daily , bild zeitung , prints some critical stories about schröder 's economic and social reforms . the chancellor , nose clearly out of joint , responds by saying he 's no longer talking to bild .
his spokesman , bela anda - a former bild journalist himself - criticizes the paper 's reporting style , calling it " a mixture of malice , agitation and contempt for the politicians , garnished with half-truths . " following the accusations , made last week , the tabloid remained cool , saying the decision only made schröder 's government look bad .
then , several bild journalists accused the government of excluding them from accompanying the chancellor on trips .
anda denies any such boycott , and says if bild reporters have to stay home , it 's because of lack of space on schröder 's plane . reporters fight for their rights sensing that the weaker party is being bullied , the german journalists ' union , djv , stepped in on monday to flex some muscle .
its head , michael konken , wrote a letter to anda , accusing the government of being overly sensitive and high-handed .
the exclusion of journalists , he says , is " a blatant transgression against the freedom of the press and their duty to report information . " " the only party responsible for the current critical nature of reports in the media is the government 's unprofessional public relations department , which seems incapable of communicating the strategies of the politicians to the media and the people in this country , " konken wrote . media chancellor ? schröder 's decision to stop granting interviews to bild bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder 's government accuses " bild " of bias. did n't exactly come out of nowhere .
the chancellor has been disgruntled with the paper 's political coverage for weeks .
last month , he requested his social democrat parliamentarians to show more restraint when speaking with bild reporters . nor is schröder 's move without precedence .
former chancellor helmut kohl , for example , refused to grant interviews to der spiegel , after accusing the news magazine of distorting its coverage of him . but schröder is germany 's self-proclaimed " media chancellor " - the man who once said that all he needed to govern were the tabloids and television .
as such , some would say he ought to know better .
this is n't the first time schröder has taken on the media for running unflattering stories about him .
but despite winning past battles , there 's a general sense that schröder is a bad sport . last year , the chancellor won a court order to stop speculation in the press about whether or not he dyed his hair -lrb- he does n't , by the way -rrb- . schröder 's lawyers also won an injunction against the british tabloid mail on sunday after it alleged that schröder 's fourth marriage was on the rocks . depending on how far schröder 's tiff with bild stretches , the tables could soon be turned .
djv head michael konken 's advice to journalists who feel they 've been excluded from accompanying the chancellor on trips because they 're not " on message " ?

frank bsirske , the chairman of german trade union verdi , spoke out publicly against three of germany 's biggest discount retailers on monday and criticized their working conditions and perceived lack of employee rights . choosing international women 's day to launch his scathing criticism of the working practices of german discount supermarkets aldi and lidl and no-frills chemist chain schlecker , frank bsirske named and shamed those companies considered by his union to rule their empires with iron fists and a culture of fear , accusing them of using " intimidation as a commercial model . "
the timing of his outburst was carefully considered .
according to the verdi trade union boss about 100,000 german women work in the 10,500 schlecker shops , 3,500 aldis and 2,500 lidl branches nationwide , mostly in part-time positions and mostly in conditions unacceptable in this modern age .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verdi chief frank bsirske " the success of the discounters bathes in the sun , " said bsirske -lrb- photo -rrb- at a protest against working conditions outside a schlecker outlet in hanau on monday .
" but the terms of employment for the employee remains in shadow . "
accusing the discount giants of operating like the industrial tyrants of the 19th century , bsirske added that rate of pay contracts had been ignored , resulting in staff wages under the national average and hours of overtime that often go unpaid .
talk of unions met with threats those employees considering joining a union had been intimidated out of doing so , with many companies actively blocking any action by works committees throughout their branches , the verdi chairman declared .
" threats are not isolated cases in the climate of fear , " he said , calling the treatment of many workers " degrading . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : discounters command a 30 percent share of the german retail market but may find their control slipping if verdi carries out its threats to take action against those companies it sees as being the main offenders .
leading the union 's hit-list is lidl , the german supermarket sector 's second largest concern .
big names facing the " last resort " according to the union , lidl has refused every collaboration with verdi , completely banning trade unionists throughout its empire .
verdi has stated that , if lidl refuses to admit organized works committee elections in its establishments and assigned branches , the union will be forced to apply its " last resort . "
that could be a referral to the federal board of trade and a subsequent investigation .
a similar fate could await aldi whose southern division is also accused of suppressing union activity throughout its branches .
attempts to create committee initiatives for the rights of workers have been " strangled by massive pressure , " according to bsirske , even in central offices where the number of employees is much higher than on the shop floor .
employees under stress and suspicion however , while verdi is concerned about the lack of union representation in discount businesses , bsirske said that the state of employment conditions is worse than the massive impediment to works committee initiatives in all three named discounters .
lack of adequate numbers of staff , extended working hours and frequent loneliness in stores has caused stress and achievement pressure in many employees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to the union , some employees have also complained about frequent controls at the cash registers , about searches of handbags and lockers and about " house visits " by superiors after a staff member has called in sick or after a union engagement .
verdi also claims the price war between the discount chains is causing more and more pressure on their staff members with little or no extra reward for the increased workload and stress .
with verdi members currently picketing discount store branches and distributing leaflets to staff members , the war of words seems set to continue . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the american way of aldi a u.s. business magazine telling americans to “ buy german ? ”

germany 's ruling social democrats and opposition conservatives thrashed out the details of long-debated immigration legislation on monday .
though there 's no talk of a breakthrough , the two sides did make progress . after almost four years of turbulent negotiations , germany 's floundering immigration legislation received a slight boost on monday when a seven-member expert group drawn from the main political parties said it made some progress on finding common ground . german interior minister otto schily of the ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- spoke of an improvement .
" the objectives are n't that far apart anymore , " he said . peter müller of the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- added that the two sides had made progress in the controversial areas of labor-market migration and humanitarian immigration , though details were n't released . müller added they discussed further tricky issues such as the integration of foreigners already in germany as well as the situation of ethnic germans and security . security a sticking point the latter point in particular proved to be a contentious one during monday 's discussions .
the conservatives have been pushing for tighter security measures ever since the discovery that terrorists involved in the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the united states had lived and studied in germany for years and had hatched the plot during that time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily on monday , schily -lrb- photo -rrb- signaled his willingness to facilitate expulsion procedures in the draft law for immigrants suspected of terrorist activities .
" it goes without saying that we do n't want to tolerate immigrants who pose a threat to german security .
we agree that there must be clear provisions that govern the residential status and possible expulsion procedures for such persons , " schily said . gulf between spd and cdu positions the immigration issue has been plagued by the widely divergent positions of the ruling coalition , made up of the spd and the green party , and the opposition cdu and its bavarian sister party csu . while the spd and the greens are in favor of a law aimed at simplifying regulations governing residency permits and making it easier for highly-qualified foreigners to work and live in germany , the cdu / csu argues that in light of germany 's high unemployment rate it would be rash to open its gates to an influx of labor from abroad .
it claims the country has enough problems integrating the seven million foreigners already in the country . the issue first attracted attention when schröder launched a scheme in 2000 to give permits to up to 20,000 computer specialists from india and central europe to work in germany on five-year contracts .
it has been lent new urgency by statistics showing germany faces a demographic time bomb with an increasingly ageing population and declining birth rates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian software expert in addition , german business and industry experts have repeatedly warned that the country faces a severe crunch of scientists and engineers and that highly-qualified foreigners were badly needed in the fields .
immigration is also necessary , they say , for economic growth and the funding of germany 's generous welfare state . signs of compromise schröder 's government came close to sealing germany 's first-ever immigration law in 2002 but suffered a severe setback in december that year when germany 's highest court ruled that it was unconstitutional .
despite the lows , in recent weeks , both sides have loosened their entrenched positions and signaled a willingness to compromise . the spd and greens have agreed to give up demands for a point system , such as in canada or new zealand , that would have allowed immigrants access to the german labor market without proof of a concrete job .
instead , permission would have been based an immigrant 's qualifications , skills and german language knowledge . the ruling coalition insists , though , that a general ban on hiring foreigners from outside the eu , which took effect in 1973 after the massive immigration wave of the 1960s , should be lifted .
this demand is expected to be a major sticking point between the two sides . for its part , the cdu has hinted that it might make concessions to the greens on drawing up a more humanitarian asylum law . clock ticking experts believe if nothing else , time pressure will ensure that the two sides are forced to reach agreement on the immigration law .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emel algan " it looks so colorful and yet it 's just so practical , " algan says .
" it does away with the thousands of safety pins that you need for a conventional muslim headscarf and at the same time covers the throat , hair and ears , " she adds .
tradition and modernity the latter is important for 43-year-old algan , a religious muslim and mother of six , who has worn the traditional muslim hijab or headscarf since her childhood spent in small towns in germany .
in recent months , the muslim headscarf has been the subject of sometimes heated debate in germany about its place in society , and in particular in state-run institutions . algan herself incorporates a mixture of tradition and modernity .
she studied english language and literature at college and now heads a muslim women 's organization .
she began toying with fashionable alternatives to the conventional headscarf a year ago .
" i was unhappy with the widespread prejudices in germany against headscarf-wearing muslim women , prejudices like ' they 're dumb and servile . '
i had nothing to do with all that but i felt like i was being branded the same on account of my headscarf , " algan explains .
search for the neutral islamic headscarf the turmoil brought algan last year to the doorstep of milliner susanne gäbel , who runs a hat shop in the upscale charlottenburg neighborhood .
" i 'm no designer , all i knew is that i wanted something functional yet attractive that would n't look like the traditional headscarf , " algan says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emel algan gäbel says the request was an unusual one .
" i did n't have any experience with islamic headscarves , though i had done something traditional for jewish customers and for women who had undergone chemotherapy and wanted to cover their heads , " she says .
the search for the neutral , non-radical islamic headscarf has resulted in a series of nine innovative headscarf models in varying colors and materials .
some resemble charleston hats , others nordic felt caps , and they all meet the needs of those muslim women who interpret the koran as requiring they cover their hair , ears and throat .
" most of them are like ski caps or hoods with ear flaps that can be simply slipped over the head without needing any buttons or zips .
the fabric has to be elastic like jersey and felt , " gäbel explains .
the alternative headscarves start at € 50 and are custom-made for each individual .
a new person algan , who has now permanently swapped her conventional hijab for the alternative headscarf , says it 's made her feel like a different person .
" every morning when i get up i ask myself what i want to wear because i can now combine my wardrobe with my colorful headgear , " she says .
the change is n't just external either .
" with the new headscarf i feel like i 'm more accepted in a positive sense .
it could be just a banal conversation with the cashier at the supermarket about the weather , but now non-muslims actually notice me and are n't afraid of contact , " she says .
strict social controls algan adds she has no plans to sell the headgear on a commercial basis , but wants to convince younger muslim girls and women to try it out and in doing so , sidestep a proposed ban on the islamic headscarf in state-run institutions in berlin .
she 's now started a women 's discussion group to that purpose .
" i 'm doing all this to just provide some ideas for muslim women , to provide them with an alternative - after all as far as islam goes , there are no rules dictating how we should dress .
we can wear what we want as long as we cover ourselves , " algan says .
but delivering the message is proving harder than expected .
" the reactions have been very reserved so far .
unfortunately , social controls are so strong in muslim society that even if the girls are interested , they do n't have the freedom to express themselves .
they 're worried about what their husbands and mothers-in-law will think , " algan says .

finding takers is a problem . on a sunny winter morning , emel algan drives up in a black mini car to the office of her islamic women 's organization in berlin 's largely turkish kreuzberg district , her pixie-like face framed by a swath of striking pink fabric . indoors , algan -lrb- photo -rrb- does a quick fashion show as she exchanges her cleverly-woven bright hood cum scarf for a jaunty shaded green silk hat with an attached piece of fabric that buttons under the chin and flows to the chest and a floral patterned bandanna-like creation that gathers in at the back of the head .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emel algan " it looks so colorful and yet it 's just so practical , " algan says .
" it does away with the thousands of safety pins that you need for a conventional muslim headscarf and at the same time covers the throat , hair and ears , " she adds .
tradition and modernity the latter is important for 43-year-old algan , a religious muslim and mother of six , who has worn the traditional muslim hijab or headscarf since her childhood spent in small towns in germany .
in recent months , the muslim headscarf has been the subject of sometimes heated debate in germany about its place in society , and in particular in state-run institutions . algan herself incorporates a mixture of tradition and modernity .
she studied english language and literature at college and now heads a muslim women 's organization .
she began toying with fashionable alternatives to the conventional headscarf a year ago .
" i was unhappy with the widespread prejudices in germany against headscarf-wearing muslim women , prejudices like ' they 're dumb and servile . '
i had nothing to do with all that but i felt like i was being branded the same on account of my headscarf , " algan explains .
search for the neutral islamic headscarf the turmoil brought algan last year to the doorstep of milliner susanne gäbel , who runs a hat shop in the upscale charlottenburg neighborhood .
" i 'm no designer , all i knew is that i wanted something functional yet attractive that would n't look like the traditional headscarf , " algan says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emel algan gäbel says the request was an unusual one .
" i did n't have any experience with islamic headscarves , though i had done something traditional for jewish customers and for women who had undergone chemotherapy and wanted to cover their heads , " she says .
the search for the neutral , non-radical islamic headscarf has resulted in a series of nine innovative headscarf models in varying colors and materials .
some resemble charleston hats , others nordic felt caps , and they all meet the needs of those muslim women who interpret the koran as requiring they cover their hair , ears and throat .
" most of them are like ski caps or hoods with ear flaps that can be simply slipped over the head without needing any buttons or zips .
the fabric has to be elastic like jersey and felt , " gäbel explains .
the alternative headscarves start at € 50 and are custom-made for each individual .
a new person algan , who has now permanently swapped her conventional hijab for the alternative headscarf , says it 's made her feel like a different person .
" every morning when i get up i ask myself what i want to wear because i can now combine my wardrobe with my colorful headgear , " she says .
the change is n't just external either .
" with the new headscarf i feel like i 'm more accepted in a positive sense .
it could be just a banal conversation with the cashier at the supermarket about the weather , but now non-muslims actually notice me and are n't afraid of contact , " she says .

germany 's ruling social democrats and opposition conservatives thrashed out the details of long-debated immigration legislation on monday .
though there 's no talk of a breakthrough , the two sides did make progress . after almost four years of turbulent negotiations , germany 's floundering immigration legislation received a slight boost on monday when a seven-member expert group drawn from the main political parties said it made some progress on finding common ground . german interior minister otto schily of the ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- spoke of an improvement .
" the objectives are n't that far apart anymore , " he said . peter müller of the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- added that the two sides had made progress in the controversial areas of labor-market migration and humanitarian immigration , though details were n't released . müller added they discussed further tricky issues such as the integration of foreigners already in germany as well as the situation of ethnic germans and security . security a sticking point the latter point in particular proved to be a contentious one during monday 's discussions .
the conservatives have been pushing for tighter security measures ever since the discovery that terrorists involved in the sept .

" it goes without saying that we do n't want to tolerate immigrants who pose a threat to german security .
we agree that there must be clear provisions that govern the residential status and possible expulsion procedures for such persons , " schily said . gulf between spd and cdu positions the immigration issue has been plagued by the widely divergent positions of the ruling coalition , made up of the spd and the green party , and the opposition cdu and its bavarian sister party csu . while the spd and the greens are in favor of a law aimed at simplifying regulations governing residency permits and making it easier for highly-qualified foreigners to work and live in germany , the cdu / csu argues that in light of germany 's high unemployment rate it would be rash to open its gates to an influx of labor from abroad .
it claims the country has enough problems integrating the seven million foreigners already in the country . the issue first attracted attention when schröder launched a scheme in 2000 to give permits to up to 20,000 computer specialists from india and central europe to work in germany on five-year contracts .
it has been lent new urgency by statistics showing germany faces a demographic time bomb with an increasingly ageing population and declining birth rates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian software expert in addition , german business and industry experts have repeatedly warned that the country faces a severe crunch of scientists and engineers and that highly-qualified foreigners were badly needed in the fields .
immigration is also necessary , they say , for economic growth and the funding of germany 's generous welfare state . signs of compromise schröder 's government came close to sealing germany 's first-ever immigration law in 2002 but suffered a severe setback in december that year when germany 's highest court ruled that it was unconstitutional .
despite the lows , in recent weeks , both sides have loosened their entrenched positions and signaled a willingness to compromise . the spd and greens have agreed to give up demands for a point system , such as in canada or new zealand , that would have allowed immigrants access to the german labor market without proof of a concrete job .
instead , permission would have been based an immigrant 's qualifications , skills and german language knowledge . the ruling coalition insists , though , that a general ban on hiring foreigners from outside the eu , which took effect in 1973 after the massive immigration wave of the 1960s , should be lifted .
this demand is expected to be a major sticking point between the two sides . for its part , the cdu has hinted that it might make concessions to the greens on drawing up a more humanitarian asylum law . clock ticking experts believe if nothing else , time pressure will ensure that the two sides are forced to reach agreement on the immigration law .

germany 's ruling social democrats and opposition conservatives thrashed out the details of long-debated immigration legislation on monday .
though there 's no talk of a breakthrough , the two sides did make progress . after almost four years of turbulent negotiations , germany 's floundering immigration legislation received a slight boost on monday when a seven-member expert group drawn from the main political parties said it made some progress on finding common ground . german interior minister otto schily of the ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- spoke of an improvement .
" the objectives are n't that far apart anymore , " he said . peter müller of the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- added that the two sides had made progress in the controversial areas of labor-market migration and humanitarian immigration , though details were n't released . müller added they discussed further tricky issues such as the integration of foreigners already in germany as well as the situation of ethnic germans and security . security a sticking point the latter point in particular proved to be a contentious one during monday 's discussions .
the conservatives have been pushing for tighter security measures ever since the discovery that terrorists involved in the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the united states had lived and studied in germany for years and had hatched the plot during that time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily on monday , schily -lrb- photo -rrb- signaled his willingness to facilitate expulsion procedures in the draft law for immigrants suspected of terrorist activities .
" it goes without saying that we do n't want to tolerate immigrants who pose a threat to german security .
we agree that there must be clear provisions that govern the residential status and possible expulsion procedures for such persons , " schily said . gulf between spd and cdu positions the immigration issue has been plagued by the widely divergent positions of the ruling coalition , made up of the spd and the green party , and the opposition cdu and its bavarian sister party csu . while the spd and the greens are in favor of a law aimed at simplifying regulations governing residency permits and making it easier for highly-qualified foreigners to work and live in germany , the cdu / csu argues that in light of germany 's high unemployment rate it would be rash to open its gates to an influx of labor from abroad .
it claims the country has enough problems integrating the seven million foreigners already in the country . the issue first attracted attention when schröder launched a scheme in 2000 to give permits to up to 20,000 computer specialists from india and central europe to work in germany on five-year contracts .
it has been lent new urgency by statistics showing germany faces a demographic time bomb with an increasingly ageing population and declining birth rates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian software expert in addition , german business and industry experts have repeatedly warned that the country faces a severe crunch of scientists and engineers and that highly-qualified foreigners were badly needed in the fields .
immigration is also necessary , they say , for economic growth and the funding of germany 's generous welfare state . signs of compromise schröder 's government came close to sealing germany 's first-ever immigration law in 2002 but suffered a severe setback in december that year when germany 's highest court ruled that it was unconstitutional .
despite the lows , in recent weeks , both sides have loosened their entrenched positions and signaled a willingness to compromise . the spd and greens have agreed to give up demands for a point system , such as in canada or new zealand , that would have allowed immigrants access to the german labor market without proof of a concrete job .
instead , permission would have been based an immigrant 's qualifications , skills and german language knowledge . the ruling coalition insists , though , that a general ban on hiring foreigners from outside the eu , which took effect in 1973 after the massive immigration wave of the 1960s , should be lifted .
this demand is expected to be a major sticking point between the two sides . for its part , the cdu has hinted that it might make concessions to the greens on drawing up a more humanitarian asylum law . clock ticking experts believe if nothing else , time pressure will ensure that the two sides are forced to reach agreement on the immigration law .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asylum-seekers in frankfurt it 's not just germany 's own economic and labor problems that are demanding attention , but even brussels is pushing germany to clear its stance on asylum policies before may 1 to make way for the implementation of a common european policy on asylum protection before it takes in the 10 new eastern and southern european members . the parties will meet again on friday to continue negotiations on the immigration law . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany offers newcomers " how to " book the german government has released a handbook for immigrants aimed to serve as a guide through the labyrinth of german ways .

the defense lawyer for imprisoned russian oil magnate mikhail khodorkovsky visited berlin on monday to raise awareness for the case , as his client allegedly stands no chance of receiving a fair trial . a fair trial is all that mikhail khodorkovsky wants , however , according to robert amsterdam , his canadian lawyer , khodorkovsky , the former ceo of yukos oil company , who has been charged with fraud and tax evasion , has rejected any offers by supporters to buy his freedom with yukos shares . " i have n't received any instructions but to take every legal action possible , " amsterdam said during a dw-world interview .
while he has not been able to see his client in private since his arrest last october , the lawyer said contact still existed . asked whether he believed the kremlin could reverse its attitude towards the case after the march 14 presidential elections , which putin is all but certain to win , amsterdam said he had no idea what would happen : " the one thing i 've learned about russia is : ' do n't even try to predict tomorrow because you do n't even understand yesterday .

he claimed moscow 's basmanny court , which is handling the case , was not independent in its decisions . " basmanny justice means no justice at all , " he said , adding that khodorkovsky 's potential release on bail after a march 25 hearing could only happen with the government 's approval .

frank bsirske , the chairman of german trade union verdi , spoke out publicly against three of germany 's biggest discount retailers on monday and criticized their working conditions and perceived lack of employee rights . choosing international women 's day to launch his scathing criticism of the working practices of german discount supermarkets aldi and lidl and no-frills chemist chain schlecker , frank bsirske named and shamed those companies considered by his union to rule their empires with iron fists and a culture of fear , accusing them of using " intimidation as a commercial model . "
the timing of his outburst was carefully considered .
according to the verdi trade union boss about 100,000 german women work in the 10,500 schlecker shops , 3,500 aldis and 2,500 lidl branches nationwide , mostly in part-time positions and mostly in conditions unacceptable in this modern age .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verdi chief frank bsirske " the success of the discounters bathes in the sun , " said bsirske -lrb- photo -rrb- at a protest against working conditions outside a schlecker outlet in hanau on monday .
" but the terms of employment for the employee remains in shadow . "
accusing the discount giants of operating like the industrial tyrants of the 19th century , bsirske added that rate of pay contracts had been ignored , resulting in staff wages under the national average and hours of overtime that often go unpaid .
talk of unions met with threats those employees considering joining a union had been intimidated out of doing so , with many companies actively blocking any action by works committees throughout their branches , the verdi chairman declared .
" threats are not isolated cases in the climate of fear , " he said , calling the treatment of many workers " degrading . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : discounters command a 30 percent share of the german retail market but may find their control slipping if verdi carries out its threats to take action against those companies it sees as being the main offenders .
leading the union 's hit-list is lidl , the german supermarket sector 's second largest concern .
big names facing the " last resort " according to the union , lidl has refused every collaboration with verdi , completely banning trade unionists throughout its empire .
verdi has stated that , if lidl refuses to admit organized works committee elections in its establishments and assigned branches , the union will be forced to apply its " last resort . "
that could be a referral to the federal board of trade and a subsequent investigation .
a similar fate could await aldi whose southern division is also accused of suppressing union activity throughout its branches .
attempts to create committee initiatives for the rights of workers have been " strangled by massive pressure , " according to bsirske , even in central offices where the number of employees is much higher than on the shop floor .
employees under stress and suspicion however , while verdi is concerned about the lack of union representation in discount businesses , bsirske said that the state of employment conditions is worse than the massive impediment to works committee initiatives in all three named discounters .
lack of adequate numbers of staff , extended working hours and frequent loneliness in stores has caused stress and achievement pressure in many employees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to the union , some employees have also complained about frequent controls at the cash registers , about searches of handbags and lockers and about " house visits " by superiors after a staff member has called in sick or after a union engagement .
verdi also claims the price war between the discount chains is causing more and more pressure on their staff members with little or no extra reward for the increased workload and stress .

frank bsirske , the chairman of german trade union verdi , spoke out publicly against three of germany 's biggest discount retailers on monday and criticized their working conditions and perceived lack of employee rights . choosing international women 's day to launch his scathing criticism of the working practices of german discount supermarkets aldi and lidl and no-frills chemist chain schlecker , frank bsirske named and shamed those companies considered by his union to rule their empires with iron fists and a culture of fear , accusing them of using " intimidation as a commercial model . "
the timing of his outburst was carefully considered .
according to the verdi trade union boss about 100,000 german women work in the 10,500 schlecker shops , 3,500 aldis and 2,500 lidl branches nationwide , mostly in part-time positions and mostly in conditions unacceptable in this modern age .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verdi chief frank bsirske " the success of the discounters bathes in the sun , " said bsirske -lrb- photo -rrb- at a protest against working conditions outside a schlecker outlet in hanau on monday .
" but the terms of employment for the employee remains in shadow . "
accusing the discount giants of operating like the industrial tyrants of the 19th century , bsirske added that rate of pay contracts had been ignored , resulting in staff wages under the national average and hours of overtime that often go unpaid .
talk of unions met with threats those employees considering joining a union had been intimidated out of doing so , with many companies actively blocking any action by works committees throughout their branches , the verdi chairman declared .
" threats are not isolated cases in the climate of fear , " he said , calling the treatment of many workers " degrading . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : discounters command a 30 percent share of the german retail market but may find their control slipping if verdi carries out its threats to take action against those companies it sees as being the main offenders .
leading the union 's hit-list is lidl , the german supermarket sector 's second largest concern .
big names facing the " last resort " according to the union , lidl has refused every collaboration with verdi , completely banning trade unionists throughout its empire .
verdi has stated that , if lidl refuses to admit organized works committee elections in its establishments and assigned branches , the union will be forced to apply its " last resort . "
that could be a referral to the federal board of trade and a subsequent investigation .
a similar fate could await aldi whose southern division is also accused of suppressing union activity throughout its branches .

germany 's ruling social democrats and opposition conservatives thrashed out the details of long-debated immigration legislation on monday .
though there 's no talk of a breakthrough , the two sides did make progress . after almost four years of turbulent negotiations , germany 's floundering immigration legislation received a slight boost on monday when a seven-member expert group drawn from the main political parties said it made some progress on finding common ground . german interior minister otto schily of the ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- spoke of an improvement .
" the objectives are n't that far apart anymore , " he said . peter müller of the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- added that the two sides had made progress in the controversial areas of labor-market migration and humanitarian immigration , though details were n't released . müller added they discussed further tricky issues such as the integration of foreigners already in germany as well as the situation of ethnic germans and security . security a sticking point the latter point in particular proved to be a contentious one during monday 's discussions .
the conservatives have been pushing for tighter security measures ever since the discovery that terrorists involved in the sept .

" it goes without saying that we do n't want to tolerate immigrants who pose a threat to german security .
we agree that there must be clear provisions that govern the residential status and possible expulsion procedures for such persons , " schily said . gulf between spd and cdu positions the immigration issue has been plagued by the widely divergent positions of the ruling coalition , made up of the spd and the green party , and the opposition cdu and its bavarian sister party csu . while the spd and the greens are in favor of a law aimed at simplifying regulations governing residency permits and making it easier for highly-qualified foreigners to work and live in germany , the cdu / csu argues that in light of germany 's high unemployment rate it would be rash to open its gates to an influx of labor from abroad .
it claims the country has enough problems integrating the seven million foreigners already in the country . the issue first attracted attention when schröder launched a scheme in 2000 to give permits to up to 20,000 computer specialists from india and central europe to work in germany on five-year contracts .
it has been lent new urgency by statistics showing germany faces a demographic time bomb with an increasingly ageing population and declining birth rates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian software expert in addition , german business and industry experts have repeatedly warned that the country faces a severe crunch of scientists and engineers and that highly-qualified foreigners were badly needed in the fields .
immigration is also necessary , they say , for economic growth and the funding of germany 's generous welfare state . signs of compromise schröder 's government came close to sealing germany 's first-ever immigration law in 2002 but suffered a severe setback in december that year when germany 's highest court ruled that it was unconstitutional .
despite the lows , in recent weeks , both sides have loosened their entrenched positions and signaled a willingness to compromise . the spd and greens have agreed to give up demands for a point system , such as in canada or new zealand , that would have allowed immigrants access to the german labor market without proof of a concrete job .
instead , permission would have been based an immigrant 's qualifications , skills and german language knowledge . the ruling coalition insists , though , that a general ban on hiring foreigners from outside the eu , which took effect in 1973 after the massive immigration wave of the 1960s , should be lifted .
this demand is expected to be a major sticking point between the two sides . for its part , the cdu has hinted that it might make concessions to the greens on drawing up a more humanitarian asylum law . clock ticking experts believe if nothing else , time pressure will ensure that the two sides are forced to reach agreement on the immigration law .

germany 's ruling social democrats and opposition conservatives thrashed out the details of long-debated immigration legislation on monday .
though there 's no talk of a breakthrough , the two sides did make progress . after almost four years of turbulent negotiations , germany 's floundering immigration legislation received a slight boost on monday when a seven-member expert group drawn from the main political parties said it made some progress on finding common ground . german interior minister otto schily of the ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- spoke of an improvement .
" the objectives are n't that far apart anymore , " he said . peter müller of the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- added that the two sides had made progress in the controversial areas of labor-market migration and humanitarian immigration , though details were n't released . müller added they discussed further tricky issues such as the integration of foreigners already in germany as well as the situation of ethnic germans and security . security a sticking point the latter point in particular proved to be a contentious one during monday 's discussions .
the conservatives have been pushing for tighter security measures ever since the discovery that terrorists involved in the sept .

" it goes without saying that we do n't want to tolerate immigrants who pose a threat to german security .
we agree that there must be clear provisions that govern the residential status and possible expulsion procedures for such persons , " schily said . gulf between spd and cdu positions the immigration issue has been plagued by the widely divergent positions of the ruling coalition , made up of the spd and the green party , and the opposition cdu and its bavarian sister party csu . while the spd and the greens are in favor of a law aimed at simplifying regulations governing residency permits and making it easier for highly-qualified foreigners to work and live in germany , the cdu / csu argues that in light of germany 's high unemployment rate it would be rash to open its gates to an influx of labor from abroad .
it claims the country has enough problems integrating the seven million foreigners already in the country . the issue first attracted attention when schröder launched a scheme in 2000 to give permits to up to 20,000 computer specialists from india and central europe to work in germany on five-year contracts .
it has been lent new urgency by statistics showing germany faces a demographic time bomb with an increasingly ageing population and declining birth rates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian software expert in addition , german business and industry experts have repeatedly warned that the country faces a severe crunch of scientists and engineers and that highly-qualified foreigners were badly needed in the fields .
immigration is also necessary , they say , for economic growth and the funding of germany 's generous welfare state . signs of compromise schröder 's government came close to sealing germany 's first-ever immigration law in 2002 but suffered a severe setback in december that year when germany 's highest court ruled that it was unconstitutional .
despite the lows , in recent weeks , both sides have loosened their entrenched positions and signaled a willingness to compromise . the spd and greens have agreed to give up demands for a point system , such as in canada or new zealand , that would have allowed immigrants access to the german labor market without proof of a concrete job .
instead , permission would have been based an immigrant 's qualifications , skills and german language knowledge . the ruling coalition insists , though , that a general ban on hiring foreigners from outside the eu , which took effect in 1973 after the massive immigration wave of the 1960s , should be lifted .
this demand is expected to be a major sticking point between the two sides . for its part , the cdu has hinted that it might make concessions to the greens on drawing up a more humanitarian asylum law . clock ticking experts believe if nothing else , time pressure will ensure that the two sides are forced to reach agreement on the immigration law .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 09.03.2004 european press review : a tough road ahead for greece european editorialists weighed in on the challenges facing greece 's newly-elected government on tuesday , from the upcoming olympic games to the reunification of cyprus . some good news for once , wrote germany 's handelsblatt .
iraq now has its own constitution , more or less on the first anniversary of the start of the war .
this is a welcome , visible step on the road to sovereignty and democracy .
it is something upon which iraq can build , and from which it can draw strength .
every new component that is added to the new order makes it more difficult for terrorists to turn the clock back . the süddeutsche zeitung from munich said iraq now has a basic law that guarantees the individual citizen freedom of expression and protection from tyranny for the first time in decades .
but that does not automatically mean a peaceful future .
the long term objective of any iraqi government must be to rid the country of the occupiers .

finding takers is a problem . on a sunny winter morning , emel algan drives up in a black mini car to the office of her islamic women 's organization in berlin 's largely turkish kreuzberg district , her pixie-like face framed by a swath of striking pink fabric . indoors , algan -lrb- photo -rrb- does a quick fashion show as she exchanges her cleverly-woven bright hood cum scarf for a jaunty shaded green silk hat with an attached piece of fabric that buttons under the chin and flows to the chest and a floral patterned bandanna-like creation that gathers in at the back of the head .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emel algan " it looks so colorful and yet it 's just so practical , " algan says .
" it does away with the thousands of safety pins that you need for a conventional muslim headscarf and at the same time covers the throat , hair and ears , " she adds .
tradition and modernity the latter is important for 43-year-old algan , a religious muslim and mother of six , who has worn the traditional muslim hijab or headscarf since her childhood spent in small towns in germany .
in recent months , the muslim headscarf has been the subject of sometimes heated debate in germany about its place in society , and in particular in state-run institutions . algan herself incorporates a mixture of tradition and modernity .

she began toying with fashionable alternatives to the conventional headscarf a year ago .
" i was unhappy with the widespread prejudices in germany against headscarf-wearing muslim women , prejudices like ' they 're dumb and servile . '
i had nothing to do with all that but i felt like i was being branded the same on account of my headscarf , " algan explains .
search for the neutral islamic headscarf the turmoil brought algan last year to the doorstep of milliner susanne gäbel , who runs a hat shop in the upscale charlottenburg neighborhood .
" i 'm no designer , all i knew is that i wanted something functional yet attractive that would n't look like the traditional headscarf , " algan says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emel algan gäbel says the request was an unusual one .
" i did n't have any experience with islamic headscarves , though i had done something traditional for jewish customers and for women who had undergone chemotherapy and wanted to cover their heads , " she says .
the search for the neutral , non-radical islamic headscarf has resulted in a series of nine innovative headscarf models in varying colors and materials .
some resemble charleston hats , others nordic felt caps , and they all meet the needs of those muslim women who interpret the koran as requiring they cover their hair , ears and throat .
" most of them are like ski caps or hoods with ear flaps that can be simply slipped over the head without needing any buttons or zips .
the fabric has to be elastic like jersey and felt , " gäbel explains .
the alternative headscarves start at € 50 and are custom-made for each individual .
a new person algan , who has now permanently swapped her conventional hijab for the alternative headscarf , says it 's made her feel like a different person .
" every morning when i get up i ask myself what i want to wear because i can now combine my wardrobe with my colorful headgear , " she says .
the change is n't just external either .
" with the new headscarf i feel like i 'm more accepted in a positive sense .
it could be just a banal conversation with the cashier at the supermarket about the weather , but now non-muslims actually notice me and are n't afraid of contact , " she says .
strict social controls algan adds she has no plans to sell the headgear on a commercial basis , but wants to convince younger muslim girls and women to try it out and in doing so , sidestep a proposed ban on the islamic headscarf in state-run institutions in berlin .
she 's now started a women 's discussion group to that purpose .
" i 'm doing all this to just provide some ideas for muslim women , to provide them with an alternative - after all as far as islam goes , there are no rules dictating how we should dress .
we can wear what we want as long as we cover ourselves , " algan says .
but delivering the message is proving harder than expected .
" the reactions have been very reserved so far .
unfortunately , social controls are so strong in muslim society that even if the girls are interested , they do n't have the freedom to express themselves .
they 're worried about what their husbands and mothers-in-law will think , " algan says .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emel algan gäbel says the request was an unusual one .
" i did n't have any experience with islamic headscarves , though i had done something traditional for jewish customers and for women who had undergone chemotherapy and wanted to cover their heads , " she says .
the search for the neutral , non-radical islamic headscarf has resulted in a series of nine innovative headscarf models in varying colors and materials .
some resemble charleston hats , others nordic felt caps , and they all meet the needs of those muslim women who interpret the koran as requiring they cover their hair , ears and throat .
" most of them are like ski caps or hoods with ear flaps that can be simply slipped over the head without needing any buttons or zips .
the fabric has to be elastic like jersey and felt , " gäbel explains .
the alternative headscarves start at € 50 and are custom-made for each individual .
a new person algan , who has now permanently swapped her conventional hijab for the alternative headscarf , says it 's made her feel like a different person .
" every morning when i get up i ask myself what i want to wear because i can now combine my wardrobe with my colorful headgear , " she says .
the change is n't just external either .
" with the new headscarf i feel like i 'm more accepted in a positive sense .
it could be just a banal conversation with the cashier at the supermarket about the weather , but now non-muslims actually notice me and are n't afraid of contact , " she says .
strict social controls algan adds she has no plans to sell the headgear on a commercial basis , but wants to convince younger muslim girls and women to try it out and in doing so , sidestep a proposed ban on the islamic headscarf in state-run institutions in berlin .
she 's now started a women 's discussion group to that purpose .
" i 'm doing all this to just provide some ideas for muslim women , to provide them with an alternative - after all as far as islam goes , there are no rules dictating how we should dress .
we can wear what we want as long as we cover ourselves , " algan says .
but delivering the message is proving harder than expected .
" the reactions have been very reserved so far .
unfortunately , social controls are so strong in muslim society that even if the girls are interested , they do n't have the freedom to express themselves .
they 're worried about what their husbands and mothers-in-law will think , " algan says .

finding takers is a problem . on a sunny winter morning , emel algan drives up in a black mini car to the office of her islamic women 's organization in berlin 's largely turkish kreuzberg district , her pixie-like face framed by a swath of striking pink fabric . indoors , algan -lrb- photo -rrb- does a quick fashion show as she exchanges her cleverly-woven bright hood cum scarf for a jaunty shaded green silk hat with an attached piece of fabric that buttons under the chin and flows to the chest and a floral patterned bandanna-like creation that gathers in at the back of the head .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emel algan " it looks so colorful and yet it 's just so practical , " algan says .
" it does away with the thousands of safety pins that you need for a conventional muslim headscarf and at the same time covers the throat , hair and ears , " she adds .
tradition and modernity the latter is important for 43-year-old algan , a religious muslim and mother of six , who has worn the traditional muslim hijab or headscarf since her childhood spent in small towns in germany .
in recent months , the muslim headscarf has been the subject of sometimes heated debate in germany about its place in society , and in particular in state-run institutions . algan herself incorporates a mixture of tradition and modernity .
she studied english language and literature at college and now heads a muslim women 's organization .
she began toying with fashionable alternatives to the conventional headscarf a year ago .
" i was unhappy with the widespread prejudices in germany against headscarf-wearing muslim women , prejudices like ' they 're dumb and servile . '
i had nothing to do with all that but i felt like i was being branded the same on account of my headscarf , " algan explains .

the german ferrari pilot raced across the finish line just ahead of his teammate rubens barrichello . six-time world champion michael schumacher proved on sunday he is once again the man to beat this season as he led his ferrari team to a one-two victory in the formula one opener in melbourne , australia .
as the german racer took the checkered flag at albert park only 13.605 seconds ahead of his brazilian teammate rubens barrichello , the clock seemed to roll back to 2002 , when the ferrari duo roared to 15 wins in 17 races .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferrari driver rubens barrichello of brazil holds his trophy to celebrate his victory in the f-1 japanese grand prix at suzuka circuit in suzuka , japan , sunday , oct .
12 , 2003 .
with a record time of 1:24:15.757 hours , the rest of the field paled in comparison to schumi and barrichello .
in third place was the spaniard fernando alonso for renault .
the bmw-williams team disappointed with a fourth and fifth place by ralf schumacher and the colombian juan pablo montoya .
" ferrari was in a class of its own , " said norbert haug , motor sport boss for mclaren-mercendes , which only managed to pull off an 8th place with david coulthard .
" i think ferrari could probably have lapped everybody if they had wanted to ...
i hope 2002 is not coming back . "
italian steed steels show bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferrari pilots michael schumacher and rubens barrichello -lrb- right -rrb- came in first and third at the monza , italy circuit on sept .
14 , 2003 .
" if the headlines are ' ferrari again ' it is not going to be good , " a frustrated montoya said after his hopes of picking up with last year 's third place overall ranking were dashed .
but for the italian carmaker , the season could n't have started better .
" it was a grandiose performance from ferrari , crowned with an equally grandiose result , " boasted the team 's sporting director jean todt .
" the championship has got underway with a dream event . "
for formula one ringmaster , bernie ecclestone , a return of a one-two ferrari sweep spells nothing but disaster .
after new regulations did nothing to slow the italian steed or bring out a new contending champion , the sport 's commercial supremo is worried 2004 could bring a return of the 2002 " formula yawn " when television audiences switched off in droves because the results were foreseeable .
schumacher , however , cautioned his teammates about getting carried away with the glory of the moment .
it is just the first of 18 races , he said : " we need to keep our feet firmly on the ground .
the difficult ones are still to come . "
schumi 's reign continues for the star of the show , who sailed seemingly effortlessly to his 71st grand prix win , the australian opener showed he was still king of the track .
the 35-year old has dominated formula one since 1999 and has given no indication of wanting to hang up his helmet .
" i just love fighting on the circuit and it 's natural to me and as long as i am competitive and the love is there ...
i 'll enjoy it as long as i can , " he vowed . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schumacher wins sixth title early sunday morning formula one fans in germany woke to see their home favorite , michael schumacher , beat out his stiffest rival kimi raikkonen to claim a historic sixth world championship in suzuka , japan .

"
gerhard schröder is no stranger to taking on the press when its coverage of him does n't pass muster .
but now that he 's decided to give the nation 's best-selling tabloid the cold shoulder , journalists are fighting back . gerhard schröder 's latest tussle with the media bears an uncanny resemblance to a schoolyard brawl .
germany 's biggest-selling daily , bild zeitung , prints some critical stories about schröder 's economic and social reforms . the chancellor , nose clearly out of joint , responds by saying he 's no longer talking to bild .
his spokesman , bela anda - a former bild journalist himself - criticizes the paper 's reporting style , calling it " a mixture of malice , agitation and contempt for the politicians , garnished with half-truths . " following the accusations , made last week , the tabloid remained cool , saying the decision only made schröder 's government look bad .
then , several bild journalists accused the government of excluding them from accompanying the chancellor on trips .
anda denies any such boycott , and says if bild reporters have to stay home , it 's because of lack of space on schröder 's plane . reporters fight for their rights sensing that the weaker party is being bullied , the german journalists ' union , djv , stepped in on monday to flex some muscle .
its head , michael konken , wrote a letter to anda , accusing the government of being overly sensitive and high-handed .
the exclusion of journalists , he says , is " a blatant transgression against the freedom of the press and their duty to report information . " " the only party responsible for the current critical nature of reports in the media is the government 's unprofessional public relations department , which seems incapable of communicating the strategies of the politicians to the media and the people in this country , " konken wrote . media chancellor ? schröder 's decision to stop granting interviews to bild bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder 's government accuses " bild " of bias. did n't exactly come out of nowhere .
the chancellor has been disgruntled with the paper 's political coverage for weeks .

former chancellor helmut kohl , for example , refused to grant interviews to der spiegel , after accusing the news magazine of distorting its coverage of him . but schröder is germany 's self-proclaimed " media chancellor " - the man who once said that all he needed to govern were the tabloids and television .

"
gerhard schröder is no stranger to taking on the press when its coverage of him does n't pass muster .
but now that he 's decided to give the nation 's best-selling tabloid the cold shoulder , journalists are fighting back . gerhard schröder 's latest tussle with the media bears an uncanny resemblance to a schoolyard brawl .
germany 's biggest-selling daily , bild zeitung , prints some critical stories about schröder 's economic and social reforms . the chancellor , nose clearly out of joint , responds by saying he 's no longer talking to bild .
his spokesman , bela anda - a former bild journalist himself - criticizes the paper 's reporting style , calling it " a mixture of malice , agitation and contempt for the politicians , garnished with half-truths . " following the accusations , made last week , the tabloid remained cool , saying the decision only made schröder 's government look bad .
then , several bild journalists accused the government of excluding them from accompanying the chancellor on trips .
anda denies any such boycott , and says if bild reporters have to stay home , it 's because of lack of space on schröder 's plane . reporters fight for their rights sensing that the weaker party is being bullied , the german journalists ' union , djv , stepped in on monday to flex some muscle .
its head , michael konken , wrote a letter to anda , accusing the government of being overly sensitive and high-handed .
the exclusion of journalists , he says , is " a blatant transgression against the freedom of the press and their duty to report information . " " the only party responsible for the current critical nature of reports in the media is the government 's unprofessional public relations department , which seems incapable of communicating the strategies of the politicians to the media and the people in this country , " konken wrote . media chancellor ? schröder 's decision to stop granting interviews to bild bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder 's government accuses " bild " of bias. did n't exactly come out of nowhere .
the chancellor has been disgruntled with the paper 's political coverage for weeks .
last month , he requested his social democrat parliamentarians to show more restraint when speaking with bild reporters . nor is schröder 's move without precedence .
former chancellor helmut kohl , for example , refused to grant interviews to der spiegel , after accusing the news magazine of distorting its coverage of him . but schröder is germany 's self-proclaimed " media chancellor " - the man who once said that all he needed to govern were the tabloids and television .
as such , some would say he ought to know better .
this is n't the first time schröder has taken on the media for running unflattering stories about him .
but despite winning past battles , there 's a general sense that schröder is a bad sport . last year , the chancellor won a court order to stop speculation in the press about whether or not he dyed his hair -lrb- he does n't , by the way -rrb- . schröder 's lawyers also won an injunction against the british tabloid mail on sunday after it alleged that schröder 's fourth marriage was on the rocks . depending on how far schröder 's tiff with bild stretches , the tables could soon be turned .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 09.03.2004 giving the headscarf a makeover großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daring to be different - emel algan even as the headscarf row simmers in germany , a berlin muslim has designed colorful alternative headgear that serves the purpose of a traditional hijab but looks like anything but .
finding takers is a problem . on a sunny winter morning , emel algan drives up in a black mini car to the office of her islamic women 's organization in berlin 's largely turkish kreuzberg district , her pixie-like face framed by a swath of striking pink fabric . indoors , algan -lrb- photo -rrb- does a quick fashion show as she exchanges her cleverly-woven bright hood cum scarf for a jaunty shaded green silk hat with an attached piece of fabric that buttons under the chin and flows to the chest and a floral patterned bandanna-like creation that gathers in at the back of the head .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emel algan " it looks so colorful and yet it 's just so practical , " algan says .
" it does away with the thousands of safety pins that you need for a conventional muslim headscarf and at the same time covers the throat , hair and ears , " she adds .
tradition and modernity the latter is important for 43-year-old algan , a religious muslim and mother of six , who has worn the traditional muslim hijab or headscarf since her childhood spent in small towns in germany .
in recent months , the muslim headscarf has been the subject of sometimes heated debate in germany about its place in society , and in particular in state-run institutions . algan herself incorporates a mixture of tradition and modernity .
she studied english language and literature at college and now heads a muslim women 's organization .
she began toying with fashionable alternatives to the conventional headscarf a year ago .
" i was unhappy with the widespread prejudices in germany against headscarf-wearing muslim women , prejudices like ' they 're dumb and servile . '
i had nothing to do with all that but i felt like i was being branded the same on account of my headscarf , " algan explains .
search for the neutral islamic headscarf the turmoil brought algan last year to the doorstep of milliner susanne gäbel , who runs a hat shop in the upscale charlottenburg neighborhood .
" i 'm no designer , all i knew is that i wanted something functional yet attractive that would n't look like the traditional headscarf , " algan says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emel algan gäbel says the request was an unusual one .
" i did n't have any experience with islamic headscarves , though i had done something traditional for jewish customers and for women who had undergone chemotherapy and wanted to cover their heads , " she says .
the search for the neutral , non-radical islamic headscarf has resulted in a series of nine innovative headscarf models in varying colors and materials .
some resemble charleston hats , others nordic felt caps , and they all meet the needs of those muslim women who interpret the koran as requiring they cover their hair , ears and throat .
" most of them are like ski caps or hoods with ear flaps that can be simply slipped over the head without needing any buttons or zips .
the fabric has to be elastic like jersey and felt , " gäbel explains .
the alternative headscarves start at € 50 and are custom-made for each individual .
a new person algan , who has now permanently swapped her conventional hijab for the alternative headscarf , says it 's made her feel like a different person .
" every morning when i get up i ask myself what i want to wear because i can now combine my wardrobe with my colorful headgear , " she says .
the change is n't just external either .
" with the new headscarf i feel like i 'm more accepted in a positive sense .
it could be just a banal conversation with the cashier at the supermarket about the weather , but now non-muslims actually notice me and are n't afraid of contact , " she says .
strict social controls algan adds she has no plans to sell the headgear on a commercial basis , but wants to convince younger muslim girls and women to try it out and in doing so , sidestep a proposed ban on the islamic headscarf in state-run institutions in berlin .
she 's now started a women 's discussion group to that purpose .
" i 'm doing all this to just provide some ideas for muslim women , to provide them with an alternative - after all as far as islam goes , there are no rules dictating how we should dress .
we can wear what we want as long as we cover ourselves , " algan says .
but delivering the message is proving harder than expected .
" the reactions have been very reserved so far .
unfortunately , social controls are so strong in muslim society that even if the girls are interested , they do n't have the freedom to express themselves .
they 're worried about what their husbands and mothers-in-law will think , " algan says .
" this traditional thinking is still deeply-ingrained in muslims here though four generations of them now live here .

the defense lawyer for imprisoned russian oil magnate mikhail khodorkovsky visited berlin on monday to raise awareness for the case , as his client allegedly stands no chance of receiving a fair trial . a fair trial is all that mikhail khodorkovsky wants , however , according to robert amsterdam , his canadian lawyer , khodorkovsky , the former ceo of yukos oil company , who has been charged with fraud and tax evasion , has rejected any offers by supporters to buy his freedom with yukos shares . " i have n't received any instructions but to take every legal action possible , " amsterdam said during a dw-world interview .
while he has not been able to see his client in private since his arrest last october , the lawyer said contact still existed . asked whether he believed the kremlin could reverse its attitude towards the case after the march 14 presidential elections , which putin is all but certain to win , amsterdam said he had no idea what would happen : " the one thing i 've learned about russia is : ' do n't even try to predict tomorrow because you do n't even understand yesterday . " ' a political decision ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mikhail khodorkovsky in prison last november .
a positive outcome for khodorkovsky -lrb- photo -rrb- would have to be sanctioned by the kremlin , amsterdam said .
he claimed moscow 's basmanny court , which is handling the case , was not independent in its decisions . " basmanny justice means no justice at all , " he said , adding that khodorkovsky 's potential release on bail after a march 25 hearing could only happen with the government 's approval .
" this will be a political decision , " amsterdam said , adding that resolution of the situation would take " many months . " in berlin to drum up foreign support for his client 's cause , amsterdam said germans had tremendous influence in russia and should stand up to demand a fair trial . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin -lrb- left -rrb- with german chancellor gerhard schröder at a meeting in moscow last year .
" we know how heroic germany has been with regard to iraq , " amsterdam said , referring to the german government 's opposition to the u.s.-led war .
" and yet with putin there is a sensibility i ca n't even begin to describe . " testing the rule of law in russia he added that khodorkovsky was faced with the possibility of a conviction .
" i think he 's taking a terrible risk , but he 's a russian , " amsterdam said .
" he did n't want to leave when everyone told him to leave . " while adding that khodorkovsky saw his case as a test of the rule of law in russia , amsterdam said , " i don ’ t believe the rule of law is anywhere near this case . " amsterdam also refuted claims by some that khodorkovsky is a single case and not the sign of the kremlin 's crackdown on businesses in russia .
" these types of things are viral , " he said , pointing to monday 's announcement by russia 's interior ministry that international accounting firm deloitte and touche was accused of tax evasion . " there are no one-offs , " he said , adding that he believed others were vulnerable to similar prosecution as well . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans troubled by russian oil tycoon ’ s case berlin has asked vladimir putin to reassure russia ’ s biggest trading partner that it will apply rule of law in its case against yukos chairman mikhail khodorkovsky .

a study by emory university in atlanta found depressed people are more likely to develop an irregular heart beat - which can put them at risk of sudden death .
the study on twins found that the worse the depression , the higher the risk .
details were presented at a meeting of american college of cardiology .
the brain is a complex organ and it is no wonder that ' mental ' illness often comes with many physical effects depression alliance the research found that people who were depressed were more likely to show symptoms of a condition called decreased heart rate variability -lrb- hrv -rrb- .
hrv is a measure of the heart 's ability to adapt to current circumstances .
for instance , during exercise the heart needs to beat faster to pump more oxygen to the muscles , while during sleep a fast heart rate is unnecessary .
a decreased hrv therefore means that the heart is less able to adapt .
it also increase the risk of developing an irregular heart beat - known as an arrhythmia - which in extreme circumstances can trigger sudden death .
nerve abnormality the heart beat is controlled by the autonomic nervous system , which is responsible for regulating basic body functions that are not under our conscious control .
therefore , a decreased hrv is a sign that the autonomic nervous system is not regulating heart beat in the way that it should .
the researchers studied 50 pairs of male twins , who were all free from any signs of heart disease .
their hearts were monitored over a period of 24 hours and they were questioned about symptoms and histories of depression .
the researchers found that people who showed signs of being depressed were more likely to have a decreased hrv .
however , there was no link between decreased hrv and a previous history of depression - suggesting that the state of being depressed has a direct effect on the autonomic nervous system .
researcher dr viola vaccarino said the results suggested that even minor episodes of depression could affect the heart .
he said : " the data suggest that treatment of clinical depression , and perhaps also minor forms of depression , should reduce the risk of coronary heart disease via normalisation of hrv . "
depression alliance , a charity which raises awareness of the problem , called for more research into the link .
" the brain is a complex organ and it is no wonder that ' mental ' illness often comes with many physical effects or that physical illness may be accompanied by ' mental ' ill health .
" indeed , recent research reveals that having depression at the time of undergoing heart bypass surgery doubles the chances of dying .
" whilst it remains unclear as to the precise link between depression and other serious illness we would also call for the implementation of depression screening during routine medical examinations . "
belinda linden , of the british heart foundation said : " it is important that we learn more about the influence of depression on heart rate variability and its effect on cardiac disease .
" it must be remembered that heart rate variability is also dependent on age and inactivity .
" although depression and isolation are clear factors that need to be addressed , it is also vital to consider lifestyle issues such as levels of physical activity , diet and smoking to reduce the risk of coronary heart disease . "

the brain is a complex organ and it is no wonder that ' mental ' illness often comes with many physical effects depression alliance the research found that people who were depressed were more likely to show symptoms of a condition called decreased heart rate variability -lrb- hrv -rrb- .
hrv is a measure of the heart 's ability to adapt to current circumstances .
for instance , during exercise the heart needs to beat faster to pump more oxygen to the muscles , while during sleep a fast heart rate is unnecessary .
a decreased hrv therefore means that the heart is less able to adapt .
it also increase the risk of developing an irregular heart beat - known as an arrhythmia - which in extreme circumstances can trigger sudden death .
nerve abnormality the heart beat is controlled by the autonomic nervous system , which is responsible for regulating basic body functions that are not under our conscious control .
therefore , a decreased hrv is a sign that the autonomic nervous system is not regulating heart beat in the way that it should .
the researchers studied 50 pairs of male twins , who were all free from any signs of heart disease .
their hearts were monitored over a period of 24 hours and they were questioned about symptoms and histories of depression .
the researchers found that people who showed signs of being depressed were more likely to have a decreased hrv .
however , there was no link between decreased hrv and a previous history of depression - suggesting that the state of being depressed has a direct effect on the autonomic nervous system .
researcher dr viola vaccarino said the results suggested that even minor episodes of depression could affect the heart .
he said : " the data suggest that treatment of clinical depression , and perhaps also minor forms of depression , should reduce the risk of coronary heart disease via normalisation of hrv . "
depression alliance , a charity which raises awareness of the problem , called for more research into the link .
" the brain is a complex organ and it is no wonder that ' mental ' illness often comes with many physical effects or that physical illness may be accompanied by ' mental ' ill health .
" indeed , recent research reveals that having depression at the time of undergoing heart bypass surgery doubles the chances of dying .
" whilst it remains unclear as to the precise link between depression and other serious illness we would also call for the implementation of depression screening during routine medical examinations . "
belinda linden , of the british heart foundation said : " it is important that we learn more about the influence of depression on heart rate variability and its effect on cardiac disease .
" it must be remembered that heart rate variability is also dependent on age and inactivity .
" although depression and isolation are clear factors that need to be addressed , it is also vital to consider lifestyle issues such as levels of physical activity , diet and smoking to reduce the risk of coronary heart disease . "

the nfo system three poll conducted for the scottish consumer council -lrb- scc -rrb- , found 40 % were in favour , with 29 % registering some support .
bbc scotland ruled out a scottish six following a review last december .
the main reporting scotland edition is currently broadcast at 6.30pm following the uk-wide 6 o 'clock news .
the survey suggested a further 29 % of respondents had some support for the flagship move , while 34 % of all respondents in lower income groups believed bbc news provided poor value for money .
of the 916 people surveyed , 48 % disagreed and said the bbc provided good value .
these results indicate that there is an appetite for change in scotland that is not being satisfied at the moment scc chairman graeme millar the poll , commissioned ahead of the scc 's submission to a consultation on the review of the bbc 's charter , was carried out in january .
scc chairman graeme millar said : " almost 70 % of the people in the survey favour greater scottish control over news output while only 14 % oppose it .
licence fee " these results indicate that there is an appetite for change in scotland that is not being satisfied at the moment .
" we will pass on the results of the survey to the bbc as part of the public consultation into the current review of the bbc 's charter .
" people pay for the bbc through their licence fee and it is important that the bbc responds to what their viewers and listeners tell them . "
a bbc scotland spokesman said the broadcaster constantly reviewed its news output .
' high satisfaction ' however , he said the idea of a scottish six was currently not being considered following last year 's consultation exercise which , he added , found " quite a high satisfaction " with existing arrangements .
last year , viewers said they were happy with the present reporting scotland format .
but the scottish national party described the decision to shelve the scottish six plan as " disastrous " .

the £ 26m sentinel development by kenmore property group will use led lights to project each floor 's colour .
the innovative illuminations will form part of the city council 's art in the city drive .
specialists kj tait engineers provided technical expertise on the plan and the building will reveal its eye-catching colour by december 2004 .
a tenant occupying the entire building could choose their corporate colours to be beamed into the sky .
kenmore 's mary galbraith said the project was taking office lighting in a different direction .
the lighting is being integrated into the very body of the building mary galbraith kenmore " the lighting is being integrated into the very body of the building so that the property will glow every evening and take the design of today 's office properties onto a new level , " she said .
" the technology has not previously been utilised in the uk and we believe it will attract considerable interest when the project is completed in december . "
gordon murray , of architects gm + ad , said it wanted to integrate colour into the design of the exterior of the building .
" an evolutionary process , the coloured elements were initially conceived as a special glass , " he said .
" however , this proved impractical , limiting the amount of light let into the building during the day and diminishing the colours come evening .
architectural assets " as a result , we moved to a lighting based design . "
the city council has already used led lighting to illuminate glasgow 's bridges .
council leader charles gordon said : " our lighting strategy for glasgow has so far focused on using special lighting effects to highlight our best architectural assets as well as using lighting as an art form .
" the proposals for sentinel support this strategy and we are very pleased a private developer has taken such an imaginative approach to the ongoing process of regeneration for glasgow . "
the led lights are to be mounted inside the windows and will shine down on the fritting - matrix of white lines coated onto the glass - that will pick out the light and produce a ' glow ' .

the led lights are to be mounted inside the windows and will shine down on the fritting - matrix of white lines coated onto the glass - that will pick out the light and produce a ' glow ' .

the proposals , from the policy and resources committee , are due to come before the house on tuesday .
connex was awarded the contract to run jersey 's buses in september 2002 .
shortly after this , jersey bus started up its own easylink service , which ran on busy routes in the summer , often at lower prices than connex .
extra bill the proposals follow claims by the environment and public services committee 's president , deputy maurice dubras , that jersey bus had not told anyone of a 20 % pay rise it agreed with workers around the time it lost the contract to connex .
the pay rise meant an extra bill to taxpayers of about £ 500,000 because the company was still under contract to the states even though the work was about to be moved to connex .
the payment of this money came to light after deputy dubras reviewed connex 's first year in operation in the states at the end of 2003 and gave details of all subsidies paid .
jersey bus boss chris lewis has denied that no-one in the states knew about the pay deal , saying that all tendering companies , the committee and its department had been told of it before any decisions on the tenders were made .

the port of mostyn has been refused permission to dredge the estuary , jeopardising the future of an £ 11bn airbus deal .
the environment agency has turned down the application because port managers have not been able to prove dredging the estuary will not have an adverse effect on the environment .
airbus want to dredge the docks to get their barges in and out of the estuary at all times of the day so they can transport wings for the a380 super jumbo from its plant in broughton to toulouse in france .
without this , the future of wing production in north wales and thousands of jobs are thrown into question .
the environmental fears ... need to be balanced against putting thousands of jobs at risk and the £ 11 billion deal with airbus which could stand in jeopardy bill wiggin mp last friday , welsh secretary peter hain and deputy prime minister john prescott , on visits to the region , both indicated the government would be prepared to intervene to ensure it went ahead .
mr wiggin said he was " astounded " at the decision and said it was the latest in a " long line of broken promises " by the government .
' devastating and breathtaking ' " i understand the environmental fears and they need to be balanced against putting thousands of jobs at risk and the £ 11bn deal with airbus which could stand in jeopardy , " he added .
" peter hain should honour his promise to intervene . "
airbus in broughton makes wings for the a380 super jumbo but on tuesday mr hain said he was very concerned because airbus was a " vital " manufacturer in north east wales .
" it 's a flagship industry for wales and the uk , " he said .
" the wings built there have to get out via the sea , around and down to toulouse where they 're assembled into the finest aircraft in the world .
" the overwhelming public interest is to maintain those jobs and the north east economy .
we have to resolve this .
" airbus ca n't be put in a straight jacket , " he added .
further discussions are to go ahead to try and find a solution .
however , if one can not be reached , the environment agency say they will consider whether the dredging can go ahead on the grounds of public interest and whether the economic arguments outweigh the environmental ones .

using properties of quantum physics , the technique encrypts data with keys that reveal if they have been intercepted or tampered with .
us company magiq and swiss firm id quantique have already sold hardware to several customers keen to protect data with quantum cryptography .
governments and armed forces are thought to be among the first users of the technology .
costly codes encryption usually involves scrambling data with long numeric keys that stop other people reading it . "
once you can guarantee the key is secret , you can use that for encrypting the data or for any other cryptographic tasks you want to do " dr andrew shields , toshiba the information inside the message is effectively kept secure because of the time it would take an eavesdropper to sort through all possible keys used to scramble the data .
but quantum cryptography scrambles data in a different way by using the strange properties of the quantum world to guarantee that keys have been swapped securely .
information about the key is encoded on to a single photon of light .
quantum physics guarantees that the properties of the photon will change if anyone intercepts it and tries to read the information off it .
once two parties have swapped a key that they know to be safe they can be sure that the messages they are sending each other are secure .
" once you can guarantee the key is secret , you can use that for encrypting the data or for any other cryptographic tasks you want to do , " said dr andrew shields , leader of the quantum information group at toshiba 's cambridge laboratory .
bob gelfond , chief executive at magiq , said the improvements in security offered by quantum cryptography were proving popular even though its qpn security gateway cost between $ 50,000 and $ 100,000 .
once connected to a fibre-optic network the magiq hardware allows companies to set up a virtual network they can use to send data encoded with quantum keys .
mr gelfond said quantum cryptography had been established in laboratories for years but magiq 's engineers had worked hard to turn it into a commercial device .
" i think a lot of people thought it would happen later rather than sooner because of those engineering challenges , " he said .
" that was our challenge ; making the system robust enough so it would work in a typical technology environment . "
distant obstacles although the technology is already in use , there are still some limitations to iron out .
for instance there is a limit to the distance that photons can travel before they lose coherence which makes it impossible to read key information .
the current record for long-distance quantum key distribution is 120km .
mr gelfond said now the basic technology was established costs of components and optics would fall .
magiq was also getting a lot of interest from net service firms , said mr gelfond , who wanted to use quantum cryptography to create ultra-secure lines they could sell for a premium .
mr gelfond said his company was working on quantum memory chips , single photon sources and quantum repeaters to help with its long-term goal of creating a commercial quantum computer .

according to the report , the ps3 is expected to sell 32 million units in europe by 2010 , more than the combined sales of the microsoft and nintendo machines .

the battleground could well be the internet , with both future consoles emphasising online play .
analysts see this as a big growth area for gaming .
but there will also be innovations to widen the appeal of the consoles .
the next round of consoles are expected to come with voice recognition and motion detection technology , so that play can become a more social experience .
this will help attract more older people , women and first-time players to gaming , said mr scott .
sony has already enjoyed some success with its eyetoy camera , which allows a player to control a game just by movement .
informa does not write off the current generation of consoles .
the report suggests they could be on sale until the end of the decade .

informa does not write off the current generation of consoles .
the report suggests they could be on sale until the end of the decade .
