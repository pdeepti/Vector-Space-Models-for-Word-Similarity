" these are clear agreements that have been made , and that the government in khartoum has committed to , " said german foreign ministry spokesperson jens plötner .
" i do n't think any additional agreements have to be made .

she ’ s got two degrees in psychology and obtained a doctorate of medicine for her cancer research .
to top it all off , she ’ s also the holder of an mba .
until 1990 dorrepaal worked at the dutch cancer research center ; after that she moved to the amsterdam offices of the business consultancy booz allen hamilton .

" dr. dorrepaal 's deep understanding of the pharmaceutical industry together with her experience in the strategic repositioning of top tier companies and in optimizing their performance will further strengthen schering 's management team , " hubertus erlen , chairman of schering ’ s executive board said in a statement .
women moving to the top schering ’ s appointment of dorrepaal is one of several signs in recent weeks that the business climate is changing for women in germany .

a meager 11 percent of german companies have a woman in management positions , compared to an eu average of 14 percent .
with 40 percent , the united states and canada are way , way ahead .
germany ’ s scarlet letter for working moms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since world war ii , german women have been told that raising a family is the job they were meant to take .
barbara schaeffer-hegel , founder of the european academy for women in politics and business -lrb- eaf -rrb- in berlin , attributes the shortfall to german cultural traditions .
" the mother ideology of the third reich and the conservative women ’ s ’ politics in the postwar time have left deep marks , " she explains .
" the division of the areas of public and private were cemented with the exclusive responsibility of women for the private areas -lrb- of life -rrb- – caring for children and ensuring the welfare of the family . "
in addition to the mentality , there ’ s also an institutional problem , the former professor of pedagogy said .
the daycare infrastructure in germany is underdeveloped , as is the preschool system .
and companies are often reluctant to trust women with important projects because they could get pregnant at any time .
in other words , latent discrimination is perpetuate throughout the business culture here .
" it ’ s a lot harder to reconcile having a family and a career in germany than it is in most developing countries and almost all industrial nations , " she says .
there ’ s still an enormous paradox here : most of the women recently making headlines for making it to the inner circle of managers have been imported from abroad .
karin dorrepaal is dutch , lucrezia reichlin is italian and beatrice weder di mauro has dual swiss and italian citizenship .
but that comes as little surprise to schaeffer-hegel .
" the word ‘ rabenmütter ’ -lrb- a term loosely translated as ‘ bad mom with latchkey kids ’ -rrb- only exists in germany , " she says .
" in other european countries and in america , women achieve huge things a still manage to have kids .
nor do they feel like bad mothers for doing so .
there the infrastructure is better and the prejudices against the women aren ’ t as big of a strain as they are here .

but after it lost its status as a political demonstration in 2001 and had to pick up part of the tab previously paid by the city , the event 's been in a slow downward spiral .
this year it was abruptly cancelled after organizers failed to find enough sponsors .
on saturday , hundreds turned out at events across the city to mourn the parade 's passing . but it went out with a whimper . hundreds of revelers converged on west berlin ’ s grand kurfürstendamm boulevard for a techno parade that included seven massive floats that made their way from adenauerplatz to the memorial cathedral .
they demostrated under the motto " fight the power – club culture versus ignorance " for the return of the love parade next year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin disc jockey dr. motte led the love parade for 15 years before its demise this year the love parade ’ s founder , dr. motte -lrb- photo -rrb- , had expected as many as 5,000 partyers on saturday .
despite the disappointing turnout , the demonstrators still managed to create an ear-splitting chorus of whistles and music that pulsed at an impressively high number of beats per minute .
dozens of djs , including german stars like westbam and paul van dyk , spun on the floats , filling the kurfürstendamm with an aural haze of electric beats .
the demo on one of berlin ’ s main shopping streets was organized by the local music magazine " partysan . "
copycat event goes ahead a few kilometers away , in the tiergarten park , another event was being held under the name " music day . "
but love parade organizer motte had sought to distance himself from the event , describing its organizers as " freeloaders . "
local authorities also required that the organizers reduce the size of the event , downsizing it from five stages to three .
nor were the organizers able to sell any food or drinks .
they first received their permit at the last minute and were unable to organize catering that met the city ’ s requirements under short notice .
berlin authorities first ruled to issue a permit for " music day " on friday , after organizers demonstrated that the event would have enough speeches to be deemed an actual demonstration under local law .
initially , authorities and the police had refused to issue a permit for the event , which they had deemed a techno party rather than a demonstration .
in the end , it made little difference .
according to the news agency dpa , police estimated only 200 to 300 attended the event on the grounds where hundreds of thousands reveled only a year ago .
before sunset there were also major differences between this year ’ s mini events and the mass love parade of the past : for one , both events had to end by 7 p.m. , a full two hours before sunset .
the original love parade lost its status as a " political event " in 2001 after holding it for more than a decade .
the move forced motte and his organizers to pony up the costs for clean-up and other expenses related to the event that are normally covered by the city for major political rallies .

on saturday , hundreds turned out at events across the city to mourn the parade 's passing . but it went out with a whimper . hundreds of revelers converged on west berlin ’ s grand kurfürstendamm boulevard for a techno parade that included seven massive floats that made their way from adenauerplatz to the memorial cathedral .
they demostrated under the motto " fight the power – club culture versus ignorance " for the return of the love parade next year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin disc jockey dr. motte led the love parade for 15 years before its demise this year the love parade ’ s founder , dr. motte -lrb- photo -rrb- , had expected as many as 5,000 partyers on saturday .
despite the disappointing turnout , the demonstrators still managed to create an ear-splitting chorus of whistles and music that pulsed at an impressively high number of beats per minute .
dozens of djs , including german stars like westbam and paul van dyk , spun on the floats , filling the kurfürstendamm with an aural haze of electric beats .
the demo on one of berlin ’ s main shopping streets was organized by the local music magazine " partysan . "
copycat event goes ahead a few kilometers away , in the tiergarten park , another event was being held under the name " music day . "
but love parade organizer motte had sought to distance himself from the event , describing its organizers as " freeloaders . "
local authorities also required that the organizers reduce the size of the event , downsizing it from five stages to three .
nor were the organizers able to sell any food or drinks .
they first received their permit at the last minute and were unable to organize catering that met the city ’ s requirements under short notice .
berlin authorities first ruled to issue a permit for " music day " on friday , after organizers demonstrated that the event would have enough speeches to be deemed an actual demonstration under local law .
initially , authorities and the police had refused to issue a permit for the event , which they had deemed a techno party rather than a demonstration .
in the end , it made little difference .
according to the news agency dpa , police estimated only 200 to 300 attended the event on the grounds where hundreds of thousands reveled only a year ago .
before sunset there were also major differences between this year ’ s mini events and the mass love parade of the past : for one , both events had to end by 7 p.m. , a full two hours before sunset .
the original love parade lost its status as a " political event " in 2001 after holding it for more than a decade .
the move forced motte and his organizers to pony up the costs for clean-up and other expenses related to the event that are normally covered by the city for major political rallies .

at the center of the discussions , which are being held in neuhardenberg palace in the state of brandenburg , are education , innovation and family policy .
the cabinet also plans to discuss labor market reforms and efforts to promote growth in eastern germany , where the economy is stagnant and the unemployment rate explosive .
at the opening of the retreat on friday , schröder called on his cabinet to stick to its current reform plans .
" our course is important , " he said , " and we have to succeed . "
otherwise , he warned , most would give up on any chance of turning germany ’ s lame economy around .
schröder ’ s " agenda 2010 " program has faced a major challenge from the leftist faction of his social democratic party .
last week they formed a split-off group , " election alternative : jobs and social justice , " and have threatened to create their own political party .
the leftist faction is seeking to block the current reforms , and schröder is also being challenged by the opposition conservatives .
the main argument among critics is that the government must assure them and german voters that it has a comprehensive reform plan that will actually deliver the final changes needed to repair the country ’ s failing labor market , lukewarm economy and a social system sagging under the weight of shrinking tax revenues and an aging population .
paving the way for implementation despite the open discussion , there are no plans to make changes to the government ’ s current reform plans at the meeting .
according to the parliamentary group leader of the greens , krista sager , the meeting is instead intended to produce " accompanying measures " for recently initiated reforms .
the party leaders are also expected to discuss government ’ s main legislative policies for the second half of the administration , which runs through 2006 .
plans for the better promotion and integration of long-term unemployed germans after the introduction of a law next year that will merge the countries unemployment and welfare benefits for the long-term unemployed are also on the table .
under the new plan , unemployed will be required to take most jobs offered to them with the risk of benefit cuts if they refuse to accept work .
on saturday , economics and labor minister wolfgang clement called on both business , communities and government to create new jobs in order to help bring the long-term unemployed back into the workforce .
better toddler daycare family minister renate schmidt is expected to introduce draft legislation that would require local communities to provide all-day care , based on need , for children under three years of age .
the plan calls for the creation of 230,000 new care slots for the toddlers in the western german states ; eastern german states would not be included in the bill because they have already reached an acceptable level , schmidt said .

initially , authorities and the police had refused to issue a permit for the event , which they had deemed a techno party rather than a demonstration .
in the end , it made little difference .
according to the news agency dpa , police estimated only 200 to 300 attended the event on the grounds where hundreds of thousands reveled only a year ago .
before sunset there were also major differences between this year ’ s mini events and the mass love parade of the past : for one , both events had to end by 7 p.m. , a full two hours before sunset .
the original love parade lost its status as a " political event " in 2001 after holding it for more than a decade .
the move forced motte and his organizers to pony up the costs for clean-up and other expenses related to the event that are normally covered by the city for major political rallies .
in may , the event , which has drawn as many as a million ravers in past years , was cancelled because its organizers couldn ’ t find enough sponsors . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mourning the love parade there 's still a glimmer of hope that the world 's largest techno music party will survive .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.07.2004 schröder ’ s cabinet ponder labor market and family policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder is trying to keep his cabinet solidly behind his reform program at a two-day meeting in eastern germany , chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s cabinet takes stock of major reforms to the country ’ s education , labor and family policies . the cabinet of german chancellor gerhard schröder continued its annual summer meeting on saturday , bringing together the heads of both the national parties and the parliamentary groups for both government coalition partners , the social democrats and the greens .
at the center of the discussions , which are being held in neuhardenberg palace in the state of brandenburg , are education , innovation and family policy .
the cabinet also plans to discuss labor market reforms and efforts to promote growth in eastern germany , where the economy is stagnant and the unemployment rate explosive .
at the opening of the retreat on friday , schröder called on his cabinet to stick to its current reform plans .
" our course is important , " he said , " and we have to succeed . "
otherwise , he warned , most would give up on any chance of turning germany ’ s lame economy around .
schröder ’ s " agenda 2010 " program has faced a major challenge from the leftist faction of his social democratic party .
last week they formed a split-off group , " election alternative : jobs and social justice , " and have threatened to create their own political party .
the leftist faction is seeking to block the current reforms , and schröder is also being challenged by the opposition conservatives .
the main argument among critics is that the government must assure them and german voters that it has a comprehensive reform plan that will actually deliver the final changes needed to repair the country ’ s failing labor market , lukewarm economy and a social system sagging under the weight of shrinking tax revenues and an aging population .
paving the way for implementation despite the open discussion , there are no plans to make changes to the government ’ s current reform plans at the meeting .
according to the parliamentary group leader of the greens , krista sager , the meeting is instead intended to produce " accompanying measures " for recently initiated reforms .
the party leaders are also expected to discuss government ’ s main legislative policies for the second half of the administration , which runs through 2006 .
plans for the better promotion and integration of long-term unemployed germans after the introduction of a law next year that will merge the countries unemployment and welfare benefits for the long-term unemployed are also on the table .
under the new plan , unemployed will be required to take most jobs offered to them with the risk of benefit cuts if they refuse to accept work .
on saturday , economics and labor minister wolfgang clement called on both business , communities and government to create new jobs in order to help bring the long-term unemployed back into the workforce .
better toddler daycare family minister renate schmidt is expected to introduce draft legislation that would require local communities to provide all-day care , based on need , for children under three years of age .
the plan calls for the creation of 230,000 new care slots for the toddlers in the western german states ; eastern german states would not be included in the bill because they have already reached an acceptable level , schmidt said .
the plan calls for money saved by communities through the merger of unemployment and welfare benefits to be funneled to the daycare programs to the tune of € 1.5 billion . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cabinet huddles to map future direction german chancellor gerhard schröder has called together his cabinet for a two-day balance-taking session , just as a key survey reveals the popularity of his social democratic party has sunk to a record new low .

at the center of the discussions , which are being held in neuhardenberg palace in the state of brandenburg , are education , innovation and family policy .
the cabinet also plans to discuss labor market reforms and efforts to promote growth in eastern germany , where the economy is stagnant and the unemployment rate explosive .
at the opening of the retreat on friday , schröder called on his cabinet to stick to its current reform plans .
" our course is important , " he said , " and we have to succeed . "
otherwise , he warned , most would give up on any chance of turning germany ’ s lame economy around .
schröder ’ s " agenda 2010 " program has faced a major challenge from the leftist faction of his social democratic party .
last week they formed a split-off group , " election alternative : jobs and social justice , " and have threatened to create their own political party .
the leftist faction is seeking to block the current reforms , and schröder is also being challenged by the opposition conservatives .
the main argument among critics is that the government must assure them and german voters that it has a comprehensive reform plan that will actually deliver the final changes needed to repair the country ’ s failing labor market , lukewarm economy and a social system sagging under the weight of shrinking tax revenues and an aging population .
paving the way for implementation despite the open discussion , there are no plans to make changes to the government ’ s current reform plans at the meeting .
according to the parliamentary group leader of the greens , krista sager , the meeting is instead intended to produce " accompanying measures " for recently initiated reforms .
the party leaders are also expected to discuss government ’ s main legislative policies for the second half of the administration , which runs through 2006 .
plans for the better promotion and integration of long-term unemployed germans after the introduction of a law next year that will merge the countries unemployment and welfare benefits for the long-term unemployed are also on the table .
under the new plan , unemployed will be required to take most jobs offered to them with the risk of benefit cuts if they refuse to accept work .
on saturday , economics and labor minister wolfgang clement called on both business , communities and government to create new jobs in order to help bring the long-term unemployed back into the workforce .
better toddler daycare family minister renate schmidt is expected to introduce draft legislation that would require local communities to provide all-day care , based on need , for children under three years of age .
the plan calls for the creation of 230,000 new care slots for the toddlers in the western german states ; eastern german states would not be included in the bill because they have already reached an acceptable level , schmidt said .

the cabinet-level officials of the social democratic and greens coalition government met at neuhardenberg palace to discuss the achievements of the first half of the administration and to solidify the political goals needed to win the next election in 2006 .
" we ’ re ready for a fight during the second half of this legislative period , " schröder said .
" and we ’ re going into this with the goal of winning a third . "
schröder said the reforms passed so far by his government are unparalleled in europe , and they are already having an effect .
in recent days , economic forecasts have been positively upgraded and , he said , the coalition government has shown an impressive level of determination to push through the difficult reforms , which are intended to jumpstart the lukewarm economy .
with the " agenda 2010 " package , schröder said , the most comprehensive modernization of germany ’ s social security system ever undertaken has been introduced .
reforms not over until they ’ re implemented " it ’ s important to me that it remains clear to everyone that the reform process hasn ’ t ended yet , " schröder said .
" the reform work can only be seen as successful when it the implementation phase has been successfully completed .
and now our political leadership needs to concentrate on the implementation of these wide-ranging reform agenda with as little conflict as possible . "
at the meeting , cabinet officials intensively discussed the law passed friday that will reorganize the supervision of the country ’ s more than 2 million long-term unemployed starting in january 2005 .
schröder said the government must ramp up its placement programs for people who have fallen out of the workforce .
schröder said that although it wouldn ’ t be possible to place all long-term unemployed people , the country needs better placement programs to bring people back into the workforce and help give them restore some of the dignity they ’ ve lost by having to accept government handouts .
but it ’ s unlikely the federal government will implement new programs itself .
economics and labor minister wolfgang clement said the government would not create any special programs to finance the long-term unemployed .
instead , communities and charity organizations should be helping create and find jobs for the unemployed , partially using money that will have been saved through the reforms , he said .
extra burdens for eastern states german cities and communities , however , have questioned whether the cuts will have any tangible effect on the labor market – especially in the eastern states .
with an unemployment rate of 25 percent in some parts of eastern germany , it will be difficult to find jobs for everyone , critics have lamented , questioning the sense of the reforms .
the chancellor said he is planning to meet with the eastern german state premiers who voted against the legislation that would dramatically reduce social welfare benefits for long-term unemployed in the bundesrat , germany ’ s upper legislative chamber , on friday .
" i don ’ t want to have an ‘ east-west ’ discussion on this issue , " schröder said .
instead , he said he is calling on the eastern german premiers to make the best out of the situation .
better daycare so moms can work schröder also called on local communities to improve daycare programs for children under three in order to make it easier for young women to build a career and family .
family minister renate schmidt is expected to next week introduce draft legislation that would require local communities to provide all-day care , based on need , for children under three years of age .

the cabinet-level officials of the social democratic and greens coalition government met at neuhardenberg palace to discuss the achievements of the first half of the administration and to solidify the political goals needed to win the next election in 2006 .
" we ’ re ready for a fight during the second half of this legislative period , " schröder said .
" and we ’ re going into this with the goal of winning a third . "
schröder said the reforms passed so far by his government are unparalleled in europe , and they are already having an effect .
in recent days , economic forecasts have been positively upgraded and , he said , the coalition government has shown an impressive level of determination to push through the difficult reforms , which are intended to jumpstart the lukewarm economy .
with the " agenda 2010 " package , schröder said , the most comprehensive modernization of germany ’ s social security system ever undertaken has been introduced .
reforms not over until they ’ re implemented " it ’ s important to me that it remains clear to everyone that the reform process hasn ’ t ended yet , " schröder said .
" the reform work can only be seen as successful when it the implementation phase has been successfully completed .
and now our political leadership needs to concentrate on the implementation of these wide-ranging reform agenda with as little conflict as possible . "
at the meeting , cabinet officials intensively discussed the law passed friday that will reorganize the supervision of the country ’ s more than 2 million long-term unemployed starting in january 2005 .
schröder said the government must ramp up its placement programs for people who have fallen out of the workforce .
schröder said that although it wouldn ’ t be possible to place all long-term unemployed people , the country needs better placement programs to bring people back into the workforce and help give them restore some of the dignity they ’ ve lost by having to accept government handouts .
but it ’ s unlikely the federal government will implement new programs itself .
economics and labor minister wolfgang clement said the government would not create any special programs to finance the long-term unemployed .
instead , communities and charity organizations should be helping create and find jobs for the unemployed , partially using money that will have been saved through the reforms , he said .
extra burdens for eastern states german cities and communities , however , have questioned whether the cuts will have any tangible effect on the labor market – especially in the eastern states .
with an unemployment rate of 25 percent in some parts of eastern germany , it will be difficult to find jobs for everyone , critics have lamented , questioning the sense of the reforms .
the chancellor said he is planning to meet with the eastern german state premiers who voted against the legislation that would dramatically reduce social welfare benefits for long-term unemployed in the bundesrat , germany ’ s upper legislative chamber , on friday .
" i don ’ t want to have an ‘ east-west ’ discussion on this issue , " schröder said .
instead , he said he is calling on the eastern german premiers to make the best out of the situation .
better daycare so moms can work schröder also called on local communities to improve daycare programs for children under three in order to make it easier for young women to build a career and family .
family minister renate schmidt is expected to next week introduce draft legislation that would require local communities to provide all-day care , based on need , for children under three years of age .
the plan calls for the creation of 230,000 new care slots for the toddlers in the western german states ; eastern german states would not be included in the bill because they have already reached an acceptable level , schmidt said .
the plan calls for money saved by communities through the merger of unemployment and welfare benefits to be funneled to the daycare programs to the tune of € 1.5 billion .

but after it lost its status as a political demonstration in 2001 and had to pick up part of the tab previously paid by the city , the event 's been in a slow downward spiral .
this year it was abruptly cancelled after organizers failed to find enough sponsors .
on saturday , hundreds turned out at events across the city to mourn the parade 's passing . but it went out with a whimper . hundreds of revelers converged on west berlin ’ s grand kurfürstendamm boulevard for a techno parade that included seven massive floats that made their way from adenauerplatz to the memorial cathedral .
they demostrated under the motto " fight the power – club culture versus ignorance " for the return of the love parade next year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin disc jockey dr. motte led the love parade for 15 years before its demise this year the love parade ’ s founder , dr. motte -lrb- photo -rrb- , had expected as many as 5,000 partyers on saturday .
despite the disappointing turnout , the demonstrators still managed to create an ear-splitting chorus of whistles and music that pulsed at an impressively high number of beats per minute .
dozens of djs , including german stars like westbam and paul van dyk , spun on the floats , filling the kurfürstendamm with an aural haze of electric beats .
the demo on one of berlin ’ s main shopping streets was organized by the local music magazine " partysan . "
copycat event goes ahead a few kilometers away , in the tiergarten park , another event was being held under the name " music day . "
but love parade organizer motte had sought to distance himself from the event , describing its organizers as " freeloaders . "
local authorities also required that the organizers reduce the size of the event , downsizing it from five stages to three .
nor were the organizers able to sell any food or drinks .
they first received their permit at the last minute and were unable to organize catering that met the city ’ s requirements under short notice .
berlin authorities first ruled to issue a permit for " music day " on friday , after organizers demonstrated that the event would have enough speeches to be deemed an actual demonstration under local law .
initially , authorities and the police had refused to issue a permit for the event , which they had deemed a techno party rather than a demonstration .
in the end , it made little difference .
according to the news agency dpa , police estimated only 200 to 300 attended the event on the grounds where hundreds of thousands reveled only a year ago .
before sunset there were also major differences between this year ’ s mini events and the mass love parade of the past : for one , both events had to end by 7 p.m. , a full two hours before sunset .
the original love parade lost its status as a " political event " in 2001 after holding it for more than a decade .
the move forced motte and his organizers to pony up the costs for clean-up and other expenses related to the event that are normally covered by the city for major political rallies .
in may , the event , which has drawn as many as a million ravers in past years , was cancelled because its organizers couldn ’ t find enough sponsors . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mourning the love parade there 's still a glimmer of hope that the world 's largest techno music party will survive .

the cabinet-level officials of the social democratic and greens coalition government met at neuhardenberg palace to discuss the achievements of the first half of the administration and to solidify the political goals needed to win the next election in 2006 .
" we ’ re ready for a fight during the second half of this legislative period , " schröder said .
" and we ’ re going into this with the goal of winning a third . "
schröder said the reforms passed so far by his government are unparalleled in europe , and they are already having an effect .
in recent days , economic forecasts have been positively upgraded and , he said , the coalition government has shown an impressive level of determination to push through the difficult reforms , which are intended to jumpstart the lukewarm economy .
with the " agenda 2010 " package , schröder said , the most comprehensive modernization of germany ’ s social security system ever undertaken has been introduced .
reforms not over until they ’ re implemented " it ’ s important to me that it remains clear to everyone that the reform process hasn ’ t ended yet , " schröder said .
" the reform work can only be seen as successful when it the implementation phase has been successfully completed .
and now our political leadership needs to concentrate on the implementation of these wide-ranging reform agenda with as little conflict as possible . "
at the meeting , cabinet officials intensively discussed the law passed friday that will reorganize the supervision of the country ’ s more than 2 million long-term unemployed starting in january 2005 .
schröder said the government must ramp up its placement programs for people who have fallen out of the workforce .
schröder said that although it wouldn ’ t be possible to place all long-term unemployed people , the country needs better placement programs to bring people back into the workforce and help give them restore some of the dignity they ’ ve lost by having to accept government handouts .
but it ’ s unlikely the federal government will implement new programs itself .
economics and labor minister wolfgang clement said the government would not create any special programs to finance the long-term unemployed .
instead , communities and charity organizations should be helping create and find jobs for the unemployed , partially using money that will have been saved through the reforms , he said .
extra burdens for eastern states german cities and communities , however , have questioned whether the cuts will have any tangible effect on the labor market – especially in the eastern states .
with an unemployment rate of 25 percent in some parts of eastern germany , it will be difficult to find jobs for everyone , critics have lamented , questioning the sense of the reforms .
the chancellor said he is planning to meet with the eastern german state premiers who voted against the legislation that would dramatically reduce social welfare benefits for long-term unemployed in the bundesrat , germany ’ s upper legislative chamber , on friday .
" i don ’ t want to have an ‘ east-west ’ discussion on this issue , " schröder said .
instead , he said he is calling on the eastern german premiers to make the best out of the situation .
better daycare so moms can work schröder also called on local communities to improve daycare programs for children under three in order to make it easier for young women to build a career and family .
family minister renate schmidt is expected to next week introduce draft legislation that would require local communities to provide all-day care , based on need , for children under three years of age .
the plan calls for the creation of 230,000 new care slots for the toddlers in the western german states ; eastern german states would not be included in the bill because they have already reached an acceptable level , schmidt said .
the plan calls for money saved by communities through the merger of unemployment and welfare benefits to be funneled to the daycare programs to the tune of € 1.5 billion .

at the center of the discussions , which are being held in neuhardenberg palace in the state of brandenburg , are education , innovation and family policy .

now , action must follow . " improved access to refugees aid workers have reported that their access to starving refugees in darfur has improved .
to assist their work , fischer is bringing with him 3.5 tons of medicine to treat the refugees . disarmament of the arab militiamen , who , with government backing have killed and raped thousands of darfur 's black african population since rebel groups took up arms last year , is taking longer . according to fischer , the government in khartoum is capable of demilitarizing the rebels immediately " if it only wants to . " " what we 're talking about is a totally normal exertion of state sovereignty , for a nation to fulfil its duty to ensure peace , order , and security for its citizens , " plötner said .
" this duty is also something that the sudanese government is obligated to fulfil . " sanctions could follow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sudanese refugee walks past a dead donkey in a refugee camp if the government in khartoum does n't stick to its commitment to stop the violence , the country faces possible sanctions .
although sudan is warning of creating another iraq-style situation should sanctions be imposed , fischer has already said that he supports the idea of certain sanctions , such as a weapons embargo . a us draft resolution before the un security council includes sanctions against leaders of the arab militia , which could be widened to include members of the government .
the us has proposed escalating sanctions within 30 days if results are not evident , though some countries say that sudan should be allowed more time . nina werkhäuser -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin may send peacekeepers to sudan the german deputy foreign minister has indicated berlin is considering sending peacekeeping troops to war-torn sudan under a u.n. mandate , adding a further dimension to the bundeswehr ’ s deployment in africa .

no other industrial nation has as few female top managers as germany . german boardrooms still remain a men ’ s club .
but come sept .
2005 , things may start to change .
karin dorrepaal , a native of the netherlands , is then set to become the only woman to join the executive board of one of the 30 blue chip companies listed on the german stock index .
she ’ s got two degrees in psychology and obtained a doctorate of medicine for her cancer research .
to top it all off , she ’ s also the holder of an mba .
until 1990 dorrepaal worked at the dutch cancer research center ; after that she moved to the amsterdam offices of the business consultancy booz allen hamilton .
in 2000 , she became the company ’ s vice president , taking responsibility for the consultancy ’ s work with pharmaceutical companies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schering headquarters in berlin she ’ s had an impressive career – one that also persuaded schering executives she was the right candidate .
nonetheless , dorrepaal is still relatively unknown within the company . schering first worked with 43-year-old dorrepaal during a restructuring of its operations and marketing divisions .
" dr. dorrepaal 's deep understanding of the pharmaceutical industry together with her experience in the strategic repositioning of top tier companies and in optimizing their performance will further strengthen schering 's management team , " hubertus erlen , chairman of schering ’ s executive board said in a statement .
women moving to the top schering ’ s appointment of dorrepaal is one of several signs in recent weeks that the business climate is changing for women in germany .
recently , economist beatrice weder di mauro got appointed to germany ’ s prestigious council of economic advisors , a panel of top-ranking economists that guides the federal government on economic decision-making .
it was the fist time in the " panel of wisemen 's " 41-year history that it had brought a woman into its ranks .
on top of all that , the german association of young entrepreneurs -lrb- bju -rrb- recently appointed 38-year-old businesswoman karoline beck as its president .
over at citibank , the subsidiary of the world ’ s largest financial services company , citigroup , american sue hartnett recently took over the helm of the company ’ s german operations after her predecessor , christine licci , unexpectedly resigned in may .
and it doesn ’ t stop there : economics professor lucrezia reichlin is considered by many to be the top candidate to lead the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- .
yet despite these advances , management circles in german business are still a man ’ s world .
a meager 11 percent of german companies have a woman in management positions , compared to an eu average of 14 percent .
with 40 percent , the united states and canada are way , way ahead .
germany ’ s scarlet letter for working moms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since world war ii , german women have been told that raising a family is the job they were meant to take .
barbara schaeffer-hegel , founder of the european academy for women in politics and business -lrb- eaf -rrb- in berlin , attributes the shortfall to german cultural traditions .
" the mother ideology of the third reich and the conservative women ’ s ’ politics in the postwar time have left deep marks , " she explains .
" the division of the areas of public and private were cemented with the exclusive responsibility of women for the private areas -lrb- of life -rrb- – caring for children and ensuring the welfare of the family . "
in addition to the mentality , there ’ s also an institutional problem , the former professor of pedagogy said .
the daycare infrastructure in germany is underdeveloped , as is the preschool system .
and companies are often reluctant to trust women with important projects because they could get pregnant at any time .
in other words , latent discrimination is perpetuate throughout the business culture here .
" it ’ s a lot harder to reconcile having a family and a career in germany than it is in most developing countries and almost all industrial nations , " she says .
there ’ s still an enormous paradox here : most of the women recently making headlines for making it to the inner circle of managers have been imported from abroad .
karin dorrepaal is dutch , lucrezia reichlin is italian and beatrice weder di mauro has dual swiss and italian citizenship .
but that comes as little surprise to schaeffer-hegel .
" the word ‘ rabenmütter ’ -lrb- a term loosely translated as ‘ bad mom with latchkey kids ’ -rrb- only exists in germany , " she says .
" in other european countries and in america , women achieve huge things a still manage to have kids .
nor do they feel like bad mothers for doing so .
there the infrastructure is better and the prejudices against the women aren ’ t as big of a strain as they are here .

but after it lost its status as a political demonstration in 2001 and had to pick up part of the tab previously paid by the city , the event 's been in a slow downward spiral .
this year it was abruptly cancelled after organizers failed to find enough sponsors .
on saturday , hundreds turned out at events across the city to mourn the parade 's passing . but it went out with a whimper . hundreds of revelers converged on west berlin ’ s grand kurfürstendamm boulevard for a techno parade that included seven massive floats that made their way from adenauerplatz to the memorial cathedral .
they demostrated under the motto " fight the power – club culture versus ignorance " for the return of the love parade next year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin disc jockey dr. motte led the love parade for 15 years before its demise this year the love parade ’ s founder , dr. motte -lrb- photo -rrb- , had expected as many as 5,000 partyers on saturday .
despite the disappointing turnout , the demonstrators still managed to create an ear-splitting chorus of whistles and music that pulsed at an impressively high number of beats per minute .
dozens of djs , including german stars like westbam and paul van dyk , spun on the floats , filling the kurfürstendamm with an aural haze of electric beats .
the demo on one of berlin ’ s main shopping streets was organized by the local music magazine " partysan . "
copycat event goes ahead a few kilometers away , in the tiergarten park , another event was being held under the name " music day . "
but love parade organizer motte had sought to distance himself from the event , describing its organizers as " freeloaders . "
local authorities also required that the organizers reduce the size of the event , downsizing it from five stages to three .
nor were the organizers able to sell any food or drinks .
they first received their permit at the last minute and were unable to organize catering that met the city ’ s requirements under short notice .
berlin authorities first ruled to issue a permit for " music day " on friday , after organizers demonstrated that the event would have enough speeches to be deemed an actual demonstration under local law .
initially , authorities and the police had refused to issue a permit for the event , which they had deemed a techno party rather than a demonstration .
in the end , it made little difference .
according to the news agency dpa , police estimated only 200 to 300 attended the event on the grounds where hundreds of thousands reveled only a year ago .
before sunset there were also major differences between this year ’ s mini events and the mass love parade of the past : for one , both events had to end by 7 p.m. , a full two hours before sunset .
the original love parade lost its status as a " political event " in 2001 after holding it for more than a decade .
the move forced motte and his organizers to pony up the costs for clean-up and other expenses related to the event that are normally covered by the city for major political rallies .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin disc jockey dr. motte led the love parade for 15 years before its demise this year the love parade ’ s founder , dr. motte -lrb- photo -rrb- , had expected as many as 5,000 partyers on saturday .
despite the disappointing turnout , the demonstrators still managed to create an ear-splitting chorus of whistles and music that pulsed at an impressively high number of beats per minute .
dozens of djs , including german stars like westbam and paul van dyk , spun on the floats , filling the kurfürstendamm with an aural haze of electric beats .
the demo on one of berlin ’ s main shopping streets was organized by the local music magazine " partysan . "
copycat event goes ahead a few kilometers away , in the tiergarten park , another event was being held under the name " music day . "
but love parade organizer motte had sought to distance himself from the event , describing its organizers as " freeloaders . "
local authorities also required that the organizers reduce the size of the event , downsizing it from five stages to three .
nor were the organizers able to sell any food or drinks .
they first received their permit at the last minute and were unable to organize catering that met the city ’ s requirements under short notice .
berlin authorities first ruled to issue a permit for " music day " on friday , after organizers demonstrated that the event would have enough speeches to be deemed an actual demonstration under local law .
initially , authorities and the police had refused to issue a permit for the event , which they had deemed a techno party rather than a demonstration .
in the end , it made little difference .
according to the news agency dpa , police estimated only 200 to 300 attended the event on the grounds where hundreds of thousands reveled only a year ago .
before sunset there were also major differences between this year ’ s mini events and the mass love parade of the past : for one , both events had to end by 7 p.m. , a full two hours before sunset .
the original love parade lost its status as a " political event " in 2001 after holding it for more than a decade .
the move forced motte and his organizers to pony up the costs for clean-up and other expenses related to the event that are normally covered by the city for major political rallies .
in may , the event , which has drawn as many as a million ravers in past years , was cancelled because its organizers couldn ’ t find enough sponsors . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mourning the love parade there 's still a glimmer of hope that the world 's largest techno music party will survive .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 10.07.2004 cologne angered by unesco criticism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this skyline is unacceptable , unesco says cologne residents are fiercely proud of their 13th-century gothic cathedral , also a unesco world heritage site .
but the landmark could be stripped of its special status because of the city 's lofty building plans . tempers in cologne are sky-high following a decision by the united nations educational scientific and cultural organization to place the city 's cathedral on its endangered list .
no , the gothic masterpiece is n't suffering from pollution damage , though over the centuries , its façade has been darkened by soot and smog .
nor is the cathedral in danger of being overrun by tourists or threatened by illicit excavation , pillaging , or landmines - all typical reasons why unesco classifies world heritage sites as endangered . the problem , according to unesco officials , lies in plans by the city of cologne to erect new office buildings which could have a " harmful visual impact " on the skyline . specifically , unesco objects to four new high-rise buildings being built opposite the cathedral , across the rhine river .
the new towers , which will range from 103 to 120 meters -lrb- 338 to 394 feet -rrb- in height , could block the dramatic view of the cathedral 's 157-meter-tall twin spires , ruining cologne 's distinctive skyline . city officials take offence cologne officials are perplexed and angry about unesco 's decision . " unesco is a bad loser , " said achim hermes , spokesman for the company putting up one of the new towers , the triangle building .
" it is well below the height of the cathedral , so the building will not affect anyone 's view - all you have to do is walk a few paces right or left , and your view will be just fine . " " i think they are using the cathedral to penalize the city , " said barbara schock-werner , who oversees the cathedral 's administration .
" one can not say that only one element , this aesthetic concern , should put the cathedral on unesco 's red list .
they are exaggerating . " unesco 's biggest threat is that it could strip the cathedral of its world heritage status , though unesco spokeswoman karaline shenk conceded " that almost never happens . " " really , it is not in unesco 's hands , " she said .
" it 's the responsibility of cologne . " progress versus preservation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne 's most famous landmark dominates the night sky the city has no plans to stop construction of the new buildings , which are going up in an area that has long been targeted for urban renewal .
nor does the city have any plans to detract from its most treasured landmark . even before the cathedral was named a world heritage site in 1996 , the city had passed zoning laws allowing only shorter buildings nearby to preserve the view of the " dom , " as it 's known by locals . " every cologner would give his last shirt to protect it , " said city spokesman ulrich hoever . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

the cabinet-level officials of the social democratic and greens coalition government met at neuhardenberg palace to discuss the achievements of the first half of the administration and to solidify the political goals needed to win the next election in 2006 .
" we ’ re ready for a fight during the second half of this legislative period , " schröder said .
" and we ’ re going into this with the goal of winning a third . "
schröder said the reforms passed so far by his government are unparalleled in europe , and they are already having an effect .
in recent days , economic forecasts have been positively upgraded and , he said , the coalition government has shown an impressive level of determination to push through the difficult reforms , which are intended to jumpstart the lukewarm economy .
with the " agenda 2010 " package , schröder said , the most comprehensive modernization of germany ’ s social security system ever undertaken has been introduced .
reforms not over until they ’ re implemented " it ’ s important to me that it remains clear to everyone that the reform process hasn ’ t ended yet , " schröder said .
" the reform work can only be seen as successful when it the implementation phase has been successfully completed .
and now our political leadership needs to concentrate on the implementation of these wide-ranging reform agenda with as little conflict as possible . "
at the meeting , cabinet officials intensively discussed the law passed friday that will reorganize the supervision of the country ’ s more than 2 million long-term unemployed starting in january 2005 .
schröder said the government must ramp up its placement programs for people who have fallen out of the workforce .
schröder said that although it wouldn ’ t be possible to place all long-term unemployed people , the country needs better placement programs to bring people back into the workforce and help give them restore some of the dignity they ’ ve lost by having to accept government handouts .
but it ’ s unlikely the federal government will implement new programs itself .
economics and labor minister wolfgang clement said the government would not create any special programs to finance the long-term unemployed .
instead , communities and charity organizations should be helping create and find jobs for the unemployed , partially using money that will have been saved through the reforms , he said .
extra burdens for eastern states german cities and communities , however , have questioned whether the cuts will have any tangible effect on the labor market – especially in the eastern states .
with an unemployment rate of 25 percent in some parts of eastern germany , it will be difficult to find jobs for everyone , critics have lamented , questioning the sense of the reforms .
the chancellor said he is planning to meet with the eastern german state premiers who voted against the legislation that would dramatically reduce social welfare benefits for long-term unemployed in the bundesrat , germany ’ s upper legislative chamber , on friday .
" i don ’ t want to have an ‘ east-west ’ discussion on this issue , " schröder said .
instead , he said he is calling on the eastern german premiers to make the best out of the situation .
better daycare so moms can work schröder also called on local communities to improve daycare programs for children under three in order to make it easier for young women to build a career and family .
family minister renate schmidt is expected to next week introduce draft legislation that would require local communities to provide all-day care , based on need , for children under three years of age .
the plan calls for the creation of 230,000 new care slots for the toddlers in the western german states ; eastern german states would not be included in the bill because they have already reached an acceptable level , schmidt said .
the plan calls for money saved by communities through the merger of unemployment and welfare benefits to be funneled to the daycare programs to the tune of € 1.5 billion .

to assist their work , fischer is bringing with him 3.5 tons of medicine to treat the refugees . disarmament of the arab militiamen , who , with government backing have killed and raped thousands of darfur 's black african population since rebel groups took up arms last year , is taking longer . according to fischer , the government in khartoum is capable of demilitarizing the rebels immediately " if it only wants to . " " what we 're talking about is a totally normal exertion of state sovereignty , for a nation to fulfil its duty to ensure peace , order , and security for its citizens , " plötner said .
" this duty is also something that the sudanese government is obligated to fulfil . " sanctions could follow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sudanese refugee walks past a dead donkey in a refugee camp if the government in khartoum does n't stick to its commitment to stop the violence , the country faces possible sanctions .
although sudan is warning of creating another iraq-style situation should sanctions be imposed , fischer has already said that he supports the idea of certain sanctions , such as a weapons embargo . a us draft resolution before the un security council includes sanctions against leaders of the arab militia , which could be widened to include members of the government .
the us has proposed escalating sanctions within 30 days if results are not evident , though some countries say that sudan should be allowed more time . nina werkhäuser -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin may send peacekeepers to sudan the german deputy foreign minister has indicated berlin is considering sending peacekeeping troops to war-torn sudan under a u.n. mandate , adding a further dimension to the bundeswehr ’ s deployment in africa .

at the center of the discussions , which are being held in neuhardenberg palace in the state of brandenburg , are education , innovation and family policy .
the cabinet also plans to discuss labor market reforms and efforts to promote growth in eastern germany , where the economy is stagnant and the unemployment rate explosive .
at the opening of the retreat on friday , schröder called on his cabinet to stick to its current reform plans .
" our course is important , " he said , " and we have to succeed . "
otherwise , he warned , most would give up on any chance of turning germany ’ s lame economy around .
schröder ’ s " agenda 2010 " program has faced a major challenge from the leftist faction of his social democratic party .
last week they formed a split-off group , " election alternative : jobs and social justice , " and have threatened to create their own political party .
the leftist faction is seeking to block the current reforms , and schröder is also being challenged by the opposition conservatives .
the main argument among critics is that the government must assure them and german voters that it has a comprehensive reform plan that will actually deliver the final changes needed to repair the country ’ s failing labor market , lukewarm economy and a social system sagging under the weight of shrinking tax revenues and an aging population .
paving the way for implementation despite the open discussion , there are no plans to make changes to the government ’ s current reform plans at the meeting .
according to the parliamentary group leader of the greens , krista sager , the meeting is instead intended to produce " accompanying measures " for recently initiated reforms .
the party leaders are also expected to discuss government ’ s main legislative policies for the second half of the administration , which runs through 2006 .
plans for the better promotion and integration of long-term unemployed germans after the introduction of a law next year that will merge the countries unemployment and welfare benefits for the long-term unemployed are also on the table .
under the new plan , unemployed will be required to take most jobs offered to them with the risk of benefit cuts if they refuse to accept work .
on saturday , economics and labor minister wolfgang clement called on both business , communities and government to create new jobs in order to help bring the long-term unemployed back into the workforce .
better toddler daycare family minister renate schmidt is expected to introduce draft legislation that would require local communities to provide all-day care , based on need , for children under three years of age .
the plan calls for the creation of 230,000 new care slots for the toddlers in the western german states ; eastern german states would not be included in the bill because they have already reached an acceptable level , schmidt said .

the cabinet-level officials of the social democratic and greens coalition government met at neuhardenberg palace to discuss the achievements of the first half of the administration and to solidify the political goals needed to win the next election in 2006 .
" we ’ re ready for a fight during the second half of this legislative period , " schröder said .
" and we ’ re going into this with the goal of winning a third . "
schröder said the reforms passed so far by his government are unparalleled in europe , and they are already having an effect .
in recent days , economic forecasts have been positively upgraded and , he said , the coalition government has shown an impressive level of determination to push through the difficult reforms , which are intended to jumpstart the lukewarm economy .
with the " agenda 2010 " package , schröder said , the most comprehensive modernization of germany ’ s social security system ever undertaken has been introduced .
reforms not over until they ’ re implemented " it ’ s important to me that it remains clear to everyone that the reform process hasn ’ t ended yet , " schröder said .
" the reform work can only be seen as successful when it the implementation phase has been successfully completed .
and now our political leadership needs to concentrate on the implementation of these wide-ranging reform agenda with as little conflict as possible . "
at the meeting , cabinet officials intensively discussed the law passed friday that will reorganize the supervision of the country ’ s more than 2 million long-term unemployed starting in january 2005 .
schröder said the government must ramp up its placement programs for people who have fallen out of the workforce .
schröder said that although it wouldn ’ t be possible to place all long-term unemployed people , the country needs better placement programs to bring people back into the workforce and help give them restore some of the dignity they ’ ve lost by having to accept government handouts .
but it ’ s unlikely the federal government will implement new programs itself .
economics and labor minister wolfgang clement said the government would not create any special programs to finance the long-term unemployed .
instead , communities and charity organizations should be helping create and find jobs for the unemployed , partially using money that will have been saved through the reforms , he said .
extra burdens for eastern states german cities and communities , however , have questioned whether the cuts will have any tangible effect on the labor market – especially in the eastern states .
with an unemployment rate of 25 percent in some parts of eastern germany , it will be difficult to find jobs for everyone , critics have lamented , questioning the sense of the reforms .
the chancellor said he is planning to meet with the eastern german state premiers who voted against the legislation that would dramatically reduce social welfare benefits for long-term unemployed in the bundesrat , germany ’ s upper legislative chamber , on friday .
" i don ’ t want to have an ‘ east-west ’ discussion on this issue , " schröder said .
instead , he said he is calling on the eastern german premiers to make the best out of the situation .
better daycare so moms can work schröder also called on local communities to improve daycare programs for children under three in order to make it easier for young women to build a career and family .
family minister renate schmidt is expected to next week introduce draft legislation that would require local communities to provide all-day care , based on need , for children under three years of age .
the plan calls for the creation of 230,000 new care slots for the toddlers in the western german states ; eastern german states would not be included in the bill because they have already reached an acceptable level , schmidt said .

but after it lost its status as a political demonstration in 2001 and had to pick up part of the tab previously paid by the city , the event 's been in a slow downward spiral .
this year it was abruptly cancelled after organizers failed to find enough sponsors .
on saturday , hundreds turned out at events across the city to mourn the parade 's passing . but it went out with a whimper . hundreds of revelers converged on west berlin ’ s grand kurfürstendamm boulevard for a techno parade that included seven massive floats that made their way from adenauerplatz to the memorial cathedral .
they demostrated under the motto " fight the power – club culture versus ignorance " for the return of the love parade next year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin disc jockey dr. motte led the love parade for 15 years before its demise this year the love parade ’ s founder , dr. motte -lrb- photo -rrb- , had expected as many as 5,000 partyers on saturday .
despite the disappointing turnout , the demonstrators still managed to create an ear-splitting chorus of whistles and music that pulsed at an impressively high number of beats per minute .
dozens of djs , including german stars like westbam and paul van dyk , spun on the floats , filling the kurfürstendamm with an aural haze of electric beats .
the demo on one of berlin ’ s main shopping streets was organized by the local music magazine " partysan . "
copycat event goes ahead a few kilometers away , in the tiergarten park , another event was being held under the name " music day . "
but love parade organizer motte had sought to distance himself from the event , describing its organizers as " freeloaders . "
local authorities also required that the organizers reduce the size of the event , downsizing it from five stages to three .
nor were the organizers able to sell any food or drinks .
they first received their permit at the last minute and were unable to organize catering that met the city ’ s requirements under short notice .
berlin authorities first ruled to issue a permit for " music day " on friday , after organizers demonstrated that the event would have enough speeches to be deemed an actual demonstration under local law .
initially , authorities and the police had refused to issue a permit for the event , which they had deemed a techno party rather than a demonstration .
in the end , it made little difference .
according to the news agency dpa , police estimated only 200 to 300 attended the event on the grounds where hundreds of thousands reveled only a year ago .
before sunset there were also major differences between this year ’ s mini events and the mass love parade of the past : for one , both events had to end by 7 p.m. , a full two hours before sunset .
the original love parade lost its status as a " political event " in 2001 after holding it for more than a decade .
the move forced motte and his organizers to pony up the costs for clean-up and other expenses related to the event that are normally covered by the city for major political rallies .
in may , the event , which has drawn as many as a million ravers in past years , was cancelled because its organizers couldn ’ t find enough sponsors . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mourning the love parade there 's still a glimmer of hope that the world 's largest techno music party will survive .

but after it lost its status as a political demonstration in 2001 and had to pick up part of the tab previously paid by the city , the event 's been in a slow downward spiral .
this year it was abruptly cancelled after organizers failed to find enough sponsors .
on saturday , hundreds turned out at events across the city to mourn the parade 's passing . but it went out with a whimper . hundreds of revelers converged on west berlin ’ s grand kurfürstendamm boulevard for a techno parade that included seven massive floats that made their way from adenauerplatz to the memorial cathedral .

but the landmark could be stripped of its special status because of the city 's lofty building plans . tempers in cologne are sky-high following a decision by the united nations educational scientific and cultural organization to place the city 's cathedral on its endangered list .
no , the gothic masterpiece is n't suffering from pollution damage , though over the centuries , its façade has been darkened by soot and smog .
nor is the cathedral in danger of being overrun by tourists or threatened by illicit excavation , pillaging , or landmines - all typical reasons why unesco classifies world heritage sites as endangered . the problem , according to unesco officials , lies in plans by the city of cologne to erect new office buildings which could have a " harmful visual impact " on the skyline . specifically , unesco objects to four new high-rise buildings being built opposite the cathedral , across the rhine river .
the new towers , which will range from 103 to 120 meters -lrb- 338 to 394 feet -rrb- in height , could block the dramatic view of the cathedral 's 157-meter-tall twin spires , ruining cologne 's distinctive skyline . city officials take offence cologne officials are perplexed and angry about unesco 's decision . " unesco is a bad loser , " said achim hermes , spokesman for the company putting up one of the new towers , the triangle building .
" it is well below the height of the cathedral , so the building will not affect anyone 's view - all you have to do is walk a few paces right or left , and your view will be just fine . " " i think they are using the cathedral to penalize the city , " said barbara schock-werner , who oversees the cathedral 's administration .
" one can not say that only one element , this aesthetic concern , should put the cathedral on unesco 's red list .
they are exaggerating . " unesco 's biggest threat is that it could strip the cathedral of its world heritage status , though unesco spokeswoman karaline shenk conceded " that almost never happens . " " really , it is not in unesco 's hands , " she said .
" it 's the responsibility of cologne . " progress versus preservation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne 's most famous landmark dominates the night sky the city has no plans to stop construction of the new buildings , which are going up in an area that has long been targeted for urban renewal .
nor does the city have any plans to detract from its most treasured landmark . even before the cathedral was named a world heritage site in 1996 , the city had passed zoning laws allowing only shorter buildings nearby to preserve the view of the " dom , " as it 's known by locals .

at the center of the discussions , which are being held in neuhardenberg palace in the state of brandenburg , are education , innovation and family policy .
the cabinet also plans to discuss labor market reforms and efforts to promote growth in eastern germany , where the economy is stagnant and the unemployment rate explosive .
at the opening of the retreat on friday , schröder called on his cabinet to stick to its current reform plans .
" our course is important , " he said , " and we have to succeed . "
otherwise , he warned , most would give up on any chance of turning germany ’ s lame economy around .
schröder ’ s " agenda 2010 " program has faced a major challenge from the leftist faction of his social democratic party .
last week they formed a split-off group , " election alternative : jobs and social justice , " and have threatened to create their own political party .
the leftist faction is seeking to block the current reforms , and schröder is also being challenged by the opposition conservatives .
the main argument among critics is that the government must assure them and german voters that it has a comprehensive reform plan that will actually deliver the final changes needed to repair the country ’ s failing labor market , lukewarm economy and a social system sagging under the weight of shrinking tax revenues and an aging population .
paving the way for implementation despite the open discussion , there are no plans to make changes to the government ’ s current reform plans at the meeting .
according to the parliamentary group leader of the greens , krista sager , the meeting is instead intended to produce " accompanying measures " for recently initiated reforms .
the party leaders are also expected to discuss government ’ s main legislative policies for the second half of the administration , which runs through 2006 .
plans for the better promotion and integration of long-term unemployed germans after the introduction of a law next year that will merge the countries unemployment and welfare benefits for the long-term unemployed are also on the table .
under the new plan , unemployed will be required to take most jobs offered to them with the risk of benefit cuts if they refuse to accept work .
on saturday , economics and labor minister wolfgang clement called on both business , communities and government to create new jobs in order to help bring the long-term unemployed back into the workforce .
better toddler daycare family minister renate schmidt is expected to introduce draft legislation that would require local communities to provide all-day care , based on need , for children under three years of age .
the plan calls for the creation of 230,000 new care slots for the toddlers in the western german states ; eastern german states would not be included in the bill because they have already reached an acceptable level , schmidt said .
the plan calls for money saved by communities through the merger of unemployment and welfare benefits to be funneled to the daycare programs to the tune of € 1.5 billion . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cabinet huddles to map future direction german chancellor gerhard schröder has called together his cabinet for a two-day balance-taking session , just as a key survey reveals the popularity of his social democratic party has sunk to a record new low .

karin dorrepaal , a native of the netherlands , is then set to become the only woman to join the executive board of one of the 30 blue chip companies listed on the german stock index .
she ’ s got two degrees in psychology and obtained a doctorate of medicine for her cancer research .
to top it all off , she ’ s also the holder of an mba .
until 1990 dorrepaal worked at the dutch cancer research center ; after that she moved to the amsterdam offices of the business consultancy booz allen hamilton .
in 2000 , she became the company ’ s vice president , taking responsibility for the consultancy ’ s work with pharmaceutical companies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schering headquarters in berlin she ’ s had an impressive career – one that also persuaded schering executives she was the right candidate .
nonetheless , dorrepaal is still relatively unknown within the company . schering first worked with 43-year-old dorrepaal during a restructuring of its operations and marketing divisions .
" dr. dorrepaal 's deep understanding of the pharmaceutical industry together with her experience in the strategic repositioning of top tier companies and in optimizing their performance will further strengthen schering 's management team , " hubertus erlen , chairman of schering ’ s executive board said in a statement .
women moving to the top schering ’ s appointment of dorrepaal is one of several signs in recent weeks that the business climate is changing for women in germany .
recently , economist beatrice weder di mauro got appointed to germany ’ s prestigious council of economic advisors , a panel of top-ranking economists that guides the federal government on economic decision-making .
it was the fist time in the " panel of wisemen 's " 41-year history that it had brought a woman into its ranks .

germany ’ s scarlet letter for working moms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since world war ii , german women have been told that raising a family is the job they were meant to take .
barbara schaeffer-hegel , founder of the european academy for women in politics and business -lrb- eaf -rrb- in berlin , attributes the shortfall to german cultural traditions .
" the mother ideology of the third reich and the conservative women ’ s ’ politics in the postwar time have left deep marks , " she explains .
" the division of the areas of public and private were cemented with the exclusive responsibility of women for the private areas -lrb- of life -rrb- – caring for children and ensuring the welfare of the family . "
in addition to the mentality , there ’ s also an institutional problem , the former professor of pedagogy said .
the daycare infrastructure in germany is underdeveloped , as is the preschool system .
and companies are often reluctant to trust women with important projects because they could get pregnant at any time .
in other words , latent discrimination is perpetuate throughout the business culture here .
" it ’ s a lot harder to reconcile having a family and a career in germany than it is in most developing countries and almost all industrial nations , " she says .
there ’ s still an enormous paradox here : most of the women recently making headlines for making it to the inner circle of managers have been imported from abroad .
karin dorrepaal is dutch , lucrezia reichlin is italian and beatrice weder di mauro has dual swiss and italian citizenship .
but that comes as little surprise to schaeffer-hegel .
" the word ‘ rabenmütter ’ -lrb- a term loosely translated as ‘ bad mom with latchkey kids ’ -rrb- only exists in germany , " she says .
" in other european countries and in america , women achieve huge things a still manage to have kids .
nor do they feel like bad mothers for doing so .

but after it lost its status as a political demonstration in 2001 and had to pick up part of the tab previously paid by the city , the event 's been in a slow downward spiral .
this year it was abruptly cancelled after organizers failed to find enough sponsors .
on saturday , hundreds turned out at events across the city to mourn the parade 's passing . but it went out with a whimper . hundreds of revelers converged on west berlin ’ s grand kurfürstendamm boulevard for a techno parade that included seven massive floats that made their way from adenauerplatz to the memorial cathedral .
they demostrated under the motto " fight the power – club culture versus ignorance " for the return of the love parade next year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin disc jockey dr. motte led the love parade for 15 years before its demise this year the love parade ’ s founder , dr. motte -lrb- photo -rrb- , had expected as many as 5,000 partyers on saturday .
despite the disappointing turnout , the demonstrators still managed to create an ear-splitting chorus of whistles and music that pulsed at an impressively high number of beats per minute .
dozens of djs , including german stars like westbam and paul van dyk , spun on the floats , filling the kurfürstendamm with an aural haze of electric beats .
the demo on one of berlin ’ s main shopping streets was organized by the local music magazine " partysan . "
copycat event goes ahead a few kilometers away , in the tiergarten park , another event was being held under the name " music day . "
but love parade organizer motte had sought to distance himself from the event , describing its organizers as " freeloaders . "
local authorities also required that the organizers reduce the size of the event , downsizing it from five stages to three .
nor were the organizers able to sell any food or drinks .
they first received their permit at the last minute and were unable to organize catering that met the city ’ s requirements under short notice .
berlin authorities first ruled to issue a permit for " music day " on friday , after organizers demonstrated that the event would have enough speeches to be deemed an actual demonstration under local law .
initially , authorities and the police had refused to issue a permit for the event , which they had deemed a techno party rather than a demonstration .
in the end , it made little difference .
according to the news agency dpa , police estimated only 200 to 300 attended the event on the grounds where hundreds of thousands reveled only a year ago .
before sunset there were also major differences between this year ’ s mini events and the mass love parade of the past : for one , both events had to end by 7 p.m. , a full two hours before sunset .
the original love parade lost its status as a " political event " in 2001 after holding it for more than a decade .
the move forced motte and his organizers to pony up the costs for clean-up and other expenses related to the event that are normally covered by the city for major political rallies .
in may , the event , which has drawn as many as a million ravers in past years , was cancelled because its organizers couldn ’ t find enough sponsors . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mourning the love parade there 's still a glimmer of hope that the world 's largest techno music party will survive .

but after it lost its status as a political demonstration in 2001 and had to pick up part of the tab previously paid by the city , the event 's been in a slow downward spiral .
this year it was abruptly cancelled after organizers failed to find enough sponsors .
on saturday , hundreds turned out at events across the city to mourn the parade 's passing . but it went out with a whimper . hundreds of revelers converged on west berlin ’ s grand kurfürstendamm boulevard for a techno parade that included seven massive floats that made their way from adenauerplatz to the memorial cathedral .
they demostrated under the motto " fight the power – club culture versus ignorance " for the return of the love parade next year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin disc jockey dr. motte led the love parade for 15 years before its demise this year the love parade ’ s founder , dr. motte -lrb- photo -rrb- , had expected as many as 5,000 partyers on saturday .
despite the disappointing turnout , the demonstrators still managed to create an ear-splitting chorus of whistles and music that pulsed at an impressively high number of beats per minute .
dozens of djs , including german stars like westbam and paul van dyk , spun on the floats , filling the kurfürstendamm with an aural haze of electric beats .
the demo on one of berlin ’ s main shopping streets was organized by the local music magazine " partysan . "
copycat event goes ahead a few kilometers away , in the tiergarten park , another event was being held under the name " music day . "
but love parade organizer motte had sought to distance himself from the event , describing its organizers as " freeloaders . "
local authorities also required that the organizers reduce the size of the event , downsizing it from five stages to three .
nor were the organizers able to sell any food or drinks .
they first received their permit at the last minute and were unable to organize catering that met the city ’ s requirements under short notice .
berlin authorities first ruled to issue a permit for " music day " on friday , after organizers demonstrated that the event would have enough speeches to be deemed an actual demonstration under local law .
initially , authorities and the police had refused to issue a permit for the event , which they had deemed a techno party rather than a demonstration .
in the end , it made little difference .
according to the news agency dpa , police estimated only 200 to 300 attended the event on the grounds where hundreds of thousands reveled only a year ago .
before sunset there were also major differences between this year ’ s mini events and the mass love parade of the past : for one , both events had to end by 7 p.m. , a full two hours before sunset .
the original love parade lost its status as a " political event " in 2001 after holding it for more than a decade .
the move forced motte and his organizers to pony up the costs for clean-up and other expenses related to the event that are normally covered by the city for major political rallies .

the cabinet-level officials of the social democratic and greens coalition government met at neuhardenberg palace to discuss the achievements of the first half of the administration and to solidify the political goals needed to win the next election in 2006 .
" we ’ re ready for a fight during the second half of this legislative period , " schröder said .
" and we ’ re going into this with the goal of winning a third . "
schröder said the reforms passed so far by his government are unparalleled in europe , and they are already having an effect .
in recent days , economic forecasts have been positively upgraded and , he said , the coalition government has shown an impressive level of determination to push through the difficult reforms , which are intended to jumpstart the lukewarm economy .
with the " agenda 2010 " package , schröder said , the most comprehensive modernization of germany ’ s social security system ever undertaken has been introduced .
reforms not over until they ’ re implemented " it ’ s important to me that it remains clear to everyone that the reform process hasn ’ t ended yet , " schröder said .
" the reform work can only be seen as successful when it the implementation phase has been successfully completed .
and now our political leadership needs to concentrate on the implementation of these wide-ranging reform agenda with as little conflict as possible . "
at the meeting , cabinet officials intensively discussed the law passed friday that will reorganize the supervision of the country ’ s more than 2 million long-term unemployed starting in january 2005 .
schröder said the government must ramp up its placement programs for people who have fallen out of the workforce .
schröder said that although it wouldn ’ t be possible to place all long-term unemployed people , the country needs better placement programs to bring people back into the workforce and help give them restore some of the dignity they ’ ve lost by having to accept government handouts .
but it ’ s unlikely the federal government will implement new programs itself .
economics and labor minister wolfgang clement said the government would not create any special programs to finance the long-term unemployed .
instead , communities and charity organizations should be helping create and find jobs for the unemployed , partially using money that will have been saved through the reforms , he said .
extra burdens for eastern states german cities and communities , however , have questioned whether the cuts will have any tangible effect on the labor market – especially in the eastern states .
with an unemployment rate of 25 percent in some parts of eastern germany , it will be difficult to find jobs for everyone , critics have lamented , questioning the sense of the reforms .
the chancellor said he is planning to meet with the eastern german state premiers who voted against the legislation that would dramatically reduce social welfare benefits for long-term unemployed in the bundesrat , germany ’ s upper legislative chamber , on friday .
" i don ’ t want to have an ‘ east-west ’ discussion on this issue , " schröder said .
instead , he said he is calling on the eastern german premiers to make the best out of the situation .
better daycare so moms can work schröder also called on local communities to improve daycare programs for children under three in order to make it easier for young women to build a career and family .
family minister renate schmidt is expected to next week introduce draft legislation that would require local communities to provide all-day care , based on need , for children under three years of age .
the plan calls for the creation of 230,000 new care slots for the toddlers in the western german states ; eastern german states would not be included in the bill because they have already reached an acceptable level , schmidt said .
the plan calls for money saved by communities through the merger of unemployment and welfare benefits to be funneled to the daycare programs to the tune of € 1.5 billion .
schröder ’ s cabinet is next scheduled to meet during the summer break from parliament in bonn , where reforms to the national public health care system will be discussed . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder ’ s cabinet ponder labor market and family policy at a two-day meeting in eastern germany , chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s cabinet takes stock of major reforms to the country ’ s education , labor and family policies .

and now our political leadership needs to concentrate on the implementation of these wide-ranging reform agenda with as little conflict as possible . "
at the meeting , cabinet officials intensively discussed the law passed friday that will reorganize the supervision of the country ’ s more than 2 million long-term unemployed starting in january 2005 .
schröder said the government must ramp up its placement programs for people who have fallen out of the workforce .
schröder said that although it wouldn ’ t be possible to place all long-term unemployed people , the country needs better placement programs to bring people back into the workforce and help give them restore some of the dignity they ’ ve lost by having to accept government handouts .
but it ’ s unlikely the federal government will implement new programs itself .
economics and labor minister wolfgang clement said the government would not create any special programs to finance the long-term unemployed .
instead , communities and charity organizations should be helping create and find jobs for the unemployed , partially using money that will have been saved through the reforms , he said .
extra burdens for eastern states german cities and communities , however , have questioned whether the cuts will have any tangible effect on the labor market – especially in the eastern states .
with an unemployment rate of 25 percent in some parts of eastern germany , it will be difficult to find jobs for everyone , critics have lamented , questioning the sense of the reforms .
the chancellor said he is planning to meet with the eastern german state premiers who voted against the legislation that would dramatically reduce social welfare benefits for long-term unemployed in the bundesrat , germany ’ s upper legislative chamber , on friday .
" i don ’ t want to have an ‘ east-west ’ discussion on this issue , " schröder said .
instead , he said he is calling on the eastern german premiers to make the best out of the situation .
better daycare so moms can work schröder also called on local communities to improve daycare programs for children under three in order to make it easier for young women to build a career and family .
family minister renate schmidt is expected to next week introduce draft legislation that would require local communities to provide all-day care , based on need , for children under three years of age .
the plan calls for the creation of 230,000 new care slots for the toddlers in the western german states ; eastern german states would not be included in the bill because they have already reached an acceptable level , schmidt said .
the plan calls for money saved by communities through the merger of unemployment and welfare benefits to be funneled to the daycare programs to the tune of € 1.5 billion .

the cabinet-level officials of the social democratic and greens coalition government met at neuhardenberg palace to discuss the achievements of the first half of the administration and to solidify the political goals needed to win the next election in 2006 .
" we ’ re ready for a fight during the second half of this legislative period , " schröder said .
" and we ’ re going into this with the goal of winning a third . "
schröder said the reforms passed so far by his government are unparalleled in europe , and they are already having an effect .
in recent days , economic forecasts have been positively upgraded and , he said , the coalition government has shown an impressive level of determination to push through the difficult reforms , which are intended to jumpstart the lukewarm economy .
with the " agenda 2010 " package , schröder said , the most comprehensive modernization of germany ’ s social security system ever undertaken has been introduced .

united states secretary of state colin powell and united nations general secretary kofi annan have already been to khartoum ; now , germany is sending joschka fischer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer the foreign minister wants to ensure that the sudanese government keeps the promises it made to powell and annan - to allow aid agencies better access to refugees in darfur , to disarm the janjaweed militiamen trying to expel african farmers from the region , and to implement security measures for darfur 's civilians . " these are clear agreements that have been made , and that the government in khartoum has committed to , " said german foreign ministry spokesperson jens plötner .
" i do n't think any additional agreements have to be made .
what 's important now is making sure the existing agreements are upheld .
minister fischer and his deputy , kerstin müller , have repeatedly made it clear that enough words have been said .
now , action must follow . " improved access to refugees aid workers have reported that their access to starving refugees in darfur has improved .
to assist their work , fischer is bringing with him 3.5 tons of medicine to treat the refugees . disarmament of the arab militiamen , who , with government backing have killed and raped thousands of darfur 's black african population since rebel groups took up arms last year , is taking longer . according to fischer , the government in khartoum is capable of demilitarizing the rebels immediately " if it only wants to . " " what we 're talking about is a totally normal exertion of state sovereignty , for a nation to fulfil its duty to ensure peace , order , and security for its citizens , " plötner said .
" this duty is also something that the sudanese government is obligated to fulfil . " sanctions could follow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sudanese refugee walks past a dead donkey in a refugee camp if the government in khartoum does n't stick to its commitment to stop the violence , the country faces possible sanctions .
although sudan is warning of creating another iraq-style situation should sanctions be imposed , fischer has already said that he supports the idea of certain sanctions , such as a weapons embargo . a us draft resolution before the un security council includes sanctions against leaders of the arab militia , which could be widened to include members of the government .
the us has proposed escalating sanctions within 30 days if results are not evident , though some countries say that sudan should be allowed more time . nina werkhäuser -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin may send peacekeepers to sudan the german deputy foreign minister has indicated berlin is considering sending peacekeeping troops to war-torn sudan under a u.n. mandate , adding a further dimension to the bundeswehr ’ s deployment in africa .

but the landmark could be stripped of its special status because of the city 's lofty building plans . tempers in cologne are sky-high following a decision by the united nations educational scientific and cultural organization to place the city 's cathedral on its endangered list .
no , the gothic masterpiece is n't suffering from pollution damage , though over the centuries , its façade has been darkened by soot and smog .
nor is the cathedral in danger of being overrun by tourists or threatened by illicit excavation , pillaging , or landmines - all typical reasons why unesco classifies world heritage sites as endangered . the problem , according to unesco officials , lies in plans by the city of cologne to erect new office buildings which could have a " harmful visual impact " on the skyline . specifically , unesco objects to four new high-rise buildings being built opposite the cathedral , across the rhine river .
the new towers , which will range from 103 to 120 meters -lrb- 338 to 394 feet -rrb- in height , could block the dramatic view of the cathedral 's 157-meter-tall twin spires , ruining cologne 's distinctive skyline . city officials take offence cologne officials are perplexed and angry about unesco 's decision .

but the landmark could be stripped of its special status because of the city 's lofty building plans . tempers in cologne are sky-high following a decision by the united nations educational scientific and cultural organization to place the city 's cathedral on its endangered list .
no , the gothic masterpiece is n't suffering from pollution damage , though over the centuries , its façade has been darkened by soot and smog .
nor is the cathedral in danger of being overrun by tourists or threatened by illicit excavation , pillaging , or landmines - all typical reasons why unesco classifies world heritage sites as endangered . the problem , according to unesco officials , lies in plans by the city of cologne to erect new office buildings which could have a " harmful visual impact " on the skyline . specifically , unesco objects to four new high-rise buildings being built opposite the cathedral , across the rhine river .
the new towers , which will range from 103 to 120 meters -lrb- 338 to 394 feet -rrb- in height , could block the dramatic view of the cathedral 's 157-meter-tall twin spires , ruining cologne 's distinctive skyline . city officials take offence cologne officials are perplexed and angry about unesco 's decision . " unesco is a bad loser , " said achim hermes , spokesman for the company putting up one of the new towers , the triangle building .
" it is well below the height of the cathedral , so the building will not affect anyone 's view - all you have to do is walk a few paces right or left , and your view will be just fine . " " i think they are using the cathedral to penalize the city , " said barbara schock-werner , who oversees the cathedral 's administration .
" one can not say that only one element , this aesthetic concern , should put the cathedral on unesco 's red list .
they are exaggerating . " unesco 's biggest threat is that it could strip the cathedral of its world heritage status , though unesco spokeswoman karaline shenk conceded " that almost never happens . " " really , it is not in unesco 's hands , " she said .
" it 's the responsibility of cologne . " progress versus preservation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne 's most famous landmark dominates the night sky the city has no plans to stop construction of the new buildings , which are going up in an area that has long been targeted for urban renewal .
nor does the city have any plans to detract from its most treasured landmark . even before the cathedral was named a world heritage site in 1996 , the city had passed zoning laws allowing only shorter buildings nearby to preserve the view of the " dom , " as it 's known by locals . " every cologner would give his last shirt to protect it , " said city spokesman ulrich hoever . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

united states secretary of state colin powell and united nations general secretary kofi annan have already been to khartoum ; now , germany is sending joschka fischer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer the foreign minister wants to ensure that the sudanese government keeps the promises it made to powell and annan - to allow aid agencies better access to refugees in darfur , to disarm the janjaweed militiamen trying to expel african farmers from the region , and to implement security measures for darfur 's civilians . " these are clear agreements that have been made , and that the government in khartoum has committed to , " said german foreign ministry spokesperson jens plötner .
" i do n't think any additional agreements have to be made .
what 's important now is making sure the existing agreements are upheld .
minister fischer and his deputy , kerstin müller , have repeatedly made it clear that enough words have been said .
now , action must follow . " improved access to refugees aid workers have reported that their access to starving refugees in darfur has improved .
to assist their work , fischer is bringing with him 3.5 tons of medicine to treat the refugees . disarmament of the arab militiamen , who , with government backing have killed and raped thousands of darfur 's black african population since rebel groups took up arms last year , is taking longer . according to fischer , the government in khartoum is capable of demilitarizing the rebels immediately " if it only wants to . " " what we 're talking about is a totally normal exertion of state sovereignty , for a nation to fulfil its duty to ensure peace , order , and security for its citizens , " plötner said .
" this duty is also something that the sudanese government is obligated to fulfil . " sanctions could follow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sudanese refugee walks past a dead donkey in a refugee camp if the government in khartoum does n't stick to its commitment to stop the violence , the country faces possible sanctions .
although sudan is warning of creating another iraq-style situation should sanctions be imposed , fischer has already said that he supports the idea of certain sanctions , such as a weapons embargo . a us draft resolution before the un security council includes sanctions against leaders of the arab militia , which could be widened to include members of the government .
the us has proposed escalating sanctions within 30 days if results are not evident , though some countries say that sudan should be allowed more time . nina werkhäuser -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin may send peacekeepers to sudan the german deputy foreign minister has indicated berlin is considering sending peacekeeping troops to war-torn sudan under a u.n. mandate , adding a further dimension to the bundeswehr ’ s deployment in africa .

the cabinet-level officials of the social democratic and greens coalition government met at neuhardenberg palace to discuss the achievements of the first half of the administration and to solidify the political goals needed to win the next election in 2006 .
" we ’ re ready for a fight during the second half of this legislative period , " schröder said .
" and we ’ re going into this with the goal of winning a third . "
schröder said the reforms passed so far by his government are unparalleled in europe , and they are already having an effect .
in recent days , economic forecasts have been positively upgraded and , he said , the coalition government has shown an impressive level of determination to push through the difficult reforms , which are intended to jumpstart the lukewarm economy .
with the " agenda 2010 " package , schröder said , the most comprehensive modernization of germany ’ s social security system ever undertaken has been introduced .
reforms not over until they ’ re implemented " it ’ s important to me that it remains clear to everyone that the reform process hasn ’ t ended yet , " schröder said .
" the reform work can only be seen as successful when it the implementation phase has been successfully completed .
and now our political leadership needs to concentrate on the implementation of these wide-ranging reform agenda with as little conflict as possible . "
at the meeting , cabinet officials intensively discussed the law passed friday that will reorganize the supervision of the country ’ s more than 2 million long-term unemployed starting in january 2005 .
schröder said the government must ramp up its placement programs for people who have fallen out of the workforce .
schröder said that although it wouldn ’ t be possible to place all long-term unemployed people , the country needs better placement programs to bring people back into the workforce and help give them restore some of the dignity they ’ ve lost by having to accept government handouts .
but it ’ s unlikely the federal government will implement new programs itself .
economics and labor minister wolfgang clement said the government would not create any special programs to finance the long-term unemployed .
instead , communities and charity organizations should be helping create and find jobs for the unemployed , partially using money that will have been saved through the reforms , he said .
extra burdens for eastern states german cities and communities , however , have questioned whether the cuts will have any tangible effect on the labor market – especially in the eastern states .
with an unemployment rate of 25 percent in some parts of eastern germany , it will be difficult to find jobs for everyone , critics have lamented , questioning the sense of the reforms .
the chancellor said he is planning to meet with the eastern german state premiers who voted against the legislation that would dramatically reduce social welfare benefits for long-term unemployed in the bundesrat , germany ’ s upper legislative chamber , on friday .
" i don ’ t want to have an ‘ east-west ’ discussion on this issue , " schröder said .
instead , he said he is calling on the eastern german premiers to make the best out of the situation .
better daycare so moms can work schröder also called on local communities to improve daycare programs for children under three in order to make it easier for young women to build a career and family .
family minister renate schmidt is expected to next week introduce draft legislation that would require local communities to provide all-day care , based on need , for children under three years of age .
the plan calls for the creation of 230,000 new care slots for the toddlers in the western german states ; eastern german states would not be included in the bill because they have already reached an acceptable level , schmidt said .
the plan calls for money saved by communities through the merger of unemployment and welfare benefits to be funneled to the daycare programs to the tune of € 1.5 billion .

in recent days , economic forecasts have been positively upgraded and , he said , the coalition government has shown an impressive level of determination to push through the difficult reforms , which are intended to jumpstart the lukewarm economy .
with the " agenda 2010 " package , schröder said , the most comprehensive modernization of germany ’ s social security system ever undertaken has been introduced .
reforms not over until they ’ re implemented " it ’ s important to me that it remains clear to everyone that the reform process hasn ’ t ended yet , " schröder said .
" the reform work can only be seen as successful when it the implementation phase has been successfully completed .
and now our political leadership needs to concentrate on the implementation of these wide-ranging reform agenda with as little conflict as possible . "
at the meeting , cabinet officials intensively discussed the law passed friday that will reorganize the supervision of the country ’ s more than 2 million long-term unemployed starting in january 2005 .
schröder said the government must ramp up its placement programs for people who have fallen out of the workforce .
schröder said that although it wouldn ’ t be possible to place all long-term unemployed people , the country needs better placement programs to bring people back into the workforce and help give them restore some of the dignity they ’ ve lost by having to accept government handouts .
but it ’ s unlikely the federal government will implement new programs itself .
economics and labor minister wolfgang clement said the government would not create any special programs to finance the long-term unemployed .
instead , communities and charity organizations should be helping create and find jobs for the unemployed , partially using money that will have been saved through the reforms , he said .
extra burdens for eastern states german cities and communities , however , have questioned whether the cuts will have any tangible effect on the labor market – especially in the eastern states .
with an unemployment rate of 25 percent in some parts of eastern germany , it will be difficult to find jobs for everyone , critics have lamented , questioning the sense of the reforms .
the chancellor said he is planning to meet with the eastern german state premiers who voted against the legislation that would dramatically reduce social welfare benefits for long-term unemployed in the bundesrat , germany ’ s upper legislative chamber , on friday .
" i don ’ t want to have an ‘ east-west ’ discussion on this issue , " schröder said .
instead , he said he is calling on the eastern german premiers to make the best out of the situation .
better daycare so moms can work schröder also called on local communities to improve daycare programs for children under three in order to make it easier for young women to build a career and family .
family minister renate schmidt is expected to next week introduce draft legislation that would require local communities to provide all-day care , based on need , for children under three years of age .
the plan calls for the creation of 230,000 new care slots for the toddlers in the western german states ; eastern german states would not be included in the bill because they have already reached an acceptable level , schmidt said .
the plan calls for money saved by communities through the merger of unemployment and welfare benefits to be funneled to the daycare programs to the tune of € 1.5 billion .

but after it lost its status as a political demonstration in 2001 and had to pick up part of the tab previously paid by the city , the event 's been in a slow downward spiral .
this year it was abruptly cancelled after organizers failed to find enough sponsors .
on saturday , hundreds turned out at events across the city to mourn the parade 's passing . but it went out with a whimper . hundreds of revelers converged on west berlin ’ s grand kurfürstendamm boulevard for a techno parade that included seven massive floats that made their way from adenauerplatz to the memorial cathedral .
they demostrated under the motto " fight the power – club culture versus ignorance " for the return of the love parade next year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin disc jockey dr. motte led the love parade for 15 years before its demise this year the love parade ’ s founder , dr. motte -lrb- photo -rrb- , had expected as many as 5,000 partyers on saturday .
despite the disappointing turnout , the demonstrators still managed to create an ear-splitting chorus of whistles and music that pulsed at an impressively high number of beats per minute .
dozens of djs , including german stars like westbam and paul van dyk , spun on the floats , filling the kurfürstendamm with an aural haze of electric beats .
the demo on one of berlin ’ s main shopping streets was organized by the local music magazine " partysan . "
copycat event goes ahead a few kilometers away , in the tiergarten park , another event was being held under the name " music day . "
but love parade organizer motte had sought to distance himself from the event , describing its organizers as " freeloaders . "
local authorities also required that the organizers reduce the size of the event , downsizing it from five stages to three .
nor were the organizers able to sell any food or drinks .
they first received their permit at the last minute and were unable to organize catering that met the city ’ s requirements under short notice .
berlin authorities first ruled to issue a permit for " music day " on friday , after organizers demonstrated that the event would have enough speeches to be deemed an actual demonstration under local law .
initially , authorities and the police had refused to issue a permit for the event , which they had deemed a techno party rather than a demonstration .
in the end , it made little difference .
according to the news agency dpa , police estimated only 200 to 300 attended the event on the grounds where hundreds of thousands reveled only a year ago .
before sunset there were also major differences between this year ’ s mini events and the mass love parade of the past : for one , both events had to end by 7 p.m. , a full two hours before sunset .
the original love parade lost its status as a " political event " in 2001 after holding it for more than a decade .
the move forced motte and his organizers to pony up the costs for clean-up and other expenses related to the event that are normally covered by the city for major political rallies .
in may , the event , which has drawn as many as a million ravers in past years , was cancelled because its organizers couldn ’ t find enough sponsors . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mourning the love parade there 's still a glimmer of hope that the world 's largest techno music party will survive .

but after it lost its status as a political demonstration in 2001 and had to pick up part of the tab previously paid by the city , the event 's been in a slow downward spiral .
this year it was abruptly cancelled after organizers failed to find enough sponsors .
on saturday , hundreds turned out at events across the city to mourn the parade 's passing . but it went out with a whimper . hundreds of revelers converged on west berlin ’ s grand kurfürstendamm boulevard for a techno parade that included seven massive floats that made their way from adenauerplatz to the memorial cathedral .
they demostrated under the motto " fight the power – club culture versus ignorance " for the return of the love parade next year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin disc jockey dr. motte led the love parade for 15 years before its demise this year the love parade ’ s founder , dr. motte -lrb- photo -rrb- , had expected as many as 5,000 partyers on saturday .
despite the disappointing turnout , the demonstrators still managed to create an ear-splitting chorus of whistles and music that pulsed at an impressively high number of beats per minute .
dozens of djs , including german stars like westbam and paul van dyk , spun on the floats , filling the kurfürstendamm with an aural haze of electric beats .
the demo on one of berlin ’ s main shopping streets was organized by the local music magazine " partysan . "
copycat event goes ahead a few kilometers away , in the tiergarten park , another event was being held under the name " music day . "
but love parade organizer motte had sought to distance himself from the event , describing its organizers as " freeloaders . "
local authorities also required that the organizers reduce the size of the event , downsizing it from five stages to three .
nor were the organizers able to sell any food or drinks .
they first received their permit at the last minute and were unable to organize catering that met the city ’ s requirements under short notice .
berlin authorities first ruled to issue a permit for " music day " on friday , after organizers demonstrated that the event would have enough speeches to be deemed an actual demonstration under local law .
initially , authorities and the police had refused to issue a permit for the event , which they had deemed a techno party rather than a demonstration .
in the end , it made little difference .
according to the news agency dpa , police estimated only 200 to 300 attended the event on the grounds where hundreds of thousands reveled only a year ago .
before sunset there were also major differences between this year ’ s mini events and the mass love parade of the past : for one , both events had to end by 7 p.m. , a full two hours before sunset .
the original love parade lost its status as a " political event " in 2001 after holding it for more than a decade .
the move forced motte and his organizers to pony up the costs for clean-up and other expenses related to the event that are normally covered by the city for major political rallies .
in may , the event , which has drawn as many as a million ravers in past years , was cancelled because its organizers couldn ’ t find enough sponsors . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mourning the love parade there 's still a glimmer of hope that the world 's largest techno music party will survive .

but after it lost its status as a political demonstration in 2001 and had to pick up part of the tab previously paid by the city , the event 's been in a slow downward spiral .
this year it was abruptly cancelled after organizers failed to find enough sponsors .
on saturday , hundreds turned out at events across the city to mourn the parade 's passing . but it went out with a whimper . hundreds of revelers converged on west berlin ’ s grand kurfürstendamm boulevard for a techno parade that included seven massive floats that made their way from adenauerplatz to the memorial cathedral .
they demostrated under the motto " fight the power – club culture versus ignorance " for the return of the love parade next year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin disc jockey dr. motte led the love parade for 15 years before its demise this year the love parade ’ s founder , dr. motte -lrb- photo -rrb- , had expected as many as 5,000 partyers on saturday .
despite the disappointing turnout , the demonstrators still managed to create an ear-splitting chorus of whistles and music that pulsed at an impressively high number of beats per minute .
dozens of djs , including german stars like westbam and paul van dyk , spun on the floats , filling the kurfürstendamm with an aural haze of electric beats .
the demo on one of berlin ’ s main shopping streets was organized by the local music magazine " partysan . "
copycat event goes ahead a few kilometers away , in the tiergarten park , another event was being held under the name " music day . "
but love parade organizer motte had sought to distance himself from the event , describing its organizers as " freeloaders . "
local authorities also required that the organizers reduce the size of the event , downsizing it from five stages to three .
nor were the organizers able to sell any food or drinks .
they first received their permit at the last minute and were unable to organize catering that met the city ’ s requirements under short notice .
berlin authorities first ruled to issue a permit for " music day " on friday , after organizers demonstrated that the event would have enough speeches to be deemed an actual demonstration under local law .
initially , authorities and the police had refused to issue a permit for the event , which they had deemed a techno party rather than a demonstration .
in the end , it made little difference .
according to the news agency dpa , police estimated only 200 to 300 attended the event on the grounds where hundreds of thousands reveled only a year ago .
before sunset there were also major differences between this year ’ s mini events and the mass love parade of the past : for one , both events had to end by 7 p.m. , a full two hours before sunset .
the original love parade lost its status as a " political event " in 2001 after holding it for more than a decade .
the move forced motte and his organizers to pony up the costs for clean-up and other expenses related to the event that are normally covered by the city for major political rallies .
in may , the event , which has drawn as many as a million ravers in past years , was cancelled because its organizers couldn ’ t find enough sponsors . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mourning the love parade there 's still a glimmer of hope that the world 's largest techno music party will survive .
but just in case it does n't , many dw-world readers expressed their sorrow over the parade 's demise .

the organizers of the love parade , the world 's biggest techno music parade , say the event wo n't happen this year .
the mass party , which at its peak had 1.5 million dancing through berlin 's streets , ca n't find financing .

" dr. dorrepaal 's deep understanding of the pharmaceutical industry together with her experience in the strategic repositioning of top tier companies and in optimizing their performance will further strengthen schering 's management team , " hubertus erlen , chairman of schering ’ s executive board said in a statement .
women moving to the top schering ’ s appointment of dorrepaal is one of several signs in recent weeks that the business climate is changing for women in germany .

on top of all that , the german association of young entrepreneurs -lrb- bju -rrb- recently appointed 38-year-old businesswoman karoline beck as its president .
over at citibank , the subsidiary of the world ’ s largest financial services company , citigroup , american sue hartnett recently took over the helm of the company ’ s german operations after her predecessor , christine licci , unexpectedly resigned in may .
and it doesn ’ t stop there : economics professor lucrezia reichlin is considered by many to be the top candidate to lead the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- .
yet despite these advances , management circles in german business are still a man ’ s world .
a meager 11 percent of german companies have a woman in management positions , compared to an eu average of 14 percent .
with 40 percent , the united states and canada are way , way ahead .
germany ’ s scarlet letter for working moms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since world war ii , german women have been told that raising a family is the job they were meant to take .
barbara schaeffer-hegel , founder of the european academy for women in politics and business -lrb- eaf -rrb- in berlin , attributes the shortfall to german cultural traditions .
" the mother ideology of the third reich and the conservative women ’ s ’ politics in the postwar time have left deep marks , " she explains .
" the division of the areas of public and private were cemented with the exclusive responsibility of women for the private areas -lrb- of life -rrb- – caring for children and ensuring the welfare of the family . "
in addition to the mentality , there ’ s also an institutional problem , the former professor of pedagogy said .
the daycare infrastructure in germany is underdeveloped , as is the preschool system .
and companies are often reluctant to trust women with important projects because they could get pregnant at any time .
in other words , latent discrimination is perpetuate throughout the business culture here .
" it ’ s a lot harder to reconcile having a family and a career in germany than it is in most developing countries and almost all industrial nations , " she says .
there ’ s still an enormous paradox here : most of the women recently making headlines for making it to the inner circle of managers have been imported from abroad .
karin dorrepaal is dutch , lucrezia reichlin is italian and beatrice weder di mauro has dual swiss and italian citizenship .
but that comes as little surprise to schaeffer-hegel .
" the word ‘ rabenmütter ’ -lrb- a term loosely translated as ‘ bad mom with latchkey kids ’ -rrb- only exists in germany , " she says .
" in other european countries and in america , women achieve huge things a still manage to have kids .
nor do they feel like bad mothers for doing so .
there the infrastructure is better and the prejudices against the women aren ’ t as big of a strain as they are here .

and yet she has chosen it as the logo for a brand new project – a bank for women .

at the center of the discussions , which are being held in neuhardenberg palace in the state of brandenburg , are education , innovation and family policy .
the cabinet also plans to discuss labor market reforms and efforts to promote growth in eastern germany , where the economy is stagnant and the unemployment rate explosive .
at the opening of the retreat on friday , schröder called on his cabinet to stick to its current reform plans .
" our course is important , " he said , " and we have to succeed . "
otherwise , he warned , most would give up on any chance of turning germany ’ s lame economy around .
schröder ’ s " agenda 2010 " program has faced a major challenge from the leftist faction of his social democratic party .
last week they formed a split-off group , " election alternative : jobs and social justice , " and have threatened to create their own political party .
the leftist faction is seeking to block the current reforms , and schröder is also being challenged by the opposition conservatives .
the main argument among critics is that the government must assure them and german voters that it has a comprehensive reform plan that will actually deliver the final changes needed to repair the country ’ s failing labor market , lukewarm economy and a social system sagging under the weight of shrinking tax revenues and an aging population .
paving the way for implementation despite the open discussion , there are no plans to make changes to the government ’ s current reform plans at the meeting .
according to the parliamentary group leader of the greens , krista sager , the meeting is instead intended to produce " accompanying measures " for recently initiated reforms .

plans for the better promotion and integration of long-term unemployed germans after the introduction of a law next year that will merge the countries unemployment and welfare benefits for the long-term unemployed are also on the table .
under the new plan , unemployed will be required to take most jobs offered to them with the risk of benefit cuts if they refuse to accept work .
on saturday , economics and labor minister wolfgang clement called on both business , communities and government to create new jobs in order to help bring the long-term unemployed back into the workforce .
better toddler daycare family minister renate schmidt is expected to introduce draft legislation that would require local communities to provide all-day care , based on need , for children under three years of age .
the plan calls for the creation of 230,000 new care slots for the toddlers in the western german states ; eastern german states would not be included in the bill because they have already reached an acceptable level , schmidt said .

at the center of the discussions , which are being held in neuhardenberg palace in the state of brandenburg , are education , innovation and family policy .
the cabinet also plans to discuss labor market reforms and efforts to promote growth in eastern germany , where the economy is stagnant and the unemployment rate explosive .
at the opening of the retreat on friday , schröder called on his cabinet to stick to its current reform plans .
" our course is important , " he said , " and we have to succeed . "
otherwise , he warned , most would give up on any chance of turning germany ’ s lame economy around .
schröder ’ s " agenda 2010 " program has faced a major challenge from the leftist faction of his social democratic party .
last week they formed a split-off group , " election alternative : jobs and social justice , " and have threatened to create their own political party .
the leftist faction is seeking to block the current reforms , and schröder is also being challenged by the opposition conservatives .
the main argument among critics is that the government must assure them and german voters that it has a comprehensive reform plan that will actually deliver the final changes needed to repair the country ’ s failing labor market , lukewarm economy and a social system sagging under the weight of shrinking tax revenues and an aging population .
paving the way for implementation despite the open discussion , there are no plans to make changes to the government ’ s current reform plans at the meeting .
according to the parliamentary group leader of the greens , krista sager , the meeting is instead intended to produce " accompanying measures " for recently initiated reforms .
the party leaders are also expected to discuss government ’ s main legislative policies for the second half of the administration , which runs through 2006 .
plans for the better promotion and integration of long-term unemployed germans after the introduction of a law next year that will merge the countries unemployment and welfare benefits for the long-term unemployed are also on the table .
under the new plan , unemployed will be required to take most jobs offered to them with the risk of benefit cuts if they refuse to accept work .
on saturday , economics and labor minister wolfgang clement called on both business , communities and government to create new jobs in order to help bring the long-term unemployed back into the workforce .
better toddler daycare family minister renate schmidt is expected to introduce draft legislation that would require local communities to provide all-day care , based on need , for children under three years of age .
the plan calls for the creation of 230,000 new care slots for the toddlers in the western german states ; eastern german states would not be included in the bill because they have already reached an acceptable level , schmidt said .
the plan calls for money saved by communities through the merger of unemployment and welfare benefits to be funneled to the daycare programs to the tune of € 1.5 billion . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cabinet huddles to map future direction german chancellor gerhard schröder has called together his cabinet for a two-day balance-taking session , just as a key survey reveals the popularity of his social democratic party has sunk to a record new low .

at the center of the discussions , which are being held in neuhardenberg palace in the state of brandenburg , are education , innovation and family policy .
the cabinet also plans to discuss labor market reforms and efforts to promote growth in eastern germany , where the economy is stagnant and the unemployment rate explosive .
at the opening of the retreat on friday , schröder called on his cabinet to stick to its current reform plans .
" our course is important , " he said , " and we have to succeed . "
otherwise , he warned , most would give up on any chance of turning germany ’ s lame economy around .
schröder ’ s " agenda 2010 " program has faced a major challenge from the leftist faction of his social democratic party .
last week they formed a split-off group , " election alternative : jobs and social justice , " and have threatened to create their own political party .
the leftist faction is seeking to block the current reforms , and schröder is also being challenged by the opposition conservatives .
the main argument among critics is that the government must assure them and german voters that it has a comprehensive reform plan that will actually deliver the final changes needed to repair the country ’ s failing labor market , lukewarm economy and a social system sagging under the weight of shrinking tax revenues and an aging population .
paving the way for implementation despite the open discussion , there are no plans to make changes to the government ’ s current reform plans at the meeting .
according to the parliamentary group leader of the greens , krista sager , the meeting is instead intended to produce " accompanying measures " for recently initiated reforms .
the party leaders are also expected to discuss government ’ s main legislative policies for the second half of the administration , which runs through 2006 .
plans for the better promotion and integration of long-term unemployed germans after the introduction of a law next year that will merge the countries unemployment and welfare benefits for the long-term unemployed are also on the table .
under the new plan , unemployed will be required to take most jobs offered to them with the risk of benefit cuts if they refuse to accept work .
on saturday , economics and labor minister wolfgang clement called on both business , communities and government to create new jobs in order to help bring the long-term unemployed back into the workforce .
better toddler daycare family minister renate schmidt is expected to introduce draft legislation that would require local communities to provide all-day care , based on need , for children under three years of age .
the plan calls for the creation of 230,000 new care slots for the toddlers in the western german states ; eastern german states would not be included in the bill because they have already reached an acceptable level , schmidt said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus on women wage gap between the sexes widens in germany work-life balance gets boost in germany " glass ceiling " lawsuit takes aim at german bank eu takes slow road to gender equity business -pipe- 10.07.2004 for german women , glass ceiling hangs low großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karin dorrepaal is the first woman to serve on a major german board pharmaceutical giant schering announced this week it would appoint karin dorrepaal to its executive board – a sad first for germany .
no other industrial nation has as few female top managers as germany . german boardrooms still remain a men ’ s club .
but come sept .
2005 , things may start to change .
karin dorrepaal , a native of the netherlands , is then set to become the only woman to join the executive board of one of the 30 blue chip companies listed on the german stock index .
she ’ s got two degrees in psychology and obtained a doctorate of medicine for her cancer research .
to top it all off , she ’ s also the holder of an mba .
until 1990 dorrepaal worked at the dutch cancer research center ; after that she moved to the amsterdam offices of the business consultancy booz allen hamilton .
in 2000 , she became the company ’ s vice president , taking responsibility for the consultancy ’ s work with pharmaceutical companies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schering headquarters in berlin she ’ s had an impressive career – one that also persuaded schering executives she was the right candidate .
nonetheless , dorrepaal is still relatively unknown within the company . schering first worked with 43-year-old dorrepaal during a restructuring of its operations and marketing divisions .
" dr. dorrepaal 's deep understanding of the pharmaceutical industry together with her experience in the strategic repositioning of top tier companies and in optimizing their performance will further strengthen schering 's management team , " hubertus erlen , chairman of schering ’ s executive board said in a statement .
women moving to the top schering ’ s appointment of dorrepaal is one of several signs in recent weeks that the business climate is changing for women in germany .
recently , economist beatrice weder di mauro got appointed to germany ’ s prestigious council of economic advisors , a panel of top-ranking economists that guides the federal government on economic decision-making .
it was the fist time in the " panel of wisemen 's " 41-year history that it had brought a woman into its ranks .
on top of all that , the german association of young entrepreneurs -lrb- bju -rrb- recently appointed 38-year-old businesswoman karoline beck as its president .
over at citibank , the subsidiary of the world ’ s largest financial services company , citigroup , american sue hartnett recently took over the helm of the company ’ s german operations after her predecessor , christine licci , unexpectedly resigned in may .
and it doesn ’ t stop there : economics professor lucrezia reichlin is considered by many to be the top candidate to lead the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- .
yet despite these advances , management circles in german business are still a man ’ s world .
a meager 11 percent of german companies have a woman in management positions , compared to an eu average of 14 percent .
with 40 percent , the united states and canada are way , way ahead .
germany ’ s scarlet letter for working moms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since world war ii , german women have been told that raising a family is the job they were meant to take .

the daycare infrastructure in germany is underdeveloped , as is the preschool system .

no other industrial nation has as few female top managers as germany . german boardrooms still remain a men ’ s club .
but come sept .
2005 , things may start to change .
karin dorrepaal , a native of the netherlands , is then set to become the only woman to join the executive board of one of the 30 blue chip companies listed on the german stock index .
she ’ s got two degrees in psychology and obtained a doctorate of medicine for her cancer research .
to top it all off , she ’ s also the holder of an mba .
until 1990 dorrepaal worked at the dutch cancer research center ; after that she moved to the amsterdam offices of the business consultancy booz allen hamilton .
in 2000 , she became the company ’ s vice president , taking responsibility for the consultancy ’ s work with pharmaceutical companies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schering headquarters in berlin she ’ s had an impressive career – one that also persuaded schering executives she was the right candidate .
nonetheless , dorrepaal is still relatively unknown within the company . schering first worked with 43-year-old dorrepaal during a restructuring of its operations and marketing divisions .
" dr. dorrepaal 's deep understanding of the pharmaceutical industry together with her experience in the strategic repositioning of top tier companies and in optimizing their performance will further strengthen schering 's management team , " hubertus erlen , chairman of schering ’ s executive board said in a statement .
women moving to the top schering ’ s appointment of dorrepaal is one of several signs in recent weeks that the business climate is changing for women in germany .
recently , economist beatrice weder di mauro got appointed to germany ’ s prestigious council of economic advisors , a panel of top-ranking economists that guides the federal government on economic decision-making .
it was the fist time in the " panel of wisemen 's " 41-year history that it had brought a woman into its ranks .
on top of all that , the german association of young entrepreneurs -lrb- bju -rrb- recently appointed 38-year-old businesswoman karoline beck as its president .
over at citibank , the subsidiary of the world ’ s largest financial services company , citigroup , american sue hartnett recently took over the helm of the company ’ s german operations after her predecessor , christine licci , unexpectedly resigned in may .
and it doesn ’ t stop there : economics professor lucrezia reichlin is considered by many to be the top candidate to lead the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- .
yet despite these advances , management circles in german business are still a man ’ s world .
a meager 11 percent of german companies have a woman in management positions , compared to an eu average of 14 percent .
with 40 percent , the united states and canada are way , way ahead .
germany ’ s scarlet letter for working moms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since world war ii , german women have been told that raising a family is the job they were meant to take .
barbara schaeffer-hegel , founder of the european academy for women in politics and business -lrb- eaf -rrb- in berlin , attributes the shortfall to german cultural traditions .
" the mother ideology of the third reich and the conservative women ’ s ’ politics in the postwar time have left deep marks , " she explains .
" the division of the areas of public and private were cemented with the exclusive responsibility of women for the private areas -lrb- of life -rrb- – caring for children and ensuring the welfare of the family . "
in addition to the mentality , there ’ s also an institutional problem , the former professor of pedagogy said .
the daycare infrastructure in germany is underdeveloped , as is the preschool system .
and companies are often reluctant to trust women with important projects because they could get pregnant at any time .
in other words , latent discrimination is perpetuate throughout the business culture here .
" it ’ s a lot harder to reconcile having a family and a career in germany than it is in most developing countries and almost all industrial nations , " she says .
there ’ s still an enormous paradox here : most of the women recently making headlines for making it to the inner circle of managers have been imported from abroad .
karin dorrepaal is dutch , lucrezia reichlin is italian and beatrice weder di mauro has dual swiss and italian citizenship .
but that comes as little surprise to schaeffer-hegel .
" the word ‘ rabenmütter ’ -lrb- a term loosely translated as ‘ bad mom with latchkey kids ’ -rrb- only exists in germany , " she says .
" in other european countries and in america , women achieve huge things a still manage to have kids .

but after it lost its status as a political demonstration in 2001 and had to pick up part of the tab previously paid by the city , the event 's been in a slow downward spiral .
this year it was abruptly cancelled after organizers failed to find enough sponsors .
on saturday , hundreds turned out at events across the city to mourn the parade 's passing . but it went out with a whimper . hundreds of revelers converged on west berlin ’ s grand kurfürstendamm boulevard for a techno parade that included seven massive floats that made their way from adenauerplatz to the memorial cathedral .
they demostrated under the motto " fight the power – club culture versus ignorance " for the return of the love parade next year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin disc jockey dr. motte led the love parade for 15 years before its demise this year the love parade ’ s founder , dr. motte -lrb- photo -rrb- , had expected as many as 5,000 partyers on saturday .
despite the disappointing turnout , the demonstrators still managed to create an ear-splitting chorus of whistles and music that pulsed at an impressively high number of beats per minute .
dozens of djs , including german stars like westbam and paul van dyk , spun on the floats , filling the kurfürstendamm with an aural haze of electric beats .
the demo on one of berlin ’ s main shopping streets was organized by the local music magazine " partysan . "
copycat event goes ahead a few kilometers away , in the tiergarten park , another event was being held under the name " music day . "
but love parade organizer motte had sought to distance himself from the event , describing its organizers as " freeloaders . "
local authorities also required that the organizers reduce the size of the event , downsizing it from five stages to three .
nor were the organizers able to sell any food or drinks .
they first received their permit at the last minute and were unable to organize catering that met the city ’ s requirements under short notice .
berlin authorities first ruled to issue a permit for " music day " on friday , after organizers demonstrated that the event would have enough speeches to be deemed an actual demonstration under local law .
initially , authorities and the police had refused to issue a permit for the event , which they had deemed a techno party rather than a demonstration .
in the end , it made little difference .
according to the news agency dpa , police estimated only 200 to 300 attended the event on the grounds where hundreds of thousands reveled only a year ago .
before sunset there were also major differences between this year ’ s mini events and the mass love parade of the past : for one , both events had to end by 7 p.m. , a full two hours before sunset .
the original love parade lost its status as a " political event " in 2001 after holding it for more than a decade .
the move forced motte and his organizers to pony up the costs for clean-up and other expenses related to the event that are normally covered by the city for major political rallies .
in may , the event , which has drawn as many as a million ravers in past years , was cancelled because its organizers couldn ’ t find enough sponsors . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mourning the love parade there 's still a glimmer of hope that the world 's largest techno music party will survive .

dozens of djs , including german stars like westbam and paul van dyk , spun on the floats , filling the kurfürstendamm with an aural haze of electric beats .
the demo on one of berlin ’ s main shopping streets was organized by the local music magazine " partysan . "
copycat event goes ahead a few kilometers away , in the tiergarten park , another event was being held under the name " music day . "
but love parade organizer motte had sought to distance himself from the event , describing its organizers as " freeloaders . "
local authorities also required that the organizers reduce the size of the event , downsizing it from five stages to three .
nor were the organizers able to sell any food or drinks .
they first received their permit at the last minute and were unable to organize catering that met the city ’ s requirements under short notice .
berlin authorities first ruled to issue a permit for " music day " on friday , after organizers demonstrated that the event would have enough speeches to be deemed an actual demonstration under local law .
initially , authorities and the police had refused to issue a permit for the event , which they had deemed a techno party rather than a demonstration .
in the end , it made little difference .
according to the news agency dpa , police estimated only 200 to 300 attended the event on the grounds where hundreds of thousands reveled only a year ago .
before sunset there were also major differences between this year ’ s mini events and the mass love parade of the past : for one , both events had to end by 7 p.m. , a full two hours before sunset .
the original love parade lost its status as a " political event " in 2001 after holding it for more than a decade .
the move forced motte and his organizers to pony up the costs for clean-up and other expenses related to the event that are normally covered by the city for major political rallies .
in may , the event , which has drawn as many as a million ravers in past years , was cancelled because its organizers couldn ’ t find enough sponsors . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mourning the love parade there 's still a glimmer of hope that the world 's largest techno music party will survive .

the cabinet-level officials of the social democratic and greens coalition government met at neuhardenberg palace to discuss the achievements of the first half of the administration and to solidify the political goals needed to win the next election in 2006 .
" we ’ re ready for a fight during the second half of this legislative period , " schröder said .
" and we ’ re going into this with the goal of winning a third . "
schröder said the reforms passed so far by his government are unparalleled in europe , and they are already having an effect .
in recent days , economic forecasts have been positively upgraded and , he said , the coalition government has shown an impressive level of determination to push through the difficult reforms , which are intended to jumpstart the lukewarm economy .
with the " agenda 2010 " package , schröder said , the most comprehensive modernization of germany ’ s social security system ever undertaken has been introduced .
reforms not over until they ’ re implemented " it ’ s important to me that it remains clear to everyone that the reform process hasn ’ t ended yet , " schröder said .
" the reform work can only be seen as successful when it the implementation phase has been successfully completed .
and now our political leadership needs to concentrate on the implementation of these wide-ranging reform agenda with as little conflict as possible . "
at the meeting , cabinet officials intensively discussed the law passed friday that will reorganize the supervision of the country ’ s more than 2 million long-term unemployed starting in january 2005 .
schröder said the government must ramp up its placement programs for people who have fallen out of the workforce .
schröder said that although it wouldn ’ t be possible to place all long-term unemployed people , the country needs better placement programs to bring people back into the workforce and help give them restore some of the dignity they ’ ve lost by having to accept government handouts .
but it ’ s unlikely the federal government will implement new programs itself .
economics and labor minister wolfgang clement said the government would not create any special programs to finance the long-term unemployed .
instead , communities and charity organizations should be helping create and find jobs for the unemployed , partially using money that will have been saved through the reforms , he said .
extra burdens for eastern states german cities and communities , however , have questioned whether the cuts will have any tangible effect on the labor market – especially in the eastern states .
with an unemployment rate of 25 percent in some parts of eastern germany , it will be difficult to find jobs for everyone , critics have lamented , questioning the sense of the reforms .
the chancellor said he is planning to meet with the eastern german state premiers who voted against the legislation that would dramatically reduce social welfare benefits for long-term unemployed in the bundesrat , germany ’ s upper legislative chamber , on friday .
" i don ’ t want to have an ‘ east-west ’ discussion on this issue , " schröder said .
instead , he said he is calling on the eastern german premiers to make the best out of the situation .
better daycare so moms can work schröder also called on local communities to improve daycare programs for children under three in order to make it easier for young women to build a career and family .
family minister renate schmidt is expected to next week introduce draft legislation that would require local communities to provide all-day care , based on need , for children under three years of age .
the plan calls for the creation of 230,000 new care slots for the toddlers in the western german states ; eastern german states would not be included in the bill because they have already reached an acceptable level , schmidt said .
the plan calls for money saved by communities through the merger of unemployment and welfare benefits to be funneled to the daycare programs to the tune of € 1.5 billion .

the cabinet-level officials of the social democratic and greens coalition government met at neuhardenberg palace to discuss the achievements of the first half of the administration and to solidify the political goals needed to win the next election in 2006 .
" we ’ re ready for a fight during the second half of this legislative period , " schröder said .
" and we ’ re going into this with the goal of winning a third . "
schröder said the reforms passed so far by his government are unparalleled in europe , and they are already having an effect .
in recent days , economic forecasts have been positively upgraded and , he said , the coalition government has shown an impressive level of determination to push through the difficult reforms , which are intended to jumpstart the lukewarm economy .
with the " agenda 2010 " package , schröder said , the most comprehensive modernization of germany ’ s social security system ever undertaken has been introduced .
reforms not over until they ’ re implemented " it ’ s important to me that it remains clear to everyone that the reform process hasn ’ t ended yet , " schröder said .
" the reform work can only be seen as successful when it the implementation phase has been successfully completed .
and now our political leadership needs to concentrate on the implementation of these wide-ranging reform agenda with as little conflict as possible . "
at the meeting , cabinet officials intensively discussed the law passed friday that will reorganize the supervision of the country ’ s more than 2 million long-term unemployed starting in january 2005 .
schröder said the government must ramp up its placement programs for people who have fallen out of the workforce .
schröder said that although it wouldn ’ t be possible to place all long-term unemployed people , the country needs better placement programs to bring people back into the workforce and help give them restore some of the dignity they ’ ve lost by having to accept government handouts .
but it ’ s unlikely the federal government will implement new programs itself .
economics and labor minister wolfgang clement said the government would not create any special programs to finance the long-term unemployed .
instead , communities and charity organizations should be helping create and find jobs for the unemployed , partially using money that will have been saved through the reforms , he said .
extra burdens for eastern states german cities and communities , however , have questioned whether the cuts will have any tangible effect on the labor market – especially in the eastern states .
with an unemployment rate of 25 percent in some parts of eastern germany , it will be difficult to find jobs for everyone , critics have lamented , questioning the sense of the reforms .
the chancellor said he is planning to meet with the eastern german state premiers who voted against the legislation that would dramatically reduce social welfare benefits for long-term unemployed in the bundesrat , germany ’ s upper legislative chamber , on friday .
" i don ’ t want to have an ‘ east-west ’ discussion on this issue , " schröder said .
instead , he said he is calling on the eastern german premiers to make the best out of the situation .
better daycare so moms can work schröder also called on local communities to improve daycare programs for children under three in order to make it easier for young women to build a career and family .
family minister renate schmidt is expected to next week introduce draft legislation that would require local communities to provide all-day care , based on need , for children under three years of age .
the plan calls for the creation of 230,000 new care slots for the toddlers in the western german states ; eastern german states would not be included in the bill because they have already reached an acceptable level , schmidt said .
the plan calls for money saved by communities through the merger of unemployment and welfare benefits to be funneled to the daycare programs to the tune of € 1.5 billion .

united states secretary of state colin powell and united nations general secretary kofi annan have already been to khartoum ; now , germany is sending joschka fischer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer the foreign minister wants to ensure that the sudanese government keeps the promises it made to powell and annan - to allow aid agencies better access to refugees in darfur , to disarm the janjaweed militiamen trying to expel african farmers from the region , and to implement security measures for darfur 's civilians . " these are clear agreements that have been made , and that the government in khartoum has committed to , " said german foreign ministry spokesperson jens plötner .
" i do n't think any additional agreements have to be made .
what 's important now is making sure the existing agreements are upheld .
minister fischer and his deputy , kerstin müller , have repeatedly made it clear that enough words have been said .
now , action must follow . " improved access to refugees aid workers have reported that their access to starving refugees in darfur has improved .
to assist their work , fischer is bringing with him 3.5 tons of medicine to treat the refugees . disarmament of the arab militiamen , who , with government backing have killed and raped thousands of darfur 's black african population since rebel groups took up arms last year , is taking longer . according to fischer , the government in khartoum is capable of demilitarizing the rebels immediately " if it only wants to . " " what we 're talking about is a totally normal exertion of state sovereignty , for a nation to fulfil its duty to ensure peace , order , and security for its citizens , " plötner said .
" this duty is also something that the sudanese government is obligated to fulfil . " sanctions could follow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sudanese refugee walks past a dead donkey in a refugee camp if the government in khartoum does n't stick to its commitment to stop the violence , the country faces possible sanctions .
although sudan is warning of creating another iraq-style situation should sanctions be imposed , fischer has already said that he supports the idea of certain sanctions , such as a weapons embargo . a us draft resolution before the un security council includes sanctions against leaders of the arab militia , which could be widened to include members of the government .
the us has proposed escalating sanctions within 30 days if results are not evident , though some countries say that sudan should be allowed more time . nina werkhäuser -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin may send peacekeepers to sudan the german deputy foreign minister has indicated berlin is considering sending peacekeeping troops to war-torn sudan under a u.n. mandate , adding a further dimension to the bundeswehr ’ s deployment in africa .

the cabinet-level officials of the social democratic and greens coalition government met at neuhardenberg palace to discuss the achievements of the first half of the administration and to solidify the political goals needed to win the next election in 2006 .
" we ’ re ready for a fight during the second half of this legislative period , " schröder said .
" and we ’ re going into this with the goal of winning a third . "
schröder said the reforms passed so far by his government are unparalleled in europe , and they are already having an effect .
in recent days , economic forecasts have been positively upgraded and , he said , the coalition government has shown an impressive level of determination to push through the difficult reforms , which are intended to jumpstart the lukewarm economy .
with the " agenda 2010 " package , schröder said , the most comprehensive modernization of germany ’ s social security system ever undertaken has been introduced .
reforms not over until they ’ re implemented " it ’ s important to me that it remains clear to everyone that the reform process hasn ’ t ended yet , " schröder said .
" the reform work can only be seen as successful when it the implementation phase has been successfully completed .
and now our political leadership needs to concentrate on the implementation of these wide-ranging reform agenda with as little conflict as possible . "
at the meeting , cabinet officials intensively discussed the law passed friday that will reorganize the supervision of the country ’ s more than 2 million long-term unemployed starting in january 2005 .
schröder said the government must ramp up its placement programs for people who have fallen out of the workforce .
schröder said that although it wouldn ’ t be possible to place all long-term unemployed people , the country needs better placement programs to bring people back into the workforce and help give them restore some of the dignity they ’ ve lost by having to accept government handouts .
but it ’ s unlikely the federal government will implement new programs itself .
economics and labor minister wolfgang clement said the government would not create any special programs to finance the long-term unemployed .
instead , communities and charity organizations should be helping create and find jobs for the unemployed , partially using money that will have been saved through the reforms , he said .
extra burdens for eastern states german cities and communities , however , have questioned whether the cuts will have any tangible effect on the labor market – especially in the eastern states .
with an unemployment rate of 25 percent in some parts of eastern germany , it will be difficult to find jobs for everyone , critics have lamented , questioning the sense of the reforms .
the chancellor said he is planning to meet with the eastern german state premiers who voted against the legislation that would dramatically reduce social welfare benefits for long-term unemployed in the bundesrat , germany ’ s upper legislative chamber , on friday .
" i don ’ t want to have an ‘ east-west ’ discussion on this issue , " schröder said .
instead , he said he is calling on the eastern german premiers to make the best out of the situation .
better daycare so moms can work schröder also called on local communities to improve daycare programs for children under three in order to make it easier for young women to build a career and family .
family minister renate schmidt is expected to next week introduce draft legislation that would require local communities to provide all-day care , based on need , for children under three years of age .
the plan calls for the creation of 230,000 new care slots for the toddlers in the western german states ; eastern german states would not be included in the bill because they have already reached an acceptable level , schmidt said .
the plan calls for money saved by communities through the merger of unemployment and welfare benefits to be funneled to the daycare programs to the tune of € 1.5 billion .

the cabinet-level officials of the social democratic and greens coalition government met at neuhardenberg palace to discuss the achievements of the first half of the administration and to solidify the political goals needed to win the next election in 2006 .
" we ’ re ready for a fight during the second half of this legislative period , " schröder said .
" and we ’ re going into this with the goal of winning a third . "
schröder said the reforms passed so far by his government are unparalleled in europe , and they are already having an effect .
in recent days , economic forecasts have been positively upgraded and , he said , the coalition government has shown an impressive level of determination to push through the difficult reforms , which are intended to jumpstart the lukewarm economy .
with the " agenda 2010 " package , schröder said , the most comprehensive modernization of germany ’ s social security system ever undertaken has been introduced .
reforms not over until they ’ re implemented " it ’ s important to me that it remains clear to everyone that the reform process hasn ’ t ended yet , " schröder said .
" the reform work can only be seen as successful when it the implementation phase has been successfully completed .
and now our political leadership needs to concentrate on the implementation of these wide-ranging reform agenda with as little conflict as possible . "
at the meeting , cabinet officials intensively discussed the law passed friday that will reorganize the supervision of the country ’ s more than 2 million long-term unemployed starting in january 2005 .
schröder said the government must ramp up its placement programs for people who have fallen out of the workforce .
schröder said that although it wouldn ’ t be possible to place all long-term unemployed people , the country needs better placement programs to bring people back into the workforce and help give them restore some of the dignity they ’ ve lost by having to accept government handouts .
but it ’ s unlikely the federal government will implement new programs itself .
economics and labor minister wolfgang clement said the government would not create any special programs to finance the long-term unemployed .
instead , communities and charity organizations should be helping create and find jobs for the unemployed , partially using money that will have been saved through the reforms , he said .
extra burdens for eastern states german cities and communities , however , have questioned whether the cuts will have any tangible effect on the labor market – especially in the eastern states .
with an unemployment rate of 25 percent in some parts of eastern germany , it will be difficult to find jobs for everyone , critics have lamented , questioning the sense of the reforms .
the chancellor said he is planning to meet with the eastern german state premiers who voted against the legislation that would dramatically reduce social welfare benefits for long-term unemployed in the bundesrat , germany ’ s upper legislative chamber , on friday .
" i don ’ t want to have an ‘ east-west ’ discussion on this issue , " schröder said .
instead , he said he is calling on the eastern german premiers to make the best out of the situation .
better daycare so moms can work schröder also called on local communities to improve daycare programs for children under three in order to make it easier for young women to build a career and family .
family minister renate schmidt is expected to next week introduce draft legislation that would require local communities to provide all-day care , based on need , for children under three years of age .
the plan calls for the creation of 230,000 new care slots for the toddlers in the western german states ; eastern german states would not be included in the bill because they have already reached an acceptable level , schmidt said .
the plan calls for money saved by communities through the merger of unemployment and welfare benefits to be funneled to the daycare programs to the tune of € 1.5 billion .

but after it lost its status as a political demonstration in 2001 and had to pick up part of the tab previously paid by the city , the event 's been in a slow downward spiral .
this year it was abruptly cancelled after organizers failed to find enough sponsors .
on saturday , hundreds turned out at events across the city to mourn the parade 's passing . but it went out with a whimper . hundreds of revelers converged on west berlin ’ s grand kurfürstendamm boulevard for a techno parade that included seven massive floats that made their way from adenauerplatz to the memorial cathedral .
they demostrated under the motto " fight the power – club culture versus ignorance " for the return of the love parade next year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin disc jockey dr. motte led the love parade for 15 years before its demise this year the love parade ’ s founder , dr. motte -lrb- photo -rrb- , had expected as many as 5,000 partyers on saturday .
despite the disappointing turnout , the demonstrators still managed to create an ear-splitting chorus of whistles and music that pulsed at an impressively high number of beats per minute .
dozens of djs , including german stars like westbam and paul van dyk , spun on the floats , filling the kurfürstendamm with an aural haze of electric beats .
the demo on one of berlin ’ s main shopping streets was organized by the local music magazine " partysan . "
copycat event goes ahead a few kilometers away , in the tiergarten park , another event was being held under the name " music day . "
but love parade organizer motte had sought to distance himself from the event , describing its organizers as " freeloaders . "
local authorities also required that the organizers reduce the size of the event , downsizing it from five stages to three .
nor were the organizers able to sell any food or drinks .
they first received their permit at the last minute and were unable to organize catering that met the city ’ s requirements under short notice .
berlin authorities first ruled to issue a permit for " music day " on friday , after organizers demonstrated that the event would have enough speeches to be deemed an actual demonstration under local law .
initially , authorities and the police had refused to issue a permit for the event , which they had deemed a techno party rather than a demonstration .
in the end , it made little difference .
according to the news agency dpa , police estimated only 200 to 300 attended the event on the grounds where hundreds of thousands reveled only a year ago .
before sunset there were also major differences between this year ’ s mini events and the mass love parade of the past : for one , both events had to end by 7 p.m. , a full two hours before sunset .
the original love parade lost its status as a " political event " in 2001 after holding it for more than a decade .
the move forced motte and his organizers to pony up the costs for clean-up and other expenses related to the event that are normally covered by the city for major political rallies .

but after it lost its status as a political demonstration in 2001 and had to pick up part of the tab previously paid by the city , the event 's been in a slow downward spiral .
this year it was abruptly cancelled after organizers failed to find enough sponsors .
on saturday , hundreds turned out at events across the city to mourn the parade 's passing . but it went out with a whimper . hundreds of revelers converged on west berlin ’ s grand kurfürstendamm boulevard for a techno parade that included seven massive floats that made their way from adenauerplatz to the memorial cathedral .
they demostrated under the motto " fight the power – club culture versus ignorance " for the return of the love parade next year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin disc jockey dr. motte led the love parade for 15 years before its demise this year the love parade ’ s founder , dr. motte -lrb- photo -rrb- , had expected as many as 5,000 partyers on saturday .
despite the disappointing turnout , the demonstrators still managed to create an ear-splitting chorus of whistles and music that pulsed at an impressively high number of beats per minute .
dozens of djs , including german stars like westbam and paul van dyk , spun on the floats , filling the kurfürstendamm with an aural haze of electric beats .
the demo on one of berlin ’ s main shopping streets was organized by the local music magazine " partysan . "
copycat event goes ahead a few kilometers away , in the tiergarten park , another event was being held under the name " music day . "
but love parade organizer motte had sought to distance himself from the event , describing its organizers as " freeloaders . "
local authorities also required that the organizers reduce the size of the event , downsizing it from five stages to three .
nor were the organizers able to sell any food or drinks .
they first received their permit at the last minute and were unable to organize catering that met the city ’ s requirements under short notice .
berlin authorities first ruled to issue a permit for " music day " on friday , after organizers demonstrated that the event would have enough speeches to be deemed an actual demonstration under local law .
initially , authorities and the police had refused to issue a permit for the event , which they had deemed a techno party rather than a demonstration .
in the end , it made little difference .
according to the news agency dpa , police estimated only 200 to 300 attended the event on the grounds where hundreds of thousands reveled only a year ago .
before sunset there were also major differences between this year ’ s mini events and the mass love parade of the past : for one , both events had to end by 7 p.m. , a full two hours before sunset .
the original love parade lost its status as a " political event " in 2001 after holding it for more than a decade .
the move forced motte and his organizers to pony up the costs for clean-up and other expenses related to the event that are normally covered by the city for major political rallies .
in may , the event , which has drawn as many as a million ravers in past years , was cancelled because its organizers couldn ’ t find enough sponsors . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mourning the love parade there 's still a glimmer of hope that the world 's largest techno music party will survive .

at the center of the discussions , which are being held in neuhardenberg palace in the state of brandenburg , are education , innovation and family policy .
the cabinet also plans to discuss labor market reforms and efforts to promote growth in eastern germany , where the economy is stagnant and the unemployment rate explosive .
at the opening of the retreat on friday , schröder called on his cabinet to stick to its current reform plans .
" our course is important , " he said , " and we have to succeed . "
otherwise , he warned , most would give up on any chance of turning germany ’ s lame economy around .
schröder ’ s " agenda 2010 " program has faced a major challenge from the leftist faction of his social democratic party .
last week they formed a split-off group , " election alternative : jobs and social justice , " and have threatened to create their own political party .
the leftist faction is seeking to block the current reforms , and schröder is also being challenged by the opposition conservatives .
the main argument among critics is that the government must assure them and german voters that it has a comprehensive reform plan that will actually deliver the final changes needed to repair the country ’ s failing labor market , lukewarm economy and a social system sagging under the weight of shrinking tax revenues and an aging population .
paving the way for implementation despite the open discussion , there are no plans to make changes to the government ’ s current reform plans at the meeting .
according to the parliamentary group leader of the greens , krista sager , the meeting is instead intended to produce " accompanying measures " for recently initiated reforms .
the party leaders are also expected to discuss government ’ s main legislative policies for the second half of the administration , which runs through 2006 .
plans for the better promotion and integration of long-term unemployed germans after the introduction of a law next year that will merge the countries unemployment and welfare benefits for the long-term unemployed are also on the table .
under the new plan , unemployed will be required to take most jobs offered to them with the risk of benefit cuts if they refuse to accept work .
on saturday , economics and labor minister wolfgang clement called on both business , communities and government to create new jobs in order to help bring the long-term unemployed back into the workforce .
better toddler daycare family minister renate schmidt is expected to introduce draft legislation that would require local communities to provide all-day care , based on need , for children under three years of age .
the plan calls for the creation of 230,000 new care slots for the toddlers in the western german states ; eastern german states would not be included in the bill because they have already reached an acceptable level , schmidt said .
the plan calls for money saved by communities through the merger of unemployment and welfare benefits to be funneled to the daycare programs to the tune of € 1.5 billion . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cabinet huddles to map future direction german chancellor gerhard schröder has called together his cabinet for a two-day balance-taking session , just as a key survey reveals the popularity of his social democratic party has sunk to a record new low .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus on women wage gap between the sexes widens in germany work-life balance gets boost in germany " glass ceiling " lawsuit takes aim at german bank eu takes slow road to gender equity business -pipe- 10.07.2004 for german women , glass ceiling hangs low großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karin dorrepaal is the first woman to serve on a major german board pharmaceutical giant schering announced this week it would appoint karin dorrepaal to its executive board – a sad first for germany .
no other industrial nation has as few female top managers as germany . german boardrooms still remain a men ’ s club .
but come sept .
2005 , things may start to change .
karin dorrepaal , a native of the netherlands , is then set to become the only woman to join the executive board of one of the 30 blue chip companies listed on the german stock index .
she ’ s got two degrees in psychology and obtained a doctorate of medicine for her cancer research .
to top it all off , she ’ s also the holder of an mba .
until 1990 dorrepaal worked at the dutch cancer research center ; after that she moved to the amsterdam offices of the business consultancy booz allen hamilton .
in 2000 , she became the company ’ s vice president , taking responsibility for the consultancy ’ s work with pharmaceutical companies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schering headquarters in berlin she ’ s had an impressive career – one that also persuaded schering executives she was the right candidate .
nonetheless , dorrepaal is still relatively unknown within the company . schering first worked with 43-year-old dorrepaal during a restructuring of its operations and marketing divisions .
" dr. dorrepaal 's deep understanding of the pharmaceutical industry together with her experience in the strategic repositioning of top tier companies and in optimizing their performance will further strengthen schering 's management team , " hubertus erlen , chairman of schering ’ s executive board said in a statement .
women moving to the top schering ’ s appointment of dorrepaal is one of several signs in recent weeks that the business climate is changing for women in germany .
recently , economist beatrice weder di mauro got appointed to germany ’ s prestigious council of economic advisors , a panel of top-ranking economists that guides the federal government on economic decision-making .
it was the fist time in the " panel of wisemen 's " 41-year history that it had brought a woman into its ranks .
on top of all that , the german association of young entrepreneurs -lrb- bju -rrb- recently appointed 38-year-old businesswoman karoline beck as its president .
over at citibank , the subsidiary of the world ’ s largest financial services company , citigroup , american sue hartnett recently took over the helm of the company ’ s german operations after her predecessor , christine licci , unexpectedly resigned in may .
and it doesn ’ t stop there : economics professor lucrezia reichlin is considered by many to be the top candidate to lead the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- .
yet despite these advances , management circles in german business are still a man ’ s world .
a meager 11 percent of german companies have a woman in management positions , compared to an eu average of 14 percent .
with 40 percent , the united states and canada are way , way ahead .
germany ’ s scarlet letter for working moms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since world war ii , german women have been told that raising a family is the job they were meant to take .
barbara schaeffer-hegel , founder of the european academy for women in politics and business -lrb- eaf -rrb- in berlin , attributes the shortfall to german cultural traditions .
" the mother ideology of the third reich and the conservative women ’ s ’ politics in the postwar time have left deep marks , " she explains .
" the division of the areas of public and private were cemented with the exclusive responsibility of women for the private areas -lrb- of life -rrb- – caring for children and ensuring the welfare of the family . "
in addition to the mentality , there ’ s also an institutional problem , the former professor of pedagogy said .
the daycare infrastructure in germany is underdeveloped , as is the preschool system .
and companies are often reluctant to trust women with important projects because they could get pregnant at any time .
in other words , latent discrimination is perpetuate throughout the business culture here .
" it ’ s a lot harder to reconcile having a family and a career in germany than it is in most developing countries and almost all industrial nations , " she says .
there ’ s still an enormous paradox here : most of the women recently making headlines for making it to the inner circle of managers have been imported from abroad .
karin dorrepaal is dutch , lucrezia reichlin is italian and beatrice weder di mauro has dual swiss and italian citizenship .
but that comes as little surprise to schaeffer-hegel .
" the word ‘ rabenmütter ’ -lrb- a term loosely translated as ‘ bad mom with latchkey kids ’ -rrb- only exists in germany , " she says .
" in other european countries and in america , women achieve huge things a still manage to have kids .
nor do they feel like bad mothers for doing so .
there the infrastructure is better and the prejudices against the women aren ’ t as big of a strain as they are here .

at the center of the discussions , which are being held in neuhardenberg palace in the state of brandenburg , are education , innovation and family policy .
the cabinet also plans to discuss labor market reforms and efforts to promote growth in eastern germany , where the economy is stagnant and the unemployment rate explosive .
at the opening of the retreat on friday , schröder called on his cabinet to stick to its current reform plans .
" our course is important , " he said , " and we have to succeed . "
otherwise , he warned , most would give up on any chance of turning germany ’ s lame economy around .
schröder ’ s " agenda 2010 " program has faced a major challenge from the leftist faction of his social democratic party .
last week they formed a split-off group , " election alternative : jobs and social justice , " and have threatened to create their own political party .
the leftist faction is seeking to block the current reforms , and schröder is also being challenged by the opposition conservatives .
the main argument among critics is that the government must assure them and german voters that it has a comprehensive reform plan that will actually deliver the final changes needed to repair the country ’ s failing labor market , lukewarm economy and a social system sagging under the weight of shrinking tax revenues and an aging population .
paving the way for implementation despite the open discussion , there are no plans to make changes to the government ’ s current reform plans at the meeting .
according to the parliamentary group leader of the greens , krista sager , the meeting is instead intended to produce " accompanying measures " for recently initiated reforms .
the party leaders are also expected to discuss government ’ s main legislative policies for the second half of the administration , which runs through 2006 .
plans for the better promotion and integration of long-term unemployed germans after the introduction of a law next year that will merge the countries unemployment and welfare benefits for the long-term unemployed are also on the table .
under the new plan , unemployed will be required to take most jobs offered to them with the risk of benefit cuts if they refuse to accept work .
on saturday , economics and labor minister wolfgang clement called on both business , communities and government to create new jobs in order to help bring the long-term unemployed back into the workforce .
better toddler daycare family minister renate schmidt is expected to introduce draft legislation that would require local communities to provide all-day care , based on need , for children under three years of age .
the plan calls for the creation of 230,000 new care slots for the toddlers in the western german states ; eastern german states would not be included in the bill because they have already reached an acceptable level , schmidt said .
the plan calls for money saved by communities through the merger of unemployment and welfare benefits to be funneled to the daycare programs to the tune of € 1.5 billion . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cabinet huddles to map future direction german chancellor gerhard schröder has called together his cabinet for a two-day balance-taking session , just as a key survey reveals the popularity of his social democratic party has sunk to a record new low .

united states secretary of state colin powell and united nations general secretary kofi annan have already been to khartoum ; now , germany is sending joschka fischer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer the foreign minister wants to ensure that the sudanese government keeps the promises it made to powell and annan - to allow aid agencies better access to refugees in darfur , to disarm the janjaweed militiamen trying to expel african farmers from the region , and to implement security measures for darfur 's civilians . " these are clear agreements that have been made , and that the government in khartoum has committed to , " said german foreign ministry spokesperson jens plötner .
" i do n't think any additional agreements have to be made .
what 's important now is making sure the existing agreements are upheld .
minister fischer and his deputy , kerstin müller , have repeatedly made it clear that enough words have been said .
now , action must follow . " improved access to refugees aid workers have reported that their access to starving refugees in darfur has improved .
to assist their work , fischer is bringing with him 3.5 tons of medicine to treat the refugees . disarmament of the arab militiamen , who , with government backing have killed and raped thousands of darfur 's black african population since rebel groups took up arms last year , is taking longer . according to fischer , the government in khartoum is capable of demilitarizing the rebels immediately " if it only wants to . " " what we 're talking about is a totally normal exertion of state sovereignty , for a nation to fulfil its duty to ensure peace , order , and security for its citizens , " plötner said .
" this duty is also something that the sudanese government is obligated to fulfil . " sanctions could follow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sudanese refugee walks past a dead donkey in a refugee camp if the government in khartoum does n't stick to its commitment to stop the violence , the country faces possible sanctions .
although sudan is warning of creating another iraq-style situation should sanctions be imposed , fischer has already said that he supports the idea of certain sanctions , such as a weapons embargo . a us draft resolution before the un security council includes sanctions against leaders of the arab militia , which could be widened to include members of the government .
the us has proposed escalating sanctions within 30 days if results are not evident , though some countries say that sudan should be allowed more time . nina werkhäuser -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin may send peacekeepers to sudan the german deputy foreign minister has indicated berlin is considering sending peacekeeping troops to war-torn sudan under a u.n. mandate , adding a further dimension to the bundeswehr ’ s deployment in africa .

united states secretary of state colin powell and united nations general secretary kofi annan have already been to khartoum ; now , germany is sending joschka fischer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer the foreign minister wants to ensure that the sudanese government keeps the promises it made to powell and annan - to allow aid agencies better access to refugees in darfur , to disarm the janjaweed militiamen trying to expel african farmers from the region , and to implement security measures for darfur 's civilians . " these are clear agreements that have been made , and that the government in khartoum has committed to , " said german foreign ministry spokesperson jens plötner .
" i do n't think any additional agreements have to be made .
what 's important now is making sure the existing agreements are upheld .
minister fischer and his deputy , kerstin müller , have repeatedly made it clear that enough words have been said .
now , action must follow . " improved access to refugees aid workers have reported that their access to starving refugees in darfur has improved .
to assist their work , fischer is bringing with him 3.5 tons of medicine to treat the refugees . disarmament of the arab militiamen , who , with government backing have killed and raped thousands of darfur 's black african population since rebel groups took up arms last year , is taking longer . according to fischer , the government in khartoum is capable of demilitarizing the rebels immediately " if it only wants to . " " what we 're talking about is a totally normal exertion of state sovereignty , for a nation to fulfil its duty to ensure peace , order , and security for its citizens , " plötner said .
" this duty is also something that the sudanese government is obligated to fulfil . " sanctions could follow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sudanese refugee walks past a dead donkey in a refugee camp if the government in khartoum does n't stick to its commitment to stop the violence , the country faces possible sanctions .
although sudan is warning of creating another iraq-style situation should sanctions be imposed , fischer has already said that he supports the idea of certain sanctions , such as a weapons embargo . a us draft resolution before the un security council includes sanctions against leaders of the arab militia , which could be widened to include members of the government .
the us has proposed escalating sanctions within 30 days if results are not evident , though some countries say that sudan should be allowed more time . nina werkhäuser -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin may send peacekeepers to sudan the german deputy foreign minister has indicated berlin is considering sending peacekeeping troops to war-torn sudan under a u.n. mandate , adding a further dimension to the bundeswehr ’ s deployment in africa .

by ray dunne bbc news online health staff it is one of the biggest changes in the history of the nhs - gps no longer have to provide care to patients in the evenings and at weekends .
bbc news online examines how the changes will affect patients .
nurses are playing a much bigger role david russell has been a gp for almost 20 years .
for most of his career , he has had to be available 24 hours a day for patients .
" it was quite stressful , " he says .
" you sometimes worried if you were called out in the middle of the night and then had to do a full day 's work the next day . "
that all changed on 1 april .
the introduction of the new nhs contract for gps meant dr russell could , for the first time , opt-out of providing out-of-hours care .
" it has been a breath of fresh air , " says the darlington gp .
" it means i no longer have to do evenings and weekends .
it has made a massive difference . "
under the terms of the new contract , responsibility for providing out-of-hours medical care passes from gps to nhs primary care organisations .
the change is being phased in over the course of this year , although some parts of the country are moving faster than others .
some hiccups by and large , everything appears to be going reasonably well , although there have been one or two hiccups .
health chiefs in norfolk revealed this week that they are relying on doctors from germany flying in to provide emergency cover at weekends because local gps do n't want to do the work .
i no longer have to do evenings and weekends dr david russell this is despite the promise of £ 80 per hour and the chance to earn up to £ 2,400 over the course of the weekend .
the fact is few british gps now want to work out-of-hours .
a survey of 3,000 doctors , published in december , suggested as many as 80 % intend to opt-out .
figures like these have forced health chiefs across the country to come up with a new way of delivering care to patients when local gp surgeries close .
the government has given the nhs in england £ 100m to come up with a workable alternative .
health chiefs in darlington have signed up a private company called primecare to run its out-of-hours service .
faced with a shortage of gps , the company has decided to employ a new breed of health worker called emergency care practitioners .
" most ecps are either paramedics or nurses by background , " says dr mike sadler , primecare 's medical director .
" but they receive additional training to qualify them to deal with the urgent care needs of individuals . "
these ecps could become the backbone of nhs out-of-hours in the years ahead .
" i think nurses and paramedics can become integral to the out-of-hours team , just as nurses have become integral to the in-hours team , " says dr mark reynolds , chairman of the national association of gp co-operatives .
" no self-respecting practice goes without a nurse during the day .
the same will happen for out-of-hours . "
wide support the new arrangements certainly appear to have the support of paramedics and nurses .
" we think it 's a very good thing , " says roland furber , chief executive of the british paramedic association .
patients will have much faster access to medical help and advice spokeswoman , royal college of nursing " doctors are not going to be available out-of-hours like they have been .
it seems logical to use paramedics and nurses . "
the royal college of nursing agrees and says the changes will benefit patients .
" patients will have much faster access to medical help and advice , " says a spokeswoman .
" they wo n't have to wait to see a gp .
they will be able to see a nurse instead . "
but do patients want to see a nurse or paramedic instead of gp ?
" it was something that concerned us , " says dr russell , who now sits on a committee overseeing the out-of-hours changes in darlington .
" but we have had really positive feedback from patients .
it has certainly exceeded my expectations . "
perhaps patients are starting to get used to the fact that they wo n't always see a gp .
nurses are now the first port of call for patients in many parts of the nhs .
they are running walk-in centres and specialist clinics and are the voices behind the telephone helpline nhs direct .
" they conduct millions of consultations each year , " says mark reynolds .
" patients like them . "
there is evidence to suggest that in some cases nurses and other healthcare workers may actually be better than doctors .
" we know that nurses and other health professionals do rather better than doctors when it comes to certain things , " says dr sadler .
" they are better at reviewing medication or offering healthcare advice .
they are also more cost-effective . "
but the changes do not mean that gps will now disappear in the evenings and weekends .
while there will be fewer of them around , they will be on hand should patients need them .
" this is not about not having doctors anymore , " says dr sadler .
" it 's about using doctors for what they do best and using other health professionals for what they do best .
" it 's about not relying on a single doctor 24 hours a day .
i think patients will value that . "

the introduction of the new nhs contract for gps meant dr russell could , for the first time , opt-out of providing out-of-hours care .
" it has been a breath of fresh air , " says the darlington gp .
" it means i no longer have to do evenings and weekends .
it has made a massive difference . "
under the terms of the new contract , responsibility for providing out-of-hours medical care passes from gps to nhs primary care organisations .
the change is being phased in over the course of this year , although some parts of the country are moving faster than others .
some hiccups by and large , everything appears to be going reasonably well , although there have been one or two hiccups .
health chiefs in norfolk revealed this week that they are relying on doctors from germany flying in to provide emergency cover at weekends because local gps do n't want to do the work .
i no longer have to do evenings and weekends dr david russell this is despite the promise of £ 80 per hour and the chance to earn up to £ 2,400 over the course of the weekend .
the fact is few british gps now want to work out-of-hours .
a survey of 3,000 doctors , published in december , suggested as many as 80 % intend to opt-out .
figures like these have forced health chiefs across the country to come up with a new way of delivering care to patients when local gp surgeries close .
the government has given the nhs in england £ 100m to come up with a workable alternative .
health chiefs in darlington have signed up a private company called primecare to run its out-of-hours service .
faced with a shortage of gps , the company has decided to employ a new breed of health worker called emergency care practitioners .
" most ecps are either paramedics or nurses by background , " says dr mike sadler , primecare 's medical director .
" but they receive additional training to qualify them to deal with the urgent care needs of individuals . "
these ecps could become the backbone of nhs out-of-hours in the years ahead .
" i think nurses and paramedics can become integral to the out-of-hours team , just as nurses have become integral to the in-hours team , " says dr mark reynolds , chairman of the national association of gp co-operatives .
" no self-respecting practice goes without a nurse during the day .
the same will happen for out-of-hours . "
wide support the new arrangements certainly appear to have the support of paramedics and nurses .
" we think it 's a very good thing , " says roland furber , chief executive of the british paramedic association .
patients will have much faster access to medical help and advice spokeswoman , royal college of nursing " doctors are not going to be available out-of-hours like they have been .
it seems logical to use paramedics and nurses . "
the royal college of nursing agrees and says the changes will benefit patients .
" patients will have much faster access to medical help and advice , " says a spokeswoman .
" they wo n't have to wait to see a gp .
they will be able to see a nurse instead . "
but do patients want to see a nurse or paramedic instead of gp ?
" it was something that concerned us , " says dr russell , who now sits on a committee overseeing the out-of-hours changes in darlington .
" but we have had really positive feedback from patients .
it has certainly exceeded my expectations . "
perhaps patients are starting to get used to the fact that they wo n't always see a gp .
nurses are now the first port of call for patients in many parts of the nhs .
they are running walk-in centres and specialist clinics and are the voices behind the telephone helpline nhs direct .
" they conduct millions of consultations each year , " says mark reynolds .
" patients like them . "
there is evidence to suggest that in some cases nurses and other healthcare workers may actually be better than doctors .
" we know that nurses and other health professionals do rather better than doctors when it comes to certain things , " says dr sadler .
" they are better at reviewing medication or offering healthcare advice .
they are also more cost-effective . "
but the changes do not mean that gps will now disappear in the evenings and weekends .
while there will be fewer of them around , they will be on hand should patients need them .
" this is not about not having doctors anymore , " says dr sadler .
" it 's about using doctors for what they do best and using other health professionals for what they do best .
" it 's about not relying on a single doctor 24 hours a day .
i think patients will value that . "
