as a nominee for the booker prize she is among the growing number of authors who are developing a so-called " euro-arab literature . " the egyptian author ahdaf soueif is one of a number of arab authors who emigrated to western europe in the second half of the 20th century and who , from their adopted homes , attempt to describe their encounters with cultural otherness .
they base their narratives in their foreign homes as well as in their countries of origin and , through the themes , content and literary style of their work , they present their characters ' unique experiences in both locations and in the " space in between . "
literature as a beacon for social integration this immigrant literature trend can for instance be observed in germany .
here , arab authors write stories which illustrate the conflict between their own cultural identity and that of the new country and which deal with the inner struggle between the old and the new cultural identities using new literary forms that stem from arab tradition .
in the context of today 's globalized literature , these authors are making an important contribution to the process of observing and comparing cultural differences : they see it as an opportunity to develop an intercultural " euro-arab literature " which can help make a dialogue between the cultures easier and assist in the integration of immigrants into the societies that receive them .
intellectual muslim background bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahdaf soueif ´ s place of birth : cairo ahdaf soueif was born in cairo in 1950 , the daughter of an intellectual muslim family .
she studied english literature at egyptian and british universities and served for two years as an instructor at a saudi arabian university .
since 1981 , she has been dividing her time between london and cairo .
soueif 's literary career began in 1983 , when she published her collection of short stories , aischa .
this was followed by the novel in the eye of the sun -lrb- 1992 -rrb- , the short story collection sandpiper -lrb- 1996 -rrb- and her second novel the map of love .
she translated some of her literary works into arabic and in 1996 , she was awarded the cairo book fair award for the best short stories of the year for her collection zimat al-hayat wa qisas ukhra , sandpiper , or literally , the beauty of life and other stories .
egyptian booker prize nominee in 1999 , her novel the map of love was nominated for the acclaimed booker prize .
numerous magazines and newspapers – including the times literary supplement , cosmopolitan , the london review of books and al-ahram weekly – regularly review her work and publish her critical treatises .
soueif 's literary works focus on the portrayal of arab-muslim society and its striving for modernization in a globalized world .
she formulates this objective in the context of a specific understanding of culture , cultural identity and intercultural relationships .
culture as a dynamic concept for her , culture is a dynamic concept which embraces all of a society 's activities in their historical context and thus lends its identity a form which is distinct , yet still able to communicate and learn .
soueif incorporates this understanding into her work by portraying her characters ' experiences both in the various stages of egyptian society 's historical development as well as during their stays in great britain .
in her novel the map of love , soueif describes the political , socio-economic and cultural conditions that dominated egyptian society at the beginning of the 20th century and follows their development through the changing viewpoints , experiences and feelings of the character anna , an englishwoman living in egypt .
through this learning process , we observe the way that anna on the one hand and her egyptian neighbors on the other maintain their respective cultural identities and , at the same time , enter into a conflict-ridden , yet fruitful dialogue .
writing about modern egyptian women soueif uses time and space , fiction and reality in the context of history and politics to paint this picture in different epochs and in different places .
she is helped here by well-founded information and research which challenge the oversimplified , stereotyped portrayal of egyptian women in english literature .
soueif pointed to the positive reception of this process among her readers .
" i think it has already changed misconceptions among my readers judging by the letters i get , " she told qantara.de.
" i do like to play with these preconceptions and twirl them round a bit ; like standing the western concept of the ' harem ' on its head as i do in the map of love by representing the domestic life of a harem . "
the special quality of soueif 's writing style lies in its artistic construction , which is based on a fusion of arab and english settings , characters and manners of speaking , lending a unique aesthetic character to her works .
cultural characteristics of egyptian people – such as arab names , expressions , metaphors , greetings and forms of address – flow seamlessly into her english-language dialogues .
" english is an extremely hospitable language " literary critic polly pattolo wrote that soueif 's literary style consisted of thinking out her dialogues in arabic and writing them in english .
soueif pointed to the literary advantages that this style provides for the english-speaking reader .
" i think this is the base , really , of the sometimes ' different ' english i write , " she said .
" that i need to fashion an english that will express an arab reality . "
in germany , too , both german and arab writers have intensified their efforts to support an intercultural dialogue in recent years .
examples of this trend can be seen in the works of the arab immigrants jusuf naoum , suleman taufiq and rafik schami .
with the intensive support of german , british and arab authors , these literary products could be developed into a euro-arabic literature .
this literary genre could provide a forum for encouraging dialogue between the cultures and accelerating integration into the societies of immigration . yafa shanneik , © qantara.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de frankfurt book fair opens gerhard schröder and the secretary general of the arab league , amre mussa , will open the frankfurt book fair on tuesday .

the rest , the office said , had short-term work contract and residency permits ranging from one to three months . according to the authorities , indian nationals form the largest group among the green card holders , amounting to a fourth of the 17,177 experts .
they are followed by it specialists from romania , russia , poland and china .
the green card program concludes this year . german chancellor gerhard schröder unveiled the initiative in march 2000 at the computer fair cebit in hanover .
the aim was to fill the gap in the german high-tech sector caused by an acute lack of qualified it specialists in the country .
at the time the computer industry was booming and experts estimated around 200,000 qualified personnel would be needed to keep it going . weak demand the first green card was awarded in summer 2000 and the german government was hoping to hand out 20,000 in four years . in the first three years of the program , an estimated 15,000 it-specialists took germany up on its offer .
but the euphoria soon passed .
the technology sector fell on hard times , and that also affected the green card holders .
in a wave of bankruptcies and layoffs , many lost their jobs . the program has also suffered from weak demand , which experts have partly blamed on germany 's sluggish economy , limitations of the green card program , bureaucracy and a divisive debate over the need for a new immigration law . five years maximum in april this year , indonesian-born harianto wijaya who gained fame as germany 's first green card holder , rattled the government when he said he was leaving . though wijaya had a job at a successful software firm , his original green card , which was limited to five years and five years only , had expired .
that meant wijaya , despite his contributions to the germany economy , had to pack his bags . wijaya , who also finished his ph.d. while living in germany , told deutsche welle he wo n't be able to apply the added expertise to the benefit of a germany company . " all you get is five years , " he said with resignation .

cultural ties are thriving and exchange , particularly in scientific and technological fields , has seen a robust increase . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian prime minister manmohan singh , left , talks to german foreign minister joschka fischer at the start of their official talks in new delhi , india , wednesday , july 14 , 2004 .
the two countries have also cooperated closely in past months in pushing for united nations reform and supporting each other 's claims to permanent seats in an expanded security council .
german foreign minister joschka fischer visited delhi in july this year . fear of the communists but , a shock change in india 's political leadership in may this year - when the congress party ended the six-year rule of the hindu nationalist bharatiya janata party -lrb- bjp -rrb- to take power - prompted worries in germany about delhi 's future economic course . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian stockbrokers trade in bombay .
a jittery indian stock market recorded its biggest fall in four years tuesday , amid fears that a hung parliament predicted by pollsters could slow or even halt economic liberalization .
the congress-led coalition headed by prime minister manmohan singh is dependent on the " outside support " of a " left front " dominated by the communist party of india -lrb- marxist -rrb- , causing foreign investors to fear that the new government could be hostile to business and reluctant to continue or accelerate the economic liberalization process begun in the early 1990s . " of course , we were jittery initially when the congress came to power , " eckart von unger , india expert for the federation of german industries -lrb- fdi -rrb- told dw-world .
" the german economy is reliant on exports and thus india 's liberalization process is of crucial importance to us . " unexpected opportunities but those fears have since been largely assuaged . " the new government will largely continue with the economic policies of the former one , so there will be no significant shift in the investment climate , " anuradha chenoy , expert on international relations at delhi 's jawaharlal nehru university , told dw-world .
" the communists realize the need for foreign investment , especially in infrastructure .
they 've indicated that they 're only concerned about how far key sectors like oil and telecom can be opened up .
it 's just a matter of numbers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manmohan singh , left , speaks about sonia gandhi , right , as they announce that he has been named prime minister of india after meeting with the country 's president in new delhi wednesday may 19 , 2004 .
von unger said that manmohan singh , considered the architect of the reform program as finance minister of the then congress government in 1991 , had created unexpected further opportunities for germany . " we 're optimistic that the singh government 's focus , especially on expanding infrastructure in rural india , offers huge chances for german firms , " he said . " lots of room for more " the time may indeed be ripe now , but there 's no denying that german companies have n't exactly seized the chance in recent years to cash in on india 's growing status as a " booming economy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mumbai 's most famous landmark , the gateway of india set against the figures associated with being the world 's second-most populous country and one of the fastest-growing markets - growth rates of 6 to 8 percent a year , a burgeoning 300-million-strong middle class and an estimated 40 million potential consumers for high-quality goods - bilateral trade at around € 5 billion -lrb- $ 6.14 billion -rrb- last year seems a mere trickle . the statistics are just as lean when it comes to german direct investments in india .
investments have been continually falling since 1997 , and reached a record low last year at € 37 million , down from € 51.7 million in 2002 . bernhard steinrücke , executive director of the indo-german chamber of commerce in mumbai , the largest bilateral trade promotion organization in india and the largest german foreign chamber abroad , however pointed out that well-established companies like siemens , krupp and bayer had been in india since the 19th century . " there are also some success stories of medium-sized german companies in india , who have reinvested in the country , " steinrücke told dw-world .
" but , there 's no denying that there 's still lots of room for more . "
steinrücke added that schröder 's visit was more than just symbolic .
" he 's the first european head of state to visit the country .
it underlines the importance that germany attaches to india . " " bad infrastructure and bureaucracy " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a wipro employee works on specialized softwares to provide services to overseas clients at the company in bangalore , india .
experts say that apart from india 's growing reputation as an " outsourcing mecca " and its enviable skills in the it services sector , which have n't escaped the notice of german companies like siemens , sap and bertelsmann , the country still suffers from huge problems which deter investors . " the infrastructure is appalling and bureaucracy a major hurdle , " von unger said .
" the awarding of licenses takes so long that many smaller businesses simply ca n't afford the complicated legal process .
you need a lot of patience . " other trade barriers include corruption , insufficient protection of intellectual property , stiflingly high state influence in industrial sectors and high import levies . others draw obvious parallels to the massive success story next door in china , where german firms exported goods worth a whopping € 18 billion last year . " india 's reform process began some 13 years after china , " christian wagner of the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin told dw-world .
" china simply has a better image .
india is often considered chaotic and unruly .
and , ironically , because it 's a democracy and has a free press , it all gets reported about in the media . " made in germany still works however , despite sluggish german investments and trade volume , there seems to be agreement on both sides that something needs to give . on the upside , experts point that india has a wealth on offer : low labor costs , highly-qualified personnel and the widespread use of english . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder in india during a visit in oct .
2001 chancellor schröder , who last year admitted that " economic ties with india leave much to be desired , " will be accompanied by a 22-member strong economic delegation on wednesday with representatives from lufthansa , allianz , man and fraport .
according to government sources , signings of major contracts are not on the agenda : the visit will be rather aimed at getting to know the new government . a high-ranking science delegation led by german minister for education and research , edelgard buhlman , will also be present . for his part , the enigmatic manmohan singh told news magazine spiegel this week that he was interested in deepening trade ties with germany . " i grew up in a small village in india where top quality was exclusively associated with germany , " he said , giving an indication of the importance he attaches to india 's second largest trading partner within the eu . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de different worlds , same goal german efforts to gain support for a permanent seat at a reformed un security council found resonance on wednesday when foreign minister fischer visited india , south asia 's giant aspirant to a similar place .

as a nominee for the booker prize she is among the growing number of authors who are developing a so-called " euro-arab literature . " the egyptian author ahdaf soueif is one of a number of arab authors who emigrated to western europe in the second half of the 20th century and who , from their adopted homes , attempt to describe their encounters with cultural otherness .
they base their narratives in their foreign homes as well as in their countries of origin and , through the themes , content and literary style of their work , they present their characters ' unique experiences in both locations and in the " space in between . "
literature as a beacon for social integration this immigrant literature trend can for instance be observed in germany .
here , arab authors write stories which illustrate the conflict between their own cultural identity and that of the new country and which deal with the inner struggle between the old and the new cultural identities using new literary forms that stem from arab tradition .
in the context of today 's globalized literature , these authors are making an important contribution to the process of observing and comparing cultural differences : they see it as an opportunity to develop an intercultural " euro-arab literature " which can help make a dialogue between the cultures easier and assist in the integration of immigrants into the societies that receive them .
intellectual muslim background bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahdaf soueif ´ s place of birth : cairo ahdaf soueif was born in cairo in 1950 , the daughter of an intellectual muslim family .
she studied english literature at egyptian and british universities and served for two years as an instructor at a saudi arabian university .
since 1981 , she has been dividing her time between london and cairo .
soueif 's literary career began in 1983 , when she published her collection of short stories , aischa .
this was followed by the novel in the eye of the sun -lrb- 1992 -rrb- , the short story collection sandpiper -lrb- 1996 -rrb- and her second novel the map of love .
she translated some of her literary works into arabic and in 1996 , she was awarded the cairo book fair award for the best short stories of the year for her collection zimat al-hayat wa qisas ukhra , sandpiper , or literally , the beauty of life and other stories .
egyptian booker prize nominee in 1999 , her novel the map of love was nominated for the acclaimed booker prize .
numerous magazines and newspapers – including the times literary supplement , cosmopolitan , the london review of books and al-ahram weekly – regularly review her work and publish her critical treatises .
soueif 's literary works focus on the portrayal of arab-muslim society and its striving for modernization in a globalized world .
she formulates this objective in the context of a specific understanding of culture , cultural identity and intercultural relationships .
culture as a dynamic concept for her , culture is a dynamic concept which embraces all of a society 's activities in their historical context and thus lends its identity a form which is distinct , yet still able to communicate and learn .
soueif incorporates this understanding into her work by portraying her characters ' experiences both in the various stages of egyptian society 's historical development as well as during their stays in great britain .
in her novel the map of love , soueif describes the political , socio-economic and cultural conditions that dominated egyptian society at the beginning of the 20th century and follows their development through the changing viewpoints , experiences and feelings of the character anna , an englishwoman living in egypt .
through this learning process , we observe the way that anna on the one hand and her egyptian neighbors on the other maintain their respective cultural identities and , at the same time , enter into a conflict-ridden , yet fruitful dialogue .
writing about modern egyptian women soueif uses time and space , fiction and reality in the context of history and politics to paint this picture in different epochs and in different places .
she is helped here by well-founded information and research which challenge the oversimplified , stereotyped portrayal of egyptian women in english literature .
soueif pointed to the positive reception of this process among her readers .
" i think it has already changed misconceptions among my readers judging by the letters i get , " she told qantara.de.
" i do like to play with these preconceptions and twirl them round a bit ; like standing the western concept of the ' harem ' on its head as i do in the map of love by representing the domestic life of a harem . "
the special quality of soueif 's writing style lies in its artistic construction , which is based on a fusion of arab and english settings , characters and manners of speaking , lending a unique aesthetic character to her works .
cultural characteristics of egyptian people – such as arab names , expressions , metaphors , greetings and forms of address – flow seamlessly into her english-language dialogues .
" english is an extremely hospitable language " literary critic polly pattolo wrote that soueif 's literary style consisted of thinking out her dialogues in arabic and writing them in english .
soueif pointed to the literary advantages that this style provides for the english-speaking reader .
" i think this is the base , really , of the sometimes ' different ' english i write , " she said .
" that i need to fashion an english that will express an arab reality . "
in germany , too , both german and arab writers have intensified their efforts to support an intercultural dialogue in recent years .
examples of this trend can be seen in the works of the arab immigrants jusuf naoum , suleman taufiq and rafik schami .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.10.2004 opinion : a matter of prestige for ankara großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's bridge to asia ?
the eu commission is likely to give the go-ahead wednesday for opening talks with ankara about its membership bid .
but it wo n't silence the controversial debate over whether turkey belongs in the eu in the first place . can the european union cope with turkey 's entry ?
the controversial question may be currently raging in europe , but , in theory , it 's already been decided .
at least from brussels ' perspective : ankara has been an official candidate for over four years . in addition , an imminent go-ahead for opening concrete negotiations is likely to set in motion an automatic eu membership process that is going to be hard to stop .
at the most , referendums in eu countries or a failure on turkey ' part to implement further reforms to fulfill membership criteria could put the brakes on it .
but , actual entry into the union is not expected before the next 10-15 years anyway . widespread eu euphoria however , the widespread skepticism against ever-growing ties between turkey and the eu is highly one-sided .
after all , in turkey itself , the vote in favor of joining is as high as 70 percent .
and there is n't any significant political or social force that would openly act against eu membership . of course that does n't mean that such forces do n't exist .
but , as long as brussels does n't disappoint turkish expectations , anti-european forces will hardly dare to reveal themselves for what they are .
eu euphoria among the turkish population is simply too robust for that . eu entry equals social progress the reasons for the euphoria are n't simply economic .
eu membership is a question for prestige for ankara and is often viewed by many ordinary turks as leading to social progress .
they may not be entirely wrong either . from the abolition of the death penalty to a strengthening of women 's rights to television programs in kurdish , the turks are already witnessing numerous improvements that would profit turkish society in the long term .
these reforms could only be pushed through because of brussels ' insistence on sustainable reforms .
nothing has contributed more to turkey 's stabilization in the past years than the prospect of eu entry . a crowning of the " european way " from a turkish perspective , eu membership would amount to a crowning of the " european way " , which the nation 's founder kemal atatürk led his people towards over 80 years ago . atatürk did n't just introduce the separation of state and religion , which is still valid today .
he was also responsible for the fact that turkish women could vote in 1934 at a time when their counterparts in countries such as france and switzerland had to obediently stay at home on election days . this should provide some food for thought for those who today reject turkey as " culturally alien " despite its decades-long membership in nato and the european council . of course , large parts of turkey still remain underdeveloped .
and naturally , there are cultural differences which can not be denied .
despite that , for most turks it 's no contradiction to feel muslim , democrat and european at the same time . the current turkey debate in europe unfortunately raises the impression that one would like to talk them into such a contradiction . rainer sollich -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder hails erdogan as a " great reformer " as turkey looks set to receive official eu blessing to start negotiating membership , prime minister recep tayyip erdogan got a warm reception when he visited germany , turkey 's major ally in its quest for accession .

the eu commission is likely to give the go-ahead wednesday for opening talks with ankara about its membership bid .
but it wo n't silence the controversial debate over whether turkey belongs in the eu in the first place . can the european union cope with turkey 's entry ?
the controversial question may be currently raging in europe , but , in theory , it 's already been decided .
at least from brussels ' perspective : ankara has been an official candidate for over four years . in addition , an imminent go-ahead for opening concrete negotiations is likely to set in motion an automatic eu membership process that is going to be hard to stop .
at the most , referendums in eu countries or a failure on turkey ' part to implement further reforms to fulfill membership criteria could put the brakes on it .
but , actual entry into the union is not expected before the next 10-15 years anyway . widespread eu euphoria however , the widespread skepticism against ever-growing ties between turkey and the eu is highly one-sided .
after all , in turkey itself , the vote in favor of joining is as high as 70 percent .
and there is n't any significant political or social force that would openly act against eu membership . of course that does n't mean that such forces do n't exist .
but , as long as brussels does n't disappoint turkish expectations , anti-european forces will hardly dare to reveal themselves for what they are .
eu euphoria among the turkish population is simply too robust for that . eu entry equals social progress the reasons for the euphoria are n't simply economic .
eu membership is a question for prestige for ankara and is often viewed by many ordinary turks as leading to social progress .
they may not be entirely wrong either . from the abolition of the death penalty to a strengthening of women 's rights to television programs in kurdish , the turks are already witnessing numerous improvements that would profit turkish society in the long term .
these reforms could only be pushed through because of brussels ' insistence on sustainable reforms .
nothing has contributed more to turkey 's stabilization in the past years than the prospect of eu entry . a crowning of the " european way " from a turkish perspective , eu membership would amount to a crowning of the " european way " , which the nation 's founder kemal atatürk led his people towards over 80 years ago . atatürk did n't just introduce the separation of state and religion , which is still valid today .
he was also responsible for the fact that turkish women could vote in 1934 at a time when their counterparts in countries such as france and switzerland had to obediently stay at home on election days . this should provide some food for thought for those who today reject turkey as " culturally alien " despite its decades-long membership in nato and the european council . of course , large parts of turkey still remain underdeveloped .
and naturally , there are cultural differences which can not be denied .
despite that , for most turks it 's no contradiction to feel muslim , democrat and european at the same time . the current turkey debate in europe unfortunately raises the impression that one would like to talk them into such a contradiction . rainer sollich -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder hails erdogan as a " great reformer " as turkey looks set to receive official eu blessing to start negotiating membership , prime minister recep tayyip erdogan got a warm reception when he visited germany , turkey 's major ally in its quest for accession .

as a nominee for the booker prize she is among the growing number of authors who are developing a so-called " euro-arab literature . " the egyptian author ahdaf soueif is one of a number of arab authors who emigrated to western europe in the second half of the 20th century and who , from their adopted homes , attempt to describe their encounters with cultural otherness .
they base their narratives in their foreign homes as well as in their countries of origin and , through the themes , content and literary style of their work , they present their characters ' unique experiences in both locations and in the " space in between . "
literature as a beacon for social integration this immigrant literature trend can for instance be observed in germany .
here , arab authors write stories which illustrate the conflict between their own cultural identity and that of the new country and which deal with the inner struggle between the old and the new cultural identities using new literary forms that stem from arab tradition .
in the context of today 's globalized literature , these authors are making an important contribution to the process of observing and comparing cultural differences : they see it as an opportunity to develop an intercultural " euro-arab literature " which can help make a dialogue between the cultures easier and assist in the integration of immigrants into the societies that receive them .
intellectual muslim background bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahdaf soueif ´ s place of birth : cairo ahdaf soueif was born in cairo in 1950 , the daughter of an intellectual muslim family .
she studied english literature at egyptian and british universities and served for two years as an instructor at a saudi arabian university .
since 1981 , she has been dividing her time between london and cairo .
soueif 's literary career began in 1983 , when she published her collection of short stories , aischa .
this was followed by the novel in the eye of the sun -lrb- 1992 -rrb- , the short story collection sandpiper -lrb- 1996 -rrb- and her second novel the map of love .
she translated some of her literary works into arabic and in 1996 , she was awarded the cairo book fair award for the best short stories of the year for her collection zimat al-hayat wa qisas ukhra , sandpiper , or literally , the beauty of life and other stories .
egyptian booker prize nominee in 1999 , her novel the map of love was nominated for the acclaimed booker prize .
numerous magazines and newspapers – including the times literary supplement , cosmopolitan , the london review of books and al-ahram weekly – regularly review her work and publish her critical treatises .
soueif 's literary works focus on the portrayal of arab-muslim society and its striving for modernization in a globalized world .
she formulates this objective in the context of a specific understanding of culture , cultural identity and intercultural relationships .
culture as a dynamic concept for her , culture is a dynamic concept which embraces all of a society 's activities in their historical context and thus lends its identity a form which is distinct , yet still able to communicate and learn .
soueif incorporates this understanding into her work by portraying her characters ' experiences both in the various stages of egyptian society 's historical development as well as during their stays in great britain .
in her novel the map of love , soueif describes the political , socio-economic and cultural conditions that dominated egyptian society at the beginning of the 20th century and follows their development through the changing viewpoints , experiences and feelings of the character anna , an englishwoman living in egypt .
through this learning process , we observe the way that anna on the one hand and her egyptian neighbors on the other maintain their respective cultural identities and , at the same time , enter into a conflict-ridden , yet fruitful dialogue .
writing about modern egyptian women soueif uses time and space , fiction and reality in the context of history and politics to paint this picture in different epochs and in different places .
she is helped here by well-founded information and research which challenge the oversimplified , stereotyped portrayal of egyptian women in english literature .
soueif pointed to the positive reception of this process among her readers .
" i think it has already changed misconceptions among my readers judging by the letters i get , " she told qantara.de.
" i do like to play with these preconceptions and twirl them round a bit ; like standing the western concept of the ' harem ' on its head as i do in the map of love by representing the domestic life of a harem . "
the special quality of soueif 's writing style lies in its artistic construction , which is based on a fusion of arab and english settings , characters and manners of speaking , lending a unique aesthetic character to her works .
cultural characteristics of egyptian people – such as arab names , expressions , metaphors , greetings and forms of address – flow seamlessly into her english-language dialogues .
" english is an extremely hospitable language " literary critic polly pattolo wrote that soueif 's literary style consisted of thinking out her dialogues in arabic and writing them in english .
soueif pointed to the literary advantages that this style provides for the english-speaking reader .
" i think this is the base , really , of the sometimes ' different ' english i write , " she said .
" that i need to fashion an english that will express an arab reality . "
in germany , too , both german and arab writers have intensified their efforts to support an intercultural dialogue in recent years .
examples of this trend can be seen in the works of the arab immigrants jusuf naoum , suleman taufiq and rafik schami .
with the intensive support of german , british and arab authors , these literary products could be developed into a euro-arabic literature .

cultural ties are thriving and exchange , particularly in scientific and technological fields , has seen a robust increase . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian prime minister manmohan singh , left , talks to german foreign minister joschka fischer at the start of their official talks in new delhi , india , wednesday , july 14 , 2004 .
the two countries have also cooperated closely in past months in pushing for united nations reform and supporting each other 's claims to permanent seats in an expanded security council .
german foreign minister joschka fischer visited delhi in july this year . fear of the communists but , a shock change in india 's political leadership in may this year - when the congress party ended the six-year rule of the hindu nationalist bharatiya janata party -lrb- bjp -rrb- to take power - prompted worries in germany about delhi 's future economic course . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian stockbrokers trade in bombay .
a jittery indian stock market recorded its biggest fall in four years tuesday , amid fears that a hung parliament predicted by pollsters could slow or even halt economic liberalization .
the congress-led coalition headed by prime minister manmohan singh is dependent on the " outside support " of a " left front " dominated by the communist party of india -lrb- marxist -rrb- , causing foreign investors to fear that the new government could be hostile to business and reluctant to continue or accelerate the economic liberalization process begun in the early 1990s . " of course , we were jittery initially when the congress came to power , " eckart von unger , india expert for the federation of german industries -lrb- fdi -rrb- told dw-world .
" the german economy is reliant on exports and thus india 's liberalization process is of crucial importance to us . " unexpected opportunities but those fears have since been largely assuaged . " the new government will largely continue with the economic policies of the former one , so there will be no significant shift in the investment climate , " anuradha chenoy , expert on international relations at delhi 's jawaharlal nehru university , told dw-world .
" the communists realize the need for foreign investment , especially in infrastructure .
they 've indicated that they 're only concerned about how far key sectors like oil and telecom can be opened up .
it 's just a matter of numbers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manmohan singh , left , speaks about sonia gandhi , right , as they announce that he has been named prime minister of india after meeting with the country 's president in new delhi wednesday may 19 , 2004 .
von unger said that manmohan singh , considered the architect of the reform program as finance minister of the then congress government in 1991 , had created unexpected further opportunities for germany . " we 're optimistic that the singh government 's focus , especially on expanding infrastructure in rural india , offers huge chances for german firms , " he said . " lots of room for more " the time may indeed be ripe now , but there 's no denying that german companies have n't exactly seized the chance in recent years to cash in on india 's growing status as a " booming economy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mumbai 's most famous landmark , the gateway of india set against the figures associated with being the world 's second-most populous country and one of the fastest-growing markets - growth rates of 6 to 8 percent a year , a burgeoning 300-million-strong middle class and an estimated 40 million potential consumers for high-quality goods - bilateral trade at around € 5 billion -lrb- $ 6.14 billion -rrb- last year seems a mere trickle . the statistics are just as lean when it comes to german direct investments in india .
investments have been continually falling since 1997 , and reached a record low last year at € 37 million , down from € 51.7 million in 2002 . bernhard steinrücke , executive director of the indo-german chamber of commerce in mumbai , the largest bilateral trade promotion organization in india and the largest german foreign chamber abroad , however pointed out that well-established companies like siemens , krupp and bayer had been in india since the 19th century . " there are also some success stories of medium-sized german companies in india , who have reinvested in the country , " steinrücke told dw-world .
" but , there 's no denying that there 's still lots of room for more . "
steinrücke added that schröder 's visit was more than just symbolic .
" he 's the first european head of state to visit the country .
it underlines the importance that germany attaches to india . " " bad infrastructure and bureaucracy " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a wipro employee works on specialized softwares to provide services to overseas clients at the company in bangalore , india .
experts say that apart from india 's growing reputation as an " outsourcing mecca " and its enviable skills in the it services sector , which have n't escaped the notice of german companies like siemens , sap and bertelsmann , the country still suffers from huge problems which deter investors . " the infrastructure is appalling and bureaucracy a major hurdle , " von unger said .
" the awarding of licenses takes so long that many smaller businesses simply ca n't afford the complicated legal process .
you need a lot of patience . " other trade barriers include corruption , insufficient protection of intellectual property , stiflingly high state influence in industrial sectors and high import levies . others draw obvious parallels to the massive success story next door in china , where german firms exported goods worth a whopping € 18 billion last year . " india 's reform process began some 13 years after china , " christian wagner of the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin told dw-world .
" china simply has a better image .
india is often considered chaotic and unruly .
and , ironically , because it 's a democracy and has a free press , it all gets reported about in the media . " made in germany still works however , despite sluggish german investments and trade volume , there seems to be agreement on both sides that something needs to give . on the upside , experts point that india has a wealth on offer : low labor costs , highly-qualified personnel and the widespread use of english . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder in india during a visit in oct .
2001 chancellor schröder , who last year admitted that " economic ties with india leave much to be desired , " will be accompanied by a 22-member strong economic delegation on wednesday with representatives from lufthansa , allianz , man and fraport .
according to government sources , signings of major contracts are not on the agenda : the visit will be rather aimed at getting to know the new government . a high-ranking science delegation led by german minister for education and research , edelgard buhlman , will also be present . for his part , the enigmatic manmohan singh told news magazine spiegel this week that he was interested in deepening trade ties with germany .

culture as a dynamic concept for her , culture is a dynamic concept which embraces all of a society 's activities in their historical context and thus lends its identity a form which is distinct , yet still able to communicate and learn .
soueif incorporates this understanding into her work by portraying her characters ' experiences both in the various stages of egyptian society 's historical development as well as during their stays in great britain .
in her novel the map of love , soueif describes the political , socio-economic and cultural conditions that dominated egyptian society at the beginning of the 20th century and follows their development through the changing viewpoints , experiences and feelings of the character anna , an englishwoman living in egypt .
through this learning process , we observe the way that anna on the one hand and her egyptian neighbors on the other maintain their respective cultural identities and , at the same time , enter into a conflict-ridden , yet fruitful dialogue .
writing about modern egyptian women soueif uses time and space , fiction and reality in the context of history and politics to paint this picture in different epochs and in different places .
she is helped here by well-founded information and research which challenge the oversimplified , stereotyped portrayal of egyptian women in english literature .
soueif pointed to the positive reception of this process among her readers .
" i think it has already changed misconceptions among my readers judging by the letters i get , " she told qantara.de.
" i do like to play with these preconceptions and twirl them round a bit ; like standing the western concept of the ' harem ' on its head as i do in the map of love by representing the domestic life of a harem . "
the special quality of soueif 's writing style lies in its artistic construction , which is based on a fusion of arab and english settings , characters and manners of speaking , lending a unique aesthetic character to her works .
cultural characteristics of egyptian people – such as arab names , expressions , metaphors , greetings and forms of address – flow seamlessly into her english-language dialogues .
" english is an extremely hospitable language " literary critic polly pattolo wrote that soueif 's literary style consisted of thinking out her dialogues in arabic and writing them in english .
soueif pointed to the literary advantages that this style provides for the english-speaking reader .
" i think this is the base , really , of the sometimes ' different ' english i write , " she said .
" that i need to fashion an english that will express an arab reality . "
in germany , too , both german and arab writers have intensified their efforts to support an intercultural dialogue in recent years .
examples of this trend can be seen in the works of the arab immigrants jusuf naoum , suleman taufiq and rafik schami .

literature as a beacon for social integration this immigrant literature trend can for instance be observed in germany .
here , arab authors write stories which illustrate the conflict between their own cultural identity and that of the new country and which deal with the inner struggle between the old and the new cultural identities using new literary forms that stem from arab tradition .

as a nominee for the booker prize she is among the growing number of authors who are developing a so-called " euro-arab literature . " the egyptian author ahdaf soueif is one of a number of arab authors who emigrated to western europe in the second half of the 20th century and who , from their adopted homes , attempt to describe their encounters with cultural otherness .
they base their narratives in their foreign homes as well as in their countries of origin and , through the themes , content and literary style of their work , they present their characters ' unique experiences in both locations and in the " space in between . "
literature as a beacon for social integration this immigrant literature trend can for instance be observed in germany .
here , arab authors write stories which illustrate the conflict between their own cultural identity and that of the new country and which deal with the inner struggle between the old and the new cultural identities using new literary forms that stem from arab tradition .
in the context of today 's globalized literature , these authors are making an important contribution to the process of observing and comparing cultural differences : they see it as an opportunity to develop an intercultural " euro-arab literature " which can help make a dialogue between the cultures easier and assist in the integration of immigrants into the societies that receive them .
intellectual muslim background bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahdaf soueif ´ s place of birth : cairo ahdaf soueif was born in cairo in 1950 , the daughter of an intellectual muslim family .
she studied english literature at egyptian and british universities and served for two years as an instructor at a saudi arabian university .
since 1981 , she has been dividing her time between london and cairo .
soueif 's literary career began in 1983 , when she published her collection of short stories , aischa .
this was followed by the novel in the eye of the sun -lrb- 1992 -rrb- , the short story collection sandpiper -lrb- 1996 -rrb- and her second novel the map of love .
she translated some of her literary works into arabic and in 1996 , she was awarded the cairo book fair award for the best short stories of the year for her collection zimat al-hayat wa qisas ukhra , sandpiper , or literally , the beauty of life and other stories .
egyptian booker prize nominee in 1999 , her novel the map of love was nominated for the acclaimed booker prize .
numerous magazines and newspapers – including the times literary supplement , cosmopolitan , the london review of books and al-ahram weekly – regularly review her work and publish her critical treatises .
soueif 's literary works focus on the portrayal of arab-muslim society and its striving for modernization in a globalized world .
she formulates this objective in the context of a specific understanding of culture , cultural identity and intercultural relationships .
culture as a dynamic concept for her , culture is a dynamic concept which embraces all of a society 's activities in their historical context and thus lends its identity a form which is distinct , yet still able to communicate and learn .
soueif incorporates this understanding into her work by portraying her characters ' experiences both in the various stages of egyptian society 's historical development as well as during their stays in great britain .
in her novel the map of love , soueif describes the political , socio-economic and cultural conditions that dominated egyptian society at the beginning of the 20th century and follows their development through the changing viewpoints , experiences and feelings of the character anna , an englishwoman living in egypt .
through this learning process , we observe the way that anna on the one hand and her egyptian neighbors on the other maintain their respective cultural identities and , at the same time , enter into a conflict-ridden , yet fruitful dialogue .
writing about modern egyptian women soueif uses time and space , fiction and reality in the context of history and politics to paint this picture in different epochs and in different places .
she is helped here by well-founded information and research which challenge the oversimplified , stereotyped portrayal of egyptian women in english literature .
soueif pointed to the positive reception of this process among her readers .
" i think it has already changed misconceptions among my readers judging by the letters i get , " she told qantara.de.
" i do like to play with these preconceptions and twirl them round a bit ; like standing the western concept of the ' harem ' on its head as i do in the map of love by representing the domestic life of a harem . "
the special quality of soueif 's writing style lies in its artistic construction , which is based on a fusion of arab and english settings , characters and manners of speaking , lending a unique aesthetic character to her works .
cultural characteristics of egyptian people – such as arab names , expressions , metaphors , greetings and forms of address – flow seamlessly into her english-language dialogues .
" english is an extremely hospitable language " literary critic polly pattolo wrote that soueif 's literary style consisted of thinking out her dialogues in arabic and writing them in english .
soueif pointed to the literary advantages that this style provides for the english-speaking reader .
" i think this is the base , really , of the sometimes ' different ' english i write , " she said .
" that i need to fashion an english that will express an arab reality . "
in germany , too , both german and arab writers have intensified their efforts to support an intercultural dialogue in recent years .
examples of this trend can be seen in the works of the arab immigrants jusuf naoum , suleman taufiq and rafik schami .
with the intensive support of german , british and arab authors , these literary products could be developed into a euro-arabic literature .
this literary genre could provide a forum for encouraging dialogue between the cultures and accelerating integration into the societies of immigration . yafa shanneik , © qantara.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de frankfurt book fair opens gerhard schröder and the secretary general of the arab league , amre mussa , will open the frankfurt book fair on tuesday .

as a nominee for the booker prize she is among the growing number of authors who are developing a so-called " euro-arab literature . " the egyptian author ahdaf soueif is one of a number of arab authors who emigrated to western europe in the second half of the 20th century and who , from their adopted homes , attempt to describe their encounters with cultural otherness .
they base their narratives in their foreign homes as well as in their countries of origin and , through the themes , content and literary style of their work , they present their characters ' unique experiences in both locations and in the " space in between . "
literature as a beacon for social integration this immigrant literature trend can for instance be observed in germany .
here , arab authors write stories which illustrate the conflict between their own cultural identity and that of the new country and which deal with the inner struggle between the old and the new cultural identities using new literary forms that stem from arab tradition .
in the context of today 's globalized literature , these authors are making an important contribution to the process of observing and comparing cultural differences : they see it as an opportunity to develop an intercultural " euro-arab literature " which can help make a dialogue between the cultures easier and assist in the integration of immigrants into the societies that receive them .
intellectual muslim background bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahdaf soueif ´ s place of birth : cairo ahdaf soueif was born in cairo in 1950 , the daughter of an intellectual muslim family .
she studied english literature at egyptian and british universities and served for two years as an instructor at a saudi arabian university .
since 1981 , she has been dividing her time between london and cairo .
soueif 's literary career began in 1983 , when she published her collection of short stories , aischa .
this was followed by the novel in the eye of the sun -lrb- 1992 -rrb- , the short story collection sandpiper -lrb- 1996 -rrb- and her second novel the map of love .
she translated some of her literary works into arabic and in 1996 , she was awarded the cairo book fair award for the best short stories of the year for her collection zimat al-hayat wa qisas ukhra , sandpiper , or literally , the beauty of life and other stories .
egyptian booker prize nominee in 1999 , her novel the map of love was nominated for the acclaimed booker prize .
numerous magazines and newspapers – including the times literary supplement , cosmopolitan , the london review of books and al-ahram weekly – regularly review her work and publish her critical treatises .
soueif 's literary works focus on the portrayal of arab-muslim society and its striving for modernization in a globalized world .
she formulates this objective in the context of a specific understanding of culture , cultural identity and intercultural relationships .
culture as a dynamic concept for her , culture is a dynamic concept which embraces all of a society 's activities in their historical context and thus lends its identity a form which is distinct , yet still able to communicate and learn .
soueif incorporates this understanding into her work by portraying her characters ' experiences both in the various stages of egyptian society 's historical development as well as during their stays in great britain .
in her novel the map of love , soueif describes the political , socio-economic and cultural conditions that dominated egyptian society at the beginning of the 20th century and follows their development through the changing viewpoints , experiences and feelings of the character anna , an englishwoman living in egypt .
through this learning process , we observe the way that anna on the one hand and her egyptian neighbors on the other maintain their respective cultural identities and , at the same time , enter into a conflict-ridden , yet fruitful dialogue .
writing about modern egyptian women soueif uses time and space , fiction and reality in the context of history and politics to paint this picture in different epochs and in different places .
she is helped here by well-founded information and research which challenge the oversimplified , stereotyped portrayal of egyptian women in english literature .
soueif pointed to the positive reception of this process among her readers .
" i think it has already changed misconceptions among my readers judging by the letters i get , " she told qantara.de.
" i do like to play with these preconceptions and twirl them round a bit ; like standing the western concept of the ' harem ' on its head as i do in the map of love by representing the domestic life of a harem . "
the special quality of soueif 's writing style lies in its artistic construction , which is based on a fusion of arab and english settings , characters and manners of speaking , lending a unique aesthetic character to her works .
cultural characteristics of egyptian people – such as arab names , expressions , metaphors , greetings and forms of address – flow seamlessly into her english-language dialogues .
" english is an extremely hospitable language " literary critic polly pattolo wrote that soueif 's literary style consisted of thinking out her dialogues in arabic and writing them in english .
soueif pointed to the literary advantages that this style provides for the english-speaking reader .
" i think this is the base , really , of the sometimes ' different ' english i write , " she said .
" that i need to fashion an english that will express an arab reality . "
in germany , too , both german and arab writers have intensified their efforts to support an intercultural dialogue in recent years .
examples of this trend can be seen in the works of the arab immigrants jusuf naoum , suleman taufiq and rafik schami .
with the intensive support of german , british and arab authors , these literary products could be developed into a euro-arabic literature .

the eu commission is likely to give the go-ahead wednesday for opening talks with ankara about its membership bid .
but it wo n't silence the controversial debate over whether turkey belongs in the eu in the first place . can the european union cope with turkey 's entry ?
the controversial question may be currently raging in europe , but , in theory , it 's already been decided .
at least from brussels ' perspective : ankara has been an official candidate for over four years . in addition , an imminent go-ahead for opening concrete negotiations is likely to set in motion an automatic eu membership process that is going to be hard to stop .
at the most , referendums in eu countries or a failure on turkey ' part to implement further reforms to fulfill membership criteria could put the brakes on it .
but , actual entry into the union is not expected before the next 10-15 years anyway . widespread eu euphoria however , the widespread skepticism against ever-growing ties between turkey and the eu is highly one-sided .
after all , in turkey itself , the vote in favor of joining is as high as 70 percent .
and there is n't any significant political or social force that would openly act against eu membership . of course that does n't mean that such forces do n't exist .
but , as long as brussels does n't disappoint turkish expectations , anti-european forces will hardly dare to reveal themselves for what they are .
eu euphoria among the turkish population is simply too robust for that . eu entry equals social progress the reasons for the euphoria are n't simply economic .
eu membership is a question for prestige for ankara and is often viewed by many ordinary turks as leading to social progress .
they may not be entirely wrong either . from the abolition of the death penalty to a strengthening of women 's rights to television programs in kurdish , the turks are already witnessing numerous improvements that would profit turkish society in the long term .
these reforms could only be pushed through because of brussels ' insistence on sustainable reforms .
nothing has contributed more to turkey 's stabilization in the past years than the prospect of eu entry . a crowning of the " european way " from a turkish perspective , eu membership would amount to a crowning of the " european way " , which the nation 's founder kemal atatürk led his people towards over 80 years ago . atatürk did n't just introduce the separation of state and religion , which is still valid today .
he was also responsible for the fact that turkish women could vote in 1934 at a time when their counterparts in countries such as france and switzerland had to obediently stay at home on election days . this should provide some food for thought for those who today reject turkey as " culturally alien " despite its decades-long membership in nato and the european council . of course , large parts of turkey still remain underdeveloped .
and naturally , there are cultural differences which can not be denied .
despite that , for most turks it 's no contradiction to feel muslim , democrat and european at the same time . the current turkey debate in europe unfortunately raises the impression that one would like to talk them into such a contradiction . rainer sollich -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder hails erdogan as a " great reformer " as turkey looks set to receive official eu blessing to start negotiating membership , prime minister recep tayyip erdogan got a warm reception when he visited germany , turkey 's major ally in its quest for accession .

the eu commission is likely to give the go-ahead wednesday for opening talks with ankara about its membership bid .
but it wo n't silence the controversial debate over whether turkey belongs in the eu in the first place . can the european union cope with turkey 's entry ?
the controversial question may be currently raging in europe , but , in theory , it 's already been decided .
at least from brussels ' perspective : ankara has been an official candidate for over four years . in addition , an imminent go-ahead for opening concrete negotiations is likely to set in motion an automatic eu membership process that is going to be hard to stop .
at the most , referendums in eu countries or a failure on turkey ' part to implement further reforms to fulfill membership criteria could put the brakes on it .
but , actual entry into the union is not expected before the next 10-15 years anyway . widespread eu euphoria however , the widespread skepticism against ever-growing ties between turkey and the eu is highly one-sided .
after all , in turkey itself , the vote in favor of joining is as high as 70 percent .
and there is n't any significant political or social force that would openly act against eu membership . of course that does n't mean that such forces do n't exist .
but , as long as brussels does n't disappoint turkish expectations , anti-european forces will hardly dare to reveal themselves for what they are .
eu euphoria among the turkish population is simply too robust for that . eu entry equals social progress the reasons for the euphoria are n't simply economic .
eu membership is a question for prestige for ankara and is often viewed by many ordinary turks as leading to social progress .
they may not be entirely wrong either . from the abolition of the death penalty to a strengthening of women 's rights to television programs in kurdish , the turks are already witnessing numerous improvements that would profit turkish society in the long term .
these reforms could only be pushed through because of brussels ' insistence on sustainable reforms .
nothing has contributed more to turkey 's stabilization in the past years than the prospect of eu entry . a crowning of the " european way " from a turkish perspective , eu membership would amount to a crowning of the " european way " , which the nation 's founder kemal atatürk led his people towards over 80 years ago . atatürk did n't just introduce the separation of state and religion , which is still valid today .

the eu commission is likely to give the go-ahead wednesday for opening talks with ankara about its membership bid .
but it wo n't silence the controversial debate over whether turkey belongs in the eu in the first place . can the european union cope with turkey 's entry ?
the controversial question may be currently raging in europe , but , in theory , it 's already been decided .
at least from brussels ' perspective : ankara has been an official candidate for over four years . in addition , an imminent go-ahead for opening concrete negotiations is likely to set in motion an automatic eu membership process that is going to be hard to stop .
at the most , referendums in eu countries or a failure on turkey ' part to implement further reforms to fulfill membership criteria could put the brakes on it .
but , actual entry into the union is not expected before the next 10-15 years anyway . widespread eu euphoria however , the widespread skepticism against ever-growing ties between turkey and the eu is highly one-sided .
after all , in turkey itself , the vote in favor of joining is as high as 70 percent .
and there is n't any significant political or social force that would openly act against eu membership . of course that does n't mean that such forces do n't exist .
but , as long as brussels does n't disappoint turkish expectations , anti-european forces will hardly dare to reveal themselves for what they are .
eu euphoria among the turkish population is simply too robust for that . eu entry equals social progress the reasons for the euphoria are n't simply economic .
eu membership is a question for prestige for ankara and is often viewed by many ordinary turks as leading to social progress .
they may not be entirely wrong either . from the abolition of the death penalty to a strengthening of women 's rights to television programs in kurdish , the turks are already witnessing numerous improvements that would profit turkish society in the long term .
these reforms could only be pushed through because of brussels ' insistence on sustainable reforms .
nothing has contributed more to turkey 's stabilization in the past years than the prospect of eu entry . a crowning of the " european way " from a turkish perspective , eu membership would amount to a crowning of the " european way " , which the nation 's founder kemal atatürk led his people towards over 80 years ago . atatürk did n't just introduce the separation of state and religion , which is still valid today .
he was also responsible for the fact that turkish women could vote in 1934 at a time when their counterparts in countries such as france and switzerland had to obediently stay at home on election days . this should provide some food for thought for those who today reject turkey as " culturally alien " despite its decades-long membership in nato and the european council . of course , large parts of turkey still remain underdeveloped .
and naturally , there are cultural differences which can not be denied .

the deal was announced by swedish prime minister göran persson and finnish prime minister matti vanhanen during a meeting yesterday -lrb- 4 october -rrb- in the border region of tornionjokilaakso .
sweden will contribute 900 soldiers and finland 300 to the nordic battle group .
the two prime ministers also urged norway to join the group , which would result in a total of 1,500 soldiers trained to fight in different environments and situations .
the norwegian defence minister kristin krohn devold has already indicated that oslo would be keen to take part in the creation of eu battle groups , a key military goal of the union .
accepting a nato country -lrb- norway -rrb- into a battle group together with two non-aligned countries -lrb- finland and sweden -rrb- would not be a problem , swedish premier göran persson indicated .
the question is rather whether the eu would accept a non-eu member -lrb- norway -rrb- to participate in the battle groups .
there are also concerns over potential opposition to the plan amongst the norwegian people , reports swedish radio .

the paper 's european edition prints some 100,000 copies - most of which are sold in germany . when the printer and publisher dogan media group opened a new headquarters in a frankfurt suburb two years ago , turkey 's vice premier mesut yilmaz called for the media to build a " bridge of understanding between cultures . "
the dogan media group owns various newspapers , magazines , and radio and television stations .
its flagship publication is the popular broadsheet hürriyet - which means translates as freedom or independent . up to now , the conservative daily was known for presenting a not so positive image of germany , while glorifying the motherland .
nevertheless , hürriyet has indeed devoted itself to building a " bridge of understanding . "
bridge between cultures at first , the paper was a bridge for emigrant turks to their old homeland .
starting in 1965 , hürriyet was flown in to germany for its readership , the turkish day laborers known as " guest workers " who were brought to the country .
since 1973 , the paper has carried germany supplements , aimed at the readers living there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : front pages of some turkish papers in early 2002 , hürriyet editors decided to print the inserts in german , in order to appeal to young readers - third generation turks who grew up in germany and whose spoken and written language is mainly german .
turkish remains the working language of the editorial offices , though .
focus on germany given its large circulation - 600,000 - hürriyet is the most widely read turkish daily .
its subsidiary europa hürriyet , with a print run of 100,000 , serves turks that live overseas , according to acting editor in chief ayhan can .
" we appear in over 20 countries from canada to australia , and across europe into macedonia , " can said .
" we have bureaus in european capitals including london , brussels , copenhagen , amsterdam and , of course , in many big cities in germany . "
with 70,000 copies sold there , germany accounts for nearly three quarters of the eurepean-hürriyet 's sales .
and wherever a large concentration of turks live , the paper has put its correspondents .
hürriyet has bureaus in berlin , munich , hamburg and cologne .
in july 2002 europa hürriyet moved from one frankfurt suburb to another , this time to the small town of walldorf .
there , the dogan media group built an extremely modern printing and publishing center , one of the largest investments of a turkish company in europe .

lifeline to ankara germany was the natural spot for the dogan empire to set up its european headquarters .
germany has a turkish population of 2.6 million , more than any other country outside of turkey .
when turkish " guest workers " came to germany in the 1960s , hürriyet was hard on their heels .
the paper was a lifeline to ankara , gave the turks in germany news from home , and played the role of teacher about daily life in germany .
" for the first generation in germany , we were their ' translator ' on complex topics like retirement funds , the social system , and company pensions .

the paper 's european edition prints some 100,000 copies - most of which are sold in germany . when the printer and publisher dogan media group opened a new headquarters in a frankfurt suburb two years ago , turkey 's vice premier mesut yilmaz called for the media to build a " bridge of understanding between cultures . "
the dogan media group owns various newspapers , magazines , and radio and television stations .
its flagship publication is the popular broadsheet hürriyet - which means translates as freedom or independent . up to now , the conservative daily was known for presenting a not so positive image of germany , while glorifying the motherland .
nevertheless , hürriyet has indeed devoted itself to building a " bridge of understanding . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 05.10.2004 eichel hastens retreat for german firms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many german companies want to leave new york 's stock exchange on a visit to new york , german finance minister hans eichel met with the director of the new york stock exchange .
his mission : to make it easier for german companies to leave the exchange . on his way home from world bank and international monetary fund meetings in washington , german finance minister hans eichel made a special pit stop in new york on monday .
he met with john thain , the director of the new york stock exchange -lrb- nyse -rrb- , and appeal on behalf of german companies for laxer rules governing the process of " de-listing " from the exchange .
the reason is quite simple : while during the boom years of the 1990s german companies raced to list themselves on the nyse , seeing it as a mark of prestige in an increasingly global economy , the effort has only proven worthwhile for a precious few .
for the rest , trading on the nyse has come at a high a price and they are looking to get out .
the trouble is , strict rules and regulations make such a retreat extremely difficult .
boom to bust at the moment , 18 german companies are traded on the nyse and nasdaq , the united states ' technology stock exchange .
deutsche telekom , siemens , sap , deutsche bank and infineon are among them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt stock exchange however , the stateside adventure has proven costly for the majority of them , particularly smaller concerns .
despite the huge initial cost of getting listed - for lawyers , consultants , etc . - most of the german companies have found there 's little interest in their stocks .
for example , the german pharmaceutical company bayer says just 80,000 of its stocks are traded each day , just 2.4 percent of the volume traded on the frankfurt exchange -lrb- photo -rrb- .
perhaps german companies get lost among the nearly 2,700 companies traded on the exchange , or , perhaps most investors interested in german stocks prefer to buy them on the frankfurt exchange , not in new york .
jürgen kurz , a spokesman for dsw , germany 's leading association for private investors , said he strongly suspects it 's the latter .
whatever the reason , the cost of doing business in new york is proving too high for many german companies listed there , and many are now beating the drums of retreat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister hans eichel at a meeting of the american chamber of commerce in germany in april .
" the majority are looking to get out sooner rather than later , " peter wiesner , of the german industry association -lrb- bdi -rrb- told the german newsweekly der spiegel .
their efforts , however , have been frustrated by strict regulations governing the process of de-listing .
eichel met with thain to appeal for laxer rules .
caught up in the red tape aside from worries that an en-masse retreat could send alarm signals off in the heads of investors , german firms looking to leave the nyse have mostly been frustrated by a rule stipulating that foreign companies can only leave the exchange if fewer than 300 permanent residents of the us own the company 's stock .
tracking down stockholders to buy back their shares is both expensive and time consuming .
indeed , german companies may have found us residents none too interested in their stocks , but enough interest existed to put them over the limit .
for example , financial services giant allianz has 555,300 stocks owned by 1,760 americans .
" it needs to be easier for german companies to leave the us exchange , " eichel told train at their meeting , according to a spokesman for eichel .

his mission : to make it easier for german companies to leave the exchange . on his way home from world bank and international monetary fund meetings in washington , german finance minister hans eichel made a special pit stop in new york on monday .
he met with john thain , the director of the new york stock exchange -lrb- nyse -rrb- , and appeal on behalf of german companies for laxer rules governing the process of " de-listing " from the exchange .
the reason is quite simple : while during the boom years of the 1990s german companies raced to list themselves on the nyse , seeing it as a mark of prestige in an increasingly global economy , the effort has only proven worthwhile for a precious few .
for the rest , trading on the nyse has come at a high a price and they are looking to get out .
the trouble is , strict rules and regulations make such a retreat extremely difficult .
boom to bust at the moment , 18 german companies are traded on the nyse and nasdaq , the united states ' technology stock exchange .
deutsche telekom , siemens , sap , deutsche bank and infineon are among them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt stock exchange however , the stateside adventure has proven costly for the majority of them , particularly smaller concerns .
despite the huge initial cost of getting listed - for lawyers , consultants , etc . - most of the german companies have found there 's little interest in their stocks .
for example , the german pharmaceutical company bayer says just 80,000 of its stocks are traded each day , just 2.4 percent of the volume traded on the frankfurt exchange -lrb- photo -rrb- .
perhaps german companies get lost among the nearly 2,700 companies traded on the exchange , or , perhaps most investors interested in german stocks prefer to buy them on the frankfurt exchange , not in new york .
jürgen kurz , a spokesman for dsw , germany 's leading association for private investors , said he strongly suspects it 's the latter .
whatever the reason , the cost of doing business in new york is proving too high for many german companies listed there , and many are now beating the drums of retreat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister hans eichel at a meeting of the american chamber of commerce in germany in april .
" the majority are looking to get out sooner rather than later , " peter wiesner , of the german industry association -lrb- bdi -rrb- told the german newsweekly der spiegel .
their efforts , however , have been frustrated by strict regulations governing the process of de-listing .
eichel met with thain to appeal for laxer rules .
caught up in the red tape aside from worries that an en-masse retreat could send alarm signals off in the heads of investors , german firms looking to leave the nyse have mostly been frustrated by a rule stipulating that foreign companies can only leave the exchange if fewer than 300 permanent residents of the us own the company 's stock .
tracking down stockholders to buy back their shares is both expensive and time consuming .
indeed , german companies may have found us residents none too interested in their stocks , but enough interest existed to put them over the limit .
for example , financial services giant allianz has 555,300 stocks owned by 1,760 americans .
" it needs to be easier for german companies to leave the us exchange , " eichel told train at their meeting , according to a spokesman for eichel .

his mission : to make it easier for german companies to leave the exchange . on his way home from world bank and international monetary fund meetings in washington , german finance minister hans eichel made a special pit stop in new york on monday .
he met with john thain , the director of the new york stock exchange -lrb- nyse -rrb- , and appeal on behalf of german companies for laxer rules governing the process of " de-listing " from the exchange .
the reason is quite simple : while during the boom years of the 1990s german companies raced to list themselves on the nyse , seeing it as a mark of prestige in an increasingly global economy , the effort has only proven worthwhile for a precious few .
for the rest , trading on the nyse has come at a high a price and they are looking to get out .
the trouble is , strict rules and regulations make such a retreat extremely difficult .

despite the huge initial cost of getting listed - for lawyers , consultants , etc . - most of the german companies have found there 's little interest in their stocks .

perhaps german companies get lost among the nearly 2,700 companies traded on the exchange , or , perhaps most investors interested in german stocks prefer to buy them on the frankfurt exchange , not in new york .
jürgen kurz , a spokesman for dsw , germany 's leading association for private investors , said he strongly suspects it 's the latter .
whatever the reason , the cost of doing business in new york is proving too high for many german companies listed there , and many are now beating the drums of retreat .

eichel met with thain to appeal for laxer rules .
caught up in the red tape aside from worries that an en-masse retreat could send alarm signals off in the heads of investors , german firms looking to leave the nyse have mostly been frustrated by a rule stipulating that foreign companies can only leave the exchange if fewer than 300 permanent residents of the us own the company 's stock .

cultural ties are thriving and exchange , particularly in scientific and technological fields , has seen a robust increase . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian prime minister manmohan singh , left , talks to german foreign minister joschka fischer at the start of their official talks in new delhi , india , wednesday , july 14 , 2004 .
the two countries have also cooperated closely in past months in pushing for united nations reform and supporting each other 's claims to permanent seats in an expanded security council .
german foreign minister joschka fischer visited delhi in july this year . fear of the communists but , a shock change in india 's political leadership in may this year - when the congress party ended the six-year rule of the hindu nationalist bharatiya janata party -lrb- bjp -rrb- to take power - prompted worries in germany about delhi 's future economic course . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian stockbrokers trade in bombay .
a jittery indian stock market recorded its biggest fall in four years tuesday , amid fears that a hung parliament predicted by pollsters could slow or even halt economic liberalization .
the congress-led coalition headed by prime minister manmohan singh is dependent on the " outside support " of a " left front " dominated by the communist party of india -lrb- marxist -rrb- , causing foreign investors to fear that the new government could be hostile to business and reluctant to continue or accelerate the economic liberalization process begun in the early 1990s . " of course , we were jittery initially when the congress came to power , " eckart von unger , india expert for the federation of german industries -lrb- fdi -rrb- told dw-world .
" the german economy is reliant on exports and thus india 's liberalization process is of crucial importance to us . " unexpected opportunities but those fears have since been largely assuaged . " the new government will largely continue with the economic policies of the former one , so there will be no significant shift in the investment climate , " anuradha chenoy , expert on international relations at delhi 's jawaharlal nehru university , told dw-world .
" the communists realize the need for foreign investment , especially in infrastructure .
they 've indicated that they 're only concerned about how far key sectors like oil and telecom can be opened up .
it 's just a matter of numbers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manmohan singh , left , speaks about sonia gandhi , right , as they announce that he has been named prime minister of india after meeting with the country 's president in new delhi wednesday may 19 , 2004 .
von unger said that manmohan singh , considered the architect of the reform program as finance minister of the then congress government in 1991 , had created unexpected further opportunities for germany . " we 're optimistic that the singh government 's focus , especially on expanding infrastructure in rural india , offers huge chances for german firms , " he said . " lots of room for more " the time may indeed be ripe now , but there 's no denying that german companies have n't exactly seized the chance in recent years to cash in on india 's growing status as a " booming economy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mumbai 's most famous landmark , the gateway of india set against the figures associated with being the world 's second-most populous country and one of the fastest-growing markets - growth rates of 6 to 8 percent a year , a burgeoning 300-million-strong middle class and an estimated 40 million potential consumers for high-quality goods - bilateral trade at around € 5 billion -lrb- $ 6.14 billion -rrb- last year seems a mere trickle . the statistics are just as lean when it comes to german direct investments in india .
investments have been continually falling since 1997 , and reached a record low last year at € 37 million , down from € 51.7 million in 2002 . bernhard steinrücke , executive director of the indo-german chamber of commerce in mumbai , the largest bilateral trade promotion organization in india and the largest german foreign chamber abroad , however pointed out that well-established companies like siemens , krupp and bayer had been in india since the 19th century . " there are also some success stories of medium-sized german companies in india , who have reinvested in the country , " steinrücke told dw-world .
" but , there 's no denying that there 's still lots of room for more . "
steinrücke added that schröder 's visit was more than just symbolic .
" he 's the first european head of state to visit the country .
it underlines the importance that germany attaches to india . " " bad infrastructure and bureaucracy " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a wipro employee works on specialized softwares to provide services to overseas clients at the company in bangalore , india .
experts say that apart from india 's growing reputation as an " outsourcing mecca " and its enviable skills in the it services sector , which have n't escaped the notice of german companies like siemens , sap and bertelsmann , the country still suffers from huge problems which deter investors . " the infrastructure is appalling and bureaucracy a major hurdle , " von unger said .
" the awarding of licenses takes so long that many smaller businesses simply ca n't afford the complicated legal process .
you need a lot of patience . " other trade barriers include corruption , insufficient protection of intellectual property , stiflingly high state influence in industrial sectors and high import levies . others draw obvious parallels to the massive success story next door in china , where german firms exported goods worth a whopping € 18 billion last year . " india 's reform process began some 13 years after china , " christian wagner of the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin told dw-world .
" china simply has a better image .
india is often considered chaotic and unruly .
and , ironically , because it 's a democracy and has a free press , it all gets reported about in the media . " made in germany still works however , despite sluggish german investments and trade volume , there seems to be agreement on both sides that something needs to give . on the upside , experts point that india has a wealth on offer : low labor costs , highly-qualified personnel and the widespread use of english . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder in india during a visit in oct .
2001 chancellor schröder , who last year admitted that " economic ties with india leave much to be desired , " will be accompanied by a 22-member strong economic delegation on wednesday with representatives from lufthansa , allianz , man and fraport .
according to government sources , signings of major contracts are not on the agenda : the visit will be rather aimed at getting to know the new government . a high-ranking science delegation led by german minister for education and research , edelgard buhlman , will also be present . for his part , the enigmatic manmohan singh told news magazine spiegel this week that he was interested in deepening trade ties with germany .

cultural ties are thriving and exchange , particularly in scientific and technological fields , has seen a robust increase . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian prime minister manmohan singh , left , talks to german foreign minister joschka fischer at the start of their official talks in new delhi , india , wednesday , july 14 , 2004 .
the two countries have also cooperated closely in past months in pushing for united nations reform and supporting each other 's claims to permanent seats in an expanded security council .
german foreign minister joschka fischer visited delhi in july this year . fear of the communists but , a shock change in india 's political leadership in may this year - when the congress party ended the six-year rule of the hindu nationalist bharatiya janata party -lrb- bjp -rrb- to take power - prompted worries in germany about delhi 's future economic course . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian stockbrokers trade in bombay .
a jittery indian stock market recorded its biggest fall in four years tuesday , amid fears that a hung parliament predicted by pollsters could slow or even halt economic liberalization .
the congress-led coalition headed by prime minister manmohan singh is dependent on the " outside support " of a " left front " dominated by the communist party of india -lrb- marxist -rrb- , causing foreign investors to fear that the new government could be hostile to business and reluctant to continue or accelerate the economic liberalization process begun in the early 1990s . " of course , we were jittery initially when the congress came to power , " eckart von unger , india expert for the federation of german industries -lrb- fdi -rrb- told dw-world .
" the german economy is reliant on exports and thus india 's liberalization process is of crucial importance to us . " unexpected opportunities but those fears have since been largely assuaged . " the new government will largely continue with the economic policies of the former one , so there will be no significant shift in the investment climate , " anuradha chenoy , expert on international relations at delhi 's jawaharlal nehru university , told dw-world .
" the communists realize the need for foreign investment , especially in infrastructure .
they 've indicated that they 're only concerned about how far key sectors like oil and telecom can be opened up .
it 's just a matter of numbers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manmohan singh , left , speaks about sonia gandhi , right , as they announce that he has been named prime minister of india after meeting with the country 's president in new delhi wednesday may 19 , 2004 .
von unger said that manmohan singh , considered the architect of the reform program as finance minister of the then congress government in 1991 , had created unexpected further opportunities for germany . " we 're optimistic that the singh government 's focus , especially on expanding infrastructure in rural india , offers huge chances for german firms , " he said . " lots of room for more " the time may indeed be ripe now , but there 's no denying that german companies have n't exactly seized the chance in recent years to cash in on india 's growing status as a " booming economy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mumbai 's most famous landmark , the gateway of india set against the figures associated with being the world 's second-most populous country and one of the fastest-growing markets - growth rates of 6 to 8 percent a year , a burgeoning 300-million-strong middle class and an estimated 40 million potential consumers for high-quality goods - bilateral trade at around € 5 billion -lrb- $ 6.14 billion -rrb- last year seems a mere trickle . the statistics are just as lean when it comes to german direct investments in india .
investments have been continually falling since 1997 , and reached a record low last year at € 37 million , down from € 51.7 million in 2002 . bernhard steinrücke , executive director of the indo-german chamber of commerce in mumbai , the largest bilateral trade promotion organization in india and the largest german foreign chamber abroad , however pointed out that well-established companies like siemens , krupp and bayer had been in india since the 19th century . " there are also some success stories of medium-sized german companies in india , who have reinvested in the country , " steinrücke told dw-world .
" but , there 's no denying that there 's still lots of room for more . "
steinrücke added that schröder 's visit was more than just symbolic .
" he 's the first european head of state to visit the country .
it underlines the importance that germany attaches to india . " " bad infrastructure and bureaucracy " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a wipro employee works on specialized softwares to provide services to overseas clients at the company in bangalore , india .
experts say that apart from india 's growing reputation as an " outsourcing mecca " and its enviable skills in the it services sector , which have n't escaped the notice of german companies like siemens , sap and bertelsmann , the country still suffers from huge problems which deter investors . " the infrastructure is appalling and bureaucracy a major hurdle , " von unger said .
" the awarding of licenses takes so long that many smaller businesses simply ca n't afford the complicated legal process .
you need a lot of patience . " other trade barriers include corruption , insufficient protection of intellectual property , stiflingly high state influence in industrial sectors and high import levies . others draw obvious parallels to the massive success story next door in china , where german firms exported goods worth a whopping € 18 billion last year . " india 's reform process began some 13 years after china , " christian wagner of the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin told dw-world .
" china simply has a better image .
india is often considered chaotic and unruly .
and , ironically , because it 's a democracy and has a free press , it all gets reported about in the media . " made in germany still works however , despite sluggish german investments and trade volume , there seems to be agreement on both sides that something needs to give . on the upside , experts point that india has a wealth on offer : low labor costs , highly-qualified personnel and the widespread use of english . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder in india during a visit in oct .
2001 chancellor schröder , who last year admitted that " economic ties with india leave much to be desired , " will be accompanied by a 22-member strong economic delegation on wednesday with representatives from lufthansa , allianz , man and fraport .
according to government sources , signings of major contracts are not on the agenda : the visit will be rather aimed at getting to know the new government . a high-ranking science delegation led by german minister for education and research , edelgard buhlman , will also be present . for his part , the enigmatic manmohan singh told news magazine spiegel this week that he was interested in deepening trade ties with germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 05.10.2004 eichel hastens retreat for german firms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many german companies want to leave new york 's stock exchange on a visit to new york , german finance minister hans eichel met with the director of the new york stock exchange .
his mission : to make it easier for german companies to leave the exchange . on his way home from world bank and international monetary fund meetings in washington , german finance minister hans eichel made a special pit stop in new york on monday .
he met with john thain , the director of the new york stock exchange -lrb- nyse -rrb- , and appeal on behalf of german companies for laxer rules governing the process of " de-listing " from the exchange .
the reason is quite simple : while during the boom years of the 1990s german companies raced to list themselves on the nyse , seeing it as a mark of prestige in an increasingly global economy , the effort has only proven worthwhile for a precious few .
for the rest , trading on the nyse has come at a high a price and they are looking to get out .
the trouble is , strict rules and regulations make such a retreat extremely difficult .
boom to bust at the moment , 18 german companies are traded on the nyse and nasdaq , the united states ' technology stock exchange .
deutsche telekom , siemens , sap , deutsche bank and infineon are among them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt stock exchange however , the stateside adventure has proven costly for the majority of them , particularly smaller concerns .
despite the huge initial cost of getting listed - for lawyers , consultants , etc . - most of the german companies have found there 's little interest in their stocks .
for example , the german pharmaceutical company bayer says just 80,000 of its stocks are traded each day , just 2.4 percent of the volume traded on the frankfurt exchange -lrb- photo -rrb- .
perhaps german companies get lost among the nearly 2,700 companies traded on the exchange , or , perhaps most investors interested in german stocks prefer to buy them on the frankfurt exchange , not in new york .
jürgen kurz , a spokesman for dsw , germany 's leading association for private investors , said he strongly suspects it 's the latter .
whatever the reason , the cost of doing business in new york is proving too high for many german companies listed there , and many are now beating the drums of retreat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister hans eichel at a meeting of the american chamber of commerce in germany in april .
" the majority are looking to get out sooner rather than later , " peter wiesner , of the german industry association -lrb- bdi -rrb- told the german newsweekly der spiegel .
their efforts , however , have been frustrated by strict regulations governing the process of de-listing .
eichel met with thain to appeal for laxer rules .
caught up in the red tape aside from worries that an en-masse retreat could send alarm signals off in the heads of investors , german firms looking to leave the nyse have mostly been frustrated by a rule stipulating that foreign companies can only leave the exchange if fewer than 300 permanent residents of the us own the company 's stock .
tracking down stockholders to buy back their shares is both expensive and time consuming .
indeed , german companies may have found us residents none too interested in their stocks , but enough interest existed to put them over the limit .
for example , financial services giant allianz has 555,300 stocks owned by 1,760 americans .
" it needs to be easier for german companies to leave the us exchange , " eichel told train at their meeting , according to a spokesman for eichel .
german firms are hoping his words did not fall on deaf ears . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eichel unveils draft budget for 2005 german finance minister eichel has put the finishing touches to the draft budget for 2005 .

his mission : to make it easier for german companies to leave the exchange . on his way home from world bank and international monetary fund meetings in washington , german finance minister hans eichel made a special pit stop in new york on monday .
he met with john thain , the director of the new york stock exchange -lrb- nyse -rrb- , and appeal on behalf of german companies for laxer rules governing the process of " de-listing " from the exchange .
the reason is quite simple : while during the boom years of the 1990s german companies raced to list themselves on the nyse , seeing it as a mark of prestige in an increasingly global economy , the effort has only proven worthwhile for a precious few .
for the rest , trading on the nyse has come at a high a price and they are looking to get out .
the trouble is , strict rules and regulations make such a retreat extremely difficult .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt stock exchange however , the stateside adventure has proven costly for the majority of them , particularly smaller concerns .
despite the huge initial cost of getting listed - for lawyers , consultants , etc . - most of the german companies have found there 's little interest in their stocks .
for example , the german pharmaceutical company bayer says just 80,000 of its stocks are traded each day , just 2.4 percent of the volume traded on the frankfurt exchange -lrb- photo -rrb- .
perhaps german companies get lost among the nearly 2,700 companies traded on the exchange , or , perhaps most investors interested in german stocks prefer to buy them on the frankfurt exchange , not in new york .
jürgen kurz , a spokesman for dsw , germany 's leading association for private investors , said he strongly suspects it 's the latter .
whatever the reason , the cost of doing business in new york is proving too high for many german companies listed there , and many are now beating the drums of retreat .

" the majority are looking to get out sooner rather than later , " peter wiesner , of the german industry association -lrb- bdi -rrb- told the german newsweekly der spiegel .
their efforts , however , have been frustrated by strict regulations governing the process of de-listing .
eichel met with thain to appeal for laxer rules .
caught up in the red tape aside from worries that an en-masse retreat could send alarm signals off in the heads of investors , german firms looking to leave the nyse have mostly been frustrated by a rule stipulating that foreign companies can only leave the exchange if fewer than 300 permanent residents of the us own the company 's stock .
tracking down stockholders to buy back their shares is both expensive and time consuming .
indeed , german companies may have found us residents none too interested in their stocks , but enough interest existed to put them over the limit .
for example , financial services giant allianz has 555,300 stocks owned by 1,760 americans .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.10.2004 opinion : a matter of prestige for ankara großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's bridge to asia ?
the eu commission is likely to give the go-ahead wednesday for opening talks with ankara about its membership bid .
but it wo n't silence the controversial debate over whether turkey belongs in the eu in the first place . can the european union cope with turkey 's entry ?
the controversial question may be currently raging in europe , but , in theory , it 's already been decided .
at least from brussels ' perspective : ankara has been an official candidate for over four years . in addition , an imminent go-ahead for opening concrete negotiations is likely to set in motion an automatic eu membership process that is going to be hard to stop .
at the most , referendums in eu countries or a failure on turkey ' part to implement further reforms to fulfill membership criteria could put the brakes on it .
but , actual entry into the union is not expected before the next 10-15 years anyway . widespread eu euphoria however , the widespread skepticism against ever-growing ties between turkey and the eu is highly one-sided .
after all , in turkey itself , the vote in favor of joining is as high as 70 percent .
and there is n't any significant political or social force that would openly act against eu membership . of course that does n't mean that such forces do n't exist .
but , as long as brussels does n't disappoint turkish expectations , anti-european forces will hardly dare to reveal themselves for what they are .
eu euphoria among the turkish population is simply too robust for that . eu entry equals social progress the reasons for the euphoria are n't simply economic .
eu membership is a question for prestige for ankara and is often viewed by many ordinary turks as leading to social progress .
they may not be entirely wrong either . from the abolition of the death penalty to a strengthening of women 's rights to television programs in kurdish , the turks are already witnessing numerous improvements that would profit turkish society in the long term .
these reforms could only be pushed through because of brussels ' insistence on sustainable reforms .
nothing has contributed more to turkey 's stabilization in the past years than the prospect of eu entry . a crowning of the " european way " from a turkish perspective , eu membership would amount to a crowning of the " european way " , which the nation 's founder kemal atatürk led his people towards over 80 years ago . atatürk did n't just introduce the separation of state and religion , which is still valid today .

the eu commission is likely to give the go-ahead wednesday for opening talks with ankara about its membership bid .
but it wo n't silence the controversial debate over whether turkey belongs in the eu in the first place . can the european union cope with turkey 's entry ?
the controversial question may be currently raging in europe , but , in theory , it 's already been decided .
at least from brussels ' perspective : ankara has been an official candidate for over four years . in addition , an imminent go-ahead for opening concrete negotiations is likely to set in motion an automatic eu membership process that is going to be hard to stop .
at the most , referendums in eu countries or a failure on turkey ' part to implement further reforms to fulfill membership criteria could put the brakes on it .
but , actual entry into the union is not expected before the next 10-15 years anyway . widespread eu euphoria however , the widespread skepticism against ever-growing ties between turkey and the eu is highly one-sided .
after all , in turkey itself , the vote in favor of joining is as high as 70 percent .
and there is n't any significant political or social force that would openly act against eu membership . of course that does n't mean that such forces do n't exist .
but , as long as brussels does n't disappoint turkish expectations , anti-european forces will hardly dare to reveal themselves for what they are .
eu euphoria among the turkish population is simply too robust for that . eu entry equals social progress the reasons for the euphoria are n't simply economic .
eu membership is a question for prestige for ankara and is often viewed by many ordinary turks as leading to social progress .
they may not be entirely wrong either . from the abolition of the death penalty to a strengthening of women 's rights to television programs in kurdish , the turks are already witnessing numerous improvements that would profit turkish society in the long term .
these reforms could only be pushed through because of brussels ' insistence on sustainable reforms .
nothing has contributed more to turkey 's stabilization in the past years than the prospect of eu entry . a crowning of the " european way " from a turkish perspective , eu membership would amount to a crowning of the " european way " , which the nation 's founder kemal atatürk led his people towards over 80 years ago . atatürk did n't just introduce the separation of state and religion , which is still valid today .
he was also responsible for the fact that turkish women could vote in 1934 at a time when their counterparts in countries such as france and switzerland had to obediently stay at home on election days . this should provide some food for thought for those who today reject turkey as " culturally alien " despite its decades-long membership in nato and the european council . of course , large parts of turkey still remain underdeveloped .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 05.10.2004 eichel hastens retreat for german firms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many german companies want to leave new york 's stock exchange on a visit to new york , german finance minister hans eichel met with the director of the new york stock exchange .
his mission : to make it easier for german companies to leave the exchange . on his way home from world bank and international monetary fund meetings in washington , german finance minister hans eichel made a special pit stop in new york on monday .
he met with john thain , the director of the new york stock exchange -lrb- nyse -rrb- , and appeal on behalf of german companies for laxer rules governing the process of " de-listing " from the exchange .
the reason is quite simple : while during the boom years of the 1990s german companies raced to list themselves on the nyse , seeing it as a mark of prestige in an increasingly global economy , the effort has only proven worthwhile for a precious few .
for the rest , trading on the nyse has come at a high a price and they are looking to get out .
the trouble is , strict rules and regulations make such a retreat extremely difficult .
boom to bust at the moment , 18 german companies are traded on the nyse and nasdaq , the united states ' technology stock exchange .
deutsche telekom , siemens , sap , deutsche bank and infineon are among them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt stock exchange however , the stateside adventure has proven costly for the majority of them , particularly smaller concerns .
despite the huge initial cost of getting listed - for lawyers , consultants , etc . - most of the german companies have found there 's little interest in their stocks .
for example , the german pharmaceutical company bayer says just 80,000 of its stocks are traded each day , just 2.4 percent of the volume traded on the frankfurt exchange -lrb- photo -rrb- .
perhaps german companies get lost among the nearly 2,700 companies traded on the exchange , or , perhaps most investors interested in german stocks prefer to buy them on the frankfurt exchange , not in new york .
jürgen kurz , a spokesman for dsw , germany 's leading association for private investors , said he strongly suspects it 's the latter .
whatever the reason , the cost of doing business in new york is proving too high for many german companies listed there , and many are now beating the drums of retreat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister hans eichel at a meeting of the american chamber of commerce in germany in april .
" the majority are looking to get out sooner rather than later , " peter wiesner , of the german industry association -lrb- bdi -rrb- told the german newsweekly der spiegel .
their efforts , however , have been frustrated by strict regulations governing the process of de-listing .
eichel met with thain to appeal for laxer rules .
caught up in the red tape aside from worries that an en-masse retreat could send alarm signals off in the heads of investors , german firms looking to leave the nyse have mostly been frustrated by a rule stipulating that foreign companies can only leave the exchange if fewer than 300 permanent residents of the us own the company 's stock .
tracking down stockholders to buy back their shares is both expensive and time consuming .
indeed , german companies may have found us residents none too interested in their stocks , but enough interest existed to put them over the limit .
for example , financial services giant allianz has 555,300 stocks owned by 1,760 americans .
" it needs to be easier for german companies to leave the us exchange , " eichel told train at their meeting , according to a spokesman for eichel .
german firms are hoping his words did not fall on deaf ears . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eichel unveils draft budget for 2005 german finance minister eichel has put the finishing touches to the draft budget for 2005 .

intellectual muslim background bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahdaf soueif ´ s place of birth : cairo ahdaf soueif was born in cairo in 1950 , the daughter of an intellectual muslim family .
she studied english literature at egyptian and british universities and served for two years as an instructor at a saudi arabian university .
since 1981 , she has been dividing her time between london and cairo .
soueif 's literary career began in 1983 , when she published her collection of short stories , aischa .
this was followed by the novel in the eye of the sun -lrb- 1992 -rrb- , the short story collection sandpiper -lrb- 1996 -rrb- and her second novel the map of love .
she translated some of her literary works into arabic and in 1996 , she was awarded the cairo book fair award for the best short stories of the year for her collection zimat al-hayat wa qisas ukhra , sandpiper , or literally , the beauty of life and other stories .
egyptian booker prize nominee in 1999 , her novel the map of love was nominated for the acclaimed booker prize .
numerous magazines and newspapers – including the times literary supplement , cosmopolitan , the london review of books and al-ahram weekly – regularly review her work and publish her critical treatises .
soueif 's literary works focus on the portrayal of arab-muslim society and its striving for modernization in a globalized world .
she formulates this objective in the context of a specific understanding of culture , cultural identity and intercultural relationships .
culture as a dynamic concept for her , culture is a dynamic concept which embraces all of a society 's activities in their historical context and thus lends its identity a form which is distinct , yet still able to communicate and learn .
soueif incorporates this understanding into her work by portraying her characters ' experiences both in the various stages of egyptian society 's historical development as well as during their stays in great britain .
in her novel the map of love , soueif describes the political , socio-economic and cultural conditions that dominated egyptian society at the beginning of the 20th century and follows their development through the changing viewpoints , experiences and feelings of the character anna , an englishwoman living in egypt .
through this learning process , we observe the way that anna on the one hand and her egyptian neighbors on the other maintain their respective cultural identities and , at the same time , enter into a conflict-ridden , yet fruitful dialogue .
writing about modern egyptian women soueif uses time and space , fiction and reality in the context of history and politics to paint this picture in different epochs and in different places .
she is helped here by well-founded information and research which challenge the oversimplified , stereotyped portrayal of egyptian women in english literature .
soueif pointed to the positive reception of this process among her readers .
" i think it has already changed misconceptions among my readers judging by the letters i get , " she told qantara.de.
" i do like to play with these preconceptions and twirl them round a bit ; like standing the western concept of the ' harem ' on its head as i do in the map of love by representing the domestic life of a harem . "
the special quality of soueif 's writing style lies in its artistic construction , which is based on a fusion of arab and english settings , characters and manners of speaking , lending a unique aesthetic character to her works .
cultural characteristics of egyptian people – such as arab names , expressions , metaphors , greetings and forms of address – flow seamlessly into her english-language dialogues .
" english is an extremely hospitable language " literary critic polly pattolo wrote that soueif 's literary style consisted of thinking out her dialogues in arabic and writing them in english .
soueif pointed to the literary advantages that this style provides for the english-speaking reader .
" i think this is the base , really , of the sometimes ' different ' english i write , " she said .
" that i need to fashion an english that will express an arab reality . "
in germany , too , both german and arab writers have intensified their efforts to support an intercultural dialogue in recent years .
examples of this trend can be seen in the works of the arab immigrants jusuf naoum , suleman taufiq and rafik schami .

soueif 's literary works focus on the portrayal of arab-muslim society and its striving for modernization in a globalized world .
she formulates this objective in the context of a specific understanding of culture , cultural identity and intercultural relationships .
culture as a dynamic concept for her , culture is a dynamic concept which embraces all of a society 's activities in their historical context and thus lends its identity a form which is distinct , yet still able to communicate and learn .
soueif incorporates this understanding into her work by portraying her characters ' experiences both in the various stages of egyptian society 's historical development as well as during their stays in great britain .
in her novel the map of love , soueif describes the political , socio-economic and cultural conditions that dominated egyptian society at the beginning of the 20th century and follows their development through the changing viewpoints , experiences and feelings of the character anna , an englishwoman living in egypt .
through this learning process , we observe the way that anna on the one hand and her egyptian neighbors on the other maintain their respective cultural identities and , at the same time , enter into a conflict-ridden , yet fruitful dialogue .
writing about modern egyptian women soueif uses time and space , fiction and reality in the context of history and politics to paint this picture in different epochs and in different places .
she is helped here by well-founded information and research which challenge the oversimplified , stereotyped portrayal of egyptian women in english literature .
soueif pointed to the positive reception of this process among her readers .
" i think it has already changed misconceptions among my readers judging by the letters i get , " she told qantara.de.
" i do like to play with these preconceptions and twirl them round a bit ; like standing the western concept of the ' harem ' on its head as i do in the map of love by representing the domestic life of a harem . "
the special quality of soueif 's writing style lies in its artistic construction , which is based on a fusion of arab and english settings , characters and manners of speaking , lending a unique aesthetic character to her works .
cultural characteristics of egyptian people – such as arab names , expressions , metaphors , greetings and forms of address – flow seamlessly into her english-language dialogues .
" english is an extremely hospitable language " literary critic polly pattolo wrote that soueif 's literary style consisted of thinking out her dialogues in arabic and writing them in english .
soueif pointed to the literary advantages that this style provides for the english-speaking reader .
" i think this is the base , really , of the sometimes ' different ' english i write , " she said .
" that i need to fashion an english that will express an arab reality . "
in germany , too , both german and arab writers have intensified their efforts to support an intercultural dialogue in recent years .
examples of this trend can be seen in the works of the arab immigrants jusuf naoum , suleman taufiq and rafik schami .
with the intensive support of german , british and arab authors , these literary products could be developed into a euro-arabic literature .

as a nominee for the booker prize she is among the growing number of authors who are developing a so-called " euro-arab literature . " the egyptian author ahdaf soueif is one of a number of arab authors who emigrated to western europe in the second half of the 20th century and who , from their adopted homes , attempt to describe their encounters with cultural otherness .
they base their narratives in their foreign homes as well as in their countries of origin and , through the themes , content and literary style of their work , they present their characters ' unique experiences in both locations and in the " space in between . "
literature as a beacon for social integration this immigrant literature trend can for instance be observed in germany .
here , arab authors write stories which illustrate the conflict between their own cultural identity and that of the new country and which deal with the inner struggle between the old and the new cultural identities using new literary forms that stem from arab tradition .
in the context of today 's globalized literature , these authors are making an important contribution to the process of observing and comparing cultural differences : they see it as an opportunity to develop an intercultural " euro-arab literature " which can help make a dialogue between the cultures easier and assist in the integration of immigrants into the societies that receive them .

she translated some of her literary works into arabic and in 1996 , she was awarded the cairo book fair award for the best short stories of the year for her collection zimat al-hayat wa qisas ukhra , sandpiper , or literally , the beauty of life and other stories .

" of course , we were jittery initially when the congress came to power , " eckart von unger , india expert for the federation of german industries -lrb- fdi -rrb- told dw-world .

the eu commission is likely to give the go-ahead wednesday for opening talks with ankara about its membership bid .
but it wo n't silence the controversial debate over whether turkey belongs in the eu in the first place . can the european union cope with turkey 's entry ?
the controversial question may be currently raging in europe , but , in theory , it 's already been decided .
at least from brussels ' perspective : ankara has been an official candidate for over four years . in addition , an imminent go-ahead for opening concrete negotiations is likely to set in motion an automatic eu membership process that is going to be hard to stop .
at the most , referendums in eu countries or a failure on turkey ' part to implement further reforms to fulfill membership criteria could put the brakes on it .
but , actual entry into the union is not expected before the next 10-15 years anyway . widespread eu euphoria however , the widespread skepticism against ever-growing ties between turkey and the eu is highly one-sided .
after all , in turkey itself , the vote in favor of joining is as high as 70 percent .
and there is n't any significant political or social force that would openly act against eu membership . of course that does n't mean that such forces do n't exist .
but , as long as brussels does n't disappoint turkish expectations , anti-european forces will hardly dare to reveal themselves for what they are .
eu euphoria among the turkish population is simply too robust for that . eu entry equals social progress the reasons for the euphoria are n't simply economic .
eu membership is a question for prestige for ankara and is often viewed by many ordinary turks as leading to social progress .
they may not be entirely wrong either . from the abolition of the death penalty to a strengthening of women 's rights to television programs in kurdish , the turks are already witnessing numerous improvements that would profit turkish society in the long term .
these reforms could only be pushed through because of brussels ' insistence on sustainable reforms .
nothing has contributed more to turkey 's stabilization in the past years than the prospect of eu entry . a crowning of the " european way " from a turkish perspective , eu membership would amount to a crowning of the " european way " , which the nation 's founder kemal atatürk led his people towards over 80 years ago . atatürk did n't just introduce the separation of state and religion , which is still valid today .
he was also responsible for the fact that turkish women could vote in 1934 at a time when their counterparts in countries such as france and switzerland had to obediently stay at home on election days . this should provide some food for thought for those who today reject turkey as " culturally alien " despite its decades-long membership in nato and the european council . of course , large parts of turkey still remain underdeveloped .
and naturally , there are cultural differences which can not be denied .
despite that , for most turks it 's no contradiction to feel muslim , democrat and european at the same time . the current turkey debate in europe unfortunately raises the impression that one would like to talk them into such a contradiction . rainer sollich -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder hails erdogan as a " great reformer " as turkey looks set to receive official eu blessing to start negotiating membership , prime minister recep tayyip erdogan got a warm reception when he visited germany , turkey 's major ally in its quest for accession .
-lrb- oct .
4 , 2004 -rrb- erdogan : " we have done our homework " this week , the european commission will publish a report expected to give turkey the go ahead to start accession talks .
in an interview with deutsche welle , the turkish premier was convinced this would take place .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 05.10.2004 eichel hastens retreat for german firms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many german companies want to leave new york 's stock exchange on a visit to new york , german finance minister hans eichel met with the director of the new york stock exchange .
his mission : to make it easier for german companies to leave the exchange . on his way home from world bank and international monetary fund meetings in washington , german finance minister hans eichel made a special pit stop in new york on monday .
he met with john thain , the director of the new york stock exchange -lrb- nyse -rrb- , and appeal on behalf of german companies for laxer rules governing the process of " de-listing " from the exchange .
the reason is quite simple : while during the boom years of the 1990s german companies raced to list themselves on the nyse , seeing it as a mark of prestige in an increasingly global economy , the effort has only proven worthwhile for a precious few .
for the rest , trading on the nyse has come at a high a price and they are looking to get out .
the trouble is , strict rules and regulations make such a retreat extremely difficult .
boom to bust at the moment , 18 german companies are traded on the nyse and nasdaq , the united states ' technology stock exchange .
deutsche telekom , siemens , sap , deutsche bank and infineon are among them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt stock exchange however , the stateside adventure has proven costly for the majority of them , particularly smaller concerns .
despite the huge initial cost of getting listed - for lawyers , consultants , etc . - most of the german companies have found there 's little interest in their stocks .
for example , the german pharmaceutical company bayer says just 80,000 of its stocks are traded each day , just 2.4 percent of the volume traded on the frankfurt exchange -lrb- photo -rrb- .
perhaps german companies get lost among the nearly 2,700 companies traded on the exchange , or , perhaps most investors interested in german stocks prefer to buy them on the frankfurt exchange , not in new york .
jürgen kurz , a spokesman for dsw , germany 's leading association for private investors , said he strongly suspects it 's the latter .
whatever the reason , the cost of doing business in new york is proving too high for many german companies listed there , and many are now beating the drums of retreat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister hans eichel at a meeting of the american chamber of commerce in germany in april .
" the majority are looking to get out sooner rather than later , " peter wiesner , of the german industry association -lrb- bdi -rrb- told the german newsweekly der spiegel .
their efforts , however , have been frustrated by strict regulations governing the process of de-listing .
eichel met with thain to appeal for laxer rules .
caught up in the red tape aside from worries that an en-masse retreat could send alarm signals off in the heads of investors , german firms looking to leave the nyse have mostly been frustrated by a rule stipulating that foreign companies can only leave the exchange if fewer than 300 permanent residents of the us own the company 's stock .
tracking down stockholders to buy back their shares is both expensive and time consuming .
indeed , german companies may have found us residents none too interested in their stocks , but enough interest existed to put them over the limit .
for example , financial services giant allianz has 555,300 stocks owned by 1,760 americans .
" it needs to be easier for german companies to leave the us exchange , " eichel told train at their meeting , according to a spokesman for eichel .

cultural ties are thriving and exchange , particularly in scientific and technological fields , has seen a robust increase . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian prime minister manmohan singh , left , talks to german foreign minister joschka fischer at the start of their official talks in new delhi , india , wednesday , july 14 , 2004 .
the two countries have also cooperated closely in past months in pushing for united nations reform and supporting each other 's claims to permanent seats in an expanded security council .
german foreign minister joschka fischer visited delhi in july this year . fear of the communists but , a shock change in india 's political leadership in may this year - when the congress party ended the six-year rule of the hindu nationalist bharatiya janata party -lrb- bjp -rrb- to take power - prompted worries in germany about delhi 's future economic course . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian stockbrokers trade in bombay .
a jittery indian stock market recorded its biggest fall in four years tuesday , amid fears that a hung parliament predicted by pollsters could slow or even halt economic liberalization .
the congress-led coalition headed by prime minister manmohan singh is dependent on the " outside support " of a " left front " dominated by the communist party of india -lrb- marxist -rrb- , causing foreign investors to fear that the new government could be hostile to business and reluctant to continue or accelerate the economic liberalization process begun in the early 1990s . " of course , we were jittery initially when the congress came to power , " eckart von unger , india expert for the federation of german industries -lrb- fdi -rrb- told dw-world .
" the german economy is reliant on exports and thus india 's liberalization process is of crucial importance to us . " unexpected opportunities but those fears have since been largely assuaged . " the new government will largely continue with the economic policies of the former one , so there will be no significant shift in the investment climate , " anuradha chenoy , expert on international relations at delhi 's jawaharlal nehru university , told dw-world .
" the communists realize the need for foreign investment , especially in infrastructure .
they 've indicated that they 're only concerned about how far key sectors like oil and telecom can be opened up .
it 's just a matter of numbers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manmohan singh , left , speaks about sonia gandhi , right , as they announce that he has been named prime minister of india after meeting with the country 's president in new delhi wednesday may 19 , 2004 .
von unger said that manmohan singh , considered the architect of the reform program as finance minister of the then congress government in 1991 , had created unexpected further opportunities for germany . " we 're optimistic that the singh government 's focus , especially on expanding infrastructure in rural india , offers huge chances for german firms , " he said . " lots of room for more " the time may indeed be ripe now , but there 's no denying that german companies have n't exactly seized the chance in recent years to cash in on india 's growing status as a " booming economy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mumbai 's most famous landmark , the gateway of india set against the figures associated with being the world 's second-most populous country and one of the fastest-growing markets - growth rates of 6 to 8 percent a year , a burgeoning 300-million-strong middle class and an estimated 40 million potential consumers for high-quality goods - bilateral trade at around € 5 billion -lrb- $ 6.14 billion -rrb- last year seems a mere trickle . the statistics are just as lean when it comes to german direct investments in india .
investments have been continually falling since 1997 , and reached a record low last year at € 37 million , down from € 51.7 million in 2002 . bernhard steinrücke , executive director of the indo-german chamber of commerce in mumbai , the largest bilateral trade promotion organization in india and the largest german foreign chamber abroad , however pointed out that well-established companies like siemens , krupp and bayer had been in india since the 19th century . " there are also some success stories of medium-sized german companies in india , who have reinvested in the country , " steinrücke told dw-world .
" but , there 's no denying that there 's still lots of room for more . "
steinrücke added that schröder 's visit was more than just symbolic .
" he 's the first european head of state to visit the country .
it underlines the importance that germany attaches to india . " " bad infrastructure and bureaucracy " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a wipro employee works on specialized softwares to provide services to overseas clients at the company in bangalore , india .
experts say that apart from india 's growing reputation as an " outsourcing mecca " and its enviable skills in the it services sector , which have n't escaped the notice of german companies like siemens , sap and bertelsmann , the country still suffers from huge problems which deter investors . " the infrastructure is appalling and bureaucracy a major hurdle , " von unger said .
" the awarding of licenses takes so long that many smaller businesses simply ca n't afford the complicated legal process .
you need a lot of patience . " other trade barriers include corruption , insufficient protection of intellectual property , stiflingly high state influence in industrial sectors and high import levies . others draw obvious parallels to the massive success story next door in china , where german firms exported goods worth a whopping € 18 billion last year . " india 's reform process began some 13 years after china , " christian wagner of the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin told dw-world .
" china simply has a better image .
india is often considered chaotic and unruly .
and , ironically , because it 's a democracy and has a free press , it all gets reported about in the media . " made in germany still works however , despite sluggish german investments and trade volume , there seems to be agreement on both sides that something needs to give . on the upside , experts point that india has a wealth on offer : low labor costs , highly-qualified personnel and the widespread use of english . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder in india during a visit in oct .
2001 chancellor schröder , who last year admitted that " economic ties with india leave much to be desired , " will be accompanied by a 22-member strong economic delegation on wednesday with representatives from lufthansa , allianz , man and fraport .
according to government sources , signings of major contracts are not on the agenda : the visit will be rather aimed at getting to know the new government . a high-ranking science delegation led by german minister for education and research , edelgard buhlman , will also be present . for his part , the enigmatic manmohan singh told news magazine spiegel this week that he was interested in deepening trade ties with germany .

as a nominee for the booker prize she is among the growing number of authors who are developing a so-called " euro-arab literature . " the egyptian author ahdaf soueif is one of a number of arab authors who emigrated to western europe in the second half of the 20th century and who , from their adopted homes , attempt to describe their encounters with cultural otherness .
they base their narratives in their foreign homes as well as in their countries of origin and , through the themes , content and literary style of their work , they present their characters ' unique experiences in both locations and in the " space in between . "
literature as a beacon for social integration this immigrant literature trend can for instance be observed in germany .
here , arab authors write stories which illustrate the conflict between their own cultural identity and that of the new country and which deal with the inner struggle between the old and the new cultural identities using new literary forms that stem from arab tradition .
in the context of today 's globalized literature , these authors are making an important contribution to the process of observing and comparing cultural differences : they see it as an opportunity to develop an intercultural " euro-arab literature " which can help make a dialogue between the cultures easier and assist in the integration of immigrants into the societies that receive them .
intellectual muslim background bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahdaf soueif ´ s place of birth : cairo ahdaf soueif was born in cairo in 1950 , the daughter of an intellectual muslim family .
she studied english literature at egyptian and british universities and served for two years as an instructor at a saudi arabian university .
since 1981 , she has been dividing her time between london and cairo .
soueif 's literary career began in 1983 , when she published her collection of short stories , aischa .
this was followed by the novel in the eye of the sun -lrb- 1992 -rrb- , the short story collection sandpiper -lrb- 1996 -rrb- and her second novel the map of love .
she translated some of her literary works into arabic and in 1996 , she was awarded the cairo book fair award for the best short stories of the year for her collection zimat al-hayat wa qisas ukhra , sandpiper , or literally , the beauty of life and other stories .
egyptian booker prize nominee in 1999 , her novel the map of love was nominated for the acclaimed booker prize .
numerous magazines and newspapers – including the times literary supplement , cosmopolitan , the london review of books and al-ahram weekly – regularly review her work and publish her critical treatises .
soueif 's literary works focus on the portrayal of arab-muslim society and its striving for modernization in a globalized world .
she formulates this objective in the context of a specific understanding of culture , cultural identity and intercultural relationships .
culture as a dynamic concept for her , culture is a dynamic concept which embraces all of a society 's activities in their historical context and thus lends its identity a form which is distinct , yet still able to communicate and learn .
soueif incorporates this understanding into her work by portraying her characters ' experiences both in the various stages of egyptian society 's historical development as well as during their stays in great britain .
in her novel the map of love , soueif describes the political , socio-economic and cultural conditions that dominated egyptian society at the beginning of the 20th century and follows their development through the changing viewpoints , experiences and feelings of the character anna , an englishwoman living in egypt .
through this learning process , we observe the way that anna on the one hand and her egyptian neighbors on the other maintain their respective cultural identities and , at the same time , enter into a conflict-ridden , yet fruitful dialogue .
writing about modern egyptian women soueif uses time and space , fiction and reality in the context of history and politics to paint this picture in different epochs and in different places .
she is helped here by well-founded information and research which challenge the oversimplified , stereotyped portrayal of egyptian women in english literature .
soueif pointed to the positive reception of this process among her readers .
" i think it has already changed misconceptions among my readers judging by the letters i get , " she told qantara.de.
" i do like to play with these preconceptions and twirl them round a bit ; like standing the western concept of the ' harem ' on its head as i do in the map of love by representing the domestic life of a harem . "
the special quality of soueif 's writing style lies in its artistic construction , which is based on a fusion of arab and english settings , characters and manners of speaking , lending a unique aesthetic character to her works .
cultural characteristics of egyptian people – such as arab names , expressions , metaphors , greetings and forms of address – flow seamlessly into her english-language dialogues .
" english is an extremely hospitable language " literary critic polly pattolo wrote that soueif 's literary style consisted of thinking out her dialogues in arabic and writing them in english .
soueif pointed to the literary advantages that this style provides for the english-speaking reader .
" i think this is the base , really , of the sometimes ' different ' english i write , " she said .
" that i need to fashion an english that will express an arab reality . "
in germany , too , both german and arab writers have intensified their efforts to support an intercultural dialogue in recent years .
examples of this trend can be seen in the works of the arab immigrants jusuf naoum , suleman taufiq and rafik schami .
with the intensive support of german , british and arab authors , these literary products could be developed into a euro-arabic literature .
this literary genre could provide a forum for encouraging dialogue between the cultures and accelerating integration into the societies of immigration . yafa shanneik , © qantara.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de frankfurt book fair opens gerhard schröder and the secretary general of the arab league , amre mussa , will open the frankfurt book fair on tuesday .

the rest , the office said , had short-term work contract and residency permits ranging from one to three months . according to the authorities , indian nationals form the largest group among the green card holders , amounting to a fourth of the 17,177 experts .
they are followed by it specialists from romania , russia , poland and china .
the green card program concludes this year . german chancellor gerhard schröder unveiled the initiative in march 2000 at the computer fair cebit in hanover .
the aim was to fill the gap in the german high-tech sector caused by an acute lack of qualified it specialists in the country .
at the time the computer industry was booming and experts estimated around 200,000 qualified personnel would be needed to keep it going . weak demand the first green card was awarded in summer 2000 and the german government was hoping to hand out 20,000 in four years . in the first three years of the program , an estimated 15,000 it-specialists took germany up on its offer .
but the euphoria soon passed .
the technology sector fell on hard times , and that also affected the green card holders .
in a wave of bankruptcies and layoffs , many lost their jobs . the program has also suffered from weak demand , which experts have partly blamed on germany 's sluggish economy , limitations of the green card program , bureaucracy and a divisive debate over the need for a new immigration law . five years maximum in april this year , indonesian-born harianto wijaya who gained fame as germany 's first green card holder , rattled the government when he said he was leaving . though wijaya had a job at a successful software firm , his original green card , which was limited to five years and five years only , had expired .
that meant wijaya , despite his contributions to the germany economy , had to pack his bags . wijaya , who also finished his ph.d. while living in germany , told deutsche welle he wo n't be able to apply the added expertise to the benefit of a germany company . " all you get is five years , " he said with resignation .
" when people like me , work for three years in research , and then realize they 'll have to leave , that hurts a little .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 05.10.2004 eichel hastens retreat for german firms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many german companies want to leave new york 's stock exchange on a visit to new york , german finance minister hans eichel met with the director of the new york stock exchange .
his mission : to make it easier for german companies to leave the exchange . on his way home from world bank and international monetary fund meetings in washington , german finance minister hans eichel made a special pit stop in new york on monday .
he met with john thain , the director of the new york stock exchange -lrb- nyse -rrb- , and appeal on behalf of german companies for laxer rules governing the process of " de-listing " from the exchange .
the reason is quite simple : while during the boom years of the 1990s german companies raced to list themselves on the nyse , seeing it as a mark of prestige in an increasingly global economy , the effort has only proven worthwhile for a precious few .
for the rest , trading on the nyse has come at a high a price and they are looking to get out .
the trouble is , strict rules and regulations make such a retreat extremely difficult .
boom to bust at the moment , 18 german companies are traded on the nyse and nasdaq , the united states ' technology stock exchange .
deutsche telekom , siemens , sap , deutsche bank and infineon are among them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt stock exchange however , the stateside adventure has proven costly for the majority of them , particularly smaller concerns .
despite the huge initial cost of getting listed - for lawyers , consultants , etc . - most of the german companies have found there 's little interest in their stocks .
for example , the german pharmaceutical company bayer says just 80,000 of its stocks are traded each day , just 2.4 percent of the volume traded on the frankfurt exchange -lrb- photo -rrb- .
perhaps german companies get lost among the nearly 2,700 companies traded on the exchange , or , perhaps most investors interested in german stocks prefer to buy them on the frankfurt exchange , not in new york .
jürgen kurz , a spokesman for dsw , germany 's leading association for private investors , said he strongly suspects it 's the latter .
whatever the reason , the cost of doing business in new york is proving too high for many german companies listed there , and many are now beating the drums of retreat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister hans eichel at a meeting of the american chamber of commerce in germany in april .
" the majority are looking to get out sooner rather than later , " peter wiesner , of the german industry association -lrb- bdi -rrb- told the german newsweekly der spiegel .
their efforts , however , have been frustrated by strict regulations governing the process of de-listing .
eichel met with thain to appeal for laxer rules .
caught up in the red tape aside from worries that an en-masse retreat could send alarm signals off in the heads of investors , german firms looking to leave the nyse have mostly been frustrated by a rule stipulating that foreign companies can only leave the exchange if fewer than 300 permanent residents of the us own the company 's stock .
tracking down stockholders to buy back their shares is both expensive and time consuming .
indeed , german companies may have found us residents none too interested in their stocks , but enough interest existed to put them over the limit .
for example , financial services giant allianz has 555,300 stocks owned by 1,760 americans .
" it needs to be easier for german companies to leave the us exchange , " eichel told train at their meeting , according to a spokesman for eichel .

but the euphoria soon passed .
the technology sector fell on hard times , and that also affected the green card holders .

that meant wijaya , despite his contributions to the germany economy , had to pack his bags . wijaya , who also finished his ph.d. while living in germany , told deutsche welle he wo n't be able to apply the added expertise to the benefit of a germany company .

the eu commission is likely to give the go-ahead wednesday for opening talks with ankara about its membership bid .
but it wo n't silence the controversial debate over whether turkey belongs in the eu in the first place . can the european union cope with turkey 's entry ?
the controversial question may be currently raging in europe , but , in theory , it 's already been decided .
at least from brussels ' perspective : ankara has been an official candidate for over four years . in addition , an imminent go-ahead for opening concrete negotiations is likely to set in motion an automatic eu membership process that is going to be hard to stop .
at the most , referendums in eu countries or a failure on turkey ' part to implement further reforms to fulfill membership criteria could put the brakes on it .
but , actual entry into the union is not expected before the next 10-15 years anyway . widespread eu euphoria however , the widespread skepticism against ever-growing ties between turkey and the eu is highly one-sided .
after all , in turkey itself , the vote in favor of joining is as high as 70 percent .
and there is n't any significant political or social force that would openly act against eu membership . of course that does n't mean that such forces do n't exist .
but , as long as brussels does n't disappoint turkish expectations , anti-european forces will hardly dare to reveal themselves for what they are .
eu euphoria among the turkish population is simply too robust for that . eu entry equals social progress the reasons for the euphoria are n't simply economic .
eu membership is a question for prestige for ankara and is often viewed by many ordinary turks as leading to social progress .
they may not be entirely wrong either . from the abolition of the death penalty to a strengthening of women 's rights to television programs in kurdish , the turks are already witnessing numerous improvements that would profit turkish society in the long term .
these reforms could only be pushed through because of brussels ' insistence on sustainable reforms .
nothing has contributed more to turkey 's stabilization in the past years than the prospect of eu entry . a crowning of the " european way " from a turkish perspective , eu membership would amount to a crowning of the " european way " , which the nation 's founder kemal atatürk led his people towards over 80 years ago . atatürk did n't just introduce the separation of state and religion , which is still valid today .
he was also responsible for the fact that turkish women could vote in 1934 at a time when their counterparts in countries such as france and switzerland had to obediently stay at home on election days . this should provide some food for thought for those who today reject turkey as " culturally alien " despite its decades-long membership in nato and the european council . of course , large parts of turkey still remain underdeveloped .
and naturally , there are cultural differences which can not be denied .
despite that , for most turks it 's no contradiction to feel muslim , democrat and european at the same time . the current turkey debate in europe unfortunately raises the impression that one would like to talk them into such a contradiction . rainer sollich -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder hails erdogan as a " great reformer " as turkey looks set to receive official eu blessing to start negotiating membership , prime minister recep tayyip erdogan got a warm reception when he visited germany , turkey 's major ally in its quest for accession .

cultural ties are thriving and exchange , particularly in scientific and technological fields , has seen a robust increase . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian prime minister manmohan singh , left , talks to german foreign minister joschka fischer at the start of their official talks in new delhi , india , wednesday , july 14 , 2004 .
the two countries have also cooperated closely in past months in pushing for united nations reform and supporting each other 's claims to permanent seats in an expanded security council .
german foreign minister joschka fischer visited delhi in july this year . fear of the communists but , a shock change in india 's political leadership in may this year - when the congress party ended the six-year rule of the hindu nationalist bharatiya janata party -lrb- bjp -rrb- to take power - prompted worries in germany about delhi 's future economic course . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian stockbrokers trade in bombay .
a jittery indian stock market recorded its biggest fall in four years tuesday , amid fears that a hung parliament predicted by pollsters could slow or even halt economic liberalization .
the congress-led coalition headed by prime minister manmohan singh is dependent on the " outside support " of a " left front " dominated by the communist party of india -lrb- marxist -rrb- , causing foreign investors to fear that the new government could be hostile to business and reluctant to continue or accelerate the economic liberalization process begun in the early 1990s . " of course , we were jittery initially when the congress came to power , " eckart von unger , india expert for the federation of german industries -lrb- fdi -rrb- told dw-world .
" the german economy is reliant on exports and thus india 's liberalization process is of crucial importance to us . " unexpected opportunities but those fears have since been largely assuaged . " the new government will largely continue with the economic policies of the former one , so there will be no significant shift in the investment climate , " anuradha chenoy , expert on international relations at delhi 's jawaharlal nehru university , told dw-world .
" the communists realize the need for foreign investment , especially in infrastructure .
they 've indicated that they 're only concerned about how far key sectors like oil and telecom can be opened up .
it 's just a matter of numbers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manmohan singh , left , speaks about sonia gandhi , right , as they announce that he has been named prime minister of india after meeting with the country 's president in new delhi wednesday may 19 , 2004 .
von unger said that manmohan singh , considered the architect of the reform program as finance minister of the then congress government in 1991 , had created unexpected further opportunities for germany . " we 're optimistic that the singh government 's focus , especially on expanding infrastructure in rural india , offers huge chances for german firms , " he said . " lots of room for more " the time may indeed be ripe now , but there 's no denying that german companies have n't exactly seized the chance in recent years to cash in on india 's growing status as a " booming economy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mumbai 's most famous landmark , the gateway of india set against the figures associated with being the world 's second-most populous country and one of the fastest-growing markets - growth rates of 6 to 8 percent a year , a burgeoning 300-million-strong middle class and an estimated 40 million potential consumers for high-quality goods - bilateral trade at around € 5 billion -lrb- $ 6.14 billion -rrb- last year seems a mere trickle . the statistics are just as lean when it comes to german direct investments in india .
investments have been continually falling since 1997 , and reached a record low last year at € 37 million , down from € 51.7 million in 2002 . bernhard steinrücke , executive director of the indo-german chamber of commerce in mumbai , the largest bilateral trade promotion organization in india and the largest german foreign chamber abroad , however pointed out that well-established companies like siemens , krupp and bayer had been in india since the 19th century . " there are also some success stories of medium-sized german companies in india , who have reinvested in the country , " steinrücke told dw-world .
" but , there 's no denying that there 's still lots of room for more . "
steinrücke added that schröder 's visit was more than just symbolic .
" he 's the first european head of state to visit the country .
it underlines the importance that germany attaches to india . " " bad infrastructure and bureaucracy " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a wipro employee works on specialized softwares to provide services to overseas clients at the company in bangalore , india .
experts say that apart from india 's growing reputation as an " outsourcing mecca " and its enviable skills in the it services sector , which have n't escaped the notice of german companies like siemens , sap and bertelsmann , the country still suffers from huge problems which deter investors . " the infrastructure is appalling and bureaucracy a major hurdle , " von unger said .
" the awarding of licenses takes so long that many smaller businesses simply ca n't afford the complicated legal process .
you need a lot of patience . " other trade barriers include corruption , insufficient protection of intellectual property , stiflingly high state influence in industrial sectors and high import levies . others draw obvious parallels to the massive success story next door in china , where german firms exported goods worth a whopping € 18 billion last year . " india 's reform process began some 13 years after china , " christian wagner of the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin told dw-world .
" china simply has a better image .
india is often considered chaotic and unruly .
and , ironically , because it 's a democracy and has a free press , it all gets reported about in the media . " made in germany still works however , despite sluggish german investments and trade volume , there seems to be agreement on both sides that something needs to give . on the upside , experts point that india has a wealth on offer : low labor costs , highly-qualified personnel and the widespread use of english . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder in india during a visit in oct .
2001 chancellor schröder , who last year admitted that " economic ties with india leave much to be desired , " will be accompanied by a 22-member strong economic delegation on wednesday with representatives from lufthansa , allianz , man and fraport .
according to government sources , signings of major contracts are not on the agenda : the visit will be rather aimed at getting to know the new government . a high-ranking science delegation led by german minister for education and research , edelgard buhlman , will also be present . for his part , the enigmatic manmohan singh told news magazine spiegel this week that he was interested in deepening trade ties with germany .

cultural ties are thriving and exchange , particularly in scientific and technological fields , has seen a robust increase . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian prime minister manmohan singh , left , talks to german foreign minister joschka fischer at the start of their official talks in new delhi , india , wednesday , july 14 , 2004 .
the two countries have also cooperated closely in past months in pushing for united nations reform and supporting each other 's claims to permanent seats in an expanded security council .
german foreign minister joschka fischer visited delhi in july this year . fear of the communists but , a shock change in india 's political leadership in may this year - when the congress party ended the six-year rule of the hindu nationalist bharatiya janata party -lrb- bjp -rrb- to take power - prompted worries in germany about delhi 's future economic course . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian stockbrokers trade in bombay .
a jittery indian stock market recorded its biggest fall in four years tuesday , amid fears that a hung parliament predicted by pollsters could slow or even halt economic liberalization .
the congress-led coalition headed by prime minister manmohan singh is dependent on the " outside support " of a " left front " dominated by the communist party of india -lrb- marxist -rrb- , causing foreign investors to fear that the new government could be hostile to business and reluctant to continue or accelerate the economic liberalization process begun in the early 1990s . " of course , we were jittery initially when the congress came to power , " eckart von unger , india expert for the federation of german industries -lrb- fdi -rrb- told dw-world .
" the german economy is reliant on exports and thus india 's liberalization process is of crucial importance to us . " unexpected opportunities but those fears have since been largely assuaged . " the new government will largely continue with the economic policies of the former one , so there will be no significant shift in the investment climate , " anuradha chenoy , expert on international relations at delhi 's jawaharlal nehru university , told dw-world .
" the communists realize the need for foreign investment , especially in infrastructure .
they 've indicated that they 're only concerned about how far key sectors like oil and telecom can be opened up .
it 's just a matter of numbers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manmohan singh , left , speaks about sonia gandhi , right , as they announce that he has been named prime minister of india after meeting with the country 's president in new delhi wednesday may 19 , 2004 .
von unger said that manmohan singh , considered the architect of the reform program as finance minister of the then congress government in 1991 , had created unexpected further opportunities for germany . " we 're optimistic that the singh government 's focus , especially on expanding infrastructure in rural india , offers huge chances for german firms , " he said . " lots of room for more " the time may indeed be ripe now , but there 's no denying that german companies have n't exactly seized the chance in recent years to cash in on india 's growing status as a " booming economy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mumbai 's most famous landmark , the gateway of india set against the figures associated with being the world 's second-most populous country and one of the fastest-growing markets - growth rates of 6 to 8 percent a year , a burgeoning 300-million-strong middle class and an estimated 40 million potential consumers for high-quality goods - bilateral trade at around € 5 billion -lrb- $ 6.14 billion -rrb- last year seems a mere trickle . the statistics are just as lean when it comes to german direct investments in india .
investments have been continually falling since 1997 , and reached a record low last year at € 37 million , down from € 51.7 million in 2002 . bernhard steinrücke , executive director of the indo-german chamber of commerce in mumbai , the largest bilateral trade promotion organization in india and the largest german foreign chamber abroad , however pointed out that well-established companies like siemens , krupp and bayer had been in india since the 19th century . " there are also some success stories of medium-sized german companies in india , who have reinvested in the country , " steinrücke told dw-world .
" but , there 's no denying that there 's still lots of room for more . "
steinrücke added that schröder 's visit was more than just symbolic .
" he 's the first european head of state to visit the country .
it underlines the importance that germany attaches to india . " " bad infrastructure and bureaucracy " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a wipro employee works on specialized softwares to provide services to overseas clients at the company in bangalore , india .
experts say that apart from india 's growing reputation as an " outsourcing mecca " and its enviable skills in the it services sector , which have n't escaped the notice of german companies like siemens , sap and bertelsmann , the country still suffers from huge problems which deter investors . " the infrastructure is appalling and bureaucracy a major hurdle , " von unger said .
" the awarding of licenses takes so long that many smaller businesses simply ca n't afford the complicated legal process .
you need a lot of patience . " other trade barriers include corruption , insufficient protection of intellectual property , stiflingly high state influence in industrial sectors and high import levies . others draw obvious parallels to the massive success story next door in china , where german firms exported goods worth a whopping € 18 billion last year . " india 's reform process began some 13 years after china , " christian wagner of the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin told dw-world .
" china simply has a better image .
india is often considered chaotic and unruly .
and , ironically , because it 's a democracy and has a free press , it all gets reported about in the media . " made in germany still works however , despite sluggish german investments and trade volume , there seems to be agreement on both sides that something needs to give . on the upside , experts point that india has a wealth on offer : low labor costs , highly-qualified personnel and the widespread use of english . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder in india during a visit in oct .
2001 chancellor schröder , who last year admitted that " economic ties with india leave much to be desired , " will be accompanied by a 22-member strong economic delegation on wednesday with representatives from lufthansa , allianz , man and fraport .
according to government sources , signings of major contracts are not on the agenda : the visit will be rather aimed at getting to know the new government . a high-ranking science delegation led by german minister for education and research , edelgard buhlman , will also be present . for his part , the enigmatic manmohan singh told news magazine spiegel this week that he was interested in deepening trade ties with germany .

the rest , the office said , had short-term work contract and residency permits ranging from one to three months . according to the authorities , indian nationals form the largest group among the green card holders , amounting to a fourth of the 17,177 experts .
they are followed by it specialists from romania , russia , poland and china .
the green card program concludes this year . german chancellor gerhard schröder unveiled the initiative in march 2000 at the computer fair cebit in hanover .
the aim was to fill the gap in the german high-tech sector caused by an acute lack of qualified it specialists in the country .
at the time the computer industry was booming and experts estimated around 200,000 qualified personnel would be needed to keep it going . weak demand the first green card was awarded in summer 2000 and the german government was hoping to hand out 20,000 in four years . in the first three years of the program , an estimated 15,000 it-specialists took germany up on its offer .
but the euphoria soon passed .
the technology sector fell on hard times , and that also affected the green card holders .
in a wave of bankruptcies and layoffs , many lost their jobs . the program has also suffered from weak demand , which experts have partly blamed on germany 's sluggish economy , limitations of the green card program , bureaucracy and a divisive debate over the need for a new immigration law . five years maximum in april this year , indonesian-born harianto wijaya who gained fame as germany 's first green card holder , rattled the government when he said he was leaving . though wijaya had a job at a successful software firm , his original green card , which was limited to five years and five years only , had expired .
that meant wijaya , despite his contributions to the germany economy , had to pack his bags . wijaya , who also finished his ph.d. while living in germany , told deutsche welle he wo n't be able to apply the added expertise to the benefit of a germany company . " all you get is five years , " he said with resignation .
" when people like me , work for three years in research , and then realize they 'll have to leave , that hurts a little .

the eu commission is likely to give the go-ahead wednesday for opening talks with ankara about its membership bid .
but it wo n't silence the controversial debate over whether turkey belongs in the eu in the first place . can the european union cope with turkey 's entry ?
the controversial question may be currently raging in europe , but , in theory , it 's already been decided .
at least from brussels ' perspective : ankara has been an official candidate for over four years . in addition , an imminent go-ahead for opening concrete negotiations is likely to set in motion an automatic eu membership process that is going to be hard to stop .
at the most , referendums in eu countries or a failure on turkey ' part to implement further reforms to fulfill membership criteria could put the brakes on it .
but , actual entry into the union is not expected before the next 10-15 years anyway . widespread eu euphoria however , the widespread skepticism against ever-growing ties between turkey and the eu is highly one-sided .
after all , in turkey itself , the vote in favor of joining is as high as 70 percent .
and there is n't any significant political or social force that would openly act against eu membership . of course that does n't mean that such forces do n't exist .
but , as long as brussels does n't disappoint turkish expectations , anti-european forces will hardly dare to reveal themselves for what they are .
eu euphoria among the turkish population is simply too robust for that . eu entry equals social progress the reasons for the euphoria are n't simply economic .
eu membership is a question for prestige for ankara and is often viewed by many ordinary turks as leading to social progress .
they may not be entirely wrong either . from the abolition of the death penalty to a strengthening of women 's rights to television programs in kurdish , the turks are already witnessing numerous improvements that would profit turkish society in the long term .
these reforms could only be pushed through because of brussels ' insistence on sustainable reforms .
nothing has contributed more to turkey 's stabilization in the past years than the prospect of eu entry . a crowning of the " european way " from a turkish perspective , eu membership would amount to a crowning of the " european way " , which the nation 's founder kemal atatürk led his people towards over 80 years ago . atatürk did n't just introduce the separation of state and religion , which is still valid today .
he was also responsible for the fact that turkish women could vote in 1934 at a time when their counterparts in countries such as france and switzerland had to obediently stay at home on election days . this should provide some food for thought for those who today reject turkey as " culturally alien " despite its decades-long membership in nato and the european council . of course , large parts of turkey still remain underdeveloped .
and naturally , there are cultural differences which can not be denied .
despite that , for most turks it 's no contradiction to feel muslim , democrat and european at the same time . the current turkey debate in europe unfortunately raises the impression that one would like to talk them into such a contradiction . rainer sollich -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder hails erdogan as a " great reformer " as turkey looks set to receive official eu blessing to start negotiating membership , prime minister recep tayyip erdogan got a warm reception when he visited germany , turkey 's major ally in its quest for accession .

the eu commission is likely to give the go-ahead wednesday for opening talks with ankara about its membership bid .
but it wo n't silence the controversial debate over whether turkey belongs in the eu in the first place . can the european union cope with turkey 's entry ?
the controversial question may be currently raging in europe , but , in theory , it 's already been decided .
at least from brussels ' perspective : ankara has been an official candidate for over four years . in addition , an imminent go-ahead for opening concrete negotiations is likely to set in motion an automatic eu membership process that is going to be hard to stop .
at the most , referendums in eu countries or a failure on turkey ' part to implement further reforms to fulfill membership criteria could put the brakes on it .
but , actual entry into the union is not expected before the next 10-15 years anyway . widespread eu euphoria however , the widespread skepticism against ever-growing ties between turkey and the eu is highly one-sided .
after all , in turkey itself , the vote in favor of joining is as high as 70 percent .
and there is n't any significant political or social force that would openly act against eu membership . of course that does n't mean that such forces do n't exist .
but , as long as brussels does n't disappoint turkish expectations , anti-european forces will hardly dare to reveal themselves for what they are .
eu euphoria among the turkish population is simply too robust for that . eu entry equals social progress the reasons for the euphoria are n't simply economic .
eu membership is a question for prestige for ankara and is often viewed by many ordinary turks as leading to social progress .
they may not be entirely wrong either . from the abolition of the death penalty to a strengthening of women 's rights to television programs in kurdish , the turks are already witnessing numerous improvements that would profit turkish society in the long term .
these reforms could only be pushed through because of brussels ' insistence on sustainable reforms .
nothing has contributed more to turkey 's stabilization in the past years than the prospect of eu entry . a crowning of the " european way " from a turkish perspective , eu membership would amount to a crowning of the " european way " , which the nation 's founder kemal atatürk led his people towards over 80 years ago . atatürk did n't just introduce the separation of state and religion , which is still valid today .
he was also responsible for the fact that turkish women could vote in 1934 at a time when their counterparts in countries such as france and switzerland had to obediently stay at home on election days . this should provide some food for thought for those who today reject turkey as " culturally alien " despite its decades-long membership in nato and the european council . of course , large parts of turkey still remain underdeveloped .

as a nominee for the booker prize she is among the growing number of authors who are developing a so-called " euro-arab literature . " the egyptian author ahdaf soueif is one of a number of arab authors who emigrated to western europe in the second half of the 20th century and who , from their adopted homes , attempt to describe their encounters with cultural otherness .
they base their narratives in their foreign homes as well as in their countries of origin and , through the themes , content and literary style of their work , they present their characters ' unique experiences in both locations and in the " space in between . "
literature as a beacon for social integration this immigrant literature trend can for instance be observed in germany .
here , arab authors write stories which illustrate the conflict between their own cultural identity and that of the new country and which deal with the inner struggle between the old and the new cultural identities using new literary forms that stem from arab tradition .
in the context of today 's globalized literature , these authors are making an important contribution to the process of observing and comparing cultural differences : they see it as an opportunity to develop an intercultural " euro-arab literature " which can help make a dialogue between the cultures easier and assist in the integration of immigrants into the societies that receive them .
intellectual muslim background bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahdaf soueif ´ s place of birth : cairo ahdaf soueif was born in cairo in 1950 , the daughter of an intellectual muslim family .
she studied english literature at egyptian and british universities and served for two years as an instructor at a saudi arabian university .
since 1981 , she has been dividing her time between london and cairo .
soueif 's literary career began in 1983 , when she published her collection of short stories , aischa .
this was followed by the novel in the eye of the sun -lrb- 1992 -rrb- , the short story collection sandpiper -lrb- 1996 -rrb- and her second novel the map of love .
she translated some of her literary works into arabic and in 1996 , she was awarded the cairo book fair award for the best short stories of the year for her collection zimat al-hayat wa qisas ukhra , sandpiper , or literally , the beauty of life and other stories .
egyptian booker prize nominee in 1999 , her novel the map of love was nominated for the acclaimed booker prize .
numerous magazines and newspapers – including the times literary supplement , cosmopolitan , the london review of books and al-ahram weekly – regularly review her work and publish her critical treatises .
soueif 's literary works focus on the portrayal of arab-muslim society and its striving for modernization in a globalized world .
she formulates this objective in the context of a specific understanding of culture , cultural identity and intercultural relationships .
culture as a dynamic concept for her , culture is a dynamic concept which embraces all of a society 's activities in their historical context and thus lends its identity a form which is distinct , yet still able to communicate and learn .
soueif incorporates this understanding into her work by portraying her characters ' experiences both in the various stages of egyptian society 's historical development as well as during their stays in great britain .
in her novel the map of love , soueif describes the political , socio-economic and cultural conditions that dominated egyptian society at the beginning of the 20th century and follows their development through the changing viewpoints , experiences and feelings of the character anna , an englishwoman living in egypt .
through this learning process , we observe the way that anna on the one hand and her egyptian neighbors on the other maintain their respective cultural identities and , at the same time , enter into a conflict-ridden , yet fruitful dialogue .
writing about modern egyptian women soueif uses time and space , fiction and reality in the context of history and politics to paint this picture in different epochs and in different places .
she is helped here by well-founded information and research which challenge the oversimplified , stereotyped portrayal of egyptian women in english literature .
soueif pointed to the positive reception of this process among her readers .
" i think it has already changed misconceptions among my readers judging by the letters i get , " she told qantara.de.
" i do like to play with these preconceptions and twirl them round a bit ; like standing the western concept of the ' harem ' on its head as i do in the map of love by representing the domestic life of a harem . "
the special quality of soueif 's writing style lies in its artistic construction , which is based on a fusion of arab and english settings , characters and manners of speaking , lending a unique aesthetic character to her works .
cultural characteristics of egyptian people – such as arab names , expressions , metaphors , greetings and forms of address – flow seamlessly into her english-language dialogues .
" english is an extremely hospitable language " literary critic polly pattolo wrote that soueif 's literary style consisted of thinking out her dialogues in arabic and writing them in english .
soueif pointed to the literary advantages that this style provides for the english-speaking reader .
" i think this is the base , really , of the sometimes ' different ' english i write , " she said .
" that i need to fashion an english that will express an arab reality . "
in germany , too , both german and arab writers have intensified their efforts to support an intercultural dialogue in recent years .
examples of this trend can be seen in the works of the arab immigrants jusuf naoum , suleman taufiq and rafik schami .
with the intensive support of german , british and arab authors , these literary products could be developed into a euro-arabic literature .

cultural characteristics of egyptian people – such as arab names , expressions , metaphors , greetings and forms of address – flow seamlessly into her english-language dialogues .
" english is an extremely hospitable language " literary critic polly pattolo wrote that soueif 's literary style consisted of thinking out her dialogues in arabic and writing them in english .
soueif pointed to the literary advantages that this style provides for the english-speaking reader .
" i think this is the base , really , of the sometimes ' different ' english i write , " she said .
" that i need to fashion an english that will express an arab reality . "
in germany , too , both german and arab writers have intensified their efforts to support an intercultural dialogue in recent years .
examples of this trend can be seen in the works of the arab immigrants jusuf naoum , suleman taufiq and rafik schami .
with the intensive support of german , british and arab authors , these literary products could be developed into a euro-arabic literature .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 05.10.2004 developing a euro-arab literature großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soueif travels between two worlds ahdaf soueif is an egyptian writer who made it big in great britain .
as a nominee for the booker prize she is among the growing number of authors who are developing a so-called " euro-arab literature . " the egyptian author ahdaf soueif is one of a number of arab authors who emigrated to western europe in the second half of the 20th century and who , from their adopted homes , attempt to describe their encounters with cultural otherness .
they base their narratives in their foreign homes as well as in their countries of origin and , through the themes , content and literary style of their work , they present their characters ' unique experiences in both locations and in the " space in between . "
literature as a beacon for social integration this immigrant literature trend can for instance be observed in germany .
here , arab authors write stories which illustrate the conflict between their own cultural identity and that of the new country and which deal with the inner struggle between the old and the new cultural identities using new literary forms that stem from arab tradition .
in the context of today 's globalized literature , these authors are making an important contribution to the process of observing and comparing cultural differences : they see it as an opportunity to develop an intercultural " euro-arab literature " which can help make a dialogue between the cultures easier and assist in the integration of immigrants into the societies that receive them .
intellectual muslim background bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahdaf soueif ´ s place of birth : cairo ahdaf soueif was born in cairo in 1950 , the daughter of an intellectual muslim family .
she studied english literature at egyptian and british universities and served for two years as an instructor at a saudi arabian university .
since 1981 , she has been dividing her time between london and cairo .
soueif 's literary career began in 1983 , when she published her collection of short stories , aischa .
this was followed by the novel in the eye of the sun -lrb- 1992 -rrb- , the short story collection sandpiper -lrb- 1996 -rrb- and her second novel the map of love .
she translated some of her literary works into arabic and in 1996 , she was awarded the cairo book fair award for the best short stories of the year for her collection zimat al-hayat wa qisas ukhra , sandpiper , or literally , the beauty of life and other stories .
egyptian booker prize nominee in 1999 , her novel the map of love was nominated for the acclaimed booker prize .
numerous magazines and newspapers – including the times literary supplement , cosmopolitan , the london review of books and al-ahram weekly – regularly review her work and publish her critical treatises .
soueif 's literary works focus on the portrayal of arab-muslim society and its striving for modernization in a globalized world .
she formulates this objective in the context of a specific understanding of culture , cultural identity and intercultural relationships .
culture as a dynamic concept for her , culture is a dynamic concept which embraces all of a society 's activities in their historical context and thus lends its identity a form which is distinct , yet still able to communicate and learn .
soueif incorporates this understanding into her work by portraying her characters ' experiences both in the various stages of egyptian society 's historical development as well as during their stays in great britain .
in her novel the map of love , soueif describes the political , socio-economic and cultural conditions that dominated egyptian society at the beginning of the 20th century and follows their development through the changing viewpoints , experiences and feelings of the character anna , an englishwoman living in egypt .
through this learning process , we observe the way that anna on the one hand and her egyptian neighbors on the other maintain their respective cultural identities and , at the same time , enter into a conflict-ridden , yet fruitful dialogue .
writing about modern egyptian women soueif uses time and space , fiction and reality in the context of history and politics to paint this picture in different epochs and in different places .
she is helped here by well-founded information and research which challenge the oversimplified , stereotyped portrayal of egyptian women in english literature .
soueif pointed to the positive reception of this process among her readers .
" i think it has already changed misconceptions among my readers judging by the letters i get , " she told qantara.de.
" i do like to play with these preconceptions and twirl them round a bit ; like standing the western concept of the ' harem ' on its head as i do in the map of love by representing the domestic life of a harem . "
the special quality of soueif 's writing style lies in its artistic construction , which is based on a fusion of arab and english settings , characters and manners of speaking , lending a unique aesthetic character to her works .
cultural characteristics of egyptian people – such as arab names , expressions , metaphors , greetings and forms of address – flow seamlessly into her english-language dialogues .
" english is an extremely hospitable language " literary critic polly pattolo wrote that soueif 's literary style consisted of thinking out her dialogues in arabic and writing them in english .
soueif pointed to the literary advantages that this style provides for the english-speaking reader .
" i think this is the base , really , of the sometimes ' different ' english i write , " she said .
" that i need to fashion an english that will express an arab reality . "
in germany , too , both german and arab writers have intensified their efforts to support an intercultural dialogue in recent years .
examples of this trend can be seen in the works of the arab immigrants jusuf naoum , suleman taufiq and rafik schami .
with the intensive support of german , british and arab authors , these literary products could be developed into a euro-arabic literature .
this literary genre could provide a forum for encouraging dialogue between the cultures and accelerating integration into the societies of immigration . yafa shanneik , © qantara.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de frankfurt book fair opens gerhard schröder and the secretary general of the arab league , amre mussa , will open the frankfurt book fair on tuesday .

cultural ties are thriving and exchange , particularly in scientific and technological fields , has seen a robust increase . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian prime minister manmohan singh , left , talks to german foreign minister joschka fischer at the start of their official talks in new delhi , india , wednesday , july 14 , 2004 .
the two countries have also cooperated closely in past months in pushing for united nations reform and supporting each other 's claims to permanent seats in an expanded security council .
german foreign minister joschka fischer visited delhi in july this year . fear of the communists but , a shock change in india 's political leadership in may this year - when the congress party ended the six-year rule of the hindu nationalist bharatiya janata party -lrb- bjp -rrb- to take power - prompted worries in germany about delhi 's future economic course . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian stockbrokers trade in bombay .
a jittery indian stock market recorded its biggest fall in four years tuesday , amid fears that a hung parliament predicted by pollsters could slow or even halt economic liberalization .
the congress-led coalition headed by prime minister manmohan singh is dependent on the " outside support " of a " left front " dominated by the communist party of india -lrb- marxist -rrb- , causing foreign investors to fear that the new government could be hostile to business and reluctant to continue or accelerate the economic liberalization process begun in the early 1990s . " of course , we were jittery initially when the congress came to power , " eckart von unger , india expert for the federation of german industries -lrb- fdi -rrb- told dw-world .
" the german economy is reliant on exports and thus india 's liberalization process is of crucial importance to us . " unexpected opportunities but those fears have since been largely assuaged . " the new government will largely continue with the economic policies of the former one , so there will be no significant shift in the investment climate , " anuradha chenoy , expert on international relations at delhi 's jawaharlal nehru university , told dw-world .
" the communists realize the need for foreign investment , especially in infrastructure .
they 've indicated that they 're only concerned about how far key sectors like oil and telecom can be opened up .
it 's just a matter of numbers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manmohan singh , left , speaks about sonia gandhi , right , as they announce that he has been named prime minister of india after meeting with the country 's president in new delhi wednesday may 19 , 2004 .
von unger said that manmohan singh , considered the architect of the reform program as finance minister of the then congress government in 1991 , had created unexpected further opportunities for germany . " we 're optimistic that the singh government 's focus , especially on expanding infrastructure in rural india , offers huge chances for german firms , " he said . " lots of room for more " the time may indeed be ripe now , but there 's no denying that german companies have n't exactly seized the chance in recent years to cash in on india 's growing status as a " booming economy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mumbai 's most famous landmark , the gateway of india set against the figures associated with being the world 's second-most populous country and one of the fastest-growing markets - growth rates of 6 to 8 percent a year , a burgeoning 300-million-strong middle class and an estimated 40 million potential consumers for high-quality goods - bilateral trade at around € 5 billion -lrb- $ 6.14 billion -rrb- last year seems a mere trickle . the statistics are just as lean when it comes to german direct investments in india .
investments have been continually falling since 1997 , and reached a record low last year at € 37 million , down from € 51.7 million in 2002 . bernhard steinrücke , executive director of the indo-german chamber of commerce in mumbai , the largest bilateral trade promotion organization in india and the largest german foreign chamber abroad , however pointed out that well-established companies like siemens , krupp and bayer had been in india since the 19th century . " there are also some success stories of medium-sized german companies in india , who have reinvested in the country , " steinrücke told dw-world .
" but , there 's no denying that there 's still lots of room for more . "
steinrücke added that schröder 's visit was more than just symbolic .
" he 's the first european head of state to visit the country .
it underlines the importance that germany attaches to india . " " bad infrastructure and bureaucracy " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a wipro employee works on specialized softwares to provide services to overseas clients at the company in bangalore , india .
experts say that apart from india 's growing reputation as an " outsourcing mecca " and its enviable skills in the it services sector , which have n't escaped the notice of german companies like siemens , sap and bertelsmann , the country still suffers from huge problems which deter investors . " the infrastructure is appalling and bureaucracy a major hurdle , " von unger said .
" the awarding of licenses takes so long that many smaller businesses simply ca n't afford the complicated legal process .
you need a lot of patience . " other trade barriers include corruption , insufficient protection of intellectual property , stiflingly high state influence in industrial sectors and high import levies . others draw obvious parallels to the massive success story next door in china , where german firms exported goods worth a whopping € 18 billion last year . " india 's reform process began some 13 years after china , " christian wagner of the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin told dw-world .
" china simply has a better image .
india is often considered chaotic and unruly .
and , ironically , because it 's a democracy and has a free press , it all gets reported about in the media . " made in germany still works however , despite sluggish german investments and trade volume , there seems to be agreement on both sides that something needs to give . on the upside , experts point that india has a wealth on offer : low labor costs , highly-qualified personnel and the widespread use of english . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder in india during a visit in oct .

according to government sources , signings of major contracts are not on the agenda : the visit will be rather aimed at getting to know the new government . a high-ranking science delegation led by german minister for education and research , edelgard buhlman , will also be present . for his part , the enigmatic manmohan singh told news magazine spiegel this week that he was interested in deepening trade ties with germany .

his mission : to make it easier for german companies to leave the exchange . on his way home from world bank and international monetary fund meetings in washington , german finance minister hans eichel made a special pit stop in new york on monday .
he met with john thain , the director of the new york stock exchange -lrb- nyse -rrb- , and appeal on behalf of german companies for laxer rules governing the process of " de-listing " from the exchange .
the reason is quite simple : while during the boom years of the 1990s german companies raced to list themselves on the nyse , seeing it as a mark of prestige in an increasingly global economy , the effort has only proven worthwhile for a precious few .
for the rest , trading on the nyse has come at a high a price and they are looking to get out .
the trouble is , strict rules and regulations make such a retreat extremely difficult .
boom to bust at the moment , 18 german companies are traded on the nyse and nasdaq , the united states ' technology stock exchange .
deutsche telekom , siemens , sap , deutsche bank and infineon are among them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt stock exchange however , the stateside adventure has proven costly for the majority of them , particularly smaller concerns .
despite the huge initial cost of getting listed - for lawyers , consultants , etc . - most of the german companies have found there 's little interest in their stocks .
for example , the german pharmaceutical company bayer says just 80,000 of its stocks are traded each day , just 2.4 percent of the volume traded on the frankfurt exchange -lrb- photo -rrb- .
perhaps german companies get lost among the nearly 2,700 companies traded on the exchange , or , perhaps most investors interested in german stocks prefer to buy them on the frankfurt exchange , not in new york .
jürgen kurz , a spokesman for dsw , germany 's leading association for private investors , said he strongly suspects it 's the latter .
whatever the reason , the cost of doing business in new york is proving too high for many german companies listed there , and many are now beating the drums of retreat .

" the majority are looking to get out sooner rather than later , " peter wiesner , of the german industry association -lrb- bdi -rrb- told the german newsweekly der spiegel .
their efforts , however , have been frustrated by strict regulations governing the process of de-listing .
eichel met with thain to appeal for laxer rules .
caught up in the red tape aside from worries that an en-masse retreat could send alarm signals off in the heads of investors , german firms looking to leave the nyse have mostly been frustrated by a rule stipulating that foreign companies can only leave the exchange if fewer than 300 permanent residents of the us own the company 's stock .
tracking down stockholders to buy back their shares is both expensive and time consuming .
indeed , german companies may have found us residents none too interested in their stocks , but enough interest existed to put them over the limit .
for example , financial services giant allianz has 555,300 stocks owned by 1,760 americans .

despite the huge initial cost of getting listed - for lawyers , consultants , etc . - most of the german companies have found there 's little interest in their stocks .
for example , the german pharmaceutical company bayer says just 80,000 of its stocks are traded each day , just 2.4 percent of the volume traded on the frankfurt exchange -lrb- photo -rrb- .
perhaps german companies get lost among the nearly 2,700 companies traded on the exchange , or , perhaps most investors interested in german stocks prefer to buy them on the frankfurt exchange , not in new york .
jürgen kurz , a spokesman for dsw , germany 's leading association for private investors , said he strongly suspects it 's the latter .
whatever the reason , the cost of doing business in new york is proving too high for many german companies listed there , and many are now beating the drums of retreat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister hans eichel at a meeting of the american chamber of commerce in germany in april .
" the majority are looking to get out sooner rather than later , " peter wiesner , of the german industry association -lrb- bdi -rrb- told the german newsweekly der spiegel .
their efforts , however , have been frustrated by strict regulations governing the process of de-listing .
eichel met with thain to appeal for laxer rules .
caught up in the red tape aside from worries that an en-masse retreat could send alarm signals off in the heads of investors , german firms looking to leave the nyse have mostly been frustrated by a rule stipulating that foreign companies can only leave the exchange if fewer than 300 permanent residents of the us own the company 's stock .
tracking down stockholders to buy back their shares is both expensive and time consuming .
indeed , german companies may have found us residents none too interested in their stocks , but enough interest existed to put them over the limit .
for example , financial services giant allianz has 555,300 stocks owned by 1,760 americans .
" it needs to be easier for german companies to leave the us exchange , " eichel told train at their meeting , according to a spokesman for eichel .

the rest , the office said , had short-term work contract and residency permits ranging from one to three months . according to the authorities , indian nationals form the largest group among the green card holders , amounting to a fourth of the 17,177 experts .
they are followed by it specialists from romania , russia , poland and china .
the green card program concludes this year . german chancellor gerhard schröder unveiled the initiative in march 2000 at the computer fair cebit in hanover .
the aim was to fill the gap in the german high-tech sector caused by an acute lack of qualified it specialists in the country .
at the time the computer industry was booming and experts estimated around 200,000 qualified personnel would be needed to keep it going . weak demand the first green card was awarded in summer 2000 and the german government was hoping to hand out 20,000 in four years . in the first three years of the program , an estimated 15,000 it-specialists took germany up on its offer .
but the euphoria soon passed .
the technology sector fell on hard times , and that also affected the green card holders .
in a wave of bankruptcies and layoffs , many lost their jobs . the program has also suffered from weak demand , which experts have partly blamed on germany 's sluggish economy , limitations of the green card program , bureaucracy and a divisive debate over the need for a new immigration law . five years maximum in april this year , indonesian-born harianto wijaya who gained fame as germany 's first green card holder , rattled the government when he said he was leaving . though wijaya had a job at a successful software firm , his original green card , which was limited to five years and five years only , had expired .
that meant wijaya , despite his contributions to the germany economy , had to pack his bags . wijaya , who also finished his ph.d. while living in germany , told deutsche welle he wo n't be able to apply the added expertise to the benefit of a germany company . " all you get is five years , " he said with resignation .
" when people like me , work for three years in research , and then realize they 'll have to leave , that hurts a little .

as a nominee for the booker prize she is among the growing number of authors who are developing a so-called " euro-arab literature . " the egyptian author ahdaf soueif is one of a number of arab authors who emigrated to western europe in the second half of the 20th century and who , from their adopted homes , attempt to describe their encounters with cultural otherness .
they base their narratives in their foreign homes as well as in their countries of origin and , through the themes , content and literary style of their work , they present their characters ' unique experiences in both locations and in the " space in between . "
literature as a beacon for social integration this immigrant literature trend can for instance be observed in germany .
here , arab authors write stories which illustrate the conflict between their own cultural identity and that of the new country and which deal with the inner struggle between the old and the new cultural identities using new literary forms that stem from arab tradition .
in the context of today 's globalized literature , these authors are making an important contribution to the process of observing and comparing cultural differences : they see it as an opportunity to develop an intercultural " euro-arab literature " which can help make a dialogue between the cultures easier and assist in the integration of immigrants into the societies that receive them .
intellectual muslim background bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahdaf soueif ´ s place of birth : cairo ahdaf soueif was born in cairo in 1950 , the daughter of an intellectual muslim family .
she studied english literature at egyptian and british universities and served for two years as an instructor at a saudi arabian university .
since 1981 , she has been dividing her time between london and cairo .
soueif 's literary career began in 1983 , when she published her collection of short stories , aischa .
this was followed by the novel in the eye of the sun -lrb- 1992 -rrb- , the short story collection sandpiper -lrb- 1996 -rrb- and her second novel the map of love .
she translated some of her literary works into arabic and in 1996 , she was awarded the cairo book fair award for the best short stories of the year for her collection zimat al-hayat wa qisas ukhra , sandpiper , or literally , the beauty of life and other stories .
egyptian booker prize nominee in 1999 , her novel the map of love was nominated for the acclaimed booker prize .
numerous magazines and newspapers – including the times literary supplement , cosmopolitan , the london review of books and al-ahram weekly – regularly review her work and publish her critical treatises .
soueif 's literary works focus on the portrayal of arab-muslim society and its striving for modernization in a globalized world .
she formulates this objective in the context of a specific understanding of culture , cultural identity and intercultural relationships .
culture as a dynamic concept for her , culture is a dynamic concept which embraces all of a society 's activities in their historical context and thus lends its identity a form which is distinct , yet still able to communicate and learn .
soueif incorporates this understanding into her work by portraying her characters ' experiences both in the various stages of egyptian society 's historical development as well as during their stays in great britain .
in her novel the map of love , soueif describes the political , socio-economic and cultural conditions that dominated egyptian society at the beginning of the 20th century and follows their development through the changing viewpoints , experiences and feelings of the character anna , an englishwoman living in egypt .
through this learning process , we observe the way that anna on the one hand and her egyptian neighbors on the other maintain their respective cultural identities and , at the same time , enter into a conflict-ridden , yet fruitful dialogue .
writing about modern egyptian women soueif uses time and space , fiction and reality in the context of history and politics to paint this picture in different epochs and in different places .
she is helped here by well-founded information and research which challenge the oversimplified , stereotyped portrayal of egyptian women in english literature .
soueif pointed to the positive reception of this process among her readers .
" i think it has already changed misconceptions among my readers judging by the letters i get , " she told qantara.de.
" i do like to play with these preconceptions and twirl them round a bit ; like standing the western concept of the ' harem ' on its head as i do in the map of love by representing the domestic life of a harem . "
the special quality of soueif 's writing style lies in its artistic construction , which is based on a fusion of arab and english settings , characters and manners of speaking , lending a unique aesthetic character to her works .
cultural characteristics of egyptian people – such as arab names , expressions , metaphors , greetings and forms of address – flow seamlessly into her english-language dialogues .
" english is an extremely hospitable language " literary critic polly pattolo wrote that soueif 's literary style consisted of thinking out her dialogues in arabic and writing them in english .
soueif pointed to the literary advantages that this style provides for the english-speaking reader .
" i think this is the base , really , of the sometimes ' different ' english i write , " she said .
" that i need to fashion an english that will express an arab reality . "
in germany , too , both german and arab writers have intensified their efforts to support an intercultural dialogue in recent years .
examples of this trend can be seen in the works of the arab immigrants jusuf naoum , suleman taufiq and rafik schami .
with the intensive support of german , british and arab authors , these literary products could be developed into a euro-arabic literature .

through this learning process , we observe the way that anna on the one hand and her egyptian neighbors on the other maintain their respective cultural identities and , at the same time , enter into a conflict-ridden , yet fruitful dialogue .
writing about modern egyptian women soueif uses time and space , fiction and reality in the context of history and politics to paint this picture in different epochs and in different places .
she is helped here by well-founded information and research which challenge the oversimplified , stereotyped portrayal of egyptian women in english literature .
soueif pointed to the positive reception of this process among her readers .
" i think it has already changed misconceptions among my readers judging by the letters i get , " she told qantara.de.
" i do like to play with these preconceptions and twirl them round a bit ; like standing the western concept of the ' harem ' on its head as i do in the map of love by representing the domestic life of a harem . "
the special quality of soueif 's writing style lies in its artistic construction , which is based on a fusion of arab and english settings , characters and manners of speaking , lending a unique aesthetic character to her works .
cultural characteristics of egyptian people – such as arab names , expressions , metaphors , greetings and forms of address – flow seamlessly into her english-language dialogues .
" english is an extremely hospitable language " literary critic polly pattolo wrote that soueif 's literary style consisted of thinking out her dialogues in arabic and writing them in english .
soueif pointed to the literary advantages that this style provides for the english-speaking reader .
" i think this is the base , really , of the sometimes ' different ' english i write , " she said .
" that i need to fashion an english that will express an arab reality . "
in germany , too , both german and arab writers have intensified their efforts to support an intercultural dialogue in recent years .
examples of this trend can be seen in the works of the arab immigrants jusuf naoum , suleman taufiq and rafik schami .

as a nominee for the booker prize she is among the growing number of authors who are developing a so-called " euro-arab literature . " the egyptian author ahdaf soueif is one of a number of arab authors who emigrated to western europe in the second half of the 20th century and who , from their adopted homes , attempt to describe their encounters with cultural otherness .
they base their narratives in their foreign homes as well as in their countries of origin and , through the themes , content and literary style of their work , they present their characters ' unique experiences in both locations and in the " space in between . "
literature as a beacon for social integration this immigrant literature trend can for instance be observed in germany .
here , arab authors write stories which illustrate the conflict between their own cultural identity and that of the new country and which deal with the inner struggle between the old and the new cultural identities using new literary forms that stem from arab tradition .
in the context of today 's globalized literature , these authors are making an important contribution to the process of observing and comparing cultural differences : they see it as an opportunity to develop an intercultural " euro-arab literature " which can help make a dialogue between the cultures easier and assist in the integration of immigrants into the societies that receive them .
intellectual muslim background bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahdaf soueif ´ s place of birth : cairo ahdaf soueif was born in cairo in 1950 , the daughter of an intellectual muslim family .
she studied english literature at egyptian and british universities and served for two years as an instructor at a saudi arabian university .
since 1981 , she has been dividing her time between london and cairo .
soueif 's literary career began in 1983 , when she published her collection of short stories , aischa .
this was followed by the novel in the eye of the sun -lrb- 1992 -rrb- , the short story collection sandpiper -lrb- 1996 -rrb- and her second novel the map of love .
she translated some of her literary works into arabic and in 1996 , she was awarded the cairo book fair award for the best short stories of the year for her collection zimat al-hayat wa qisas ukhra , sandpiper , or literally , the beauty of life and other stories .
egyptian booker prize nominee in 1999 , her novel the map of love was nominated for the acclaimed booker prize .
numerous magazines and newspapers – including the times literary supplement , cosmopolitan , the london review of books and al-ahram weekly – regularly review her work and publish her critical treatises .
soueif 's literary works focus on the portrayal of arab-muslim society and its striving for modernization in a globalized world .
she formulates this objective in the context of a specific understanding of culture , cultural identity and intercultural relationships .
culture as a dynamic concept for her , culture is a dynamic concept which embraces all of a society 's activities in their historical context and thus lends its identity a form which is distinct , yet still able to communicate and learn .
soueif incorporates this understanding into her work by portraying her characters ' experiences both in the various stages of egyptian society 's historical development as well as during their stays in great britain .
in her novel the map of love , soueif describes the political , socio-economic and cultural conditions that dominated egyptian society at the beginning of the 20th century and follows their development through the changing viewpoints , experiences and feelings of the character anna , an englishwoman living in egypt .

the rest , the office said , had short-term work contract and residency permits ranging from one to three months . according to the authorities , indian nationals form the largest group among the green card holders , amounting to a fourth of the 17,177 experts .
they are followed by it specialists from romania , russia , poland and china .
the green card program concludes this year . german chancellor gerhard schröder unveiled the initiative in march 2000 at the computer fair cebit in hanover .
the aim was to fill the gap in the german high-tech sector caused by an acute lack of qualified it specialists in the country .
at the time the computer industry was booming and experts estimated around 200,000 qualified personnel would be needed to keep it going . weak demand the first green card was awarded in summer 2000 and the german government was hoping to hand out 20,000 in four years . in the first three years of the program , an estimated 15,000 it-specialists took germany up on its offer .
but the euphoria soon passed .
the technology sector fell on hard times , and that also affected the green card holders .
in a wave of bankruptcies and layoffs , many lost their jobs . the program has also suffered from weak demand , which experts have partly blamed on germany 's sluggish economy , limitations of the green card program , bureaucracy and a divisive debate over the need for a new immigration law . five years maximum in april this year , indonesian-born harianto wijaya who gained fame as germany 's first green card holder , rattled the government when he said he was leaving . though wijaya had a job at a successful software firm , his original green card , which was limited to five years and five years only , had expired .
that meant wijaya , despite his contributions to the germany economy , had to pack his bags . wijaya , who also finished his ph.d. while living in germany , told deutsche welle he wo n't be able to apply the added expertise to the benefit of a germany company . " all you get is five years , " he said with resignation .
" when people like me , work for three years in research , and then realize they 'll have to leave , that hurts a little . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german experts warn of alarming lack of skilled workers german business leaders have largely welcomed the political breakthrough on immigration , but warn the government has to move quickly to translate words into action as germany faces a dramatic shortage of skilled labor .
-lrb- may 29 , 2004 -rrb- not all that 's " green " glitters three years ago , indonesian-born harianto wijaya was the first to come to germany with a special green card for highly-skilled computer experts .
now - disappointed - he 's leaving .
deutsche welle spoke with him .
-lrb- april 7 , 2004 -rrb- german greencarders live life in limbo the german government 's green card program brought thousands of foreign it experts to work in the country for five-year stints , but for many their status remains dubious and life in limbo is not getting easier .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 05.10.2004 eichel hastens retreat for german firms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many german companies want to leave new york 's stock exchange on a visit to new york , german finance minister hans eichel met with the director of the new york stock exchange .
his mission : to make it easier for german companies to leave the exchange . on his way home from world bank and international monetary fund meetings in washington , german finance minister hans eichel made a special pit stop in new york on monday .
he met with john thain , the director of the new york stock exchange -lrb- nyse -rrb- , and appeal on behalf of german companies for laxer rules governing the process of " de-listing " from the exchange .
the reason is quite simple : while during the boom years of the 1990s german companies raced to list themselves on the nyse , seeing it as a mark of prestige in an increasingly global economy , the effort has only proven worthwhile for a precious few .
for the rest , trading on the nyse has come at a high a price and they are looking to get out .
the trouble is , strict rules and regulations make such a retreat extremely difficult .
boom to bust at the moment , 18 german companies are traded on the nyse and nasdaq , the united states ' technology stock exchange .
deutsche telekom , siemens , sap , deutsche bank and infineon are among them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt stock exchange however , the stateside adventure has proven costly for the majority of them , particularly smaller concerns .
despite the huge initial cost of getting listed - for lawyers , consultants , etc . - most of the german companies have found there 's little interest in their stocks .
for example , the german pharmaceutical company bayer says just 80,000 of its stocks are traded each day , just 2.4 percent of the volume traded on the frankfurt exchange -lrb- photo -rrb- .
perhaps german companies get lost among the nearly 2,700 companies traded on the exchange , or , perhaps most investors interested in german stocks prefer to buy them on the frankfurt exchange , not in new york .
jürgen kurz , a spokesman for dsw , germany 's leading association for private investors , said he strongly suspects it 's the latter .
whatever the reason , the cost of doing business in new york is proving too high for many german companies listed there , and many are now beating the drums of retreat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister hans eichel at a meeting of the american chamber of commerce in germany in april .
" the majority are looking to get out sooner rather than later , " peter wiesner , of the german industry association -lrb- bdi -rrb- told the german newsweekly der spiegel .
their efforts , however , have been frustrated by strict regulations governing the process of de-listing .
eichel met with thain to appeal for laxer rules .
caught up in the red tape aside from worries that an en-masse retreat could send alarm signals off in the heads of investors , german firms looking to leave the nyse have mostly been frustrated by a rule stipulating that foreign companies can only leave the exchange if fewer than 300 permanent residents of the us own the company 's stock .
tracking down stockholders to buy back their shares is both expensive and time consuming .
indeed , german companies may have found us residents none too interested in their stocks , but enough interest existed to put them over the limit .
for example , financial services giant allianz has 555,300 stocks owned by 1,760 americans .
" it needs to be easier for german companies to leave the us exchange , " eichel told train at their meeting , according to a spokesman for eichel .

his mission : to make it easier for german companies to leave the exchange . on his way home from world bank and international monetary fund meetings in washington , german finance minister hans eichel made a special pit stop in new york on monday .
he met with john thain , the director of the new york stock exchange -lrb- nyse -rrb- , and appeal on behalf of german companies for laxer rules governing the process of " de-listing " from the exchange .
the reason is quite simple : while during the boom years of the 1990s german companies raced to list themselves on the nyse , seeing it as a mark of prestige in an increasingly global economy , the effort has only proven worthwhile for a precious few .
for the rest , trading on the nyse has come at a high a price and they are looking to get out .
the trouble is , strict rules and regulations make such a retreat extremely difficult .
boom to bust at the moment , 18 german companies are traded on the nyse and nasdaq , the united states ' technology stock exchange .
deutsche telekom , siemens , sap , deutsche bank and infineon are among them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt stock exchange however , the stateside adventure has proven costly for the majority of them , particularly smaller concerns .
despite the huge initial cost of getting listed - for lawyers , consultants , etc . - most of the german companies have found there 's little interest in their stocks .
for example , the german pharmaceutical company bayer says just 80,000 of its stocks are traded each day , just 2.4 percent of the volume traded on the frankfurt exchange -lrb- photo -rrb- .
perhaps german companies get lost among the nearly 2,700 companies traded on the exchange , or , perhaps most investors interested in german stocks prefer to buy them on the frankfurt exchange , not in new york .
jürgen kurz , a spokesman for dsw , germany 's leading association for private investors , said he strongly suspects it 's the latter .
whatever the reason , the cost of doing business in new york is proving too high for many german companies listed there , and many are now beating the drums of retreat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister hans eichel at a meeting of the american chamber of commerce in germany in april .
" the majority are looking to get out sooner rather than later , " peter wiesner , of the german industry association -lrb- bdi -rrb- told the german newsweekly der spiegel .
their efforts , however , have been frustrated by strict regulations governing the process of de-listing .
eichel met with thain to appeal for laxer rules .
caught up in the red tape aside from worries that an en-masse retreat could send alarm signals off in the heads of investors , german firms looking to leave the nyse have mostly been frustrated by a rule stipulating that foreign companies can only leave the exchange if fewer than 300 permanent residents of the us own the company 's stock .
tracking down stockholders to buy back their shares is both expensive and time consuming .
indeed , german companies may have found us residents none too interested in their stocks , but enough interest existed to put them over the limit .
for example , financial services giant allianz has 555,300 stocks owned by 1,760 americans .
" it needs to be easier for german companies to leave the us exchange , " eichel told train at their meeting , according to a spokesman for eichel .

the rest , the office said , had short-term work contract and residency permits ranging from one to three months . according to the authorities , indian nationals form the largest group among the green card holders , amounting to a fourth of the 17,177 experts .
they are followed by it specialists from romania , russia , poland and china .
the green card program concludes this year . german chancellor gerhard schröder unveiled the initiative in march 2000 at the computer fair cebit in hanover .
the aim was to fill the gap in the german high-tech sector caused by an acute lack of qualified it specialists in the country .
at the time the computer industry was booming and experts estimated around 200,000 qualified personnel would be needed to keep it going . weak demand the first green card was awarded in summer 2000 and the german government was hoping to hand out 20,000 in four years . in the first three years of the program , an estimated 15,000 it-specialists took germany up on its offer .
but the euphoria soon passed .
the technology sector fell on hard times , and that also affected the green card holders .
in a wave of bankruptcies and layoffs , many lost their jobs . the program has also suffered from weak demand , which experts have partly blamed on germany 's sluggish economy , limitations of the green card program , bureaucracy and a divisive debate over the need for a new immigration law . five years maximum in april this year , indonesian-born harianto wijaya who gained fame as germany 's first green card holder , rattled the government when he said he was leaving . though wijaya had a job at a successful software firm , his original green card , which was limited to five years and five years only , had expired .
that meant wijaya , despite his contributions to the germany economy , had to pack his bags . wijaya , who also finished his ph.d. while living in germany , told deutsche welle he wo n't be able to apply the added expertise to the benefit of a germany company . " all you get is five years , " he said with resignation .
" when people like me , work for three years in research , and then realize they 'll have to leave , that hurts a little . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german experts warn of alarming lack of skilled workers german business leaders have largely welcomed the political breakthrough on immigration , but warn the government has to move quickly to translate words into action as germany faces a dramatic shortage of skilled labor .
-lrb- may 29 , 2004 -rrb- not all that 's " green " glitters three years ago , indonesian-born harianto wijaya was the first to come to germany with a special green card for highly-skilled computer experts .
now - disappointed - he 's leaving .
deutsche welle spoke with him .
-lrb- april 7 , 2004 -rrb- german greencarders live life in limbo the german government 's green card program brought thousands of foreign it experts to work in the country for five-year stints , but for many their status remains dubious and life in limbo is not getting easier .

the eu commission is likely to give the go-ahead wednesday for opening talks with ankara about its membership bid .
but it wo n't silence the controversial debate over whether turkey belongs in the eu in the first place . can the european union cope with turkey 's entry ?
the controversial question may be currently raging in europe , but , in theory , it 's already been decided .
at least from brussels ' perspective : ankara has been an official candidate for over four years . in addition , an imminent go-ahead for opening concrete negotiations is likely to set in motion an automatic eu membership process that is going to be hard to stop .
at the most , referendums in eu countries or a failure on turkey ' part to implement further reforms to fulfill membership criteria could put the brakes on it .
but , actual entry into the union is not expected before the next 10-15 years anyway . widespread eu euphoria however , the widespread skepticism against ever-growing ties between turkey and the eu is highly one-sided .
after all , in turkey itself , the vote in favor of joining is as high as 70 percent .
and there is n't any significant political or social force that would openly act against eu membership . of course that does n't mean that such forces do n't exist .
but , as long as brussels does n't disappoint turkish expectations , anti-european forces will hardly dare to reveal themselves for what they are .
eu euphoria among the turkish population is simply too robust for that . eu entry equals social progress the reasons for the euphoria are n't simply economic .
eu membership is a question for prestige for ankara and is often viewed by many ordinary turks as leading to social progress .
they may not be entirely wrong either . from the abolition of the death penalty to a strengthening of women 's rights to television programs in kurdish , the turks are already witnessing numerous improvements that would profit turkish society in the long term .
these reforms could only be pushed through because of brussels ' insistence on sustainable reforms .
nothing has contributed more to turkey 's stabilization in the past years than the prospect of eu entry . a crowning of the " european way " from a turkish perspective , eu membership would amount to a crowning of the " european way " , which the nation 's founder kemal atatürk led his people towards over 80 years ago . atatürk did n't just introduce the separation of state and religion , which is still valid today .
he was also responsible for the fact that turkish women could vote in 1934 at a time when their counterparts in countries such as france and switzerland had to obediently stay at home on election days . this should provide some food for thought for those who today reject turkey as " culturally alien " despite its decades-long membership in nato and the european council . of course , large parts of turkey still remain underdeveloped .
and naturally , there are cultural differences which can not be denied .
despite that , for most turks it 's no contradiction to feel muslim , democrat and european at the same time . the current turkey debate in europe unfortunately raises the impression that one would like to talk them into such a contradiction . rainer sollich -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder hails erdogan as a " great reformer " as turkey looks set to receive official eu blessing to start negotiating membership , prime minister recep tayyip erdogan got a warm reception when he visited germany , turkey 's major ally in its quest for accession .

as a nominee for the booker prize she is among the growing number of authors who are developing a so-called " euro-arab literature . " the egyptian author ahdaf soueif is one of a number of arab authors who emigrated to western europe in the second half of the 20th century and who , from their adopted homes , attempt to describe their encounters with cultural otherness .
they base their narratives in their foreign homes as well as in their countries of origin and , through the themes , content and literary style of their work , they present their characters ' unique experiences in both locations and in the " space in between . "
literature as a beacon for social integration this immigrant literature trend can for instance be observed in germany .
here , arab authors write stories which illustrate the conflict between their own cultural identity and that of the new country and which deal with the inner struggle between the old and the new cultural identities using new literary forms that stem from arab tradition .
in the context of today 's globalized literature , these authors are making an important contribution to the process of observing and comparing cultural differences : they see it as an opportunity to develop an intercultural " euro-arab literature " which can help make a dialogue between the cultures easier and assist in the integration of immigrants into the societies that receive them .
intellectual muslim background bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahdaf soueif ´ s place of birth : cairo ahdaf soueif was born in cairo in 1950 , the daughter of an intellectual muslim family .
she studied english literature at egyptian and british universities and served for two years as an instructor at a saudi arabian university .
since 1981 , she has been dividing her time between london and cairo .
soueif 's literary career began in 1983 , when she published her collection of short stories , aischa .
this was followed by the novel in the eye of the sun -lrb- 1992 -rrb- , the short story collection sandpiper -lrb- 1996 -rrb- and her second novel the map of love .
she translated some of her literary works into arabic and in 1996 , she was awarded the cairo book fair award for the best short stories of the year for her collection zimat al-hayat wa qisas ukhra , sandpiper , or literally , the beauty of life and other stories .
egyptian booker prize nominee in 1999 , her novel the map of love was nominated for the acclaimed booker prize .
numerous magazines and newspapers – including the times literary supplement , cosmopolitan , the london review of books and al-ahram weekly – regularly review her work and publish her critical treatises .
soueif 's literary works focus on the portrayal of arab-muslim society and its striving for modernization in a globalized world .
she formulates this objective in the context of a specific understanding of culture , cultural identity and intercultural relationships .
culture as a dynamic concept for her , culture is a dynamic concept which embraces all of a society 's activities in their historical context and thus lends its identity a form which is distinct , yet still able to communicate and learn .
soueif incorporates this understanding into her work by portraying her characters ' experiences both in the various stages of egyptian society 's historical development as well as during their stays in great britain .
in her novel the map of love , soueif describes the political , socio-economic and cultural conditions that dominated egyptian society at the beginning of the 20th century and follows their development through the changing viewpoints , experiences and feelings of the character anna , an englishwoman living in egypt .
through this learning process , we observe the way that anna on the one hand and her egyptian neighbors on the other maintain their respective cultural identities and , at the same time , enter into a conflict-ridden , yet fruitful dialogue .
writing about modern egyptian women soueif uses time and space , fiction and reality in the context of history and politics to paint this picture in different epochs and in different places .
she is helped here by well-founded information and research which challenge the oversimplified , stereotyped portrayal of egyptian women in english literature .
soueif pointed to the positive reception of this process among her readers .
" i think it has already changed misconceptions among my readers judging by the letters i get , " she told qantara.de.
" i do like to play with these preconceptions and twirl them round a bit ; like standing the western concept of the ' harem ' on its head as i do in the map of love by representing the domestic life of a harem . "
the special quality of soueif 's writing style lies in its artistic construction , which is based on a fusion of arab and english settings , characters and manners of speaking , lending a unique aesthetic character to her works .
cultural characteristics of egyptian people – such as arab names , expressions , metaphors , greetings and forms of address – flow seamlessly into her english-language dialogues .
" english is an extremely hospitable language " literary critic polly pattolo wrote that soueif 's literary style consisted of thinking out her dialogues in arabic and writing them in english .
soueif pointed to the literary advantages that this style provides for the english-speaking reader .
" i think this is the base , really , of the sometimes ' different ' english i write , " she said .
" that i need to fashion an english that will express an arab reality . "
in germany , too , both german and arab writers have intensified their efforts to support an intercultural dialogue in recent years .
examples of this trend can be seen in the works of the arab immigrants jusuf naoum , suleman taufiq and rafik schami .
with the intensive support of german , british and arab authors , these literary products could be developed into a euro-arabic literature .

his mission : to make it easier for german companies to leave the exchange . on his way home from world bank and international monetary fund meetings in washington , german finance minister hans eichel made a special pit stop in new york on monday .
he met with john thain , the director of the new york stock exchange -lrb- nyse -rrb- , and appeal on behalf of german companies for laxer rules governing the process of " de-listing " from the exchange .
the reason is quite simple : while during the boom years of the 1990s german companies raced to list themselves on the nyse , seeing it as a mark of prestige in an increasingly global economy , the effort has only proven worthwhile for a precious few .
for the rest , trading on the nyse has come at a high a price and they are looking to get out .
the trouble is , strict rules and regulations make such a retreat extremely difficult .
boom to bust at the moment , 18 german companies are traded on the nyse and nasdaq , the united states ' technology stock exchange .
deutsche telekom , siemens , sap , deutsche bank and infineon are among them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt stock exchange however , the stateside adventure has proven costly for the majority of them , particularly smaller concerns .
despite the huge initial cost of getting listed - for lawyers , consultants , etc . - most of the german companies have found there 's little interest in their stocks .
for example , the german pharmaceutical company bayer says just 80,000 of its stocks are traded each day , just 2.4 percent of the volume traded on the frankfurt exchange -lrb- photo -rrb- .
perhaps german companies get lost among the nearly 2,700 companies traded on the exchange , or , perhaps most investors interested in german stocks prefer to buy them on the frankfurt exchange , not in new york .
jürgen kurz , a spokesman for dsw , germany 's leading association for private investors , said he strongly suspects it 's the latter .
whatever the reason , the cost of doing business in new york is proving too high for many german companies listed there , and many are now beating the drums of retreat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister hans eichel at a meeting of the american chamber of commerce in germany in april .
" the majority are looking to get out sooner rather than later , " peter wiesner , of the german industry association -lrb- bdi -rrb- told the german newsweekly der spiegel .
their efforts , however , have been frustrated by strict regulations governing the process of de-listing .
eichel met with thain to appeal for laxer rules .
caught up in the red tape aside from worries that an en-masse retreat could send alarm signals off in the heads of investors , german firms looking to leave the nyse have mostly been frustrated by a rule stipulating that foreign companies can only leave the exchange if fewer than 300 permanent residents of the us own the company 's stock .
tracking down stockholders to buy back their shares is both expensive and time consuming .
indeed , german companies may have found us residents none too interested in their stocks , but enough interest existed to put them over the limit .
for example , financial services giant allianz has 555,300 stocks owned by 1,760 americans .
" it needs to be easier for german companies to leave the us exchange , " eichel told train at their meeting , according to a spokesman for eichel .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 05.10.2004 eichel hastens retreat for german firms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many german companies want to leave new york 's stock exchange on a visit to new york , german finance minister hans eichel met with the director of the new york stock exchange .
his mission : to make it easier for german companies to leave the exchange . on his way home from world bank and international monetary fund meetings in washington , german finance minister hans eichel made a special pit stop in new york on monday .
he met with john thain , the director of the new york stock exchange -lrb- nyse -rrb- , and appeal on behalf of german companies for laxer rules governing the process of " de-listing " from the exchange .
the reason is quite simple : while during the boom years of the 1990s german companies raced to list themselves on the nyse , seeing it as a mark of prestige in an increasingly global economy , the effort has only proven worthwhile for a precious few .
for the rest , trading on the nyse has come at a high a price and they are looking to get out .
the trouble is , strict rules and regulations make such a retreat extremely difficult .
boom to bust at the moment , 18 german companies are traded on the nyse and nasdaq , the united states ' technology stock exchange .
deutsche telekom , siemens , sap , deutsche bank and infineon are among them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt stock exchange however , the stateside adventure has proven costly for the majority of them , particularly smaller concerns .
despite the huge initial cost of getting listed - for lawyers , consultants , etc . - most of the german companies have found there 's little interest in their stocks .
for example , the german pharmaceutical company bayer says just 80,000 of its stocks are traded each day , just 2.4 percent of the volume traded on the frankfurt exchange -lrb- photo -rrb- .
perhaps german companies get lost among the nearly 2,700 companies traded on the exchange , or , perhaps most investors interested in german stocks prefer to buy them on the frankfurt exchange , not in new york .
jürgen kurz , a spokesman for dsw , germany 's leading association for private investors , said he strongly suspects it 's the latter .
whatever the reason , the cost of doing business in new york is proving too high for many german companies listed there , and many are now beating the drums of retreat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister hans eichel at a meeting of the american chamber of commerce in germany in april .
" the majority are looking to get out sooner rather than later , " peter wiesner , of the german industry association -lrb- bdi -rrb- told the german newsweekly der spiegel .
their efforts , however , have been frustrated by strict regulations governing the process of de-listing .
eichel met with thain to appeal for laxer rules .
caught up in the red tape aside from worries that an en-masse retreat could send alarm signals off in the heads of investors , german firms looking to leave the nyse have mostly been frustrated by a rule stipulating that foreign companies can only leave the exchange if fewer than 300 permanent residents of the us own the company 's stock .
tracking down stockholders to buy back their shares is both expensive and time consuming .
indeed , german companies may have found us residents none too interested in their stocks , but enough interest existed to put them over the limit .
for example , financial services giant allianz has 555,300 stocks owned by 1,760 americans .
" it needs to be easier for german companies to leave the us exchange , " eichel told train at their meeting , according to a spokesman for eichel .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 05.10.2004 eichel hastens retreat for german firms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many german companies want to leave new york 's stock exchange on a visit to new york , german finance minister hans eichel met with the director of the new york stock exchange .
his mission : to make it easier for german companies to leave the exchange . on his way home from world bank and international monetary fund meetings in washington , german finance minister hans eichel made a special pit stop in new york on monday .
he met with john thain , the director of the new york stock exchange -lrb- nyse -rrb- , and appeal on behalf of german companies for laxer rules governing the process of " de-listing " from the exchange .
the reason is quite simple : while during the boom years of the 1990s german companies raced to list themselves on the nyse , seeing it as a mark of prestige in an increasingly global economy , the effort has only proven worthwhile for a precious few .
for the rest , trading on the nyse has come at a high a price and they are looking to get out .
the trouble is , strict rules and regulations make such a retreat extremely difficult .
boom to bust at the moment , 18 german companies are traded on the nyse and nasdaq , the united states ' technology stock exchange .
deutsche telekom , siemens , sap , deutsche bank and infineon are among them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt stock exchange however , the stateside adventure has proven costly for the majority of them , particularly smaller concerns .
despite the huge initial cost of getting listed - for lawyers , consultants , etc . - most of the german companies have found there 's little interest in their stocks .
for example , the german pharmaceutical company bayer says just 80,000 of its stocks are traded each day , just 2.4 percent of the volume traded on the frankfurt exchange -lrb- photo -rrb- .
perhaps german companies get lost among the nearly 2,700 companies traded on the exchange , or , perhaps most investors interested in german stocks prefer to buy them on the frankfurt exchange , not in new york .
jürgen kurz , a spokesman for dsw , germany 's leading association for private investors , said he strongly suspects it 's the latter .
whatever the reason , the cost of doing business in new york is proving too high for many german companies listed there , and many are now beating the drums of retreat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister hans eichel at a meeting of the american chamber of commerce in germany in april .
" the majority are looking to get out sooner rather than later , " peter wiesner , of the german industry association -lrb- bdi -rrb- told the german newsweekly der spiegel .
their efforts , however , have been frustrated by strict regulations governing the process of de-listing .
eichel met with thain to appeal for laxer rules .
caught up in the red tape aside from worries that an en-masse retreat could send alarm signals off in the heads of investors , german firms looking to leave the nyse have mostly been frustrated by a rule stipulating that foreign companies can only leave the exchange if fewer than 300 permanent residents of the us own the company 's stock .
tracking down stockholders to buy back their shares is both expensive and time consuming .
indeed , german companies may have found us residents none too interested in their stocks , but enough interest existed to put them over the limit .
for example , financial services giant allianz has 555,300 stocks owned by 1,760 americans .
" it needs to be easier for german companies to leave the us exchange , " eichel told train at their meeting , according to a spokesman for eichel .

cultural ties are thriving and exchange , particularly in scientific and technological fields , has seen a robust increase . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian prime minister manmohan singh , left , talks to german foreign minister joschka fischer at the start of their official talks in new delhi , india , wednesday , july 14 , 2004 .
the two countries have also cooperated closely in past months in pushing for united nations reform and supporting each other 's claims to permanent seats in an expanded security council .
german foreign minister joschka fischer visited delhi in july this year . fear of the communists but , a shock change in india 's political leadership in may this year - when the congress party ended the six-year rule of the hindu nationalist bharatiya janata party -lrb- bjp -rrb- to take power - prompted worries in germany about delhi 's future economic course . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian stockbrokers trade in bombay .
a jittery indian stock market recorded its biggest fall in four years tuesday , amid fears that a hung parliament predicted by pollsters could slow or even halt economic liberalization .
the congress-led coalition headed by prime minister manmohan singh is dependent on the " outside support " of a " left front " dominated by the communist party of india -lrb- marxist -rrb- , causing foreign investors to fear that the new government could be hostile to business and reluctant to continue or accelerate the economic liberalization process begun in the early 1990s . " of course , we were jittery initially when the congress came to power , " eckart von unger , india expert for the federation of german industries -lrb- fdi -rrb- told dw-world .
" the german economy is reliant on exports and thus india 's liberalization process is of crucial importance to us . " unexpected opportunities but those fears have since been largely assuaged . " the new government will largely continue with the economic policies of the former one , so there will be no significant shift in the investment climate , " anuradha chenoy , expert on international relations at delhi 's jawaharlal nehru university , told dw-world .
" the communists realize the need for foreign investment , especially in infrastructure .
they 've indicated that they 're only concerned about how far key sectors like oil and telecom can be opened up .
it 's just a matter of numbers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manmohan singh , left , speaks about sonia gandhi , right , as they announce that he has been named prime minister of india after meeting with the country 's president in new delhi wednesday may 19 , 2004 .
von unger said that manmohan singh , considered the architect of the reform program as finance minister of the then congress government in 1991 , had created unexpected further opportunities for germany . " we 're optimistic that the singh government 's focus , especially on expanding infrastructure in rural india , offers huge chances for german firms , " he said . " lots of room for more " the time may indeed be ripe now , but there 's no denying that german companies have n't exactly seized the chance in recent years to cash in on india 's growing status as a " booming economy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mumbai 's most famous landmark , the gateway of india set against the figures associated with being the world 's second-most populous country and one of the fastest-growing markets - growth rates of 6 to 8 percent a year , a burgeoning 300-million-strong middle class and an estimated 40 million potential consumers for high-quality goods - bilateral trade at around € 5 billion -lrb- $ 6.14 billion -rrb- last year seems a mere trickle . the statistics are just as lean when it comes to german direct investments in india .
investments have been continually falling since 1997 , and reached a record low last year at € 37 million , down from € 51.7 million in 2002 . bernhard steinrücke , executive director of the indo-german chamber of commerce in mumbai , the largest bilateral trade promotion organization in india and the largest german foreign chamber abroad , however pointed out that well-established companies like siemens , krupp and bayer had been in india since the 19th century . " there are also some success stories of medium-sized german companies in india , who have reinvested in the country , " steinrücke told dw-world .
" but , there 's no denying that there 's still lots of room for more . "
steinrücke added that schröder 's visit was more than just symbolic .
" he 's the first european head of state to visit the country .
it underlines the importance that germany attaches to india . " " bad infrastructure and bureaucracy " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a wipro employee works on specialized softwares to provide services to overseas clients at the company in bangalore , india .
experts say that apart from india 's growing reputation as an " outsourcing mecca " and its enviable skills in the it services sector , which have n't escaped the notice of german companies like siemens , sap and bertelsmann , the country still suffers from huge problems which deter investors . " the infrastructure is appalling and bureaucracy a major hurdle , " von unger said .
" the awarding of licenses takes so long that many smaller businesses simply ca n't afford the complicated legal process .
you need a lot of patience . " other trade barriers include corruption , insufficient protection of intellectual property , stiflingly high state influence in industrial sectors and high import levies . others draw obvious parallels to the massive success story next door in china , where german firms exported goods worth a whopping € 18 billion last year . " india 's reform process began some 13 years after china , " christian wagner of the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin told dw-world .
" china simply has a better image .
india is often considered chaotic and unruly .
and , ironically , because it 's a democracy and has a free press , it all gets reported about in the media . " made in germany still works however , despite sluggish german investments and trade volume , there seems to be agreement on both sides that something needs to give . on the upside , experts point that india has a wealth on offer : low labor costs , highly-qualified personnel and the widespread use of english . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder in india during a visit in oct .
2001 chancellor schröder , who last year admitted that " economic ties with india leave much to be desired , " will be accompanied by a 22-member strong economic delegation on wednesday with representatives from lufthansa , allianz , man and fraport .
according to government sources , signings of major contracts are not on the agenda : the visit will be rather aimed at getting to know the new government . a high-ranking science delegation led by german minister for education and research , edelgard buhlman , will also be present . for his part , the enigmatic manmohan singh told news magazine spiegel this week that he was interested in deepening trade ties with germany . " i grew up in a small village in india where top quality was exclusively associated with germany , " he said , giving an indication of the importance he attaches to india 's second largest trading partner within the eu . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de different worlds , same goal german efforts to gain support for a permanent seat at a reformed un security council found resonance on wednesday when foreign minister fischer visited india , south asia 's giant aspirant to a similar place .

cultural ties are thriving and exchange , particularly in scientific and technological fields , has seen a robust increase . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian prime minister manmohan singh , left , talks to german foreign minister joschka fischer at the start of their official talks in new delhi , india , wednesday , july 14 , 2004 .
the two countries have also cooperated closely in past months in pushing for united nations reform and supporting each other 's claims to permanent seats in an expanded security council .
german foreign minister joschka fischer visited delhi in july this year . fear of the communists but , a shock change in india 's political leadership in may this year - when the congress party ended the six-year rule of the hindu nationalist bharatiya janata party -lrb- bjp -rrb- to take power - prompted worries in germany about delhi 's future economic course . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian stockbrokers trade in bombay .
a jittery indian stock market recorded its biggest fall in four years tuesday , amid fears that a hung parliament predicted by pollsters could slow or even halt economic liberalization .
the congress-led coalition headed by prime minister manmohan singh is dependent on the " outside support " of a " left front " dominated by the communist party of india -lrb- marxist -rrb- , causing foreign investors to fear that the new government could be hostile to business and reluctant to continue or accelerate the economic liberalization process begun in the early 1990s . " of course , we were jittery initially when the congress came to power , " eckart von unger , india expert for the federation of german industries -lrb- fdi -rrb- told dw-world .
" the german economy is reliant on exports and thus india 's liberalization process is of crucial importance to us . " unexpected opportunities but those fears have since been largely assuaged . " the new government will largely continue with the economic policies of the former one , so there will be no significant shift in the investment climate , " anuradha chenoy , expert on international relations at delhi 's jawaharlal nehru university , told dw-world .
" the communists realize the need for foreign investment , especially in infrastructure .
they 've indicated that they 're only concerned about how far key sectors like oil and telecom can be opened up .
it 's just a matter of numbers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manmohan singh , left , speaks about sonia gandhi , right , as they announce that he has been named prime minister of india after meeting with the country 's president in new delhi wednesday may 19 , 2004 .
von unger said that manmohan singh , considered the architect of the reform program as finance minister of the then congress government in 1991 , had created unexpected further opportunities for germany . " we 're optimistic that the singh government 's focus , especially on expanding infrastructure in rural india , offers huge chances for german firms , " he said . " lots of room for more " the time may indeed be ripe now , but there 's no denying that german companies have n't exactly seized the chance in recent years to cash in on india 's growing status as a " booming economy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mumbai 's most famous landmark , the gateway of india set against the figures associated with being the world 's second-most populous country and one of the fastest-growing markets - growth rates of 6 to 8 percent a year , a burgeoning 300-million-strong middle class and an estimated 40 million potential consumers for high-quality goods - bilateral trade at around € 5 billion -lrb- $ 6.14 billion -rrb- last year seems a mere trickle . the statistics are just as lean when it comes to german direct investments in india .
investments have been continually falling since 1997 , and reached a record low last year at € 37 million , down from € 51.7 million in 2002 . bernhard steinrücke , executive director of the indo-german chamber of commerce in mumbai , the largest bilateral trade promotion organization in india and the largest german foreign chamber abroad , however pointed out that well-established companies like siemens , krupp and bayer had been in india since the 19th century . " there are also some success stories of medium-sized german companies in india , who have reinvested in the country , " steinrücke told dw-world .
" but , there 's no denying that there 's still lots of room for more . "
steinrücke added that schröder 's visit was more than just symbolic .
" he 's the first european head of state to visit the country .
it underlines the importance that germany attaches to india . " " bad infrastructure and bureaucracy " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a wipro employee works on specialized softwares to provide services to overseas clients at the company in bangalore , india .
experts say that apart from india 's growing reputation as an " outsourcing mecca " and its enviable skills in the it services sector , which have n't escaped the notice of german companies like siemens , sap and bertelsmann , the country still suffers from huge problems which deter investors . " the infrastructure is appalling and bureaucracy a major hurdle , " von unger said .
" the awarding of licenses takes so long that many smaller businesses simply ca n't afford the complicated legal process .
you need a lot of patience . " other trade barriers include corruption , insufficient protection of intellectual property , stiflingly high state influence in industrial sectors and high import levies . others draw obvious parallels to the massive success story next door in china , where german firms exported goods worth a whopping € 18 billion last year . " india 's reform process began some 13 years after china , " christian wagner of the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin told dw-world .
" china simply has a better image .
india is often considered chaotic and unruly .
and , ironically , because it 's a democracy and has a free press , it all gets reported about in the media . " made in germany still works however , despite sluggish german investments and trade volume , there seems to be agreement on both sides that something needs to give . on the upside , experts point that india has a wealth on offer : low labor costs , highly-qualified personnel and the widespread use of english . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder in india during a visit in oct .
2001 chancellor schröder , who last year admitted that " economic ties with india leave much to be desired , " will be accompanied by a 22-member strong economic delegation on wednesday with representatives from lufthansa , allianz , man and fraport .
according to government sources , signings of major contracts are not on the agenda : the visit will be rather aimed at getting to know the new government . a high-ranking science delegation led by german minister for education and research , edelgard buhlman , will also be present . for his part , the enigmatic manmohan singh told news magazine spiegel this week that he was interested in deepening trade ties with germany . " i grew up in a small village in india where top quality was exclusively associated with germany , " he said , giving an indication of the importance he attaches to india 's second largest trading partner within the eu . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de different worlds , same goal german efforts to gain support for a permanent seat at a reformed un security council found resonance on wednesday when foreign minister fischer visited india , south asia 's giant aspirant to a similar place .

here , arab authors write stories which illustrate the conflict between their own cultural identity and that of the new country and which deal with the inner struggle between the old and the new cultural identities using new literary forms that stem from arab tradition .
in the context of today 's globalized literature , these authors are making an important contribution to the process of observing and comparing cultural differences : they see it as an opportunity to develop an intercultural " euro-arab literature " which can help make a dialogue between the cultures easier and assist in the integration of immigrants into the societies that receive them .
intellectual muslim background bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahdaf soueif ´ s place of birth : cairo ahdaf soueif was born in cairo in 1950 , the daughter of an intellectual muslim family .
she studied english literature at egyptian and british universities and served for two years as an instructor at a saudi arabian university .
since 1981 , she has been dividing her time between london and cairo .
soueif 's literary career began in 1983 , when she published her collection of short stories , aischa .
this was followed by the novel in the eye of the sun -lrb- 1992 -rrb- , the short story collection sandpiper -lrb- 1996 -rrb- and her second novel the map of love .
she translated some of her literary works into arabic and in 1996 , she was awarded the cairo book fair award for the best short stories of the year for her collection zimat al-hayat wa qisas ukhra , sandpiper , or literally , the beauty of life and other stories .
egyptian booker prize nominee in 1999 , her novel the map of love was nominated for the acclaimed booker prize .
numerous magazines and newspapers – including the times literary supplement , cosmopolitan , the london review of books and al-ahram weekly – regularly review her work and publish her critical treatises .
soueif 's literary works focus on the portrayal of arab-muslim society and its striving for modernization in a globalized world .
she formulates this objective in the context of a specific understanding of culture , cultural identity and intercultural relationships .
culture as a dynamic concept for her , culture is a dynamic concept which embraces all of a society 's activities in their historical context and thus lends its identity a form which is distinct , yet still able to communicate and learn .
soueif incorporates this understanding into her work by portraying her characters ' experiences both in the various stages of egyptian society 's historical development as well as during their stays in great britain .
in her novel the map of love , soueif describes the political , socio-economic and cultural conditions that dominated egyptian society at the beginning of the 20th century and follows their development through the changing viewpoints , experiences and feelings of the character anna , an englishwoman living in egypt .
through this learning process , we observe the way that anna on the one hand and her egyptian neighbors on the other maintain their respective cultural identities and , at the same time , enter into a conflict-ridden , yet fruitful dialogue .
writing about modern egyptian women soueif uses time and space , fiction and reality in the context of history and politics to paint this picture in different epochs and in different places .
she is helped here by well-founded information and research which challenge the oversimplified , stereotyped portrayal of egyptian women in english literature .
soueif pointed to the positive reception of this process among her readers .
" i think it has already changed misconceptions among my readers judging by the letters i get , " she told qantara.de.
" i do like to play with these preconceptions and twirl them round a bit ; like standing the western concept of the ' harem ' on its head as i do in the map of love by representing the domestic life of a harem . "
the special quality of soueif 's writing style lies in its artistic construction , which is based on a fusion of arab and english settings , characters and manners of speaking , lending a unique aesthetic character to her works .
cultural characteristics of egyptian people – such as arab names , expressions , metaphors , greetings and forms of address – flow seamlessly into her english-language dialogues .
" english is an extremely hospitable language " literary critic polly pattolo wrote that soueif 's literary style consisted of thinking out her dialogues in arabic and writing them in english .
soueif pointed to the literary advantages that this style provides for the english-speaking reader .
" i think this is the base , really , of the sometimes ' different ' english i write , " she said .
" that i need to fashion an english that will express an arab reality . "
in germany , too , both german and arab writers have intensified their efforts to support an intercultural dialogue in recent years .
examples of this trend can be seen in the works of the arab immigrants jusuf naoum , suleman taufiq and rafik schami .
with the intensive support of german , british and arab authors , these literary products could be developed into a euro-arabic literature .

in her novel the map of love , soueif describes the political , socio-economic and cultural conditions that dominated egyptian society at the beginning of the 20th century and follows their development through the changing viewpoints , experiences and feelings of the character anna , an englishwoman living in egypt .

the eu commission is likely to give the go-ahead wednesday for opening talks with ankara about its membership bid .
but it wo n't silence the controversial debate over whether turkey belongs in the eu in the first place . can the european union cope with turkey 's entry ?
the controversial question may be currently raging in europe , but , in theory , it 's already been decided .
at least from brussels ' perspective : ankara has been an official candidate for over four years . in addition , an imminent go-ahead for opening concrete negotiations is likely to set in motion an automatic eu membership process that is going to be hard to stop .
at the most , referendums in eu countries or a failure on turkey ' part to implement further reforms to fulfill membership criteria could put the brakes on it .
but , actual entry into the union is not expected before the next 10-15 years anyway . widespread eu euphoria however , the widespread skepticism against ever-growing ties between turkey and the eu is highly one-sided .
after all , in turkey itself , the vote in favor of joining is as high as 70 percent .
and there is n't any significant political or social force that would openly act against eu membership . of course that does n't mean that such forces do n't exist .
but , as long as brussels does n't disappoint turkish expectations , anti-european forces will hardly dare to reveal themselves for what they are .
eu euphoria among the turkish population is simply too robust for that . eu entry equals social progress the reasons for the euphoria are n't simply economic .
eu membership is a question for prestige for ankara and is often viewed by many ordinary turks as leading to social progress .
they may not be entirely wrong either . from the abolition of the death penalty to a strengthening of women 's rights to television programs in kurdish , the turks are already witnessing numerous improvements that would profit turkish society in the long term .
these reforms could only be pushed through because of brussels ' insistence on sustainable reforms .
nothing has contributed more to turkey 's stabilization in the past years than the prospect of eu entry . a crowning of the " european way " from a turkish perspective , eu membership would amount to a crowning of the " european way " , which the nation 's founder kemal atatürk led his people towards over 80 years ago . atatürk did n't just introduce the separation of state and religion , which is still valid today .
he was also responsible for the fact that turkish women could vote in 1934 at a time when their counterparts in countries such as france and switzerland had to obediently stay at home on election days . this should provide some food for thought for those who today reject turkey as " culturally alien " despite its decades-long membership in nato and the european council . of course , large parts of turkey still remain underdeveloped .
and naturally , there are cultural differences which can not be denied .
despite that , for most turks it 's no contradiction to feel muslim , democrat and european at the same time . the current turkey debate in europe unfortunately raises the impression that one would like to talk them into such a contradiction . rainer sollich -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder hails erdogan as a " great reformer " as turkey looks set to receive official eu blessing to start negotiating membership , prime minister recep tayyip erdogan got a warm reception when he visited germany , turkey 's major ally in its quest for accession .

the eu commission is likely to give the go-ahead wednesday for opening talks with ankara about its membership bid .
but it wo n't silence the controversial debate over whether turkey belongs in the eu in the first place . can the european union cope with turkey 's entry ?
the controversial question may be currently raging in europe , but , in theory , it 's already been decided .
at least from brussels ' perspective : ankara has been an official candidate for over four years . in addition , an imminent go-ahead for opening concrete negotiations is likely to set in motion an automatic eu membership process that is going to be hard to stop .
at the most , referendums in eu countries or a failure on turkey ' part to implement further reforms to fulfill membership criteria could put the brakes on it .
but , actual entry into the union is not expected before the next 10-15 years anyway . widespread eu euphoria however , the widespread skepticism against ever-growing ties between turkey and the eu is highly one-sided .
after all , in turkey itself , the vote in favor of joining is as high as 70 percent .
and there is n't any significant political or social force that would openly act against eu membership . of course that does n't mean that such forces do n't exist .
but , as long as brussels does n't disappoint turkish expectations , anti-european forces will hardly dare to reveal themselves for what they are .
eu euphoria among the turkish population is simply too robust for that . eu entry equals social progress the reasons for the euphoria are n't simply economic .
eu membership is a question for prestige for ankara and is often viewed by many ordinary turks as leading to social progress .
they may not be entirely wrong either . from the abolition of the death penalty to a strengthening of women 's rights to television programs in kurdish , the turks are already witnessing numerous improvements that would profit turkish society in the long term .
these reforms could only be pushed through because of brussels ' insistence on sustainable reforms .
nothing has contributed more to turkey 's stabilization in the past years than the prospect of eu entry . a crowning of the " european way " from a turkish perspective , eu membership would amount to a crowning of the " european way " , which the nation 's founder kemal atatürk led his people towards over 80 years ago . atatürk did n't just introduce the separation of state and religion , which is still valid today .
he was also responsible for the fact that turkish women could vote in 1934 at a time when their counterparts in countries such as france and switzerland had to obediently stay at home on election days . this should provide some food for thought for those who today reject turkey as " culturally alien " despite its decades-long membership in nato and the european council . of course , large parts of turkey still remain underdeveloped .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 05.10.2004 developing a euro-arab literature großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soueif travels between two worlds ahdaf soueif is an egyptian writer who made it big in great britain .
as a nominee for the booker prize she is among the growing number of authors who are developing a so-called " euro-arab literature . " the egyptian author ahdaf soueif is one of a number of arab authors who emigrated to western europe in the second half of the 20th century and who , from their adopted homes , attempt to describe their encounters with cultural otherness .
they base their narratives in their foreign homes as well as in their countries of origin and , through the themes , content and literary style of their work , they present their characters ' unique experiences in both locations and in the " space in between . "
literature as a beacon for social integration this immigrant literature trend can for instance be observed in germany .
here , arab authors write stories which illustrate the conflict between their own cultural identity and that of the new country and which deal with the inner struggle between the old and the new cultural identities using new literary forms that stem from arab tradition .
in the context of today 's globalized literature , these authors are making an important contribution to the process of observing and comparing cultural differences : they see it as an opportunity to develop an intercultural " euro-arab literature " which can help make a dialogue between the cultures easier and assist in the integration of immigrants into the societies that receive them .
intellectual muslim background bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahdaf soueif ´ s place of birth : cairo ahdaf soueif was born in cairo in 1950 , the daughter of an intellectual muslim family .
she studied english literature at egyptian and british universities and served for two years as an instructor at a saudi arabian university .
since 1981 , she has been dividing her time between london and cairo .
soueif 's literary career began in 1983 , when she published her collection of short stories , aischa .
this was followed by the novel in the eye of the sun -lrb- 1992 -rrb- , the short story collection sandpiper -lrb- 1996 -rrb- and her second novel the map of love .
she translated some of her literary works into arabic and in 1996 , she was awarded the cairo book fair award for the best short stories of the year for her collection zimat al-hayat wa qisas ukhra , sandpiper , or literally , the beauty of life and other stories .
egyptian booker prize nominee in 1999 , her novel the map of love was nominated for the acclaimed booker prize .
numerous magazines and newspapers – including the times literary supplement , cosmopolitan , the london review of books and al-ahram weekly – regularly review her work and publish her critical treatises .
soueif 's literary works focus on the portrayal of arab-muslim society and its striving for modernization in a globalized world .
she formulates this objective in the context of a specific understanding of culture , cultural identity and intercultural relationships .
culture as a dynamic concept for her , culture is a dynamic concept which embraces all of a society 's activities in their historical context and thus lends its identity a form which is distinct , yet still able to communicate and learn .
soueif incorporates this understanding into her work by portraying her characters ' experiences both in the various stages of egyptian society 's historical development as well as during their stays in great britain .
in her novel the map of love , soueif describes the political , socio-economic and cultural conditions that dominated egyptian society at the beginning of the 20th century and follows their development through the changing viewpoints , experiences and feelings of the character anna , an englishwoman living in egypt .
through this learning process , we observe the way that anna on the one hand and her egyptian neighbors on the other maintain their respective cultural identities and , at the same time , enter into a conflict-ridden , yet fruitful dialogue .
writing about modern egyptian women soueif uses time and space , fiction and reality in the context of history and politics to paint this picture in different epochs and in different places .
she is helped here by well-founded information and research which challenge the oversimplified , stereotyped portrayal of egyptian women in english literature .
soueif pointed to the positive reception of this process among her readers .
" i think it has already changed misconceptions among my readers judging by the letters i get , " she told qantara.de.
" i do like to play with these preconceptions and twirl them round a bit ; like standing the western concept of the ' harem ' on its head as i do in the map of love by representing the domestic life of a harem . "
the special quality of soueif 's writing style lies in its artistic construction , which is based on a fusion of arab and english settings , characters and manners of speaking , lending a unique aesthetic character to her works .
cultural characteristics of egyptian people – such as arab names , expressions , metaphors , greetings and forms of address – flow seamlessly into her english-language dialogues .
" english is an extremely hospitable language " literary critic polly pattolo wrote that soueif 's literary style consisted of thinking out her dialogues in arabic and writing them in english .
soueif pointed to the literary advantages that this style provides for the english-speaking reader .
" i think this is the base , really , of the sometimes ' different ' english i write , " she said .
" that i need to fashion an english that will express an arab reality . "
in germany , too , both german and arab writers have intensified their efforts to support an intercultural dialogue in recent years .
examples of this trend can be seen in the works of the arab immigrants jusuf naoum , suleman taufiq and rafik schami .
with the intensive support of german , british and arab authors , these literary products could be developed into a euro-arabic literature .
this literary genre could provide a forum for encouraging dialogue between the cultures and accelerating integration into the societies of immigration . yafa shanneik , © qantara.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de frankfurt book fair opens gerhard schröder and the secretary general of the arab league , amre mussa , will open the frankfurt book fair on tuesday .

a jittery indian stock market recorded its biggest fall in four years tuesday , amid fears that a hung parliament predicted by pollsters could slow or even halt economic liberalization .
the congress-led coalition headed by prime minister manmohan singh is dependent on the " outside support " of a " left front " dominated by the communist party of india -lrb- marxist -rrb- , causing foreign investors to fear that the new government could be hostile to business and reluctant to continue or accelerate the economic liberalization process begun in the early 1990s .

von unger said that manmohan singh , considered the architect of the reform program as finance minister of the then congress government in 1991 , had created unexpected further opportunities for germany . " we 're optimistic that the singh government 's focus , especially on expanding infrastructure in rural india , offers huge chances for german firms , " he said . " lots of room for more " the time may indeed be ripe now , but there 's no denying that german companies have n't exactly seized the chance in recent years to cash in on india 's growing status as a " booming economy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mumbai 's most famous landmark , the gateway of india set against the figures associated with being the world 's second-most populous country and one of the fastest-growing markets - growth rates of 6 to 8 percent a year , a burgeoning 300-million-strong middle class and an estimated 40 million potential consumers for high-quality goods - bilateral trade at around € 5 billion -lrb- $ 6.14 billion -rrb- last year seems a mere trickle . the statistics are just as lean when it comes to german direct investments in india .
investments have been continually falling since 1997 , and reached a record low last year at € 37 million , down from € 51.7 million in 2002 . bernhard steinrücke , executive director of the indo-german chamber of commerce in mumbai , the largest bilateral trade promotion organization in india and the largest german foreign chamber abroad , however pointed out that well-established companies like siemens , krupp and bayer had been in india since the 19th century . " there are also some success stories of medium-sized german companies in india , who have reinvested in the country , " steinrücke told dw-world .
" but , there 's no denying that there 's still lots of room for more . "
steinrücke added that schröder 's visit was more than just symbolic .

it underlines the importance that germany attaches to india . " " bad infrastructure and bureaucracy " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a wipro employee works on specialized softwares to provide services to overseas clients at the company in bangalore , india .
experts say that apart from india 's growing reputation as an " outsourcing mecca " and its enviable skills in the it services sector , which have n't escaped the notice of german companies like siemens , sap and bertelsmann , the country still suffers from huge problems which deter investors . " the infrastructure is appalling and bureaucracy a major hurdle , " von unger said .
" the awarding of licenses takes so long that many smaller businesses simply ca n't afford the complicated legal process .
you need a lot of patience . " other trade barriers include corruption , insufficient protection of intellectual property , stiflingly high state influence in industrial sectors and high import levies . others draw obvious parallels to the massive success story next door in china , where german firms exported goods worth a whopping € 18 billion last year .

a jittery indian stock market recorded its biggest fall in four years tuesday , amid fears that a hung parliament predicted by pollsters could slow or even halt economic liberalization .

his mission : to make it easier for german companies to leave the exchange . on his way home from world bank and international monetary fund meetings in washington , german finance minister hans eichel made a special pit stop in new york on monday .
he met with john thain , the director of the new york stock exchange -lrb- nyse -rrb- , and appeal on behalf of german companies for laxer rules governing the process of " de-listing " from the exchange .
the reason is quite simple : while during the boom years of the 1990s german companies raced to list themselves on the nyse , seeing it as a mark of prestige in an increasingly global economy , the effort has only proven worthwhile for a precious few .
for the rest , trading on the nyse has come at a high a price and they are looking to get out .
the trouble is , strict rules and regulations make such a retreat extremely difficult .
boom to bust at the moment , 18 german companies are traded on the nyse and nasdaq , the united states ' technology stock exchange .
deutsche telekom , siemens , sap , deutsche bank and infineon are among them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt stock exchange however , the stateside adventure has proven costly for the majority of them , particularly smaller concerns .
despite the huge initial cost of getting listed - for lawyers , consultants , etc . - most of the german companies have found there 's little interest in their stocks .
for example , the german pharmaceutical company bayer says just 80,000 of its stocks are traded each day , just 2.4 percent of the volume traded on the frankfurt exchange -lrb- photo -rrb- .
perhaps german companies get lost among the nearly 2,700 companies traded on the exchange , or , perhaps most investors interested in german stocks prefer to buy them on the frankfurt exchange , not in new york .
jürgen kurz , a spokesman for dsw , germany 's leading association for private investors , said he strongly suspects it 's the latter .
whatever the reason , the cost of doing business in new york is proving too high for many german companies listed there , and many are now beating the drums of retreat .

their efforts , however , have been frustrated by strict regulations governing the process of de-listing .
eichel met with thain to appeal for laxer rules .
caught up in the red tape aside from worries that an en-masse retreat could send alarm signals off in the heads of investors , german firms looking to leave the nyse have mostly been frustrated by a rule stipulating that foreign companies can only leave the exchange if fewer than 300 permanent residents of the us own the company 's stock .
tracking down stockholders to buy back their shares is both expensive and time consuming .
indeed , german companies may have found us residents none too interested in their stocks , but enough interest existed to put them over the limit .
for example , financial services giant allianz has 555,300 stocks owned by 1,760 americans .

his mission : to make it easier for german companies to leave the exchange . on his way home from world bank and international monetary fund meetings in washington , german finance minister hans eichel made a special pit stop in new york on monday .
he met with john thain , the director of the new york stock exchange -lrb- nyse -rrb- , and appeal on behalf of german companies for laxer rules governing the process of " de-listing " from the exchange .
the reason is quite simple : while during the boom years of the 1990s german companies raced to list themselves on the nyse , seeing it as a mark of prestige in an increasingly global economy , the effort has only proven worthwhile for a precious few .
for the rest , trading on the nyse has come at a high a price and they are looking to get out .
the trouble is , strict rules and regulations make such a retreat extremely difficult .
boom to bust at the moment , 18 german companies are traded on the nyse and nasdaq , the united states ' technology stock exchange .
deutsche telekom , siemens , sap , deutsche bank and infineon are among them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt stock exchange however , the stateside adventure has proven costly for the majority of them , particularly smaller concerns .
despite the huge initial cost of getting listed - for lawyers , consultants , etc . - most of the german companies have found there 's little interest in their stocks .
for example , the german pharmaceutical company bayer says just 80,000 of its stocks are traded each day , just 2.4 percent of the volume traded on the frankfurt exchange -lrb- photo -rrb- .
perhaps german companies get lost among the nearly 2,700 companies traded on the exchange , or , perhaps most investors interested in german stocks prefer to buy them on the frankfurt exchange , not in new york .
jürgen kurz , a spokesman for dsw , germany 's leading association for private investors , said he strongly suspects it 's the latter .
whatever the reason , the cost of doing business in new york is proving too high for many german companies listed there , and many are now beating the drums of retreat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister hans eichel at a meeting of the american chamber of commerce in germany in april .
" the majority are looking to get out sooner rather than later , " peter wiesner , of the german industry association -lrb- bdi -rrb- told the german newsweekly der spiegel .
their efforts , however , have been frustrated by strict regulations governing the process of de-listing .
eichel met with thain to appeal for laxer rules .
caught up in the red tape aside from worries that an en-masse retreat could send alarm signals off in the heads of investors , german firms looking to leave the nyse have mostly been frustrated by a rule stipulating that foreign companies can only leave the exchange if fewer than 300 permanent residents of the us own the company 's stock .
tracking down stockholders to buy back their shares is both expensive and time consuming .
indeed , german companies may have found us residents none too interested in their stocks , but enough interest existed to put them over the limit .
for example , financial services giant allianz has 555,300 stocks owned by 1,760 americans .

the two countries have also cooperated closely in past months in pushing for united nations reform and supporting each other 's claims to permanent seats in an expanded security council .
german foreign minister joschka fischer visited delhi in july this year . fear of the communists but , a shock change in india 's political leadership in may this year - when the congress party ended the six-year rule of the hindu nationalist bharatiya janata party -lrb- bjp -rrb- to take power - prompted worries in germany about delhi 's future economic course . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian stockbrokers trade in bombay .
a jittery indian stock market recorded its biggest fall in four years tuesday , amid fears that a hung parliament predicted by pollsters could slow or even halt economic liberalization .
the congress-led coalition headed by prime minister manmohan singh is dependent on the " outside support " of a " left front " dominated by the communist party of india -lrb- marxist -rrb- , causing foreign investors to fear that the new government could be hostile to business and reluctant to continue or accelerate the economic liberalization process begun in the early 1990s . " of course , we were jittery initially when the congress came to power , " eckart von unger , india expert for the federation of german industries -lrb- fdi -rrb- told dw-world .
" the german economy is reliant on exports and thus india 's liberalization process is of crucial importance to us . " unexpected opportunities but those fears have since been largely assuaged . " the new government will largely continue with the economic policies of the former one , so there will be no significant shift in the investment climate , " anuradha chenoy , expert on international relations at delhi 's jawaharlal nehru university , told dw-world .

von unger said that manmohan singh , considered the architect of the reform program as finance minister of the then congress government in 1991 , had created unexpected further opportunities for germany . " we 're optimistic that the singh government 's focus , especially on expanding infrastructure in rural india , offers huge chances for german firms , " he said . " lots of room for more " the time may indeed be ripe now , but there 's no denying that german companies have n't exactly seized the chance in recent years to cash in on india 's growing status as a " booming economy .

investments have been continually falling since 1997 , and reached a record low last year at € 37 million , down from € 51.7 million in 2002 . bernhard steinrücke , executive director of the indo-german chamber of commerce in mumbai , the largest bilateral trade promotion organization in india and the largest german foreign chamber abroad , however pointed out that well-established companies like siemens , krupp and bayer had been in india since the 19th century . " there are also some success stories of medium-sized german companies in india , who have reinvested in the country , " steinrücke told dw-world .
" but , there 's no denying that there 's still lots of room for more . "

it underlines the importance that germany attaches to india . " " bad infrastructure and bureaucracy " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a wipro employee works on specialized softwares to provide services to overseas clients at the company in bangalore , india .
experts say that apart from india 's growing reputation as an " outsourcing mecca " and its enviable skills in the it services sector , which have n't escaped the notice of german companies like siemens , sap and bertelsmann , the country still suffers from huge problems which deter investors . " the infrastructure is appalling and bureaucracy a major hurdle , " von unger said .
" the awarding of licenses takes so long that many smaller businesses simply ca n't afford the complicated legal process .
you need a lot of patience . " other trade barriers include corruption , insufficient protection of intellectual property , stiflingly high state influence in industrial sectors and high import levies . others draw obvious parallels to the massive success story next door in china , where german firms exported goods worth a whopping € 18 billion last year . " india 's reform process began some 13 years after china , " christian wagner of the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin told dw-world .
" china simply has a better image .
india is often considered chaotic and unruly .
and , ironically , because it 's a democracy and has a free press , it all gets reported about in the media .

his mission : to make it easier for german companies to leave the exchange . on his way home from world bank and international monetary fund meetings in washington , german finance minister hans eichel made a special pit stop in new york on monday .
he met with john thain , the director of the new york stock exchange -lrb- nyse -rrb- , and appeal on behalf of german companies for laxer rules governing the process of " de-listing " from the exchange .
the reason is quite simple : while during the boom years of the 1990s german companies raced to list themselves on the nyse , seeing it as a mark of prestige in an increasingly global economy , the effort has only proven worthwhile for a precious few .
for the rest , trading on the nyse has come at a high a price and they are looking to get out .
the trouble is , strict rules and regulations make such a retreat extremely difficult .
boom to bust at the moment , 18 german companies are traded on the nyse and nasdaq , the united states ' technology stock exchange .
deutsche telekom , siemens , sap , deutsche bank and infineon are among them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt stock exchange however , the stateside adventure has proven costly for the majority of them , particularly smaller concerns .
despite the huge initial cost of getting listed - for lawyers , consultants , etc . - most of the german companies have found there 's little interest in their stocks .
for example , the german pharmaceutical company bayer says just 80,000 of its stocks are traded each day , just 2.4 percent of the volume traded on the frankfurt exchange -lrb- photo -rrb- .
perhaps german companies get lost among the nearly 2,700 companies traded on the exchange , or , perhaps most investors interested in german stocks prefer to buy them on the frankfurt exchange , not in new york .
jürgen kurz , a spokesman for dsw , germany 's leading association for private investors , said he strongly suspects it 's the latter .
whatever the reason , the cost of doing business in new york is proving too high for many german companies listed there , and many are now beating the drums of retreat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister hans eichel at a meeting of the american chamber of commerce in germany in april .
" the majority are looking to get out sooner rather than later , " peter wiesner , of the german industry association -lrb- bdi -rrb- told the german newsweekly der spiegel .
their efforts , however , have been frustrated by strict regulations governing the process of de-listing .
eichel met with thain to appeal for laxer rules .
caught up in the red tape aside from worries that an en-masse retreat could send alarm signals off in the heads of investors , german firms looking to leave the nyse have mostly been frustrated by a rule stipulating that foreign companies can only leave the exchange if fewer than 300 permanent residents of the us own the company 's stock .
tracking down stockholders to buy back their shares is both expensive and time consuming .
indeed , german companies may have found us residents none too interested in their stocks , but enough interest existed to put them over the limit .
for example , financial services giant allianz has 555,300 stocks owned by 1,760 americans .
" it needs to be easier for german companies to leave the us exchange , " eichel told train at their meeting , according to a spokesman for eichel .

cultural ties are thriving and exchange , particularly in scientific and technological fields , has seen a robust increase . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian prime minister manmohan singh , left , talks to german foreign minister joschka fischer at the start of their official talks in new delhi , india , wednesday , july 14 , 2004 .
the two countries have also cooperated closely in past months in pushing for united nations reform and supporting each other 's claims to permanent seats in an expanded security council .
german foreign minister joschka fischer visited delhi in july this year . fear of the communists but , a shock change in india 's political leadership in may this year - when the congress party ended the six-year rule of the hindu nationalist bharatiya janata party -lrb- bjp -rrb- to take power - prompted worries in germany about delhi 's future economic course . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian stockbrokers trade in bombay .
a jittery indian stock market recorded its biggest fall in four years tuesday , amid fears that a hung parliament predicted by pollsters could slow or even halt economic liberalization .
the congress-led coalition headed by prime minister manmohan singh is dependent on the " outside support " of a " left front " dominated by the communist party of india -lrb- marxist -rrb- , causing foreign investors to fear that the new government could be hostile to business and reluctant to continue or accelerate the economic liberalization process begun in the early 1990s . " of course , we were jittery initially when the congress came to power , " eckart von unger , india expert for the federation of german industries -lrb- fdi -rrb- told dw-world .
" the german economy is reliant on exports and thus india 's liberalization process is of crucial importance to us . " unexpected opportunities but those fears have since been largely assuaged . " the new government will largely continue with the economic policies of the former one , so there will be no significant shift in the investment climate , " anuradha chenoy , expert on international relations at delhi 's jawaharlal nehru university , told dw-world .
" the communists realize the need for foreign investment , especially in infrastructure .
they 've indicated that they 're only concerned about how far key sectors like oil and telecom can be opened up .
it 's just a matter of numbers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manmohan singh , left , speaks about sonia gandhi , right , as they announce that he has been named prime minister of india after meeting with the country 's president in new delhi wednesday may 19 , 2004 .
von unger said that manmohan singh , considered the architect of the reform program as finance minister of the then congress government in 1991 , had created unexpected further opportunities for germany . " we 're optimistic that the singh government 's focus , especially on expanding infrastructure in rural india , offers huge chances for german firms , " he said . " lots of room for more " the time may indeed be ripe now , but there 's no denying that german companies have n't exactly seized the chance in recent years to cash in on india 's growing status as a " booming economy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mumbai 's most famous landmark , the gateway of india set against the figures associated with being the world 's second-most populous country and one of the fastest-growing markets - growth rates of 6 to 8 percent a year , a burgeoning 300-million-strong middle class and an estimated 40 million potential consumers for high-quality goods - bilateral trade at around € 5 billion -lrb- $ 6.14 billion -rrb- last year seems a mere trickle . the statistics are just as lean when it comes to german direct investments in india .
investments have been continually falling since 1997 , and reached a record low last year at € 37 million , down from € 51.7 million in 2002 . bernhard steinrücke , executive director of the indo-german chamber of commerce in mumbai , the largest bilateral trade promotion organization in india and the largest german foreign chamber abroad , however pointed out that well-established companies like siemens , krupp and bayer had been in india since the 19th century . " there are also some success stories of medium-sized german companies in india , who have reinvested in the country , " steinrücke told dw-world .
" but , there 's no denying that there 's still lots of room for more . "

the current costa rican leader , abel pacheco , called on mr rodriguez to return and " face his responsibilities " .
prosecutors last week said they wanted to question to him over an alleged bribe from the french telecommunications giant alcatel .
mr rodriguez , who was president until 2002 , has denied any wrongdoing .
last week a former director of the state telephone company , jose antonio lobo , testified that bribes were involved in the award of a big contract to alcatel .
in a television interview mr rodriguez - who is based in washington - said the money he received from mr lobo was a personal loan to defray the costs of his campaign to head the oas .
mr rodriguez became secretary-general of the organisation last month .

harmonia axyridis posed a " deadly threat " to butterflies , lacewings and ladybirds , dr michael majerus of cambridge university said .
the ladybird is an asian species which was introduced into north america 25 years ago to fight aphids .
it has since spread to europe and last month was discovered in the gardens of the white lion pub in sible hedingham .
it is critical to monitor this ladybird now , before it gets out of control and starts to annihilate our own british ladybirds dr michael majerus the ladybird , which is also known as harlequin or the multi-coloured ladybug , was seen at the pub on 19 september and identified by dr majerus at the university 's genetics department .
several patterns dr majerus said : " this is without doubt the ladybird i have least wanted to see here .
" i knew it was on its way , but i hoped that it would n't be so soon .
now many of our ladybirds will be in direct competition with this aggressively invasive species , and some will simply not cope . "
the adult h. axyridis is about 7mm long , slightly larger than the seven-spot ladybird native to the uk .
it comes in a range of colours and patterns .
the one found in essex was black with two very bold red spots and two smaller red spots .
but the bugs can also be orange in colour and checked in pattern .
h. axyridis is still sold in north america as a pest control .
" it is now the commonest ladybird in north america , " dr majerus told bbc news .
" it is outcompeting pretty much all of the aphid-feeding native american ladybirds which are going through anything from a slight to a very , very serious decline .
" and there are lacewing , hoverfly larvae and even butterflies that are suffering because this thing is eating all the food , and it is also eating as secondary food butterfly eggs , and other ladybirds and lacewing larvae . "
time to defend despite this unwelcome and well-publicised take-over , the harlequin ladybirds are also still being sold in continental europe by biocontrol companies .
the bug now roams across france , belgium and holland , with numbers soaring annually .
harlequins also feed on fruit juices as they fuel up for the winter and fruit-growers are finding that they blemish many soft fruits , reducing the value of the crop .
wineries report the bugs also taint the vintage because of their acrid defensive chemicals .
dr majerus believes there is still time to save the uk from a full invasion .
he urges anyone who finds the insect to send it to him with precise details on when and where the ladybird was found .
" it is critical to monitor this ladybird now , before it gets out of control and starts to annihilate our own british ladybirds , " he said .

the ladybird is an asian species which was introduced into north america 25 years ago to fight aphids .
it has since spread to europe and last month was discovered in the gardens of the white lion pub in sible hedingham .
it is critical to monitor this ladybird now , before it gets out of control and starts to annihilate our own british ladybirds dr michael majerus the ladybird , which is also known as harlequin or the multi-coloured ladybug , was seen at the pub on 19 september and identified by dr majerus at the university 's genetics department .
several patterns dr majerus said : " this is without doubt the ladybird i have least wanted to see here .
" i knew it was on its way , but i hoped that it would n't be so soon .
now many of our ladybirds will be in direct competition with this aggressively invasive species , and some will simply not cope . "
the adult h. axyridis is about 7mm long , slightly larger than the seven-spot ladybird native to the uk .
it comes in a range of colours and patterns .
the one found in essex was black with two very bold red spots and two smaller red spots .
but the bugs can also be orange in colour and checked in pattern .
h. axyridis is still sold in north america as a pest control .
" it is now the commonest ladybird in north america , " dr majerus told bbc news .
" it is outcompeting pretty much all of the aphid-feeding native american ladybirds which are going through anything from a slight to a very , very serious decline .
" and there are lacewing , hoverfly larvae and even butterflies that are suffering because this thing is eating all the food , and it is also eating as secondary food butterfly eggs , and other ladybirds and lacewing larvae . "
time to defend despite this unwelcome and well-publicised take-over , the harlequin ladybirds are also still being sold in continental europe by biocontrol companies .
the bug now roams across france , belgium and holland , with numbers soaring annually .
harlequins also feed on fruit juices as they fuel up for the winter and fruit-growers are finding that they blemish many soft fruits , reducing the value of the crop .
wineries report the bugs also taint the vintage because of their acrid defensive chemicals .
dr majerus believes there is still time to save the uk from a full invasion .
he urges anyone who finds the insect to send it to him with precise details on when and where the ladybird was found .
" it is critical to monitor this ladybird now , before it gets out of control and starts to annihilate our own british ladybirds , " he said .

harmonia axyridis posed a " deadly threat " to butterflies , lacewings and ladybirds , dr michael majerus of cambridge university said .
the ladybird is an asian species which was introduced into north america 25 years ago to fight aphids .
it has since spread to europe and last month was discovered in the gardens of the white lion pub in sible hedingham .
it is critical to monitor this ladybird now , before it gets out of control and starts to annihilate our own british ladybirds dr michael majerus the ladybird , which is also known as harlequin or the multi-coloured ladybug , was seen at the pub on 19 september and identified by dr majerus at the university 's genetics department .
several patterns dr majerus said : " this is without doubt the ladybird i have least wanted to see here .
" i knew it was on its way , but i hoped that it would n't be so soon .
now many of our ladybirds will be in direct competition with this aggressively invasive species , and some will simply not cope . "
the adult h. axyridis is about 7mm long , slightly larger than the seven-spot ladybird native to the uk .
it comes in a range of colours and patterns .
the one found in essex was black with two very bold red spots and two smaller red spots .
but the bugs can also be orange in colour and checked in pattern .
h. axyridis is still sold in north america as a pest control .
" it is now the commonest ladybird in north america , " dr majerus told bbc news .
" it is outcompeting pretty much all of the aphid-feeding native american ladybirds which are going through anything from a slight to a very , very serious decline .
" and there are lacewing , hoverfly larvae and even butterflies that are suffering because this thing is eating all the food , and it is also eating as secondary food butterfly eggs , and other ladybirds and lacewing larvae . "
time to defend despite this unwelcome and well-publicised take-over , the harlequin ladybirds are also still being sold in continental europe by biocontrol companies .
the bug now roams across france , belgium and holland , with numbers soaring annually .
harlequins also feed on fruit juices as they fuel up for the winter and fruit-growers are finding that they blemish many soft fruits , reducing the value of the crop .
wineries report the bugs also taint the vintage because of their acrid defensive chemicals .
dr majerus believes there is still time to save the uk from a full invasion .
he urges anyone who finds the insect to send it to him with precise details on when and where the ladybird was found .

crime involving cards lost or stolen in the post increased by 51 % , apacs said .
all uk banks are replacing their customers ' cards as chip and pin fraud-prevention technology rolls out .
an apacs spokeswoman said criminals were stepping-up their fraudulent activities during the introduction of chip and pin card technology .
card roll-out chip and pin cards aim to cut fraud by including a smart chip , which can store more information than the usual magnetic strips , and also by having users verify transactions by keying in a pin number rather than signing a receipt .
major areas of card fraud counterfeit cards £ 123m -lrb- down 2 % -rrb- card stolen or lost £ 118.8m -lrb- up 11 % -rrb- card not present £ 138.8m -lrb- up 29 % -rrb- card lost or stolen in the post £ 61.2m -lrb- up 51 % -rrb- id fraud £ 37m -lrb- up 66 % -rrb- source : association of payment clearing services -lrb- apacs -rrb- , year to end of june france pioneered the technology more than 10 years ago - reportedly cutting fraud by almost 50 % as a result .
latest figures from the chip and pin programme show more than 50 million new cards have been sent out to around 25 million of the uk 's 42 million card holders .
" criminals are trying to make the most of the system prior to the completion of the roll-out of chip and pin , " jemma smith , a spokeswoman for apacs , told bbc news online .

professor alistair hall , british heart foundation professor cardiologist roger blumenthal and colleagues scanned the arteries of 8,549 people with no obvious signs or symptoms of heart disease .
this was to look for signs of plaque build up inside the vessel walls , called atherosclerosis , which is an early sign of cardiovascular disease .
the volunteers were then asked about any risk factors for heart disease , such as smoking , blood pressure and whether any of their relatives had had a heart attack or surgery for heart disease by the age of 55 .
the volunteers were two-and-a-half- to three-times more likely to have a higher degree of furring of their arteries if a brother or sister had already been diagnosed with heart disease .
screening this was much more than the risk posed by a parent with heart disease .
dr blumenthal said this knowledge could help screen for people at greatest risk of developing heart disease .
" the overall long-term goal is to use these findings to develop faster and better means of identifying early atherosclerosis in high risk groups and prevent its progression to full blown heart disease , " he said .
professor alistair hall , consultant cardiologist at leeds university and british heart foundation professor who has carried out research into family patterns of heart disease , said : " this is very original and exciting .

sibling history predicted heart disease risk better than parental history or traditional risk factors , a johns hopkins university team found .
this could help identify which individuals should do most to reduce their heart risk , say the authors .
their findings , based on nearly 8,500 people , appear in circulation .
brothers and sisters it is well known that things like smoking , high cholesterol and having a parent who suffered a heart attack at a young age all increase a person 's risk of heart disease significantly .
but it was not known how important heart disease in a sibling might be as a risk factor .
this is very original and exciting .
it makes sense .
professor alistair hall , british heart foundation professor cardiologist roger blumenthal and colleagues scanned the arteries of 8,549 people with no obvious signs or symptoms of heart disease .
this was to look for signs of plaque build up inside the vessel walls , called atherosclerosis , which is an early sign of cardiovascular disease .
the volunteers were then asked about any risk factors for heart disease , such as smoking , blood pressure and whether any of their relatives had had a heart attack or surgery for heart disease by the age of 55 .
the volunteers were two-and-a-half- to three-times more likely to have a higher degree of furring of their arteries if a brother or sister had already been diagnosed with heart disease .
screening this was much more than the risk posed by a parent with heart disease .
dr blumenthal said this knowledge could help screen for people at greatest risk of developing heart disease .
" the overall long-term goal is to use these findings to develop faster and better means of identifying early atherosclerosis in high risk groups and prevent its progression to full blown heart disease , " he said .
professor alistair hall , consultant cardiologist at leeds university and british heart foundation professor who has carried out research into family patterns of heart disease , said : " this is very original and exciting .
it makes sense .
" a brother and sister will share 50 % of their genes by chance and so will a child and a parent .
" you would expect the predictive value to be the same , but i guess the difference is the era in which the parents will have lived through versus the sibling .
" siblings will have been exposed to similar environmental risks so it does not surprise me that they are a more accurate predictor of risk . "
he said doctors were beginning to realise that it is important to ask patients about siblings ' history of heart disease .

m & s had announced plans to acquire the brand when chief executive stuart rose unveiled his turnaround strategy for the troubled retailer in july .
under the terms of the deal , george davies will stay chief executive of per una for at least two years , m & s said .
the per una range has been one of the few successes for m & s , which reported another fall in sales last month .
in its most recent trading update , m & s said overall like-for-like sales had slipped 5.2 % in the 10 weeks to 18 september , with clothing sales under pressure yet again .
in august , a report by research firm tns said supermarket chain asda had overtaken m & s to become the uk 's largest clothing retailer .
reform george davies made his name through establishing the next clothing stores , and then went on to design the george range of clothing for asda supermarkets .
per una was formed as a joint venture between m & s and mr davies .
george davies had a supplier relationship with m & s , but following the purchase the retailer will receive all revenues generated by the brand .
the purchase of per una was just one of a number of measures unveiled by mr rose in july to defeat a potential £ 9.1bn takeover offer for m & s from retail tycoon philip green .

wychavon district council said it was not told of the company 's new plans and has ordered the mast to be taken down .
' serve notice ' the council 's planning enforcement officer graeme duerdon told bbc radio hereford and worcester : " we at the council can not condone people vodaphone running roughshod over the planning system .

he added : " it 's our intention to serve notice to require the removal of the mast . "
vodaphone had agreed to move the mast 400m further away from homes after the residents ' protest near the cornmeadow lane site .
at the time , the company failed to get prior approval for the site from worcester city council .
it later agreed to move the site to a shared mobile phone mast area under wychavon district council .

a junk e-mail invites people to dial a premium rate number to express their support for president george w bush or rival john kerry .
e-mail filtering firm blackspider estimates that almost a quarter of a million are being sent out every day .
in the past , net fraudsters have tried to use the 9/11 attacks and the tragedy in beslan to get money .
900 number at first glance , the presidential election message appears to be legitimate , saying it was sent from a lycos.com address .
but blackspider technologies said it had traced some of the e-mails to a server in the czech republic . "
no doubt we will be seeing some messages like this in the next general election in the uk " john cheney , blackspider technologies the mail reads : " fellow citizen : the extremely jubilant crowds in baghdad appeared to vindicate president george bush 's belief that the military action in iraq was the right move .
" but many questions still remain over the lack of hard evidence of saddam 's weapons of mass destruction .
with these tough times before us , let us know . "
it goes on to ask readers if they support president bush , prompting them to call a 900 premium rate number .
it says votes will be sent to the bush and kerry campaigns .
in an effort to convince people it is a genuine message , the e-mail says who commissioned the poll .
the mail adds that the calls will cost $ 1.99 , saying this is " a little price to pay for a better democracy " .
" this is a relatively new scam , " said blackspider ceo , john cheney .
" the question is , are they breaking the law ?
in the uk they are , in the us they are not . "
sending unsolicited messages to personal e-mail is barred in the uk .
but in the us , people have to opt out of receiving these sorts of messages .
hotbed of scams blackspider estimates that 240,000 of the presidential scam e-mails are being sent out worldwide a day .
the lack of any spelling mistakes and its resemblance to a genuine message means that it could slip through the spam filtering of home users .
this latest scam reflects how the nature of spam is changing .
in the past , spam was dominated by pornography .
these days spam is a hotbed of financial scams , as well as a black market for fake pharmaceuticals and software .
e-mail scams known as phishing have tried to trick customers into giving away confidential bank details .
other scams known as 419 try to part people from their cash by telling them they in line for millions from a deposed african leader .
the us presidential mail is just the latest trick used by spammers to part the unwary from their money .
" no doubt we will be seeing some messages like this in the next general election in the uk , " said mr cheney .
