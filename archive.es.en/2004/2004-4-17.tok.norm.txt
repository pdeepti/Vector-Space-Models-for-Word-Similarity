the head of germany 's central bank , ernst welteke , resigned friday after further revelations he accepted freebies from bmw . welteke , 61 , offered his resignation to the bundesbank 's executive council , the central bank said in a statement .
the board accepted his resignation , saying the step was " appropriate in view of the bank 's reputation and the perception of its duties . " last week , welteke took a leave of absence with pay from his job , although the bank 's board said at the time that it did not find reason enough to ask for welteke 's resignation . welteke , germany 's highest-paid public official and the country 's representative at the european central bank , came under fire when it emerged that dresdner bank , a commercial bank , had picked up the tab for a four-night stay for him and his family in berlin 's luxurious adlon hotel during celebrations marking the introduction of euro notes and coins on january 1 , 2002 .
the hotel bill came to € 7,600 -lrb- $ 9,200 -rrb- . but the straw that broke the camel 's back appears to be a further revelation that welteke attended a formula 1 race in monaco at the invitation of german auto manufacturer bmw , according to a report in the german news weekly der spiegel which appeared on friday .
this particular case proved more problematic for welteke , because it took place in the spring of 2003 - after the european central bank , whose rules welteke is subject to , issued a code of conduct forbidding the acceptance of such gifts .
the dresdner bank incident took place before that . scandal angered germans the hotel scandal first came to light when the newsmagazine der spiegel reported that welteke had ignored potential conflicts of interest , given that the bundesbank is partly responsible for regulating the german banking sector . the free stay for the banker angered many germans , especially since welteke earns € 350,000 -lrb- $ 421,000 -rrb- a year .
mixing business with pleasure , the central banker confirmed that he , his wife and their three-year-old son , as well as his 25-year-old son and his son 's girlfriend , had stayed at the hotel .
in an attempt to make amends , he paid for two nights of the stay himself , while the bundesbank covered the days welteke was working during the trip . government wanted resignation members of the ruling social democratic party , of which welteke is a member , made little secret of the fact they wanted him to resign over the affair .
german finance minister hans eichel said it was up to the bundesbank , which enjoys considerable independence under german law , to review the case , but added that the conduct would have been unacceptable if welteke had been a government minister . there has been no immediate word on a successor , who under german law must be appointed by the government .
speculation has centered on bundesbank vice president jürgen stark and caio koch-weser , the deputy finance minister . koch-weser has plenty of international financial experience from his years at the finance ministry and his time at the world bank in washington .
he was nominated by germany to take over the international monetary fund in 2000 , but his candidacy was vetoed by the u.s. government at the time , saying the post should go to someone with a higher profile . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pressure mounts on bank chief to quit over perks scandal amid a legal probe and media hostility , calls are growing louder for germany 's embattled bundesbank chief ernst welteke to resign over his acceptance of a luxury hotel stay paid for by a bank he regulates .

the head of germany 's central bank , ernst welteke , resigned friday after further revelations he accepted freebies from bmw . welteke , 61 , offered his resignation to the bundesbank 's executive council , the central bank said in a statement .
the board accepted his resignation , saying the step was " appropriate in view of the bank 's reputation and the perception of its duties . " last week , welteke took a leave of absence with pay from his job , although the bank 's board said at the time that it did not find reason enough to ask for welteke 's resignation . welteke , germany 's highest-paid public official and the country 's representative at the european central bank , came under fire when it emerged that dresdner bank , a commercial bank , had picked up the tab for a four-night stay for him and his family in berlin 's luxurious adlon hotel during celebrations marking the introduction of euro notes and coins on january 1 , 2002 .
the hotel bill came to € 7,600 -lrb- $ 9,200 -rrb- . but the straw that broke the camel 's back appears to be a further revelation that welteke attended a formula 1 race in monaco at the invitation of german auto manufacturer bmw , according to a report in the german news weekly der spiegel which appeared on friday .
this particular case proved more problematic for welteke , because it took place in the spring of 2003 - after the european central bank , whose rules welteke is subject to , issued a code of conduct forbidding the acceptance of such gifts .
the dresdner bank incident took place before that . scandal angered germans the hotel scandal first came to light when the newsmagazine der spiegel reported that welteke had ignored potential conflicts of interest , given that the bundesbank is partly responsible for regulating the german banking sector . the free stay for the banker angered many germans , especially since welteke earns € 350,000 -lrb- $ 421,000 -rrb- a year .

the head of germany 's central bank , ernst welteke , resigned friday after further revelations he accepted freebies from bmw . welteke , 61 , offered his resignation to the bundesbank 's executive council , the central bank said in a statement .
the board accepted his resignation , saying the step was " appropriate in view of the bank 's reputation and the perception of its duties . " last week , welteke took a leave of absence with pay from his job , although the bank 's board said at the time that it did not find reason enough to ask for welteke 's resignation . welteke , germany 's highest-paid public official and the country 's representative at the european central bank , came under fire when it emerged that dresdner bank , a commercial bank , had picked up the tab for a four-night stay for him and his family in berlin 's luxurious adlon hotel during celebrations marking the introduction of euro notes and coins on january 1 , 2002 .
the hotel bill came to € 7,600 -lrb- $ 9,200 -rrb- . but the straw that broke the camel 's back appears to be a further revelation that welteke attended a formula 1 race in monaco at the invitation of german auto manufacturer bmw , according to a report in the german news weekly der spiegel which appeared on friday .
this particular case proved more problematic for welteke , because it took place in the spring of 2003 - after the european central bank , whose rules welteke is subject to , issued a code of conduct forbidding the acceptance of such gifts .
the dresdner bank incident took place before that . scandal angered germans the hotel scandal first came to light when the newsmagazine der spiegel reported that welteke had ignored potential conflicts of interest , given that the bundesbank is partly responsible for regulating the german banking sector . the free stay for the banker angered many germans , especially since welteke earns € 350,000 -lrb- $ 421,000 -rrb- a year .
mixing business with pleasure , the central banker confirmed that he , his wife and their three-year-old son , as well as his 25-year-old son and his son 's girlfriend , had stayed at the hotel .
in an attempt to make amends , he paid for two nights of the stay himself , while the bundesbank covered the days welteke was working during the trip . government wanted resignation members of the ruling social democratic party , of which welteke is a member , made little secret of the fact they wanted him to resign over the affair .
german finance minister hans eichel said it was up to the bundesbank , which enjoys considerable independence under german law , to review the case , but added that the conduct would have been unacceptable if welteke had been a government minister . there has been no immediate word on a successor , who under german law must be appointed by the government .
speculation has centered on bundesbank vice president jürgen stark and caio koch-weser , the deputy finance minister . koch-weser has plenty of international financial experience from his years at the finance ministry and his time at the world bank in washington .
he was nominated by germany to take over the international monetary fund in 2000 , but his candidacy was vetoed by the u.s. government at the time , saying the post should go to someone with a higher profile . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pressure mounts on bank chief to quit over perks scandal amid a legal probe and media hostility , calls are growing louder for germany 's embattled bundesbank chief ernst welteke to resign over his acceptance of a luxury hotel stay paid for by a bank he regulates .

the head of germany 's central bank , ernst welteke , resigned friday after further revelations he accepted freebies from bmw . welteke , 61 , offered his resignation to the bundesbank 's executive council , the central bank said in a statement .
the board accepted his resignation , saying the step was " appropriate in view of the bank 's reputation and the perception of its duties . " last week , welteke took a leave of absence with pay from his job , although the bank 's board said at the time that it did not find reason enough to ask for welteke 's resignation . welteke , germany 's highest-paid public official and the country 's representative at the european central bank , came under fire when it emerged that dresdner bank , a commercial bank , had picked up the tab for a four-night stay for him and his family in berlin 's luxurious adlon hotel during celebrations marking the introduction of euro notes and coins on january 1 , 2002 .
the hotel bill came to € 7,600 -lrb- $ 9,200 -rrb- . but the straw that broke the camel 's back appears to be a further revelation that welteke attended a formula 1 race in monaco at the invitation of german auto manufacturer bmw , according to a report in the german news weekly der spiegel which appeared on friday .
this particular case proved more problematic for welteke , because it took place in the spring of 2003 - after the european central bank , whose rules welteke is subject to , issued a code of conduct forbidding the acceptance of such gifts .
the dresdner bank incident took place before that . scandal angered germans the hotel scandal first came to light when the newsmagazine der spiegel reported that welteke had ignored potential conflicts of interest , given that the bundesbank is partly responsible for regulating the german banking sector . the free stay for the banker angered many germans , especially since welteke earns € 350,000 -lrb- $ 421,000 -rrb- a year .
mixing business with pleasure , the central banker confirmed that he , his wife and their three-year-old son , as well as his 25-year-old son and his son 's girlfriend , had stayed at the hotel .
in an attempt to make amends , he paid for two nights of the stay himself , while the bundesbank covered the days welteke was working during the trip . government wanted resignation members of the ruling social democratic party , of which welteke is a member , made little secret of the fact they wanted him to resign over the affair .
german finance minister hans eichel said it was up to the bundesbank , which enjoys considerable independence under german law , to review the case , but added that the conduct would have been unacceptable if welteke had been a government minister . there has been no immediate word on a successor , who under german law must be appointed by the government .
speculation has centered on bundesbank vice president jürgen stark and caio koch-weser , the deputy finance minister . koch-weser has plenty of international financial experience from his years at the finance ministry and his time at the world bank in washington .
he was nominated by germany to take over the international monetary fund in 2000 , but his candidacy was vetoed by the u.s. government at the time , saying the post should go to someone with a higher profile . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pressure mounts on bank chief to quit over perks scandal amid a legal probe and media hostility , calls are growing louder for germany 's embattled bundesbank chief ernst welteke to resign over his acceptance of a luxury hotel stay paid for by a bank he regulates .

the head of germany 's central bank , ernst welteke , resigned friday after further revelations he accepted freebies from bmw . welteke , 61 , offered his resignation to the bundesbank 's executive council , the central bank said in a statement .
the board accepted his resignation , saying the step was " appropriate in view of the bank 's reputation and the perception of its duties . " last week , welteke took a leave of absence with pay from his job , although the bank 's board said at the time that it did not find reason enough to ask for welteke 's resignation . welteke , germany 's highest-paid public official and the country 's representative at the european central bank , came under fire when it emerged that dresdner bank , a commercial bank , had picked up the tab for a four-night stay for him and his family in berlin 's luxurious adlon hotel during celebrations marking the introduction of euro notes and coins on january 1 , 2002 .
the hotel bill came to € 7,600 -lrb- $ 9,200 -rrb- . but the straw that broke the camel 's back appears to be a further revelation that welteke attended a formula 1 race in monaco at the invitation of german auto manufacturer bmw , according to a report in the german news weekly der spiegel which appeared on friday .
this particular case proved more problematic for welteke , because it took place in the spring of 2003 - after the european central bank , whose rules welteke is subject to , issued a code of conduct forbidding the acceptance of such gifts .
the dresdner bank incident took place before that . scandal angered germans the hotel scandal first came to light when the newsmagazine der spiegel reported that welteke had ignored potential conflicts of interest , given that the bundesbank is partly responsible for regulating the german banking sector . the free stay for the banker angered many germans , especially since welteke earns € 350,000 -lrb- $ 421,000 -rrb- a year .
mixing business with pleasure , the central banker confirmed that he , his wife and their three-year-old son , as well as his 25-year-old son and his son 's girlfriend , had stayed at the hotel .

the head of germany 's central bank , ernst welteke , resigned friday after further revelations he accepted freebies from bmw . welteke , 61 , offered his resignation to the bundesbank 's executive council , the central bank said in a statement .
the board accepted his resignation , saying the step was " appropriate in view of the bank 's reputation and the perception of its duties . " last week , welteke took a leave of absence with pay from his job , although the bank 's board said at the time that it did not find reason enough to ask for welteke 's resignation . welteke , germany 's highest-paid public official and the country 's representative at the european central bank , came under fire when it emerged that dresdner bank , a commercial bank , had picked up the tab for a four-night stay for him and his family in berlin 's luxurious adlon hotel during celebrations marking the introduction of euro notes and coins on january 1 , 2002 .
the hotel bill came to € 7,600 -lrb- $ 9,200 -rrb- . but the straw that broke the camel 's back appears to be a further revelation that welteke attended a formula 1 race in monaco at the invitation of german auto manufacturer bmw , according to a report in the german news weekly der spiegel which appeared on friday .
this particular case proved more problematic for welteke , because it took place in the spring of 2003 - after the european central bank , whose rules welteke is subject to , issued a code of conduct forbidding the acceptance of such gifts .
the dresdner bank incident took place before that . scandal angered germans the hotel scandal first came to light when the newsmagazine der spiegel reported that welteke had ignored potential conflicts of interest , given that the bundesbank is partly responsible for regulating the german banking sector . the free stay for the banker angered many germans , especially since welteke earns € 350,000 -lrb- $ 421,000 -rrb- a year .
mixing business with pleasure , the central banker confirmed that he , his wife and their three-year-old son , as well as his 25-year-old son and his son 's girlfriend , had stayed at the hotel .
in an attempt to make amends , he paid for two nights of the stay himself , while the bundesbank covered the days welteke was working during the trip . government wanted resignation members of the ruling social democratic party , of which welteke is a member , made little secret of the fact they wanted him to resign over the affair .
german finance minister hans eichel said it was up to the bundesbank , which enjoys considerable independence under german law , to review the case , but added that the conduct would have been unacceptable if welteke had been a government minister . there has been no immediate word on a successor , who under german law must be appointed by the government .
speculation has centered on bundesbank vice president jürgen stark and caio koch-weser , the deputy finance minister . koch-weser has plenty of international financial experience from his years at the finance ministry and his time at the world bank in washington .
he was nominated by germany to take over the international monetary fund in 2000 , but his candidacy was vetoed by the u.s. government at the time , saying the post should go to someone with a higher profile . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pressure mounts on bank chief to quit over perks scandal amid a legal probe and media hostility , calls are growing louder for germany 's embattled bundesbank chief ernst welteke to resign over his acceptance of a luxury hotel stay paid for by a bank he regulates .

the head of germany 's central bank , ernst welteke , resigned friday after further revelations he accepted freebies from bmw . welteke , 61 , offered his resignation to the bundesbank 's executive council , the central bank said in a statement .
the board accepted his resignation , saying the step was " appropriate in view of the bank 's reputation and the perception of its duties . " last week , welteke took a leave of absence with pay from his job , although the bank 's board said at the time that it did not find reason enough to ask for welteke 's resignation . welteke , germany 's highest-paid public official and the country 's representative at the european central bank , came under fire when it emerged that dresdner bank , a commercial bank , had picked up the tab for a four-night stay for him and his family in berlin 's luxurious adlon hotel during celebrations marking the introduction of euro notes and coins on january 1 , 2002 .
the hotel bill came to € 7,600 -lrb- $ 9,200 -rrb- . but the straw that broke the camel 's back appears to be a further revelation that welteke attended a formula 1 race in monaco at the invitation of german auto manufacturer bmw , according to a report in the german news weekly der spiegel which appeared on friday .
this particular case proved more problematic for welteke , because it took place in the spring of 2003 - after the european central bank , whose rules welteke is subject to , issued a code of conduct forbidding the acceptance of such gifts .
the dresdner bank incident took place before that . scandal angered germans the hotel scandal first came to light when the newsmagazine der spiegel reported that welteke had ignored potential conflicts of interest , given that the bundesbank is partly responsible for regulating the german banking sector . the free stay for the banker angered many germans , especially since welteke earns € 350,000 -lrb- $ 421,000 -rrb- a year .
mixing business with pleasure , the central banker confirmed that he , his wife and their three-year-old son , as well as his 25-year-old son and his son 's girlfriend , had stayed at the hotel .

at a joint news conference , mr blair declared : " we will do what it takes to win this struggle .
" we will not back down in the face of attacks either on us or on defenceless civilians , " he said .
like mr bush , he backed israeli prime minister ariel sharon 's controversial plans for palestinian land .
but iraq was the focus of the talks amid the continuing violence in the country .
mr blair has arrived back in the uk following the summit .
speaking bluntly ?
it follows disquiet about some of the us military 's tactics .
former foreign secretary robin cook urged mr blair to tell the president " bluntly " he was pursuing the wrong policies .
it is clear that unless all parties engage and agree on the path to peace , the road map will remain in jeopardy charles kennedy liberal democrat leader allies ' will not waver ' on iraq and liberal democrat leader charles kennedy said heavy-handed tactics by us troops risked driving young muslims into the arms of radicals .
conservative leader michael howard said he was disappointed there had been no mention of appointing a senior british official as the deputy head of the coalition .
britain was " punching above its weight " militarily because of the strength of its armed forces , said mr howard .
" we are seen to be punching a bit below our weight in iraq politically and diplomatically because we lack that powerful voice and because we do not have a sufficient say on day-to-day decisions on what is happening on the ground . "
sacrifices whatever the words in private , mr blair showed public solidarity with mr bush in the white house rose garden .
" we mourn each loss of life , " he said .
" we salute them and their families for their bravery and their sacrifice .
" our promise to them in return is clear .
it is to succeed .
to get the job done .
to ensure their courage and sacrifice has not been in vain . "
president bush owes it to him to listen today robin cook former uk foreign secretary us warms to un 's plan mr blair said the united nations would play a " central role " in the transition of power in iraq , and he hoped for a new security council resolution on the country .
mr bush declared : " the prime minister and i have made our choice .
iraq will be free .
iraq will be independent .
iraq will be a peaceful nation and we will not waver in the face of fear of intimidation . "
the summit has coincided with indications from senior us officials that they are prepared to accept a plan prepared by un special envoy lakhdar brahimi .
it proposes replacing the us-appointed iraqi governing council with a caretaker government after the 30 june handover .
new opportunity ?
with those preparations continuing , the attention this week has switched back to the middle east peace efforts .
mr sharon plans to withdraw from palestinian land in the gaza strip , but retain jewish settlements built in the west bank in defiance of international law .
there had been speculation that mr bush 's support for the plan this week would have irritated the prime minister .
but mr blair insisted the existing " roadmap " peace plan was not being abandoned , nor did the proposals prejudge any final settlement in the middle east .
" what it does give us is at least the possibility of moving it forward , " he said .
he urged the international community to " get involved " with the plan .
mr bush called the plan a good opportunity .
" it gives the palestinians a chance to create a reformed , just and free government .

former foreign secretary robin cook urged mr blair to tell the president " bluntly " he was pursuing the wrong policies .
it is clear that unless all parties engage and agree on the path to peace , the road map will remain in jeopardy charles kennedy liberal democrat leader allies ' will not waver ' on iraq and liberal democrat leader charles kennedy said heavy-handed tactics by us troops risked driving young muslims into the arms of radicals .
conservative leader michael howard said he was disappointed there had been no mention of appointing a senior british official as the deputy head of the coalition .
britain was " punching above its weight " militarily because of the strength of its armed forces , said mr howard .
" we are seen to be punching a bit below our weight in iraq politically and diplomatically because we lack that powerful voice and because we do not have a sufficient say on day-to-day decisions on what is happening on the ground . "
sacrifices whatever the words in private , mr blair showed public solidarity with mr bush in the white house rose garden .
" we mourn each loss of life , " he said .
" we salute them and their families for their bravery and their sacrifice .
" our promise to them in return is clear .
it is to succeed .
to get the job done .
to ensure their courage and sacrifice has not been in vain . "
president bush owes it to him to listen today robin cook former uk foreign secretary us warms to un 's plan mr blair said the united nations would play a " central role " in the transition of power in iraq , and he hoped for a new security council resolution on the country .
mr bush declared : " the prime minister and i have made our choice .
iraq will be free .
iraq will be independent .
iraq will be a peaceful nation and we will not waver in the face of fear of intimidation . "
the summit has coincided with indications from senior us officials that they are prepared to accept a plan prepared by un special envoy lakhdar brahimi .
it proposes replacing the us-appointed iraqi governing council with a caretaker government after the 30 june handover .
new opportunity ?
with those preparations continuing , the attention this week has switched back to the middle east peace efforts .
mr sharon plans to withdraw from palestinian land in the gaza strip , but retain jewish settlements built in the west bank in defiance of international law .
there had been speculation that mr bush 's support for the plan this week would have irritated the prime minister .
but mr blair insisted the existing " roadmap " peace plan was not being abandoned , nor did the proposals prejudge any final settlement in the middle east .
" what it does give us is at least the possibility of moving it forward , " he said .
he urged the international community to " get involved " with the plan .
mr bush called the plan a good opportunity .
" it gives the palestinians a chance to create a reformed , just and free government .
lib dem leader charles kennedy said mr blair 's endorsement of the israeli plan risked fuelling palestinian resentment .

us firm vocera has created a wireless voice communicator just like they use in star trek : the next generation .
similar to the tv series , all you do to contact someone is press the talk button on the lapel badge , say their name , and you will be put through .
the gadget is proving popular in hospitals to make it easier for nurses to find and get advice from doctors .
talk time the vocera communications system channels voice calls via a wi-fi network to recognise who someone is trying to reach and then to connect them .
servers do the job of decoding speech to recognise names , find out if the person is available and then a portion of the wireless network is reserved so the people can speak to each other .
the gadget is popular in hospitals " it 's pretty futuristic , " said keerti melkote , co-founder of aruba networks that is a partner of vocera .
" it 's very neat , smaller than a cell phone and very lightweight , " he told bbc news online .
although the voice recognition system needs a bit of training to match names with the way people pronounce them , the system can be working well within a few days , said mr melkote .
early customers for the vocera communicator were hospitals who like the fact that it lets nurses talk directly to doctors .
" we 're focussing on healthcare to help provide bedside patient care and replace pager type calls , " he said .
he said pagers can just lead to people leaving endless numbers of messages for each other but never actually speaking .
mr melkote said the communicator was ideal for workplaces where staff move around a lot , are spread around large campuses or across several buildings .
the battery-powered gadget can either be clipped to a lapel or worn on a lanyard around the neck .

talk time the vocera communications system channels voice calls via a wi-fi network to recognise who someone is trying to reach and then to connect them .
servers do the job of decoding speech to recognise names , find out if the person is available and then a portion of the wireless network is reserved so the people can speak to each other .
the gadget is popular in hospitals " it 's pretty futuristic , " said keerti melkote , co-founder of aruba networks that is a partner of vocera .
" it 's very neat , smaller than a cell phone and very lightweight , " he told bbc news online .
although the voice recognition system needs a bit of training to match names with the way people pronounce them , the system can be working well within a few days , said mr melkote .
early customers for the vocera communicator were hospitals who like the fact that it lets nurses talk directly to doctors .
" we 're focussing on healthcare to help provide bedside patient care and replace pager type calls , " he said .
he said pagers can just lead to people leaving endless numbers of messages for each other but never actually speaking .
mr melkote said the communicator was ideal for workplaces where staff move around a lot , are spread around large campuses or across several buildings .
the battery-powered gadget can either be clipped to a lapel or worn on a lanyard around the neck .

network rail say the work prompted by february 's torrential rain should be complete in time for summer timetables .
stretches of the conwy valley line near llanrwst were completely swept away in the floods , leaving some track dangling in mid air .
alternative bus services have been running for passengers on the line during nearly four months of repairs .
entire communities in the valley were completely cut off when the river conwy burst its banks in the floods in early february .
a 10 mile stretch of railway line between tal-y-cafn and betws-y-coed was badly hit with parts of embankment washed away and huge gaps left underneath parts of the track .
celebration " the flooding was to such an extent that this work had to be done and the rail line temporarily closed , " said a network rail spokeswoman .
" rather than repair the line temporarily it was decided to do everything from scratch . "
engineers have concentrated on three areas of track - renovating the actual track , relevelling the ground beneath and protecting the embankments to stop further landslide .
another week of spring floods in early march set back the project by a week , but it is now hoped to be complete by 22 may .
arriva trains wales which operates services on the conwy valley line said they had been working with local groups to plan a reopening celebration in time for the may timetable .
" we have also been identifying new promotional opportunities for our customers to explore the line , including an enhanced red rover ticket , " said ben davies , stakeholder liaison manager .
" this will be an integrated rail and bus ticket allowing our customers to travel within a specified area .
this one-day ticket will be available for use when the line re-opens in may . "

the affairs , even if not physical , are damaging to relationships , the british psychological society 's annual conference was told .
more than half of 245 students who took part in a survey carried out by belfast 's queens university said anyone flirting online was being unfaithful .
experts said they were often a symptom of a relationship in trouble .
dr monica whitty , of queen 's university asked students to complete stories in which one partner in a couple had developed a relationship over the internet . "
it might be easier for people to justify an online affair to themselves , but the consequences can be just as damaging as an offline affair " dr monica whitty the stories were then studied to see if the online affair was interpreted as infidelity .
in 51 % of cases it was , while 84 % of the students thought the other partner would feel betrayed .
women were more likely than men to see the internet affair as damaging to the real life relationship .
friendship however , some people argued that the interaction was just a friendship or could not be infidelity because no sex was taking place .
dr whitty said : " the results of this study show that couples need to be clear what the rules are when it comes to online cheating .
" emotional involvement , even without physical consummation , can be just as damaging to a relationship .
" it might be easier for people to justify an online affair to themselves , but the consequences , like loss of trust or hurt , can be just as damaging as an offline affair . "
christine northam , a senior counsellor at relationship guidance experts relate , agreed there was a danger in internet relationships .
she said they were often a reaction to dissatisfaction in a relationship with one member of the couple thinking they could solve it by having a " fantasy " connection online .
she said : " up to a point it is ok , but past the boundary is where it is not .
" where the boundary is depends on the individual relationship . "
rather than resort to internet affairs , people should face up to problems in their relationships by talking to their partner .
if they felt unable to do that alone , they should go to a counsellor , she said .
she added : " just to bury your head in the sand is not going to solve anything .
" the best thing to do is take your courage in your hands , sit down and have a chat about what you are feeling and what bugs you . "
