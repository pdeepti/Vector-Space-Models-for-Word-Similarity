according to sources quoted in a report by automotive news europe , vw intends to bring forward by 12 months the introduction of an all-new polo small car to 2007 .
the car manufacturer will also shift its strategy in the mini-car segment , selling the new brazilian-built fox , which replaces its slow-selling lupo mini-car , as a two-door version only to reduce competition with the polo .
the fox will be priced up to € 2,000 -lrb- $ 2,400 -rrb- less than the current € 10,150 lupo it replaces despite being over 30 centimeters longer .
the strategic change is a response to demands from vw 's works council and its dealers in germany who want a budget-priced car to compete with asian imports and the top sellers in the mini-car segment .
vw sold just 43,188 lupos in western europe last year . more briefs 27.07.2004 -pipe- german business confidence rises in july 26.07.2004 -pipe- german states favor longer opening hours 26.07.2004 -pipe- consumers in germany hit by oil price hike 26.07.2004 -pipe- ex-east german brown coal firm marks 10-year milestone 26.07.2004 -pipe- germany starts first unofficial summer sale 23.07.2004 -pipe- economist : longer workweek risks deflation 23.07.2004 -pipe- german air traffic controllers allowed to strike 23.07.2004 -pipe- greens : no record deficit in 2004 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

prodi has said the center-left is ready " to take on general elections at any time if and when the government were to fall through as a result of an internal crisis . "
in the last few months , the center-right governing coalition has faced several crises , with berlusconi struggling to keep his fractured four-party coalition together .

more freeways are needed , but their construction remains controversial and expensive . the completion of the a17 autobahn , the freeway which will eventually run from the city of dresden to the czech border , will mean very different things depending on who you talk to . to its proponents , it will close a gaping hole in europe 's freeway system and encourage economic growth by keeping pace with the continent 's fast-growing international road transport needs .
to its detractors , it will dirty the air in dresden , threaten sensitive natural habitats and increase traffic in the region .
in short , it will represent a wrong approach to transport planning . all can agree on one thing though , it will have been an expensive and protracted project - in the works since 1991 , in the end the 44.6 kilometer -lrb- 27.7 mile -rrb- stretch to the czech republic , estimated to be completed in 2006 and to carry up to 72,000 vehicles per day , will have cost at least € 650 million -lrb- $ 790 million -rrb- to build . the rocky history of this costly road highlights a common problem regarding transport in germany today : how to balance the growing needs of highway transportation and economic growth with protection for the environment and the people who live near autobahn routes . armin reck , press spokesman for the saxony highway department , has been involved with the a17 since its early days .
he was brought in to sell the idea to the public , since the project was almost shelved due to vocal opposition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opponents say the stretch runs through sensitive habitats groups ranging from traditional environmental activists to farmers to the clergy - " pastors against the a17 " - hit the streets in protest , camped out in trees slated for felling , and went to court to stop the freeway . " it was astounding what kind of groups came out against this freeway , " reck told dw-world as he drove along the nine-kilometer stretch of almost-completed tunnels and bridges that has turned into once of the most expensive sections of an already costly project . eu 's transport backbone despite the sky-high sums involved , economists and business leaders agree that there is a critical need to improve and expand germany 's aging network of freeways .
given germany 's new central position within the eu , after the may 1 expansion added ten new members mostly in eastern europe , the freeway system is now the backbone of international road shipping in europe .
whether goods are going from poland to spain or sweden to greece , if they are going by road , it is likely they will pass through germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : truck traffic is estimated to increase dramatically .
as trade increases between new and old members of the eu , traffic is likely to increase .
conservative estimates say by 2010 , the number of trucks travelling on german freeways will double ; other forecasts say the number will quadruple .
if germany 's already overburdened system is not beefed up , many fear , goods could be delayed crossing the continent and economic development could suffer . " traffic and economic growth are related closely to one another , " ralf stock , head of the department of traffic engineering , told dw-world .
" it 's a fact that during the past 30 years , the development of the gross domestic product and the passenger and freight transport service has been very similar . " while other eu countries have on average increased their highway networks by 70 percent since 1991 , germany has only added 10 percent to its own system .
highway planners now work into their calculations the consequences of protests and lawsuits from various interest groups , which have become almost as inevitable as death and taxes . difficult birth plans for an autobahn between dresden and the czech border are not new .
the nazis drew up plans for a highway in 1938 , but they were scrapped during the war .
the east germans considered building as well , but their government collapsed before they could start digging .
after reunification in 1990 , the project got new priority status and in 1991 planning began - shortly thereafter , so did the protests . the issue became so contentious that the highway department , for the first time , put the matter to the public in a 1995 referendum , and won .
but , to get public approval , the department decided to accommodate many of the concerns of freeway opponents . engineers sank most of the autobahn up to twelve meters below the surface , to provide noise protection and give a psychological boost to surrounding residents .
" if they ca n't actually see the freeway , they 're less likely to complain about it , " the highway department 's reck said . spanning the road will be two so-called " green bridges , " which were demanded by environmentalists who wanted animals to be able cross the highway safely and by local residents who insisted that a wooded area near the ruins of a manor torn down by the nazis be preserved .
the two bridges cost around € 8 million to build . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other environmental protection measures include noise protection panels that line much of the freeway and tunnels and guidance systems that allow protected species of frogs to cross the road .
local bats get their own tunnel with ultrasonic technology to guide them through . " on average , every third euro for street or highway construction is spent on environmental protection , " said reck . quality of life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the costs , even those who want to see more kilometers of autobahn and more lanes to already existing ones are wary of jettisoning germany 's strict environmental laws in favor of unfettered highway construction .
they say they are necessary to maintain the quality of life in this densely populated country , whose road network is already one of the most extensive in europe . but if some costs could come down , experts say , construction could be moved along , and autobahn supply might keep up with future trucking demands . " financing is often a problem because of the large expenses involved , " kay lindemann , head of the traffic policy department at the federation of german endustry , told dw-world .
" environmental protection measures often drive those costs up . " armin reck , however , is fairly good natured about the costs as well as the drawn-out and often controversial planning and construction process .
" we have to respect people 's interests , they have to live near the autobahn after all , " he said . " besides , planning started in 1991 and we 're going to open one part in october 2004 .

more freeways are needed , but their construction remains controversial and expensive . the completion of the a17 autobahn , the freeway which will eventually run from the city of dresden to the czech border , will mean very different things depending on who you talk to . to its proponents , it will close a gaping hole in europe 's freeway system and encourage economic growth by keeping pace with the continent 's fast-growing international road transport needs .
to its detractors , it will dirty the air in dresden , threaten sensitive natural habitats and increase traffic in the region .
in short , it will represent a wrong approach to transport planning . all can agree on one thing though , it will have been an expensive and protracted project - in the works since 1991 , in the end the 44.6 kilometer -lrb- 27.7 mile -rrb- stretch to the czech republic , estimated to be completed in 2006 and to carry up to 72,000 vehicles per day , will have cost at least € 650 million -lrb- $ 790 million -rrb- to build . the rocky history of this costly road highlights a common problem regarding transport in germany today : how to balance the growing needs of highway transportation and economic growth with protection for the environment and the people who live near autobahn routes . armin reck , press spokesman for the saxony highway department , has been involved with the a17 since its early days .
he was brought in to sell the idea to the public , since the project was almost shelved due to vocal opposition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opponents say the stretch runs through sensitive habitats groups ranging from traditional environmental activists to farmers to the clergy - " pastors against the a17 " - hit the streets in protest , camped out in trees slated for felling , and went to court to stop the freeway . " it was astounding what kind of groups came out against this freeway , " reck told dw-world as he drove along the nine-kilometer stretch of almost-completed tunnels and bridges that has turned into once of the most expensive sections of an already costly project . eu 's transport backbone despite the sky-high sums involved , economists and business leaders agree that there is a critical need to improve and expand germany 's aging network of freeways .
given germany 's new central position within the eu , after the may 1 expansion added ten new members mostly in eastern europe , the freeway system is now the backbone of international road shipping in europe .
whether goods are going from poland to spain or sweden to greece , if they are going by road , it is likely they will pass through germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : truck traffic is estimated to increase dramatically .
as trade increases between new and old members of the eu , traffic is likely to increase .
conservative estimates say by 2010 , the number of trucks travelling on german freeways will double ; other forecasts say the number will quadruple .
if germany 's already overburdened system is not beefed up , many fear , goods could be delayed crossing the continent and economic development could suffer . " traffic and economic growth are related closely to one another , " ralf stock , head of the department of traffic engineering , told dw-world .
" it 's a fact that during the past 30 years , the development of the gross domestic product and the passenger and freight transport service has been very similar . " while other eu countries have on average increased their highway networks by 70 percent since 1991 , germany has only added 10 percent to its own system .
highway planners now work into their calculations the consequences of protests and lawsuits from various interest groups , which have become almost as inevitable as death and taxes . difficult birth plans for an autobahn between dresden and the czech border are not new .
the nazis drew up plans for a highway in 1938 , but they were scrapped during the war .
the east germans considered building as well , but their government collapsed before they could start digging .
after reunification in 1990 , the project got new priority status and in 1991 planning began - shortly thereafter , so did the protests . the issue became so contentious that the highway department , for the first time , put the matter to the public in a 1995 referendum , and won .
but , to get public approval , the department decided to accommodate many of the concerns of freeway opponents . engineers sank most of the autobahn up to twelve meters below the surface , to provide noise protection and give a psychological boost to surrounding residents .
" if they ca n't actually see the freeway , they 're less likely to complain about it , " the highway department 's reck said . spanning the road will be two so-called " green bridges , " which were demanded by environmentalists who wanted animals to be able cross the highway safely and by local residents who insisted that a wooded area near the ruins of a manor torn down by the nazis be preserved .
the two bridges cost around € 8 million to build . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other environmental protection measures include noise protection panels that line much of the freeway and tunnels and guidance systems that allow protected species of frogs to cross the road .
local bats get their own tunnel with ultrasonic technology to guide them through . " on average , every third euro for street or highway construction is spent on environmental protection , " said reck . quality of life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the costs , even those who want to see more kilometers of autobahn and more lanes to already existing ones are wary of jettisoning germany 's strict environmental laws in favor of unfettered highway construction .
they say they are necessary to maintain the quality of life in this densely populated country , whose road network is already one of the most extensive in europe . but if some costs could come down , experts say , construction could be moved along , and autobahn supply might keep up with future trucking demands .

" it would allow people to communicate in their language , or to obtain documents in that language , " james fife of eurolang , the newsagency attached to the european buro for lesser used languages , told dw-world .

but would other countries want the same treatment for their pockets of linguistic diversity ?
according to fife , it varies from place to place .

not all states are minority language-friendly , " fife said .

according to fife , it varies from place to place .

" we will never reach the stage where people who live in sorbian areas have to be able to speak both languages , because we do not have territorial autonomy , " zies added .

but new efforts are being made to strenghten the bloc 's cultural diversity . when spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero took office earlier this year , he decided to take a new linguistic approach than his predecessor .
within just a matter of weeks he had called on his counterparts in the european union to grant spain 's regional languages official recognition in the future european constitution . if the eu agrees to madrid 's request , catalan , basque and galician will be awarded ' treaty status ' .
" it would allow people to communicate in their language , or to obtain documents in that language , " james fife of eurolang , the newsagency attached to the european buro for lesser used languages , told dw-world .
and given that there are more speakers of catalan than of either slovenian or maltese - which has not yet become an eu working language - it does n't seem an altogether unfair request . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish prime minister , jose luis rodriguez zapatero however , spain 's conservative opposition slammed zapatero 's demand for recognition , saying it was nothing more than a stunt aimed at sweetening his nationalist coalition partners .
but whatever the motives , fife welcomes spain 's nurturing approach , and would like to see other european states take their cue from madrid 's lead . " even if spain were successful in achieving treaty status , it is hard to see how there would be a snowball effect .
not all states are minority language-friendly , " fife said .
for many regional languages , simply gaining recognition on home ground is a steep enough mountain to climb .
" it 's often all that national minorities can do to maintain themselves , in many cases they are losing their fight to stay alive , " he concluded . eastern europe provides new impetus interestingly enough , the new eu member states have dusted off the issue of minority european languages , and put it squarely back on the table .
while western european governments have traditionally tended to close their ears to regional tongues , the approach in the east is quite different .
many of the ten new countries were forced into a life of russian , and are only too glad to have the chance to promote their own linguistic heritages . although the eu is home to more than 40 minority languages - with tens of million speakers - the only one on the whole continent actually entitled to the status of official working language , is gaelic , and that is only the case because gaelic is an official language of the republic of ireland .
but would other countries want the same treatment for their pockets of linguistic diversity ?
according to fife , it varies from place to place .
he cites hungary as great believer in the promotion of its 15 sub-languages , and france as country which is doggedly determined not to acknowledge it linguistic treasure chest . fife said germany , with its slavic sorbian minority , is somewhere in the middle .
" germany does n't have quite the same negative attitude to minority languages .
it provides some support and recognition , more than the french , " he said . keeping sorbian alive but the official association of sorbs feels that germany 's federal government could do more to integrate sorbian into the regional and national consciousness .
although the government currently stumps up an annual budget for the promotion of sorbian culture , it has already threatened to cut its contributions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sorbian girls in traditional dress. dressed in their traditional with a total of 60,000 speakers of upper sorbian and lower sorbian in the states of saxony and brandenburg , local residents can theoretically go from one day to the next without speaking any german .
theoretical , however , is the operative word .
" many people ca n't speak sorbian , but those who work for the local authorities , and the police etc , should be bi-lingual .
if sorbs saw that they could use their language freely , they would do so , " bernhard zies , managing director of the association for lausitzer sorbs told dw-world . it 's an ideal which remains far from reality .
even measures to revitalize the language , such as the introduction of bi-lingual kindergartens and schooling , are unlikely to make it as important to germany as catalan appears to be to spain . " we will never reach the stage where people who live in sorbian areas have to be able to speak both languages , because we do not have territorial autonomy , " zies added .

according to sources quoted in a report by automotive news europe , vw intends to bring forward by 12 months the introduction of an all-new polo small car to 2007 .
the car manufacturer will also shift its strategy in the mini-car segment , selling the new brazilian-built fox , which replaces its slow-selling lupo mini-car , as a two-door version only to reduce competition with the polo .

more freeways are needed , but their construction remains controversial and expensive . the completion of the a17 autobahn , the freeway which will eventually run from the city of dresden to the czech border , will mean very different things depending on who you talk to . to its proponents , it will close a gaping hole in europe 's freeway system and encourage economic growth by keeping pace with the continent 's fast-growing international road transport needs .
to its detractors , it will dirty the air in dresden , threaten sensitive natural habitats and increase traffic in the region .
in short , it will represent a wrong approach to transport planning . all can agree on one thing though , it will have been an expensive and protracted project - in the works since 1991 , in the end the 44.6 kilometer -lrb- 27.7 mile -rrb- stretch to the czech republic , estimated to be completed in 2006 and to carry up to 72,000 vehicles per day , will have cost at least € 650 million -lrb- $ 790 million -rrb- to build . the rocky history of this costly road highlights a common problem regarding transport in germany today : how to balance the growing needs of highway transportation and economic growth with protection for the environment and the people who live near autobahn routes . armin reck , press spokesman for the saxony highway department , has been involved with the a17 since its early days .
he was brought in to sell the idea to the public , since the project was almost shelved due to vocal opposition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opponents say the stretch runs through sensitive habitats groups ranging from traditional environmental activists to farmers to the clergy - " pastors against the a17 " - hit the streets in protest , camped out in trees slated for felling , and went to court to stop the freeway . " it was astounding what kind of groups came out against this freeway , " reck told dw-world as he drove along the nine-kilometer stretch of almost-completed tunnels and bridges that has turned into once of the most expensive sections of an already costly project . eu 's transport backbone despite the sky-high sums involved , economists and business leaders agree that there is a critical need to improve and expand germany 's aging network of freeways .
given germany 's new central position within the eu , after the may 1 expansion added ten new members mostly in eastern europe , the freeway system is now the backbone of international road shipping in europe .

" traffic and economic growth are related closely to one another , " ralf stock , head of the department of traffic engineering , told dw-world .
" it 's a fact that during the past 30 years , the development of the gross domestic product and the passenger and freight transport service has been very similar . " while other eu countries have on average increased their highway networks by 70 percent since 1991 , germany has only added 10 percent to its own system .
highway planners now work into their calculations the consequences of protests and lawsuits from various interest groups , which have become almost as inevitable as death and taxes . difficult birth plans for an autobahn between dresden and the czech border are not new .

but , to get public approval , the department decided to accommodate many of the concerns of freeway opponents . engineers sank most of the autobahn up to twelve meters below the surface , to provide noise protection and give a psychological boost to surrounding residents .
" if they ca n't actually see the freeway , they 're less likely to complain about it , " the highway department 's reck said . spanning the road will be two so-called " green bridges , " which were demanded by environmentalists who wanted animals to be able cross the highway safely and by local residents who insisted that a wooded area near the ruins of a manor torn down by the nazis be preserved .

more freeways are needed , but their construction remains controversial and expensive . the completion of the a17 autobahn , the freeway which will eventually run from the city of dresden to the czech border , will mean very different things depending on who you talk to . to its proponents , it will close a gaping hole in europe 's freeway system and encourage economic growth by keeping pace with the continent 's fast-growing international road transport needs .
to its detractors , it will dirty the air in dresden , threaten sensitive natural habitats and increase traffic in the region .
in short , it will represent a wrong approach to transport planning . all can agree on one thing though , it will have been an expensive and protracted project - in the works since 1991 , in the end the 44.6 kilometer -lrb- 27.7 mile -rrb- stretch to the czech republic , estimated to be completed in 2006 and to carry up to 72,000 vehicles per day , will have cost at least € 650 million -lrb- $ 790 million -rrb- to build . the rocky history of this costly road highlights a common problem regarding transport in germany today : how to balance the growing needs of highway transportation and economic growth with protection for the environment and the people who live near autobahn routes . armin reck , press spokesman for the saxony highway department , has been involved with the a17 since its early days .
he was brought in to sell the idea to the public , since the project was almost shelved due to vocal opposition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opponents say the stretch runs through sensitive habitats groups ranging from traditional environmental activists to farmers to the clergy - " pastors against the a17 " - hit the streets in protest , camped out in trees slated for felling , and went to court to stop the freeway . " it was astounding what kind of groups came out against this freeway , " reck told dw-world as he drove along the nine-kilometer stretch of almost-completed tunnels and bridges that has turned into once of the most expensive sections of an already costly project . eu 's transport backbone despite the sky-high sums involved , economists and business leaders agree that there is a critical need to improve and expand germany 's aging network of freeways .
given germany 's new central position within the eu , after the may 1 expansion added ten new members mostly in eastern europe , the freeway system is now the backbone of international road shipping in europe .
whether goods are going from poland to spain or sweden to greece , if they are going by road , it is likely they will pass through germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : truck traffic is estimated to increase dramatically .
as trade increases between new and old members of the eu , traffic is likely to increase .
conservative estimates say by 2010 , the number of trucks travelling on german freeways will double ; other forecasts say the number will quadruple .
if germany 's already overburdened system is not beefed up , many fear , goods could be delayed crossing the continent and economic development could suffer . " traffic and economic growth are related closely to one another , " ralf stock , head of the department of traffic engineering , told dw-world .
" it 's a fact that during the past 30 years , the development of the gross domestic product and the passenger and freight transport service has been very similar . " while other eu countries have on average increased their highway networks by 70 percent since 1991 , germany has only added 10 percent to its own system .
highway planners now work into their calculations the consequences of protests and lawsuits from various interest groups , which have become almost as inevitable as death and taxes . difficult birth plans for an autobahn between dresden and the czech border are not new .

in spain , the country 's southern regions have been sweltering in temperatures of more than 40 degrees celsius -lrb- 104 fahrenheit -rrb- since last week and have claimed an estimated eleven lives so far .
the most recent victims , a 32-year-old man and an 82-year-old woman who died of heat strokes in the southern cities of cordoba and jaen respectively , were discovered on monday while a 78-year-old woman died of a circulatory failure brought on by the high temperatures on the canary island of tenerife over the weekend .
in the spanish capital , madrid , temperatures have hit 39.3c -lrb- 103f -rrb- - a 73-year high .
the latest heat wave brings back memories of the extreme heat that swept through europe last summer , killing thousands .
exceptionally hot weather killed at least 141 people in spain last year .
france braces as bad memories return in france , which was hardest hit last year in the heat wave that killed an estimated 15,000 people , president jacques chirac told his ministers monday to keep their summer vacations short this year as fears of a repeat of last summer 's tragedy begin to circulate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bodies of the dead were stored in refrigerated makeshift morgues in paris .
the death of thousands of mostly elderly french citizens caused outrage as it was revealed that government ministers initially refused to cut short their holidays to respond to the extraordinary conditions in august 2003 .
the number of dead and increasing temperatures caused havoc and led to the use of makeshift insulated morgues across the french capital -lrb- photo -rrb- . jean-francois mattei , who was health minister at the time , was eventually sacked in a cabinet reshuffle months after being seen on television in a t-shirt in his villa in south of france insisting that there was nothing to worry about at the beginning of the hot weather . his replacement , philippe douste-blazy , has promised that , he would return to paris from his summer vacation " at the drop of a hat " if similar conditions look likely this summer .
jacques chirac , however , will again be overseas this year .
the french president failed to return from his vacation in canada during last summer 's deadly heat wave .
huge swathes of portugal 's forests lost meanwhile hundreds of firefighters , backed by water trucks , helicopters and planes , continued to battle fires across portugal on monday .
the tourist region of faro on portugal 's southern coast was hardest hit , with more than 150 firefighters working in mountains near the spa town of monchique , a spokesman for the national emergency service said .
it is the second consecutive year of extreme forest fires in portugal .
in 2003 , huge fires destroyed 13 percent of its forests and woodlands and claimed 18 lives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : firefighters also extinguished a major fire in the arrabida natural park , 30 miles south of lisbon on monday .
the fire in the park , which is home to protected species like the wildcat and the mongoose , was eventually put out after destroying over 900 hectares of wilderness .
several beaches in the area had to be evacuated on sunday and remained closed to the public on tuesday .
there were no reports of injuries in any of the fires .
eu neighbors on alert with aid greece is sending two planes to portugal to fight the fires while italy has put an aircraft on standby following the country 's plea for help , the eu executive commission said in a statement .
the high temperatures and strong dry winds have made it harder to control the many fires blazing all over the country .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 27.07.2004 a rocky road for germany 's autobahn großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 12 years in the making , and the a17 autobahn is n't finished yet the eu 's eastern expansion has made germany 's freeway system essential for cross-european freight transport .
more freeways are needed , but their construction remains controversial and expensive . the completion of the a17 autobahn , the freeway which will eventually run from the city of dresden to the czech border , will mean very different things depending on who you talk to . to its proponents , it will close a gaping hole in europe 's freeway system and encourage economic growth by keeping pace with the continent 's fast-growing international road transport needs .
to its detractors , it will dirty the air in dresden , threaten sensitive natural habitats and increase traffic in the region .
in short , it will represent a wrong approach to transport planning . all can agree on one thing though , it will have been an expensive and protracted project - in the works since 1991 , in the end the 44.6 kilometer -lrb- 27.7 mile -rrb- stretch to the czech republic , estimated to be completed in 2006 and to carry up to 72,000 vehicles per day , will have cost at least € 650 million -lrb- $ 790 million -rrb- to build . the rocky history of this costly road highlights a common problem regarding transport in germany today : how to balance the growing needs of highway transportation and economic growth with protection for the environment and the people who live near autobahn routes . armin reck , press spokesman for the saxony highway department , has been involved with the a17 since its early days .
he was brought in to sell the idea to the public , since the project was almost shelved due to vocal opposition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opponents say the stretch runs through sensitive habitats groups ranging from traditional environmental activists to farmers to the clergy - " pastors against the a17 " - hit the streets in protest , camped out in trees slated for felling , and went to court to stop the freeway . " it was astounding what kind of groups came out against this freeway , " reck told dw-world as he drove along the nine-kilometer stretch of almost-completed tunnels and bridges that has turned into once of the most expensive sections of an already costly project . eu 's transport backbone despite the sky-high sums involved , economists and business leaders agree that there is a critical need to improve and expand germany 's aging network of freeways .
given germany 's new central position within the eu , after the may 1 expansion added ten new members mostly in eastern europe , the freeway system is now the backbone of international road shipping in europe .
whether goods are going from poland to spain or sweden to greece , if they are going by road , it is likely they will pass through germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : truck traffic is estimated to increase dramatically .
as trade increases between new and old members of the eu , traffic is likely to increase .
conservative estimates say by 2010 , the number of trucks travelling on german freeways will double ; other forecasts say the number will quadruple .
if germany 's already overburdened system is not beefed up , many fear , goods could be delayed crossing the continent and economic development could suffer . " traffic and economic growth are related closely to one another , " ralf stock , head of the department of traffic engineering , told dw-world .
" it 's a fact that during the past 30 years , the development of the gross domestic product and the passenger and freight transport service has been very similar . " while other eu countries have on average increased their highway networks by 70 percent since 1991 , germany has only added 10 percent to its own system .
highway planners now work into their calculations the consequences of protests and lawsuits from various interest groups , which have become almost as inevitable as death and taxes . difficult birth plans for an autobahn between dresden and the czech border are not new .
the nazis drew up plans for a highway in 1938 , but they were scrapped during the war .
the east germans considered building as well , but their government collapsed before they could start digging .
after reunification in 1990 , the project got new priority status and in 1991 planning began - shortly thereafter , so did the protests . the issue became so contentious that the highway department , for the first time , put the matter to the public in a 1995 referendum , and won .
but , to get public approval , the department decided to accommodate many of the concerns of freeway opponents . engineers sank most of the autobahn up to twelve meters below the surface , to provide noise protection and give a psychological boost to surrounding residents .
" if they ca n't actually see the freeway , they 're less likely to complain about it , " the highway department 's reck said . spanning the road will be two so-called " green bridges , " which were demanded by environmentalists who wanted animals to be able cross the highway safely and by local residents who insisted that a wooded area near the ruins of a manor torn down by the nazis be preserved .
the two bridges cost around € 8 million to build . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other environmental protection measures include noise protection panels that line much of the freeway and tunnels and guidance systems that allow protected species of frogs to cross the road .
local bats get their own tunnel with ultrasonic technology to guide them through . " on average , every third euro for street or highway construction is spent on environmental protection , " said reck . quality of life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the costs , even those who want to see more kilometers of autobahn and more lanes to already existing ones are wary of jettisoning germany 's strict environmental laws in favor of unfettered highway construction .
they say they are necessary to maintain the quality of life in this densely populated country , whose road network is already one of the most extensive in europe . but if some costs could come down , experts say , construction could be moved along , and autobahn supply might keep up with future trucking demands . " financing is often a problem because of the large expenses involved , " kay lindemann , head of the traffic policy department at the federation of german endustry , told dw-world .
" environmental protection measures often drive those costs up . " armin reck , however , is fairly good natured about the costs as well as the drawn-out and often controversial planning and construction process .
" we have to respect people 's interests , they have to live near the autobahn after all , " he said . " besides , planning started in 1991 and we 're going to open one part in october 2004 .
for us getting such a difficult freeway built , that 's almost a world record . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putting the brakes on germany 's autobahn ?
while many sections of germany 's freeway system , or autobahn , allow drivers to cruise as fast as they want , politicians have begun calling for a general speed limit .

more freeways are needed , but their construction remains controversial and expensive . the completion of the a17 autobahn , the freeway which will eventually run from the city of dresden to the czech border , will mean very different things depending on who you talk to . to its proponents , it will close a gaping hole in europe 's freeway system and encourage economic growth by keeping pace with the continent 's fast-growing international road transport needs .
to its detractors , it will dirty the air in dresden , threaten sensitive natural habitats and increase traffic in the region .
in short , it will represent a wrong approach to transport planning . all can agree on one thing though , it will have been an expensive and protracted project - in the works since 1991 , in the end the 44.6 kilometer -lrb- 27.7 mile -rrb- stretch to the czech republic , estimated to be completed in 2006 and to carry up to 72,000 vehicles per day , will have cost at least € 650 million -lrb- $ 790 million -rrb- to build . the rocky history of this costly road highlights a common problem regarding transport in germany today : how to balance the growing needs of highway transportation and economic growth with protection for the environment and the people who live near autobahn routes . armin reck , press spokesman for the saxony highway department , has been involved with the a17 since its early days .
he was brought in to sell the idea to the public , since the project was almost shelved due to vocal opposition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opponents say the stretch runs through sensitive habitats groups ranging from traditional environmental activists to farmers to the clergy - " pastors against the a17 " - hit the streets in protest , camped out in trees slated for felling , and went to court to stop the freeway . " it was astounding what kind of groups came out against this freeway , " reck told dw-world as he drove along the nine-kilometer stretch of almost-completed tunnels and bridges that has turned into once of the most expensive sections of an already costly project . eu 's transport backbone despite the sky-high sums involved , economists and business leaders agree that there is a critical need to improve and expand germany 's aging network of freeways .
given germany 's new central position within the eu , after the may 1 expansion added ten new members mostly in eastern europe , the freeway system is now the backbone of international road shipping in europe .
whether goods are going from poland to spain or sweden to greece , if they are going by road , it is likely they will pass through germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : truck traffic is estimated to increase dramatically .
as trade increases between new and old members of the eu , traffic is likely to increase .
conservative estimates say by 2010 , the number of trucks travelling on german freeways will double ; other forecasts say the number will quadruple .
if germany 's already overburdened system is not beefed up , many fear , goods could be delayed crossing the continent and economic development could suffer . " traffic and economic growth are related closely to one another , " ralf stock , head of the department of traffic engineering , told dw-world .
" it 's a fact that during the past 30 years , the development of the gross domestic product and the passenger and freight transport service has been very similar . " while other eu countries have on average increased their highway networks by 70 percent since 1991 , germany has only added 10 percent to its own system .
highway planners now work into their calculations the consequences of protests and lawsuits from various interest groups , which have become almost as inevitable as death and taxes . difficult birth plans for an autobahn between dresden and the czech border are not new .
the nazis drew up plans for a highway in 1938 , but they were scrapped during the war .
the east germans considered building as well , but their government collapsed before they could start digging .
after reunification in 1990 , the project got new priority status and in 1991 planning began - shortly thereafter , so did the protests . the issue became so contentious that the highway department , for the first time , put the matter to the public in a 1995 referendum , and won .
but , to get public approval , the department decided to accommodate many of the concerns of freeway opponents . engineers sank most of the autobahn up to twelve meters below the surface , to provide noise protection and give a psychological boost to surrounding residents .
" if they ca n't actually see the freeway , they 're less likely to complain about it , " the highway department 's reck said . spanning the road will be two so-called " green bridges , " which were demanded by environmentalists who wanted animals to be able cross the highway safely and by local residents who insisted that a wooded area near the ruins of a manor torn down by the nazis be preserved .
the two bridges cost around € 8 million to build . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other environmental protection measures include noise protection panels that line much of the freeway and tunnels and guidance systems that allow protected species of frogs to cross the road .
local bats get their own tunnel with ultrasonic technology to guide them through . " on average , every third euro for street or highway construction is spent on environmental protection , " said reck . quality of life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the costs , even those who want to see more kilometers of autobahn and more lanes to already existing ones are wary of jettisoning germany 's strict environmental laws in favor of unfettered highway construction .
they say they are necessary to maintain the quality of life in this densely populated country , whose road network is already one of the most extensive in europe . but if some costs could come down , experts say , construction could be moved along , and autobahn supply might keep up with future trucking demands . " financing is often a problem because of the large expenses involved , " kay lindemann , head of the traffic policy department at the federation of german endustry , told dw-world .
" environmental protection measures often drive those costs up . " armin reck , however , is fairly good natured about the costs as well as the drawn-out and often controversial planning and construction process .
" we have to respect people 's interests , they have to live near the autobahn after all , " he said . " besides , planning started in 1991 and we 're going to open one part in october 2004 .
for us getting such a difficult freeway built , that 's almost a world record . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putting the brakes on germany 's autobahn ?
while many sections of germany 's freeway system , or autobahn , allow drivers to cruise as fast as they want , politicians have begun calling for a general speed limit .
public opinion on the issue looks to be changing .
-lrb- july 7 , 2004 -rrb- a toll for germany 's autobahns ?
the economics minister 's comments on privatizing the autobahn has drawn a raft of criticism from politicians and experts with most unanimous that germans wo n't want to pay money to speed on their beloved freeway system .

the united nations and nato failed to protect minorities in kosovo when ethnic albanians went on a rampage in march , a leading human rights organization has said . in a 66-page report , the new york-based human rights watch said the failure of security institutions in kosovo to protect the minorities was " beyond dispute . " " in community after community , serbs and other minorities ... were left for hours at the mercy of hostile ethnic albanians rioters , waiting for kfor and unmik to rescue them , " the report said . nineteen people were killed and over 900 injured , including international police and nato peacekeepers -lrb- kfor -rrb- , as mobs of ethnic albanians attacked minority enclaves mostly inhabited by serbs . no coordinated response the report , released on monday , slammed the un mission -lrb- unmik -rrb- and kfor for not sharing information and claimed part of the responsibility could be attributed to kfor troops for engaging in traditional military terms " rather than in more appropriate policing terms . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a kosovo police officer stands guard near damaged cars and apartments in a mainly serb neighborhood in the kosovo capital pristina the report condemned kfor and unmik for lacking a coordinated response while " in numerous cases minorities under attack were left entirely unprotected and at the mercy of the rioters . " kfor , unmik reject criticism however , kfor spokesman said the force did not agree with the report 's conclusions . " it came late and it is a report looking from an armchair perspective and not one of a soldier looking at thousands of protesters approaching him , " kfor spokesman , horst pieper told afp . " kfor did the outmost to de-escalate the confrontation and saved many lives , " he said .
" we think the strategy all over was successful . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers of the nato-led kfor peacekeeping force in kosovo guard the unmik united nation mission in a statement , unmik denied the accusations that it failed to address the situation .

" in the western town of prizren , german kfor failed to deploy to protect the serb population and the many historic serbian orthodox churches . " at least 29 churches and monasteries were burned while over 800 houses were torched . nato rushed some 2,000 troops to quell the violence in addition to some 17,000 troops it had stationed in the province . kosovo has been under un and nato control since 1999 when a nato bombing campaign forced serb troops under nationalist strongman slobodan milosevic to end a crackdown on ethnic albanian separatists . the march violence dealt a devastating blow to unmik 's efforts to reconcile the province 's embittered rival communities . kosovo serbs return un officials and a serbian organization meanwhile announced plans to start returning kosovo serbs that had fled the province in 1999 . the plan is to bring back 300 families by the end of this year .
should the resettlement be successful , 1,200 families could following in 2005 , dragisa krstovic , the leader of a group called povratak , which means " return " in serbian , told ap newsagency . in 1999 , more than 200,000 serbs left kosovo because they feared revenge attacks from ethnic albanians .

and given that there are more speakers of catalan than of either slovenian or maltese - which has not yet become an eu working language - it does n't seem an altogether unfair request . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish prime minister , jose luis rodriguez zapatero however , spain 's conservative opposition slammed zapatero 's demand for recognition , saying it was nothing more than a stunt aimed at sweetening his nationalist coalition partners .
but whatever the motives , fife welcomes spain 's nurturing approach , and would like to see other european states take their cue from madrid 's lead . " even if spain were successful in achieving treaty status , it is hard to see how there would be a snowball effect .
not all states are minority language-friendly , " fife said .
for many regional languages , simply gaining recognition on home ground is a steep enough mountain to climb .
" it 's often all that national minorities can do to maintain themselves , in many cases they are losing their fight to stay alive , " he concluded . eastern europe provides new impetus interestingly enough , the new eu member states have dusted off the issue of minority european languages , and put it squarely back on the table .
while western european governments have traditionally tended to close their ears to regional tongues , the approach in the east is quite different .
many of the ten new countries were forced into a life of russian , and are only too glad to have the chance to promote their own linguistic heritages . although the eu is home to more than 40 minority languages - with tens of million speakers - the only one on the whole continent actually entitled to the status of official working language , is gaelic , and that is only the case because gaelic is an official language of the republic of ireland .
but would other countries want the same treatment for their pockets of linguistic diversity ?
according to fife , it varies from place to place .
he cites hungary as great believer in the promotion of its 15 sub-languages , and france as country which is doggedly determined not to acknowledge it linguistic treasure chest . fife said germany , with its slavic sorbian minority , is somewhere in the middle .
" germany does n't have quite the same negative attitude to minority languages .
it provides some support and recognition , more than the french , " he said . keeping sorbian alive but the official association of sorbs feels that germany 's federal government could do more to integrate sorbian into the regional and national consciousness .
although the government currently stumps up an annual budget for the promotion of sorbian culture , it has already threatened to cut its contributions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sorbian girls in traditional dress. dressed in their traditional with a total of 60,000 speakers of upper sorbian and lower sorbian in the states of saxony and brandenburg , local residents can theoretically go from one day to the next without speaking any german .
theoretical , however , is the operative word .
" many people ca n't speak sorbian , but those who work for the local authorities , and the police etc , should be bi-lingual .
if sorbs saw that they could use their language freely , they would do so , " bernhard zies , managing director of the association for lausitzer sorbs told dw-world . it 's an ideal which remains far from reality .
even measures to revitalize the language , such as the introduction of bi-lingual kindergartens and schooling , are unlikely to make it as important to germany as catalan appears to be to spain . " we will never reach the stage where people who live in sorbian areas have to be able to speak both languages , because we do not have territorial autonomy , " zies added .
that is a view shared by james fife , who believes devolution from central powers is a pre-requisite to the successful preservation of minority languages . tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de how do you say accession in maltese ?

in spain , the country 's southern regions have been sweltering in temperatures of more than 40 degrees celsius -lrb- 104 fahrenheit -rrb- since last week and have claimed an estimated eleven lives so far .
the most recent victims , a 32-year-old man and an 82-year-old woman who died of heat strokes in the southern cities of cordoba and jaen respectively , were discovered on monday while a 78-year-old woman died of a circulatory failure brought on by the high temperatures on the canary island of tenerife over the weekend .
in the spanish capital , madrid , temperatures have hit 39.3c -lrb- 103f -rrb- - a 73-year high .
the latest heat wave brings back memories of the extreme heat that swept through europe last summer , killing thousands .
exceptionally hot weather killed at least 141 people in spain last year .
france braces as bad memories return in france , which was hardest hit last year in the heat wave that killed an estimated 15,000 people , president jacques chirac told his ministers monday to keep their summer vacations short this year as fears of a repeat of last summer 's tragedy begin to circulate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bodies of the dead were stored in refrigerated makeshift morgues in paris .
the death of thousands of mostly elderly french citizens caused outrage as it was revealed that government ministers initially refused to cut short their holidays to respond to the extraordinary conditions in august 2003 .
the number of dead and increasing temperatures caused havoc and led to the use of makeshift insulated morgues across the french capital -lrb- photo -rrb- . jean-francois mattei , who was health minister at the time , was eventually sacked in a cabinet reshuffle months after being seen on television in a t-shirt in his villa in south of france insisting that there was nothing to worry about at the beginning of the hot weather . his replacement , philippe douste-blazy , has promised that , he would return to paris from his summer vacation " at the drop of a hat " if similar conditions look likely this summer .
jacques chirac , however , will again be overseas this year .
the french president failed to return from his vacation in canada during last summer 's deadly heat wave .
huge swathes of portugal 's forests lost meanwhile hundreds of firefighters , backed by water trucks , helicopters and planes , continued to battle fires across portugal on monday .
the tourist region of faro on portugal 's southern coast was hardest hit , with more than 150 firefighters working in mountains near the spa town of monchique , a spokesman for the national emergency service said .
it is the second consecutive year of extreme forest fires in portugal .
in 2003 , huge fires destroyed 13 percent of its forests and woodlands and claimed 18 lives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : firefighters also extinguished a major fire in the arrabida natural park , 30 miles south of lisbon on monday .
the fire in the park , which is home to protected species like the wildcat and the mongoose , was eventually put out after destroying over 900 hectares of wilderness .
several beaches in the area had to be evacuated on sunday and remained closed to the public on tuesday .
there were no reports of injuries in any of the fires .
eu neighbors on alert with aid greece is sending two planes to portugal to fight the fires while italy has put an aircraft on standby following the country 's plea for help , the eu executive commission said in a statement .

the news follows efforts by officials in the state of north-rhine westphalia to shut down a private saudi-financed school after fundamentalist leanings were detected in the textbooks . " the state has absolutely no authority in these schools , they can do what they want and that is very troubling , " lutz irrgang , who heads the hesse state office for the protection of the constitution , told dw-world . educating the next generation of islam teachers officials know that raids alone ca n't root out radicalism in pockets of germany 's 3.2 million-strong muslim community .
one of the best hopes remains ending the monopoly on islamic teachings held by dubious imams and teachers in courtyard mosques , and bringing muslim children back into the educational mainstream .
this week , the university of münster took a step in that direction when it announced the appointment of mohammed sven kalisch , a muslim theologian who converted to islam as a teen , to head the university 's new department dedicated to educating future generations of islamic teachers .
the department , the first of its kind in germany , is designed to bridge the mistrust between german educational authorities and the country 's myriad muslim organizations .
kalisch , a favorite of both german educators and muslim leaders , said he is fully aware of the way fundamentalist imams use the koran to send the wrong message .
" by educating islamic teachers we , of course , hope to work against extremist tendencies , " kalisch said . problems begin after school school authorities in berlin , bremen , bavaria and north rhine- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish students taking islam religion classes at a school in bremen westphalia have already added islam religion classes as an option to similar course offerings in judaism and catholicism .
lower saxony recently announced similar plans to test out islam religion courses . the classes , taught by teachers who are practicing muslims , offer germany 's estimated 800,000 muslim students the possibility of learning about their religion in a way that officials can keep tabs on . " it 's like our classes on catholicism and protestantism , " said spokeswoman nina schmidt .
" by doing it in our school we can make sure that it 's taught from an academic point of view , that no fundamentalist teachings slip in . " the problems begin after school is over for the day , when many parents send their children to private koran lessons . it is at these schools that the seeds of fundamentalism are planted , say law enforcement officials .
raids by police across germany routinely turn up the type of videos and literature found at the frankfurt school . jihadis " rely more on indirect communication nowadays , like videos and tapes , " said kai hirschmann , co-director of the essen-based institute for terrorism research and policy .
" that communication often takes place through the koran schools . " holy war at the school 's friday prayers but not only there .
school officials in north-rhine westphalia were appalled at the material found in textbooks seized at the king fahd academy in bonn .
the academy , funded by the saudi arabian government , caters to the sons and daughters of diplomats , arabic families who stay in germany for long periods as well as children with german citizenship or permanent resident status . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the king fahd academy in bad godesberg more than 300 textbooks were confiscated as part of a police investigation into the school 's fundamentalist tendencies in october 2003 .
the academy -lrb- photo -rrb- , which opened in the quiet bonn neighborhood of bad godesberg in 1995 , had already suspended one teacher after he had allegedly called for holy war against the west in friday prayers . bonn school officials reviewing the teaching material found in a study that students were taught that " the muslim people 's existence has been threatened by jews and christians since the crusades and it is the first duty of every muslim to prepare to fight against these enemies .

critics said the law infringed on states ' rights . the ruling does away with so-called " junior professorships " the federal government introduced to replace a germany 's unique system of habilitation , which requires post-doctoral researchers to work with tenured professors for several years and complete another thesis before they can become professors themselves . saying that the old german system prevented people from competing on an international level , the social democratic-greens government decided to allow scholars to become professors immediately . according to the new law , they were able to hold the position for up to six years before having to move on to a regular professorship .
the new system was expected to replace the old in 2010 . some states resist federal involvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : currently , most german professors are at least 42 years old several state governments - bavaria , saxony and thuringia - had criticized the change for a number of reasons : they complained that the federal government had infringed on state rights to determine educational policies themselves - an argument five of eight judges at germany 's constitutional court agreed with in ruling against the law . government officials were quick to point out that the judges had only ruled against the federal law without calling into question the concept of junior professorships itself .
german education minister edelgard bulmahn said she expected state governments to act now and implement the change . berlin vows to stick to program several states have already done so .
berlin state government officials on tuesday said they would stick to junior professorships and lobby for the program with other states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edelgard bulmahn inside germany 's constitutional court on tuesday bulmahn -lrb- photo -rrb- added that the federal government 's jurisdiction over universities had to be expanded for german academic institutions to stay competitive internationally .
she said a committee currently working on reforming germany 's federal system should address that issue as well . supporters of the junior professorships also said the ruling would hold them back as compared to academics in other countries that do n't have to spend valuable years as assistants to another professor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's humboldt university " this way we 're never going to get competitive internationally , " claudia kemfert , an economic scientist at berlin 's humboldt university , told der spiegel newsmagazine .
the 35-year-old recently became germany 's first junior professor to move on to a regular professorship . a lack of funding ? but critics also lamented a lack of adequate funding for the positions .
universities had received about € 180 million -lrb- $ 219 million -rrb- for up to 3,000 junior professors .
so far , only 933 positions exist . " that 's definitely too little money , " katharina reiche , an education policy expert for the opposition christian democrats in the german parliament , told berliner zeitung . while saying that junior professorships were not necessarily a bad thing , reiche added that her party planned to undo the abolishment of the habilitation , which should remain as an alternative option . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students in frankfurt protesting against proposed university fees constitutional court judges are also expected to rule on a prohibition of university fees later this year after several states who would like to charge students had complained about the law . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de antarctic summit gets underway in bremen germany will pay € 26 million for the construction of the new neumayer iii polar station in the antarctic , government officials announce at the start of an international conference in bremen .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 27.07.2004 a rocky road for germany 's autobahn großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 12 years in the making , and the a17 autobahn is n't finished yet the eu 's eastern expansion has made germany 's freeway system essential for cross-european freight transport .
more freeways are needed , but their construction remains controversial and expensive . the completion of the a17 autobahn , the freeway which will eventually run from the city of dresden to the czech border , will mean very different things depending on who you talk to . to its proponents , it will close a gaping hole in europe 's freeway system and encourage economic growth by keeping pace with the continent 's fast-growing international road transport needs .
to its detractors , it will dirty the air in dresden , threaten sensitive natural habitats and increase traffic in the region .
in short , it will represent a wrong approach to transport planning . all can agree on one thing though , it will have been an expensive and protracted project - in the works since 1991 , in the end the 44.6 kilometer -lrb- 27.7 mile -rrb- stretch to the czech republic , estimated to be completed in 2006 and to carry up to 72,000 vehicles per day , will have cost at least € 650 million -lrb- $ 790 million -rrb- to build . the rocky history of this costly road highlights a common problem regarding transport in germany today : how to balance the growing needs of highway transportation and economic growth with protection for the environment and the people who live near autobahn routes . armin reck , press spokesman for the saxony highway department , has been involved with the a17 since its early days .
he was brought in to sell the idea to the public , since the project was almost shelved due to vocal opposition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opponents say the stretch runs through sensitive habitats groups ranging from traditional environmental activists to farmers to the clergy - " pastors against the a17 " - hit the streets in protest , camped out in trees slated for felling , and went to court to stop the freeway . " it was astounding what kind of groups came out against this freeway , " reck told dw-world as he drove along the nine-kilometer stretch of almost-completed tunnels and bridges that has turned into once of the most expensive sections of an already costly project . eu 's transport backbone despite the sky-high sums involved , economists and business leaders agree that there is a critical need to improve and expand germany 's aging network of freeways .
given germany 's new central position within the eu , after the may 1 expansion added ten new members mostly in eastern europe , the freeway system is now the backbone of international road shipping in europe .
whether goods are going from poland to spain or sweden to greece , if they are going by road , it is likely they will pass through germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : truck traffic is estimated to increase dramatically .
as trade increases between new and old members of the eu , traffic is likely to increase .
conservative estimates say by 2010 , the number of trucks travelling on german freeways will double ; other forecasts say the number will quadruple .
if germany 's already overburdened system is not beefed up , many fear , goods could be delayed crossing the continent and economic development could suffer . " traffic and economic growth are related closely to one another , " ralf stock , head of the department of traffic engineering , told dw-world .
" it 's a fact that during the past 30 years , the development of the gross domestic product and the passenger and freight transport service has been very similar . " while other eu countries have on average increased their highway networks by 70 percent since 1991 , germany has only added 10 percent to its own system .
highway planners now work into their calculations the consequences of protests and lawsuits from various interest groups , which have become almost as inevitable as death and taxes . difficult birth plans for an autobahn between dresden and the czech border are not new .
the nazis drew up plans for a highway in 1938 , but they were scrapped during the war .
the east germans considered building as well , but their government collapsed before they could start digging .
after reunification in 1990 , the project got new priority status and in 1991 planning began - shortly thereafter , so did the protests . the issue became so contentious that the highway department , for the first time , put the matter to the public in a 1995 referendum , and won .
but , to get public approval , the department decided to accommodate many of the concerns of freeway opponents . engineers sank most of the autobahn up to twelve meters below the surface , to provide noise protection and give a psychological boost to surrounding residents .
" if they ca n't actually see the freeway , they 're less likely to complain about it , " the highway department 's reck said . spanning the road will be two so-called " green bridges , " which were demanded by environmentalists who wanted animals to be able cross the highway safely and by local residents who insisted that a wooded area near the ruins of a manor torn down by the nazis be preserved .
the two bridges cost around € 8 million to build . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other environmental protection measures include noise protection panels that line much of the freeway and tunnels and guidance systems that allow protected species of frogs to cross the road .
local bats get their own tunnel with ultrasonic technology to guide them through . " on average , every third euro for street or highway construction is spent on environmental protection , " said reck . quality of life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the costs , even those who want to see more kilometers of autobahn and more lanes to already existing ones are wary of jettisoning germany 's strict environmental laws in favor of unfettered highway construction .
they say they are necessary to maintain the quality of life in this densely populated country , whose road network is already one of the most extensive in europe . but if some costs could come down , experts say , construction could be moved along , and autobahn supply might keep up with future trucking demands . " financing is often a problem because of the large expenses involved , " kay lindemann , head of the traffic policy department at the federation of german endustry , told dw-world .
" environmental protection measures often drive those costs up . " armin reck , however , is fairly good natured about the costs as well as the drawn-out and often controversial planning and construction process .
" we have to respect people 's interests , they have to live near the autobahn after all , " he said . " besides , planning started in 1991 and we 're going to open one part in october 2004 .
for us getting such a difficult freeway built , that 's almost a world record . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putting the brakes on germany 's autobahn ?
while many sections of germany 's freeway system , or autobahn , allow drivers to cruise as fast as they want , politicians have begun calling for a general speed limit .
public opinion on the issue looks to be changing .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 27.07.2004 court rules against reform for german academics großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : younger academics used to wait years to become professors germany 's highest court tuesday scrapped a 2002 federal law intended to make german universities more competitive by speeding up the process of obtaining a professorship .
critics said the law infringed on states ' rights . the ruling does away with so-called " junior professorships " the federal government introduced to replace a germany 's unique system of habilitation , which requires post-doctoral researchers to work with tenured professors for several years and complete another thesis before they can become professors themselves . saying that the old german system prevented people from competing on an international level , the social democratic-greens government decided to allow scholars to become professors immediately . according to the new law , they were able to hold the position for up to six years before having to move on to a regular professorship .
the new system was expected to replace the old in 2010 . some states resist federal involvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : currently , most german professors are at least 42 years old several state governments - bavaria , saxony and thuringia - had criticized the change for a number of reasons : they complained that the federal government had infringed on state rights to determine educational policies themselves - an argument five of eight judges at germany 's constitutional court agreed with in ruling against the law . government officials were quick to point out that the judges had only ruled against the federal law without calling into question the concept of junior professorships itself .
german education minister edelgard bulmahn said she expected state governments to act now and implement the change . berlin vows to stick to program several states have already done so .
berlin state government officials on tuesday said they would stick to junior professorships and lobby for the program with other states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edelgard bulmahn inside germany 's constitutional court on tuesday bulmahn -lrb- photo -rrb- added that the federal government 's jurisdiction over universities had to be expanded for german academic institutions to stay competitive internationally .
she said a committee currently working on reforming germany 's federal system should address that issue as well . supporters of the junior professorships also said the ruling would hold them back as compared to academics in other countries that do n't have to spend valuable years as assistants to another professor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's humboldt university " this way we 're never going to get competitive internationally , " claudia kemfert , an economic scientist at berlin 's humboldt university , told der spiegel newsmagazine .
the 35-year-old recently became germany 's first junior professor to move on to a regular professorship . a lack of funding ? but critics also lamented a lack of adequate funding for the positions .
universities had received about € 180 million -lrb- $ 219 million -rrb- for up to 3,000 junior professors .
so far , only 933 positions exist . " that 's definitely too little money , " katharina reiche , an education policy expert for the opposition christian democrats in the german parliament , told berliner zeitung . while saying that junior professorships were not necessarily a bad thing , reiche added that her party planned to undo the abolishment of the habilitation , which should remain as an alternative option . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students in frankfurt protesting against proposed university fees constitutional court judges are also expected to rule on a prohibition of university fees later this year after several states who would like to charge students had complained about the law . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de antarctic summit gets underway in bremen germany will pay € 26 million for the construction of the new neumayer iii polar station in the antarctic , government officials announce at the start of an international conference in bremen .

the news follows efforts by officials in the state of north-rhine westphalia to shut down a private saudi-financed school after fundamentalist leanings were detected in the textbooks . " the state has absolutely no authority in these schools , they can do what they want and that is very troubling , " lutz irrgang , who heads the hesse state office for the protection of the constitution , told dw-world . educating the next generation of islam teachers officials know that raids alone ca n't root out radicalism in pockets of germany 's 3.2 million-strong muslim community .
one of the best hopes remains ending the monopoly on islamic teachings held by dubious imams and teachers in courtyard mosques , and bringing muslim children back into the educational mainstream .
this week , the university of münster took a step in that direction when it announced the appointment of mohammed sven kalisch , a muslim theologian who converted to islam as a teen , to head the university 's new department dedicated to educating future generations of islamic teachers .
the department , the first of its kind in germany , is designed to bridge the mistrust between german educational authorities and the country 's myriad muslim organizations .
kalisch , a favorite of both german educators and muslim leaders , said he is fully aware of the way fundamentalist imams use the koran to send the wrong message .
" by educating islamic teachers we , of course , hope to work against extremist tendencies , " kalisch said . problems begin after school school authorities in berlin , bremen , bavaria and north rhine- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish students taking islam religion classes at a school in bremen westphalia have already added islam religion classes as an option to similar course offerings in judaism and catholicism .
lower saxony recently announced similar plans to test out islam religion courses . the classes , taught by teachers who are practicing muslims , offer germany 's estimated 800,000 muslim students the possibility of learning about their religion in a way that officials can keep tabs on . " it 's like our classes on catholicism and protestantism , " said spokeswoman nina schmidt .
" by doing it in our school we can make sure that it 's taught from an academic point of view , that no fundamentalist teachings slip in . " the problems begin after school is over for the day , when many parents send their children to private koran lessons . it is at these schools that the seeds of fundamentalism are planted , say law enforcement officials .
raids by police across germany routinely turn up the type of videos and literature found at the frankfurt school . jihadis " rely more on indirect communication nowadays , like videos and tapes , " said kai hirschmann , co-director of the essen-based institute for terrorism research and policy .
" that communication often takes place through the koran schools . " holy war at the school 's friday prayers but not only there .
school officials in north-rhine westphalia were appalled at the material found in textbooks seized at the king fahd academy in bonn .
the academy , funded by the saudi arabian government , caters to the sons and daughters of diplomats , arabic families who stay in germany for long periods as well as children with german citizenship or permanent resident status . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the king fahd academy in bad godesberg more than 300 textbooks were confiscated as part of a police investigation into the school 's fundamentalist tendencies in october 2003 .
the academy -lrb- photo -rrb- , which opened in the quiet bonn neighborhood of bad godesberg in 1995 , had already suspended one teacher after he had allegedly called for holy war against the west in friday prayers . bonn school officials reviewing the teaching material found in a study that students were taught that " the muslim people 's existence has been threatened by jews and christians since the crusades and it is the first duty of every muslim to prepare to fight against these enemies . " though powerless to close the school , school officials were able to force at least 53 children with german citizenship or permanent residency status to leave the academy based on what they study . the cooperation between law enforcement and school authorities is by no means typical , but can sometimes be useful .
still , investigators say that the best methods are not frequent raids but education . " one of the best tools , " said irrgang , " remains enlightenment .

the united nations and nato failed to protect minorities in kosovo when ethnic albanians went on a rampage in march , a leading human rights organization has said . in a 66-page report , the new york-based human rights watch said the failure of security institutions in kosovo to protect the minorities was " beyond dispute . " " in community after community , serbs and other minorities ... were left for hours at the mercy of hostile ethnic albanians rioters , waiting for kfor and unmik to rescue them , " the report said . nineteen people were killed and over 900 injured , including international police and nato peacekeepers -lrb- kfor -rrb- , as mobs of ethnic albanians attacked minority enclaves mostly inhabited by serbs . no coordinated response the report , released on monday , slammed the un mission -lrb- unmik -rrb- and kfor for not sharing information and claimed part of the responsibility could be attributed to kfor troops for engaging in traditional military terms " rather than in more appropriate policing terms . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a kosovo police officer stands guard near damaged cars and apartments in a mainly serb neighborhood in the kosovo capital pristina the report condemned kfor and unmik for lacking a coordinated response while " in numerous cases minorities under attack were left entirely unprotected and at the mercy of the rioters . " kfor , unmik reject criticism however , kfor spokesman said the force did not agree with the report 's conclusions . " it came late and it is a report looking from an armchair perspective and not one of a soldier looking at thousands of protesters approaching him , " kfor spokesman , horst pieper told afp .

" the international community appears to be in absolute denial about its own failures in kosovo , " the report said . it specifically accused french peacekeepers serving with kfor of not helping besieged serbs in the northern village of svinjare " even though their main base was just a few hundred meters -lrb- yards -rrb- away .

" in the western town of prizren , german kfor failed to deploy to protect the serb population and the many historic serbian orthodox churches . " at least 29 churches and monasteries were burned while over 800 houses were torched . nato rushed some 2,000 troops to quell the violence in addition to some 17,000 troops it had stationed in the province . kosovo has been under un and nato control since 1999 when a nato bombing campaign forced serb troops under nationalist strongman slobodan milosevic to end a crackdown on ethnic albanian separatists . the march violence dealt a devastating blow to unmik 's efforts to reconcile the province 's embittered rival communities . kosovo serbs return un officials and a serbian organization meanwhile announced plans to start returning kosovo serbs that had fled the province in 1999 . the plan is to bring back 300 families by the end of this year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 27.07.2004 court rules against reform for german academics großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : younger academics used to wait years to become professors germany 's highest court tuesday scrapped a 2002 federal law intended to make german universities more competitive by speeding up the process of obtaining a professorship .
critics said the law infringed on states ' rights . the ruling does away with so-called " junior professorships " the federal government introduced to replace a germany 's unique system of habilitation , which requires post-doctoral researchers to work with tenured professors for several years and complete another thesis before they can become professors themselves . saying that the old german system prevented people from competing on an international level , the social democratic-greens government decided to allow scholars to become professors immediately . according to the new law , they were able to hold the position for up to six years before having to move on to a regular professorship .
the new system was expected to replace the old in 2010 . some states resist federal involvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : currently , most german professors are at least 42 years old several state governments - bavaria , saxony and thuringia - had criticized the change for a number of reasons : they complained that the federal government had infringed on state rights to determine educational policies themselves - an argument five of eight judges at germany 's constitutional court agreed with in ruling against the law . government officials were quick to point out that the judges had only ruled against the federal law without calling into question the concept of junior professorships itself .
german education minister edelgard bulmahn said she expected state governments to act now and implement the change . berlin vows to stick to program several states have already done so .
berlin state government officials on tuesday said they would stick to junior professorships and lobby for the program with other states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edelgard bulmahn inside germany 's constitutional court on tuesday bulmahn -lrb- photo -rrb- added that the federal government 's jurisdiction over universities had to be expanded for german academic institutions to stay competitive internationally .
she said a committee currently working on reforming germany 's federal system should address that issue as well . supporters of the junior professorships also said the ruling would hold them back as compared to academics in other countries that do n't have to spend valuable years as assistants to another professor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's humboldt university " this way we 're never going to get competitive internationally , " claudia kemfert , an economic scientist at berlin 's humboldt university , told der spiegel newsmagazine .
the 35-year-old recently became germany 's first junior professor to move on to a regular professorship . a lack of funding ? but critics also lamented a lack of adequate funding for the positions .
universities had received about € 180 million -lrb- $ 219 million -rrb- for up to 3,000 junior professors .
so far , only 933 positions exist . " that 's definitely too little money , " katharina reiche , an education policy expert for the opposition christian democrats in the german parliament , told berliner zeitung . while saying that junior professorships were not necessarily a bad thing , reiche added that her party planned to undo the abolishment of the habilitation , which should remain as an alternative option . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students in frankfurt protesting against proposed university fees constitutional court judges are also expected to rule on a prohibition of university fees later this year after several states who would like to charge students had complained about the law . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de antarctic summit gets underway in bremen germany will pay € 26 million for the construction of the new neumayer iii polar station in the antarctic , government officials announce at the start of an international conference in bremen .

" the state has absolutely no authority in these schools , they can do what they want and that is very troubling , " lutz irrgang , who heads the hesse state office for the protection of the constitution , told dw-world . educating the next generation of islam teachers officials know that raids alone ca n't root out radicalism in pockets of germany 's 3.2 million-strong muslim community .
one of the best hopes remains ending the monopoly on islamic teachings held by dubious imams and teachers in courtyard mosques , and bringing muslim children back into the educational mainstream .
this week , the university of münster took a step in that direction when it announced the appointment of mohammed sven kalisch , a muslim theologian who converted to islam as a teen , to head the university 's new department dedicated to educating future generations of islamic teachers .
the department , the first of its kind in germany , is designed to bridge the mistrust between german educational authorities and the country 's myriad muslim organizations .

more freeways are needed , but their construction remains controversial and expensive . the completion of the a17 autobahn , the freeway which will eventually run from the city of dresden to the czech border , will mean very different things depending on who you talk to . to its proponents , it will close a gaping hole in europe 's freeway system and encourage economic growth by keeping pace with the continent 's fast-growing international road transport needs .
to its detractors , it will dirty the air in dresden , threaten sensitive natural habitats and increase traffic in the region .
in short , it will represent a wrong approach to transport planning . all can agree on one thing though , it will have been an expensive and protracted project - in the works since 1991 , in the end the 44.6 kilometer -lrb- 27.7 mile -rrb- stretch to the czech republic , estimated to be completed in 2006 and to carry up to 72,000 vehicles per day , will have cost at least € 650 million -lrb- $ 790 million -rrb- to build . the rocky history of this costly road highlights a common problem regarding transport in germany today : how to balance the growing needs of highway transportation and economic growth with protection for the environment and the people who live near autobahn routes . armin reck , press spokesman for the saxony highway department , has been involved with the a17 since its early days .
he was brought in to sell the idea to the public , since the project was almost shelved due to vocal opposition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opponents say the stretch runs through sensitive habitats groups ranging from traditional environmental activists to farmers to the clergy - " pastors against the a17 " - hit the streets in protest , camped out in trees slated for felling , and went to court to stop the freeway . " it was astounding what kind of groups came out against this freeway , " reck told dw-world as he drove along the nine-kilometer stretch of almost-completed tunnels and bridges that has turned into once of the most expensive sections of an already costly project . eu 's transport backbone despite the sky-high sums involved , economists and business leaders agree that there is a critical need to improve and expand germany 's aging network of freeways .
given germany 's new central position within the eu , after the may 1 expansion added ten new members mostly in eastern europe , the freeway system is now the backbone of international road shipping in europe .
whether goods are going from poland to spain or sweden to greece , if they are going by road , it is likely they will pass through germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : truck traffic is estimated to increase dramatically .
as trade increases between new and old members of the eu , traffic is likely to increase .
conservative estimates say by 2010 , the number of trucks travelling on german freeways will double ; other forecasts say the number will quadruple .
if germany 's already overburdened system is not beefed up , many fear , goods could be delayed crossing the continent and economic development could suffer . " traffic and economic growth are related closely to one another , " ralf stock , head of the department of traffic engineering , told dw-world .
" it 's a fact that during the past 30 years , the development of the gross domestic product and the passenger and freight transport service has been very similar . " while other eu countries have on average increased their highway networks by 70 percent since 1991 , germany has only added 10 percent to its own system .
highway planners now work into their calculations the consequences of protests and lawsuits from various interest groups , which have become almost as inevitable as death and taxes . difficult birth plans for an autobahn between dresden and the czech border are not new .
the nazis drew up plans for a highway in 1938 , but they were scrapped during the war .
the east germans considered building as well , but their government collapsed before they could start digging .
after reunification in 1990 , the project got new priority status and in 1991 planning began - shortly thereafter , so did the protests . the issue became so contentious that the highway department , for the first time , put the matter to the public in a 1995 referendum , and won .
but , to get public approval , the department decided to accommodate many of the concerns of freeway opponents . engineers sank most of the autobahn up to twelve meters below the surface , to provide noise protection and give a psychological boost to surrounding residents .
" if they ca n't actually see the freeway , they 're less likely to complain about it , " the highway department 's reck said . spanning the road will be two so-called " green bridges , " which were demanded by environmentalists who wanted animals to be able cross the highway safely and by local residents who insisted that a wooded area near the ruins of a manor torn down by the nazis be preserved .
the two bridges cost around € 8 million to build . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other environmental protection measures include noise protection panels that line much of the freeway and tunnels and guidance systems that allow protected species of frogs to cross the road .
local bats get their own tunnel with ultrasonic technology to guide them through . " on average , every third euro for street or highway construction is spent on environmental protection , " said reck . quality of life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the costs , even those who want to see more kilometers of autobahn and more lanes to already existing ones are wary of jettisoning germany 's strict environmental laws in favor of unfettered highway construction .
they say they are necessary to maintain the quality of life in this densely populated country , whose road network is already one of the most extensive in europe . but if some costs could come down , experts say , construction could be moved along , and autobahn supply might keep up with future trucking demands . " financing is often a problem because of the large expenses involved , " kay lindemann , head of the traffic policy department at the federation of german endustry , told dw-world .
" environmental protection measures often drive those costs up . " armin reck , however , is fairly good natured about the costs as well as the drawn-out and often controversial planning and construction process .
" we have to respect people 's interests , they have to live near the autobahn after all , " he said . " besides , planning started in 1991 and we 're going to open one part in october 2004 .
for us getting such a difficult freeway built , that 's almost a world record . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putting the brakes on germany 's autobahn ?
while many sections of germany 's freeway system , or autobahn , allow drivers to cruise as fast as they want , politicians have begun calling for a general speed limit .
public opinion on the issue looks to be changing .
-lrb- july 7 , 2004 -rrb- a toll for germany 's autobahns ?
the economics minister 's comments on privatizing the autobahn has drawn a raft of criticism from politicians and experts with most unanimous that germans wo n't want to pay money to speed on their beloved freeway system .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 27.07.2004 court rules against reform for german academics großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : younger academics used to wait years to become professors germany 's highest court tuesday scrapped a 2002 federal law intended to make german universities more competitive by speeding up the process of obtaining a professorship .
critics said the law infringed on states ' rights . the ruling does away with so-called " junior professorships " the federal government introduced to replace a germany 's unique system of habilitation , which requires post-doctoral researchers to work with tenured professors for several years and complete another thesis before they can become professors themselves . saying that the old german system prevented people from competing on an international level , the social democratic-greens government decided to allow scholars to become professors immediately . according to the new law , they were able to hold the position for up to six years before having to move on to a regular professorship .
the new system was expected to replace the old in 2010 . some states resist federal involvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : currently , most german professors are at least 42 years old several state governments - bavaria , saxony and thuringia - had criticized the change for a number of reasons : they complained that the federal government had infringed on state rights to determine educational policies themselves - an argument five of eight judges at germany 's constitutional court agreed with in ruling against the law . government officials were quick to point out that the judges had only ruled against the federal law without calling into question the concept of junior professorships itself .
german education minister edelgard bulmahn said she expected state governments to act now and implement the change . berlin vows to stick to program several states have already done so .
berlin state government officials on tuesday said they would stick to junior professorships and lobby for the program with other states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edelgard bulmahn inside germany 's constitutional court on tuesday bulmahn -lrb- photo -rrb- added that the federal government 's jurisdiction over universities had to be expanded for german academic institutions to stay competitive internationally .
she said a committee currently working on reforming germany 's federal system should address that issue as well . supporters of the junior professorships also said the ruling would hold them back as compared to academics in other countries that do n't have to spend valuable years as assistants to another professor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's humboldt university " this way we 're never going to get competitive internationally , " claudia kemfert , an economic scientist at berlin 's humboldt university , told der spiegel newsmagazine .
the 35-year-old recently became germany 's first junior professor to move on to a regular professorship . a lack of funding ? but critics also lamented a lack of adequate funding for the positions .
universities had received about € 180 million -lrb- $ 219 million -rrb- for up to 3,000 junior professors .
so far , only 933 positions exist . " that 's definitely too little money , " katharina reiche , an education policy expert for the opposition christian democrats in the german parliament , told berliner zeitung . while saying that junior professorships were not necessarily a bad thing , reiche added that her party planned to undo the abolishment of the habilitation , which should remain as an alternative option . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students in frankfurt protesting against proposed university fees constitutional court judges are also expected to rule on a prohibition of university fees later this year after several states who would like to charge students had complained about the law . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de antarctic summit gets underway in bremen germany will pay € 26 million for the construction of the new neumayer iii polar station in the antarctic , government officials announce at the start of an international conference in bremen .

the united nations and nato failed to protect minorities in kosovo when ethnic albanians went on a rampage in march , a leading human rights organization has said . in a 66-page report , the new york-based human rights watch said the failure of security institutions in kosovo to protect the minorities was " beyond dispute . " " in community after community , serbs and other minorities ... were left for hours at the mercy of hostile ethnic albanians rioters , waiting for kfor and unmik to rescue them , " the report said . nineteen people were killed and over 900 injured , including international police and nato peacekeepers -lrb- kfor -rrb- , as mobs of ethnic albanians attacked minority enclaves mostly inhabited by serbs . no coordinated response the report , released on monday , slammed the un mission -lrb- unmik -rrb- and kfor for not sharing information and claimed part of the responsibility could be attributed to kfor troops for engaging in traditional military terms " rather than in more appropriate policing terms .

" kfor , unmik reject criticism however , kfor spokesman said the force did not agree with the report 's conclusions .

" at least 29 churches and monasteries were burned while over 800 houses were torched . nato rushed some 2,000 troops to quell the violence in addition to some 17,000 troops it had stationed in the province . kosovo has been under un and nato control since 1999 when a nato bombing campaign forced serb troops under nationalist strongman slobodan milosevic to end a crackdown on ethnic albanian separatists . the march violence dealt a devastating blow to unmik 's efforts to reconcile the province 's embittered rival communities . kosovo serbs return un officials and a serbian organization meanwhile announced plans to start returning kosovo serbs that had fled the province in 1999 . the plan is to bring back 300 families by the end of this year .

more freeways are needed , but their construction remains controversial and expensive . the completion of the a17 autobahn , the freeway which will eventually run from the city of dresden to the czech border , will mean very different things depending on who you talk to . to its proponents , it will close a gaping hole in europe 's freeway system and encourage economic growth by keeping pace with the continent 's fast-growing international road transport needs .
to its detractors , it will dirty the air in dresden , threaten sensitive natural habitats and increase traffic in the region .
in short , it will represent a wrong approach to transport planning . all can agree on one thing though , it will have been an expensive and protracted project - in the works since 1991 , in the end the 44.6 kilometer -lrb- 27.7 mile -rrb- stretch to the czech republic , estimated to be completed in 2006 and to carry up to 72,000 vehicles per day , will have cost at least € 650 million -lrb- $ 790 million -rrb- to build . the rocky history of this costly road highlights a common problem regarding transport in germany today : how to balance the growing needs of highway transportation and economic growth with protection for the environment and the people who live near autobahn routes . armin reck , press spokesman for the saxony highway department , has been involved with the a17 since its early days .
he was brought in to sell the idea to the public , since the project was almost shelved due to vocal opposition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opponents say the stretch runs through sensitive habitats groups ranging from traditional environmental activists to farmers to the clergy - " pastors against the a17 " - hit the streets in protest , camped out in trees slated for felling , and went to court to stop the freeway . " it was astounding what kind of groups came out against this freeway , " reck told dw-world as he drove along the nine-kilometer stretch of almost-completed tunnels and bridges that has turned into once of the most expensive sections of an already costly project . eu 's transport backbone despite the sky-high sums involved , economists and business leaders agree that there is a critical need to improve and expand germany 's aging network of freeways .
given germany 's new central position within the eu , after the may 1 expansion added ten new members mostly in eastern europe , the freeway system is now the backbone of international road shipping in europe .
whether goods are going from poland to spain or sweden to greece , if they are going by road , it is likely they will pass through germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : truck traffic is estimated to increase dramatically .
as trade increases between new and old members of the eu , traffic is likely to increase .
conservative estimates say by 2010 , the number of trucks travelling on german freeways will double ; other forecasts say the number will quadruple .
if germany 's already overburdened system is not beefed up , many fear , goods could be delayed crossing the continent and economic development could suffer . " traffic and economic growth are related closely to one another , " ralf stock , head of the department of traffic engineering , told dw-world .
" it 's a fact that during the past 30 years , the development of the gross domestic product and the passenger and freight transport service has been very similar . " while other eu countries have on average increased their highway networks by 70 percent since 1991 , germany has only added 10 percent to its own system .
highway planners now work into their calculations the consequences of protests and lawsuits from various interest groups , which have become almost as inevitable as death and taxes . difficult birth plans for an autobahn between dresden and the czech border are not new .
the nazis drew up plans for a highway in 1938 , but they were scrapped during the war .
the east germans considered building as well , but their government collapsed before they could start digging .
after reunification in 1990 , the project got new priority status and in 1991 planning began - shortly thereafter , so did the protests . the issue became so contentious that the highway department , for the first time , put the matter to the public in a 1995 referendum , and won .
but , to get public approval , the department decided to accommodate many of the concerns of freeway opponents . engineers sank most of the autobahn up to twelve meters below the surface , to provide noise protection and give a psychological boost to surrounding residents .
" if they ca n't actually see the freeway , they 're less likely to complain about it , " the highway department 's reck said . spanning the road will be two so-called " green bridges , " which were demanded by environmentalists who wanted animals to be able cross the highway safely and by local residents who insisted that a wooded area near the ruins of a manor torn down by the nazis be preserved .
the two bridges cost around € 8 million to build . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other environmental protection measures include noise protection panels that line much of the freeway and tunnels and guidance systems that allow protected species of frogs to cross the road .

" financing is often a problem because of the large expenses involved , " kay lindemann , head of the traffic policy department at the federation of german endustry , told dw-world .
" environmental protection measures often drive those costs up . " armin reck , however , is fairly good natured about the costs as well as the drawn-out and often controversial planning and construction process .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 27.07.2004 the major issue of minority languages großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : language is an important part of catalan culture the newly enlarged european union has a rich linguistic variety extending far beyond its official working languages .
but new efforts are being made to strenghten the bloc 's cultural diversity . when spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero took office earlier this year , he decided to take a new linguistic approach than his predecessor .
within just a matter of weeks he had called on his counterparts in the european union to grant spain 's regional languages official recognition in the future european constitution . if the eu agrees to madrid 's request , catalan , basque and galician will be awarded ' treaty status ' .
" it would allow people to communicate in their language , or to obtain documents in that language , " james fife of eurolang , the newsagency attached to the european buro for lesser used languages , told dw-world .
and given that there are more speakers of catalan than of either slovenian or maltese - which has not yet become an eu working language - it does n't seem an altogether unfair request . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish prime minister , jose luis rodriguez zapatero however , spain 's conservative opposition slammed zapatero 's demand for recognition , saying it was nothing more than a stunt aimed at sweetening his nationalist coalition partners .
but whatever the motives , fife welcomes spain 's nurturing approach , and would like to see other european states take their cue from madrid 's lead . " even if spain were successful in achieving treaty status , it is hard to see how there would be a snowball effect .
not all states are minority language-friendly , " fife said .
for many regional languages , simply gaining recognition on home ground is a steep enough mountain to climb .
" it 's often all that national minorities can do to maintain themselves , in many cases they are losing their fight to stay alive , " he concluded . eastern europe provides new impetus interestingly enough , the new eu member states have dusted off the issue of minority european languages , and put it squarely back on the table .
while western european governments have traditionally tended to close their ears to regional tongues , the approach in the east is quite different .
many of the ten new countries were forced into a life of russian , and are only too glad to have the chance to promote their own linguistic heritages . although the eu is home to more than 40 minority languages - with tens of million speakers - the only one on the whole continent actually entitled to the status of official working language , is gaelic , and that is only the case because gaelic is an official language of the republic of ireland .
but would other countries want the same treatment for their pockets of linguistic diversity ?
according to fife , it varies from place to place .
he cites hungary as great believer in the promotion of its 15 sub-languages , and france as country which is doggedly determined not to acknowledge it linguistic treasure chest . fife said germany , with its slavic sorbian minority , is somewhere in the middle .
" germany does n't have quite the same negative attitude to minority languages .
it provides some support and recognition , more than the french , " he said . keeping sorbian alive but the official association of sorbs feels that germany 's federal government could do more to integrate sorbian into the regional and national consciousness .
although the government currently stumps up an annual budget for the promotion of sorbian culture , it has already threatened to cut its contributions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sorbian girls in traditional dress. dressed in their traditional with a total of 60,000 speakers of upper sorbian and lower sorbian in the states of saxony and brandenburg , local residents can theoretically go from one day to the next without speaking any german .
theoretical , however , is the operative word .
" many people ca n't speak sorbian , but those who work for the local authorities , and the police etc , should be bi-lingual .
if sorbs saw that they could use their language freely , they would do so , " bernhard zies , managing director of the association for lausitzer sorbs told dw-world . it 's an ideal which remains far from reality .
even measures to revitalize the language , such as the introduction of bi-lingual kindergartens and schooling , are unlikely to make it as important to germany as catalan appears to be to spain . " we will never reach the stage where people who live in sorbian areas have to be able to speak both languages , because we do not have territorial autonomy , " zies added .
that is a view shared by james fife , who believes devolution from central powers is a pre-requisite to the successful preservation of minority languages . tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de how do you say accession in maltese ?

more freeways are needed , but their construction remains controversial and expensive . the completion of the a17 autobahn , the freeway which will eventually run from the city of dresden to the czech border , will mean very different things depending on who you talk to . to its proponents , it will close a gaping hole in europe 's freeway system and encourage economic growth by keeping pace with the continent 's fast-growing international road transport needs .
to its detractors , it will dirty the air in dresden , threaten sensitive natural habitats and increase traffic in the region .
in short , it will represent a wrong approach to transport planning . all can agree on one thing though , it will have been an expensive and protracted project - in the works since 1991 , in the end the 44.6 kilometer -lrb- 27.7 mile -rrb- stretch to the czech republic , estimated to be completed in 2006 and to carry up to 72,000 vehicles per day , will have cost at least € 650 million -lrb- $ 790 million -rrb- to build . the rocky history of this costly road highlights a common problem regarding transport in germany today : how to balance the growing needs of highway transportation and economic growth with protection for the environment and the people who live near autobahn routes . armin reck , press spokesman for the saxony highway department , has been involved with the a17 since its early days .
he was brought in to sell the idea to the public , since the project was almost shelved due to vocal opposition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opponents say the stretch runs through sensitive habitats groups ranging from traditional environmental activists to farmers to the clergy - " pastors against the a17 " - hit the streets in protest , camped out in trees slated for felling , and went to court to stop the freeway . " it was astounding what kind of groups came out against this freeway , " reck told dw-world as he drove along the nine-kilometer stretch of almost-completed tunnels and bridges that has turned into once of the most expensive sections of an already costly project . eu 's transport backbone despite the sky-high sums involved , economists and business leaders agree that there is a critical need to improve and expand germany 's aging network of freeways .
given germany 's new central position within the eu , after the may 1 expansion added ten new members mostly in eastern europe , the freeway system is now the backbone of international road shipping in europe .
whether goods are going from poland to spain or sweden to greece , if they are going by road , it is likely they will pass through germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : truck traffic is estimated to increase dramatically .
as trade increases between new and old members of the eu , traffic is likely to increase .
conservative estimates say by 2010 , the number of trucks travelling on german freeways will double ; other forecasts say the number will quadruple .
if germany 's already overburdened system is not beefed up , many fear , goods could be delayed crossing the continent and economic development could suffer . " traffic and economic growth are related closely to one another , " ralf stock , head of the department of traffic engineering , told dw-world .
" it 's a fact that during the past 30 years , the development of the gross domestic product and the passenger and freight transport service has been very similar . " while other eu countries have on average increased their highway networks by 70 percent since 1991 , germany has only added 10 percent to its own system .
highway planners now work into their calculations the consequences of protests and lawsuits from various interest groups , which have become almost as inevitable as death and taxes . difficult birth plans for an autobahn between dresden and the czech border are not new .
the nazis drew up plans for a highway in 1938 , but they were scrapped during the war .
the east germans considered building as well , but their government collapsed before they could start digging .
after reunification in 1990 , the project got new priority status and in 1991 planning began - shortly thereafter , so did the protests . the issue became so contentious that the highway department , for the first time , put the matter to the public in a 1995 referendum , and won .
but , to get public approval , the department decided to accommodate many of the concerns of freeway opponents . engineers sank most of the autobahn up to twelve meters below the surface , to provide noise protection and give a psychological boost to surrounding residents .
" if they ca n't actually see the freeway , they 're less likely to complain about it , " the highway department 's reck said . spanning the road will be two so-called " green bridges , " which were demanded by environmentalists who wanted animals to be able cross the highway safely and by local residents who insisted that a wooded area near the ruins of a manor torn down by the nazis be preserved .
the two bridges cost around € 8 million to build . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other environmental protection measures include noise protection panels that line much of the freeway and tunnels and guidance systems that allow protected species of frogs to cross the road .
local bats get their own tunnel with ultrasonic technology to guide them through . " on average , every third euro for street or highway construction is spent on environmental protection , " said reck . quality of life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the costs , even those who want to see more kilometers of autobahn and more lanes to already existing ones are wary of jettisoning germany 's strict environmental laws in favor of unfettered highway construction .
they say they are necessary to maintain the quality of life in this densely populated country , whose road network is already one of the most extensive in europe . but if some costs could come down , experts say , construction could be moved along , and autobahn supply might keep up with future trucking demands . " financing is often a problem because of the large expenses involved , " kay lindemann , head of the traffic policy department at the federation of german endustry , told dw-world .
" environmental protection measures often drive those costs up . " armin reck , however , is fairly good natured about the costs as well as the drawn-out and often controversial planning and construction process .
" we have to respect people 's interests , they have to live near the autobahn after all , " he said . " besides , planning started in 1991 and we 're going to open one part in october 2004 .
for us getting such a difficult freeway built , that 's almost a world record . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putting the brakes on germany 's autobahn ?
while many sections of germany 's freeway system , or autobahn , allow drivers to cruise as fast as they want , politicians have begun calling for a general speed limit .

the news follows efforts by officials in the state of north-rhine westphalia to shut down a private saudi-financed school after fundamentalist leanings were detected in the textbooks . " the state has absolutely no authority in these schools , they can do what they want and that is very troubling , " lutz irrgang , who heads the hesse state office for the protection of the constitution , told dw-world . educating the next generation of islam teachers officials know that raids alone ca n't root out radicalism in pockets of germany 's 3.2 million-strong muslim community .
one of the best hopes remains ending the monopoly on islamic teachings held by dubious imams and teachers in courtyard mosques , and bringing muslim children back into the educational mainstream .
this week , the university of münster took a step in that direction when it announced the appointment of mohammed sven kalisch , a muslim theologian who converted to islam as a teen , to head the university 's new department dedicated to educating future generations of islamic teachers .
the department , the first of its kind in germany , is designed to bridge the mistrust between german educational authorities and the country 's myriad muslim organizations .
kalisch , a favorite of both german educators and muslim leaders , said he is fully aware of the way fundamentalist imams use the koran to send the wrong message .
" by educating islamic teachers we , of course , hope to work against extremist tendencies , " kalisch said . problems begin after school school authorities in berlin , bremen , bavaria and north rhine- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish students taking islam religion classes at a school in bremen westphalia have already added islam religion classes as an option to similar course offerings in judaism and catholicism .
lower saxony recently announced similar plans to test out islam religion courses . the classes , taught by teachers who are practicing muslims , offer germany 's estimated 800,000 muslim students the possibility of learning about their religion in a way that officials can keep tabs on . " it 's like our classes on catholicism and protestantism , " said spokeswoman nina schmidt .
" by doing it in our school we can make sure that it 's taught from an academic point of view , that no fundamentalist teachings slip in . " the problems begin after school is over for the day , when many parents send their children to private koran lessons . it is at these schools that the seeds of fundamentalism are planted , say law enforcement officials .
raids by police across germany routinely turn up the type of videos and literature found at the frankfurt school . jihadis " rely more on indirect communication nowadays , like videos and tapes , " said kai hirschmann , co-director of the essen-based institute for terrorism research and policy .
" that communication often takes place through the koran schools . " holy war at the school 's friday prayers but not only there .
school officials in north-rhine westphalia were appalled at the material found in textbooks seized at the king fahd academy in bonn .
the academy , funded by the saudi arabian government , caters to the sons and daughters of diplomats , arabic families who stay in germany for long periods as well as children with german citizenship or permanent resident status . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the king fahd academy in bad godesberg more than 300 textbooks were confiscated as part of a police investigation into the school 's fundamentalist tendencies in october 2003 .
the academy -lrb- photo -rrb- , which opened in the quiet bonn neighborhood of bad godesberg in 1995 , had already suspended one teacher after he had allegedly called for holy war against the west in friday prayers . bonn school officials reviewing the teaching material found in a study that students were taught that " the muslim people 's existence has been threatened by jews and christians since the crusades and it is the first duty of every muslim to prepare to fight against these enemies . " though powerless to close the school , school officials were able to force at least 53 children with german citizenship or permanent residency status to leave the academy based on what they study . the cooperation between law enforcement and school authorities is by no means typical , but can sometimes be useful .
still , investigators say that the best methods are not frequent raids but education . " one of the best tools , " said irrgang , " remains enlightenment .

critics said the law infringed on states ' rights . the ruling does away with so-called " junior professorships " the federal government introduced to replace a germany 's unique system of habilitation , which requires post-doctoral researchers to work with tenured professors for several years and complete another thesis before they can become professors themselves . saying that the old german system prevented people from competing on an international level , the social democratic-greens government decided to allow scholars to become professors immediately . according to the new law , they were able to hold the position for up to six years before having to move on to a regular professorship .
the new system was expected to replace the old in 2010 . some states resist federal involvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : currently , most german professors are at least 42 years old several state governments - bavaria , saxony and thuringia - had criticized the change for a number of reasons : they complained that the federal government had infringed on state rights to determine educational policies themselves - an argument five of eight judges at germany 's constitutional court agreed with in ruling against the law . government officials were quick to point out that the judges had only ruled against the federal law without calling into question the concept of junior professorships itself .
german education minister edelgard bulmahn said she expected state governments to act now and implement the change . berlin vows to stick to program several states have already done so .
berlin state government officials on tuesday said they would stick to junior professorships and lobby for the program with other states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edelgard bulmahn inside germany 's constitutional court on tuesday bulmahn -lrb- photo -rrb- added that the federal government 's jurisdiction over universities had to be expanded for german academic institutions to stay competitive internationally .
she said a committee currently working on reforming germany 's federal system should address that issue as well . supporters of the junior professorships also said the ruling would hold them back as compared to academics in other countries that do n't have to spend valuable years as assistants to another professor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's humboldt university " this way we 're never going to get competitive internationally , " claudia kemfert , an economic scientist at berlin 's humboldt university , told der spiegel newsmagazine .
the 35-year-old recently became germany 's first junior professor to move on to a regular professorship . a lack of funding ? but critics also lamented a lack of adequate funding for the positions .
universities had received about € 180 million -lrb- $ 219 million -rrb- for up to 3,000 junior professors .
so far , only 933 positions exist . " that 's definitely too little money , " katharina reiche , an education policy expert for the opposition christian democrats in the german parliament , told berliner zeitung . while saying that junior professorships were not necessarily a bad thing , reiche added that her party planned to undo the abolishment of the habilitation , which should remain as an alternative option . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students in frankfurt protesting against proposed university fees constitutional court judges are also expected to rule on a prohibition of university fees later this year after several states who would like to charge students had complained about the law . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de antarctic summit gets underway in bremen germany will pay € 26 million for the construction of the new neumayer iii polar station in the antarctic , government officials announce at the start of an international conference in bremen .

" many people ca n't speak sorbian , but those who work for the local authorities , and the police etc , should be bi-lingual .
if sorbs saw that they could use their language freely , they would do so , " bernhard zies , managing director of the association for lausitzer sorbs told dw-world . it 's an ideal which remains far from reality .
even measures to revitalize the language , such as the introduction of bi-lingual kindergartens and schooling , are unlikely to make it as important to germany as catalan appears to be to spain . " we will never reach the stage where people who live in sorbian areas have to be able to speak both languages , because we do not have territorial autonomy , " zies added .

but new efforts are being made to strenghten the bloc 's cultural diversity . when spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero took office earlier this year , he decided to take a new linguistic approach than his predecessor .
within just a matter of weeks he had called on his counterparts in the european union to grant spain 's regional languages official recognition in the future european constitution . if the eu agrees to madrid 's request , catalan , basque and galician will be awarded ' treaty status ' .
" it would allow people to communicate in their language , or to obtain documents in that language , " james fife of eurolang , the newsagency attached to the european buro for lesser used languages , told dw-world .
and given that there are more speakers of catalan than of either slovenian or maltese - which has not yet become an eu working language - it does n't seem an altogether unfair request . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish prime minister , jose luis rodriguez zapatero however , spain 's conservative opposition slammed zapatero 's demand for recognition , saying it was nothing more than a stunt aimed at sweetening his nationalist coalition partners .
but whatever the motives , fife welcomes spain 's nurturing approach , and would like to see other european states take their cue from madrid 's lead . " even if spain were successful in achieving treaty status , it is hard to see how there would be a snowball effect .
not all states are minority language-friendly , " fife said .
for many regional languages , simply gaining recognition on home ground is a steep enough mountain to climb .
" it 's often all that national minorities can do to maintain themselves , in many cases they are losing their fight to stay alive , " he concluded . eastern europe provides new impetus interestingly enough , the new eu member states have dusted off the issue of minority european languages , and put it squarely back on the table .
while western european governments have traditionally tended to close their ears to regional tongues , the approach in the east is quite different .
many of the ten new countries were forced into a life of russian , and are only too glad to have the chance to promote their own linguistic heritages . although the eu is home to more than 40 minority languages - with tens of million speakers - the only one on the whole continent actually entitled to the status of official working language , is gaelic , and that is only the case because gaelic is an official language of the republic of ireland .
but would other countries want the same treatment for their pockets of linguistic diversity ?
according to fife , it varies from place to place .
he cites hungary as great believer in the promotion of its 15 sub-languages , and france as country which is doggedly determined not to acknowledge it linguistic treasure chest . fife said germany , with its slavic sorbian minority , is somewhere in the middle .

more freeways are needed , but their construction remains controversial and expensive . the completion of the a17 autobahn , the freeway which will eventually run from the city of dresden to the czech border , will mean very different things depending on who you talk to . to its proponents , it will close a gaping hole in europe 's freeway system and encourage economic growth by keeping pace with the continent 's fast-growing international road transport needs .
to its detractors , it will dirty the air in dresden , threaten sensitive natural habitats and increase traffic in the region .
in short , it will represent a wrong approach to transport planning . all can agree on one thing though , it will have been an expensive and protracted project - in the works since 1991 , in the end the 44.6 kilometer -lrb- 27.7 mile -rrb- stretch to the czech republic , estimated to be completed in 2006 and to carry up to 72,000 vehicles per day , will have cost at least € 650 million -lrb- $ 790 million -rrb- to build . the rocky history of this costly road highlights a common problem regarding transport in germany today : how to balance the growing needs of highway transportation and economic growth with protection for the environment and the people who live near autobahn routes . armin reck , press spokesman for the saxony highway department , has been involved with the a17 since its early days .

the news follows efforts by officials in the state of north-rhine westphalia to shut down a private saudi-financed school after fundamentalist leanings were detected in the textbooks . " the state has absolutely no authority in these schools , they can do what they want and that is very troubling , " lutz irrgang , who heads the hesse state office for the protection of the constitution , told dw-world . educating the next generation of islam teachers officials know that raids alone ca n't root out radicalism in pockets of germany 's 3.2 million-strong muslim community .
one of the best hopes remains ending the monopoly on islamic teachings held by dubious imams and teachers in courtyard mosques , and bringing muslim children back into the educational mainstream .
this week , the university of münster took a step in that direction when it announced the appointment of mohammed sven kalisch , a muslim theologian who converted to islam as a teen , to head the university 's new department dedicated to educating future generations of islamic teachers .
the department , the first of its kind in germany , is designed to bridge the mistrust between german educational authorities and the country 's myriad muslim organizations .
kalisch , a favorite of both german educators and muslim leaders , said he is fully aware of the way fundamentalist imams use the koran to send the wrong message .
" by educating islamic teachers we , of course , hope to work against extremist tendencies , " kalisch said . problems begin after school school authorities in berlin , bremen , bavaria and north rhine- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish students taking islam religion classes at a school in bremen westphalia have already added islam religion classes as an option to similar course offerings in judaism and catholicism .
lower saxony recently announced similar plans to test out islam religion courses . the classes , taught by teachers who are practicing muslims , offer germany 's estimated 800,000 muslim students the possibility of learning about their religion in a way that officials can keep tabs on . " it 's like our classes on catholicism and protestantism , " said spokeswoman nina schmidt .
" by doing it in our school we can make sure that it 's taught from an academic point of view , that no fundamentalist teachings slip in . " the problems begin after school is over for the day , when many parents send their children to private koran lessons . it is at these schools that the seeds of fundamentalism are planted , say law enforcement officials .
raids by police across germany routinely turn up the type of videos and literature found at the frankfurt school . jihadis " rely more on indirect communication nowadays , like videos and tapes , " said kai hirschmann , co-director of the essen-based institute for terrorism research and policy .
" that communication often takes place through the koran schools . " holy war at the school 's friday prayers but not only there .
school officials in north-rhine westphalia were appalled at the material found in textbooks seized at the king fahd academy in bonn .
the academy , funded by the saudi arabian government , caters to the sons and daughters of diplomats , arabic families who stay in germany for long periods as well as children with german citizenship or permanent resident status . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the king fahd academy in bad godesberg more than 300 textbooks were confiscated as part of a police investigation into the school 's fundamentalist tendencies in october 2003 .
the academy -lrb- photo -rrb- , which opened in the quiet bonn neighborhood of bad godesberg in 1995 , had already suspended one teacher after he had allegedly called for holy war against the west in friday prayers . bonn school officials reviewing the teaching material found in a study that students were taught that " the muslim people 's existence has been threatened by jews and christians since the crusades and it is the first duty of every muslim to prepare to fight against these enemies . " though powerless to close the school , school officials were able to force at least 53 children with german citizenship or permanent residency status to leave the academy based on what they study . the cooperation between law enforcement and school authorities is by no means typical , but can sometimes be useful .
still , investigators say that the best methods are not frequent raids but education . " one of the best tools , " said irrgang , " remains enlightenment .

critics said the law infringed on states ' rights . the ruling does away with so-called " junior professorships " the federal government introduced to replace a germany 's unique system of habilitation , which requires post-doctoral researchers to work with tenured professors for several years and complete another thesis before they can become professors themselves . saying that the old german system prevented people from competing on an international level , the social democratic-greens government decided to allow scholars to become professors immediately . according to the new law , they were able to hold the position for up to six years before having to move on to a regular professorship .
the new system was expected to replace the old in 2010 . some states resist federal involvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : currently , most german professors are at least 42 years old several state governments - bavaria , saxony and thuringia - had criticized the change for a number of reasons : they complained that the federal government had infringed on state rights to determine educational policies themselves - an argument five of eight judges at germany 's constitutional court agreed with in ruling against the law . government officials were quick to point out that the judges had only ruled against the federal law without calling into question the concept of junior professorships itself .
german education minister edelgard bulmahn said she expected state governments to act now and implement the change . berlin vows to stick to program several states have already done so .
berlin state government officials on tuesday said they would stick to junior professorships and lobby for the program with other states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edelgard bulmahn inside germany 's constitutional court on tuesday bulmahn -lrb- photo -rrb- added that the federal government 's jurisdiction over universities had to be expanded for german academic institutions to stay competitive internationally .
she said a committee currently working on reforming germany 's federal system should address that issue as well . supporters of the junior professorships also said the ruling would hold them back as compared to academics in other countries that do n't have to spend valuable years as assistants to another professor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's humboldt university " this way we 're never going to get competitive internationally , " claudia kemfert , an economic scientist at berlin 's humboldt university , told der spiegel newsmagazine .

so far , only 933 positions exist . " that 's definitely too little money , " katharina reiche , an education policy expert for the opposition christian democrats in the german parliament , told berliner zeitung . while saying that junior professorships were not necessarily a bad thing , reiche added that her party planned to undo the abolishment of the habilitation , which should remain as an alternative option . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students in frankfurt protesting against proposed university fees constitutional court judges are also expected to rule on a prohibition of university fees later this year after several states who would like to charge students had complained about the law . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de antarctic summit gets underway in bremen germany will pay € 26 million for the construction of the new neumayer iii polar station in the antarctic , government officials announce at the start of an international conference in bremen .

but new efforts are being made to strenghten the bloc 's cultural diversity . when spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero took office earlier this year , he decided to take a new linguistic approach than his predecessor .
within just a matter of weeks he had called on his counterparts in the european union to grant spain 's regional languages official recognition in the future european constitution . if the eu agrees to madrid 's request , catalan , basque and galician will be awarded ' treaty status ' .
" it would allow people to communicate in their language , or to obtain documents in that language , " james fife of eurolang , the newsagency attached to the european buro for lesser used languages , told dw-world .
and given that there are more speakers of catalan than of either slovenian or maltese - which has not yet become an eu working language - it does n't seem an altogether unfair request . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish prime minister , jose luis rodriguez zapatero however , spain 's conservative opposition slammed zapatero 's demand for recognition , saying it was nothing more than a stunt aimed at sweetening his nationalist coalition partners .
but whatever the motives , fife welcomes spain 's nurturing approach , and would like to see other european states take their cue from madrid 's lead . " even if spain were successful in achieving treaty status , it is hard to see how there would be a snowball effect .
not all states are minority language-friendly , " fife said .
for many regional languages , simply gaining recognition on home ground is a steep enough mountain to climb .
" it 's often all that national minorities can do to maintain themselves , in many cases they are losing their fight to stay alive , " he concluded . eastern europe provides new impetus interestingly enough , the new eu member states have dusted off the issue of minority european languages , and put it squarely back on the table .
while western european governments have traditionally tended to close their ears to regional tongues , the approach in the east is quite different .
many of the ten new countries were forced into a life of russian , and are only too glad to have the chance to promote their own linguistic heritages . although the eu is home to more than 40 minority languages - with tens of million speakers - the only one on the whole continent actually entitled to the status of official working language , is gaelic , and that is only the case because gaelic is an official language of the republic of ireland .
but would other countries want the same treatment for their pockets of linguistic diversity ?
according to fife , it varies from place to place .
he cites hungary as great believer in the promotion of its 15 sub-languages , and france as country which is doggedly determined not to acknowledge it linguistic treasure chest . fife said germany , with its slavic sorbian minority , is somewhere in the middle .
" germany does n't have quite the same negative attitude to minority languages .
it provides some support and recognition , more than the french , " he said . keeping sorbian alive but the official association of sorbs feels that germany 's federal government could do more to integrate sorbian into the regional and national consciousness .
although the government currently stumps up an annual budget for the promotion of sorbian culture , it has already threatened to cut its contributions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sorbian girls in traditional dress. dressed in their traditional with a total of 60,000 speakers of upper sorbian and lower sorbian in the states of saxony and brandenburg , local residents can theoretically go from one day to the next without speaking any german .

" many people ca n't speak sorbian , but those who work for the local authorities , and the police etc , should be bi-lingual .
if sorbs saw that they could use their language freely , they would do so , " bernhard zies , managing director of the association for lausitzer sorbs told dw-world . it 's an ideal which remains far from reality .
even measures to revitalize the language , such as the introduction of bi-lingual kindergartens and schooling , are unlikely to make it as important to germany as catalan appears to be to spain . " we will never reach the stage where people who live in sorbian areas have to be able to speak both languages , because we do not have territorial autonomy , " zies added .

the news follows efforts by officials in the state of north-rhine westphalia to shut down a private saudi-financed school after fundamentalist leanings were detected in the textbooks . " the state has absolutely no authority in these schools , they can do what they want and that is very troubling , " lutz irrgang , who heads the hesse state office for the protection of the constitution , told dw-world . educating the next generation of islam teachers officials know that raids alone ca n't root out radicalism in pockets of germany 's 3.2 million-strong muslim community .
one of the best hopes remains ending the monopoly on islamic teachings held by dubious imams and teachers in courtyard mosques , and bringing muslim children back into the educational mainstream .
this week , the university of münster took a step in that direction when it announced the appointment of mohammed sven kalisch , a muslim theologian who converted to islam as a teen , to head the university 's new department dedicated to educating future generations of islamic teachers .
the department , the first of its kind in germany , is designed to bridge the mistrust between german educational authorities and the country 's myriad muslim organizations .
kalisch , a favorite of both german educators and muslim leaders , said he is fully aware of the way fundamentalist imams use the koran to send the wrong message .
" by educating islamic teachers we , of course , hope to work against extremist tendencies , " kalisch said . problems begin after school school authorities in berlin , bremen , bavaria and north rhine- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish students taking islam religion classes at a school in bremen westphalia have already added islam religion classes as an option to similar course offerings in judaism and catholicism .
lower saxony recently announced similar plans to test out islam religion courses . the classes , taught by teachers who are practicing muslims , offer germany 's estimated 800,000 muslim students the possibility of learning about their religion in a way that officials can keep tabs on . " it 's like our classes on catholicism and protestantism , " said spokeswoman nina schmidt .
" by doing it in our school we can make sure that it 's taught from an academic point of view , that no fundamentalist teachings slip in . " the problems begin after school is over for the day , when many parents send their children to private koran lessons . it is at these schools that the seeds of fundamentalism are planted , say law enforcement officials .
raids by police across germany routinely turn up the type of videos and literature found at the frankfurt school . jihadis " rely more on indirect communication nowadays , like videos and tapes , " said kai hirschmann , co-director of the essen-based institute for terrorism research and policy .
" that communication often takes place through the koran schools . " holy war at the school 's friday prayers but not only there .
school officials in north-rhine westphalia were appalled at the material found in textbooks seized at the king fahd academy in bonn .
the academy , funded by the saudi arabian government , caters to the sons and daughters of diplomats , arabic families who stay in germany for long periods as well as children with german citizenship or permanent resident status . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the king fahd academy in bad godesberg more than 300 textbooks were confiscated as part of a police investigation into the school 's fundamentalist tendencies in october 2003 .
the academy -lrb- photo -rrb- , which opened in the quiet bonn neighborhood of bad godesberg in 1995 , had already suspended one teacher after he had allegedly called for holy war against the west in friday prayers . bonn school officials reviewing the teaching material found in a study that students were taught that " the muslim people 's existence has been threatened by jews and christians since the crusades and it is the first duty of every muslim to prepare to fight against these enemies . " though powerless to close the school , school officials were able to force at least 53 children with german citizenship or permanent residency status to leave the academy based on what they study . the cooperation between law enforcement and school authorities is by no means typical , but can sometimes be useful .
still , investigators say that the best methods are not frequent raids but education . " one of the best tools , " said irrgang , " remains enlightenment .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 27.07.2004 a rocky road for germany 's autobahn großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 12 years in the making , and the a17 autobahn is n't finished yet the eu 's eastern expansion has made germany 's freeway system essential for cross-european freight transport .
more freeways are needed , but their construction remains controversial and expensive . the completion of the a17 autobahn , the freeway which will eventually run from the city of dresden to the czech border , will mean very different things depending on who you talk to . to its proponents , it will close a gaping hole in europe 's freeway system and encourage economic growth by keeping pace with the continent 's fast-growing international road transport needs .
to its detractors , it will dirty the air in dresden , threaten sensitive natural habitats and increase traffic in the region .
in short , it will represent a wrong approach to transport planning . all can agree on one thing though , it will have been an expensive and protracted project - in the works since 1991 , in the end the 44.6 kilometer -lrb- 27.7 mile -rrb- stretch to the czech republic , estimated to be completed in 2006 and to carry up to 72,000 vehicles per day , will have cost at least € 650 million -lrb- $ 790 million -rrb- to build . the rocky history of this costly road highlights a common problem regarding transport in germany today : how to balance the growing needs of highway transportation and economic growth with protection for the environment and the people who live near autobahn routes . armin reck , press spokesman for the saxony highway department , has been involved with the a17 since its early days .
he was brought in to sell the idea to the public , since the project was almost shelved due to vocal opposition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opponents say the stretch runs through sensitive habitats groups ranging from traditional environmental activists to farmers to the clergy - " pastors against the a17 " - hit the streets in protest , camped out in trees slated for felling , and went to court to stop the freeway . " it was astounding what kind of groups came out against this freeway , " reck told dw-world as he drove along the nine-kilometer stretch of almost-completed tunnels and bridges that has turned into once of the most expensive sections of an already costly project . eu 's transport backbone despite the sky-high sums involved , economists and business leaders agree that there is a critical need to improve and expand germany 's aging network of freeways .
given germany 's new central position within the eu , after the may 1 expansion added ten new members mostly in eastern europe , the freeway system is now the backbone of international road shipping in europe .
whether goods are going from poland to spain or sweden to greece , if they are going by road , it is likely they will pass through germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : truck traffic is estimated to increase dramatically .
as trade increases between new and old members of the eu , traffic is likely to increase .
conservative estimates say by 2010 , the number of trucks travelling on german freeways will double ; other forecasts say the number will quadruple .
if germany 's already overburdened system is not beefed up , many fear , goods could be delayed crossing the continent and economic development could suffer . " traffic and economic growth are related closely to one another , " ralf stock , head of the department of traffic engineering , told dw-world .
" it 's a fact that during the past 30 years , the development of the gross domestic product and the passenger and freight transport service has been very similar . " while other eu countries have on average increased their highway networks by 70 percent since 1991 , germany has only added 10 percent to its own system .
highway planners now work into their calculations the consequences of protests and lawsuits from various interest groups , which have become almost as inevitable as death and taxes . difficult birth plans for an autobahn between dresden and the czech border are not new .
the nazis drew up plans for a highway in 1938 , but they were scrapped during the war .
the east germans considered building as well , but their government collapsed before they could start digging .
after reunification in 1990 , the project got new priority status and in 1991 planning began - shortly thereafter , so did the protests . the issue became so contentious that the highway department , for the first time , put the matter to the public in a 1995 referendum , and won .
but , to get public approval , the department decided to accommodate many of the concerns of freeway opponents . engineers sank most of the autobahn up to twelve meters below the surface , to provide noise protection and give a psychological boost to surrounding residents .
" if they ca n't actually see the freeway , they 're less likely to complain about it , " the highway department 's reck said . spanning the road will be two so-called " green bridges , " which were demanded by environmentalists who wanted animals to be able cross the highway safely and by local residents who insisted that a wooded area near the ruins of a manor torn down by the nazis be preserved .
the two bridges cost around € 8 million to build . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other environmental protection measures include noise protection panels that line much of the freeway and tunnels and guidance systems that allow protected species of frogs to cross the road .
local bats get their own tunnel with ultrasonic technology to guide them through . " on average , every third euro for street or highway construction is spent on environmental protection , " said reck . quality of life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the costs , even those who want to see more kilometers of autobahn and more lanes to already existing ones are wary of jettisoning germany 's strict environmental laws in favor of unfettered highway construction .
they say they are necessary to maintain the quality of life in this densely populated country , whose road network is already one of the most extensive in europe . but if some costs could come down , experts say , construction could be moved along , and autobahn supply might keep up with future trucking demands . " financing is often a problem because of the large expenses involved , " kay lindemann , head of the traffic policy department at the federation of german endustry , told dw-world .
" environmental protection measures often drive those costs up . " armin reck , however , is fairly good natured about the costs as well as the drawn-out and often controversial planning and construction process .
" we have to respect people 's interests , they have to live near the autobahn after all , " he said . " besides , planning started in 1991 and we 're going to open one part in october 2004 .
for us getting such a difficult freeway built , that 's almost a world record . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putting the brakes on germany 's autobahn ?

more freeways are needed , but their construction remains controversial and expensive . the completion of the a17 autobahn , the freeway which will eventually run from the city of dresden to the czech border , will mean very different things depending on who you talk to . to its proponents , it will close a gaping hole in europe 's freeway system and encourage economic growth by keeping pace with the continent 's fast-growing international road transport needs .
to its detractors , it will dirty the air in dresden , threaten sensitive natural habitats and increase traffic in the region .
in short , it will represent a wrong approach to transport planning . all can agree on one thing though , it will have been an expensive and protracted project - in the works since 1991 , in the end the 44.6 kilometer -lrb- 27.7 mile -rrb- stretch to the czech republic , estimated to be completed in 2006 and to carry up to 72,000 vehicles per day , will have cost at least € 650 million -lrb- $ 790 million -rrb- to build . the rocky history of this costly road highlights a common problem regarding transport in germany today : how to balance the growing needs of highway transportation and economic growth with protection for the environment and the people who live near autobahn routes . armin reck , press spokesman for the saxony highway department , has been involved with the a17 since its early days .
he was brought in to sell the idea to the public , since the project was almost shelved due to vocal opposition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opponents say the stretch runs through sensitive habitats groups ranging from traditional environmental activists to farmers to the clergy - " pastors against the a17 " - hit the streets in protest , camped out in trees slated for felling , and went to court to stop the freeway . " it was astounding what kind of groups came out against this freeway , " reck told dw-world as he drove along the nine-kilometer stretch of almost-completed tunnels and bridges that has turned into once of the most expensive sections of an already costly project . eu 's transport backbone despite the sky-high sums involved , economists and business leaders agree that there is a critical need to improve and expand germany 's aging network of freeways .
given germany 's new central position within the eu , after the may 1 expansion added ten new members mostly in eastern europe , the freeway system is now the backbone of international road shipping in europe .
whether goods are going from poland to spain or sweden to greece , if they are going by road , it is likely they will pass through germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : truck traffic is estimated to increase dramatically .
as trade increases between new and old members of the eu , traffic is likely to increase .
conservative estimates say by 2010 , the number of trucks travelling on german freeways will double ; other forecasts say the number will quadruple .
if germany 's already overburdened system is not beefed up , many fear , goods could be delayed crossing the continent and economic development could suffer . " traffic and economic growth are related closely to one another , " ralf stock , head of the department of traffic engineering , told dw-world .
" it 's a fact that during the past 30 years , the development of the gross domestic product and the passenger and freight transport service has been very similar . " while other eu countries have on average increased their highway networks by 70 percent since 1991 , germany has only added 10 percent to its own system .
highway planners now work into their calculations the consequences of protests and lawsuits from various interest groups , which have become almost as inevitable as death and taxes . difficult birth plans for an autobahn between dresden and the czech border are not new .
the nazis drew up plans for a highway in 1938 , but they were scrapped during the war .
the east germans considered building as well , but their government collapsed before they could start digging .
after reunification in 1990 , the project got new priority status and in 1991 planning began - shortly thereafter , so did the protests . the issue became so contentious that the highway department , for the first time , put the matter to the public in a 1995 referendum , and won .
but , to get public approval , the department decided to accommodate many of the concerns of freeway opponents . engineers sank most of the autobahn up to twelve meters below the surface , to provide noise protection and give a psychological boost to surrounding residents .
" if they ca n't actually see the freeway , they 're less likely to complain about it , " the highway department 's reck said . spanning the road will be two so-called " green bridges , " which were demanded by environmentalists who wanted animals to be able cross the highway safely and by local residents who insisted that a wooded area near the ruins of a manor torn down by the nazis be preserved .
the two bridges cost around € 8 million to build . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other environmental protection measures include noise protection panels that line much of the freeway and tunnels and guidance systems that allow protected species of frogs to cross the road .
local bats get their own tunnel with ultrasonic technology to guide them through . " on average , every third euro for street or highway construction is spent on environmental protection , " said reck . quality of life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the costs , even those who want to see more kilometers of autobahn and more lanes to already existing ones are wary of jettisoning germany 's strict environmental laws in favor of unfettered highway construction .
they say they are necessary to maintain the quality of life in this densely populated country , whose road network is already one of the most extensive in europe . but if some costs could come down , experts say , construction could be moved along , and autobahn supply might keep up with future trucking demands . " financing is often a problem because of the large expenses involved , " kay lindemann , head of the traffic policy department at the federation of german endustry , told dw-world .
" environmental protection measures often drive those costs up . " armin reck , however , is fairly good natured about the costs as well as the drawn-out and often controversial planning and construction process .
" we have to respect people 's interests , they have to live near the autobahn after all , " he said . " besides , planning started in 1991 and we 're going to open one part in october 2004 .

" it 's a fact that during the past 30 years , the development of the gross domestic product and the passenger and freight transport service has been very similar . " while other eu countries have on average increased their highway networks by 70 percent since 1991 , germany has only added 10 percent to its own system .
highway planners now work into their calculations the consequences of protests and lawsuits from various interest groups , which have become almost as inevitable as death and taxes . difficult birth plans for an autobahn between dresden and the czech border are not new .
the nazis drew up plans for a highway in 1938 , but they were scrapped during the war .
the east germans considered building as well , but their government collapsed before they could start digging .
after reunification in 1990 , the project got new priority status and in 1991 planning began - shortly thereafter , so did the protests . the issue became so contentious that the highway department , for the first time , put the matter to the public in a 1995 referendum , and won .
but , to get public approval , the department decided to accommodate many of the concerns of freeway opponents . engineers sank most of the autobahn up to twelve meters below the surface , to provide noise protection and give a psychological boost to surrounding residents .
" if they ca n't actually see the freeway , they 're less likely to complain about it , " the highway department 's reck said . spanning the road will be two so-called " green bridges , " which were demanded by environmentalists who wanted animals to be able cross the highway safely and by local residents who insisted that a wooded area near the ruins of a manor torn down by the nazis be preserved .

more freeways are needed , but their construction remains controversial and expensive . the completion of the a17 autobahn , the freeway which will eventually run from the city of dresden to the czech border , will mean very different things depending on who you talk to . to its proponents , it will close a gaping hole in europe 's freeway system and encourage economic growth by keeping pace with the continent 's fast-growing international road transport needs .
to its detractors , it will dirty the air in dresden , threaten sensitive natural habitats and increase traffic in the region .
in short , it will represent a wrong approach to transport planning . all can agree on one thing though , it will have been an expensive and protracted project - in the works since 1991 , in the end the 44.6 kilometer -lrb- 27.7 mile -rrb- stretch to the czech republic , estimated to be completed in 2006 and to carry up to 72,000 vehicles per day , will have cost at least € 650 million -lrb- $ 790 million -rrb- to build . the rocky history of this costly road highlights a common problem regarding transport in germany today : how to balance the growing needs of highway transportation and economic growth with protection for the environment and the people who live near autobahn routes . armin reck , press spokesman for the saxony highway department , has been involved with the a17 since its early days .
he was brought in to sell the idea to the public , since the project was almost shelved due to vocal opposition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opponents say the stretch runs through sensitive habitats groups ranging from traditional environmental activists to farmers to the clergy - " pastors against the a17 " - hit the streets in protest , camped out in trees slated for felling , and went to court to stop the freeway . " it was astounding what kind of groups came out against this freeway , " reck told dw-world as he drove along the nine-kilometer stretch of almost-completed tunnels and bridges that has turned into once of the most expensive sections of an already costly project . eu 's transport backbone despite the sky-high sums involved , economists and business leaders agree that there is a critical need to improve and expand germany 's aging network of freeways .
given germany 's new central position within the eu , after the may 1 expansion added ten new members mostly in eastern europe , the freeway system is now the backbone of international road shipping in europe .
whether goods are going from poland to spain or sweden to greece , if they are going by road , it is likely they will pass through germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : truck traffic is estimated to increase dramatically .
as trade increases between new and old members of the eu , traffic is likely to increase .
conservative estimates say by 2010 , the number of trucks travelling on german freeways will double ; other forecasts say the number will quadruple .
if germany 's already overburdened system is not beefed up , many fear , goods could be delayed crossing the continent and economic development could suffer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 27.07.2004 the battle for german muslim minds großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : educators worry about what kids are taught in koran schools police raids on islamic schools may shake up fundamentalist cells , but officials agree that the right teachers are the best way to root out radical islamic leanings among germany 's muslim youth . weeks separated news of a police raid on an islamic school in frankfurt and the announcement that the university of münster had set up a department dedicated to educating islamic teachers . but the two items reveal the two-pronged approach taken in germany on what is becoming an increasingly important front in the country 's fight against terrorism : the battle for young muslim minds . after being tipped off by a 9-year-old student , police in frankfurt seized jihadist literature and videos , among them one showing a beheading , from the school hosted in a moroccan cultural center .
the news follows efforts by officials in the state of north-rhine westphalia to shut down a private saudi-financed school after fundamentalist leanings were detected in the textbooks . " the state has absolutely no authority in these schools , they can do what they want and that is very troubling , " lutz irrgang , who heads the hesse state office for the protection of the constitution , told dw-world . educating the next generation of islam teachers officials know that raids alone ca n't root out radicalism in pockets of germany 's 3.2 million-strong muslim community .
one of the best hopes remains ending the monopoly on islamic teachings held by dubious imams and teachers in courtyard mosques , and bringing muslim children back into the educational mainstream .
this week , the university of münster took a step in that direction when it announced the appointment of mohammed sven kalisch , a muslim theologian who converted to islam as a teen , to head the university 's new department dedicated to educating future generations of islamic teachers .
the department , the first of its kind in germany , is designed to bridge the mistrust between german educational authorities and the country 's myriad muslim organizations .

the news follows efforts by officials in the state of north-rhine westphalia to shut down a private saudi-financed school after fundamentalist leanings were detected in the textbooks . " the state has absolutely no authority in these schools , they can do what they want and that is very troubling , " lutz irrgang , who heads the hesse state office for the protection of the constitution , told dw-world . educating the next generation of islam teachers officials know that raids alone ca n't root out radicalism in pockets of germany 's 3.2 million-strong muslim community .
one of the best hopes remains ending the monopoly on islamic teachings held by dubious imams and teachers in courtyard mosques , and bringing muslim children back into the educational mainstream .
this week , the university of münster took a step in that direction when it announced the appointment of mohammed sven kalisch , a muslim theologian who converted to islam as a teen , to head the university 's new department dedicated to educating future generations of islamic teachers .
the department , the first of its kind in germany , is designed to bridge the mistrust between german educational authorities and the country 's myriad muslim organizations .
kalisch , a favorite of both german educators and muslim leaders , said he is fully aware of the way fundamentalist imams use the koran to send the wrong message .
" by educating islamic teachers we , of course , hope to work against extremist tendencies , " kalisch said . problems begin after school school authorities in berlin , bremen , bavaria and north rhine- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish students taking islam religion classes at a school in bremen westphalia have already added islam religion classes as an option to similar course offerings in judaism and catholicism .
lower saxony recently announced similar plans to test out islam religion courses . the classes , taught by teachers who are practicing muslims , offer germany 's estimated 800,000 muslim students the possibility of learning about their religion in a way that officials can keep tabs on . " it 's like our classes on catholicism and protestantism , " said spokeswoman nina schmidt .
" by doing it in our school we can make sure that it 's taught from an academic point of view , that no fundamentalist teachings slip in . " the problems begin after school is over for the day , when many parents send their children to private koran lessons . it is at these schools that the seeds of fundamentalism are planted , say law enforcement officials .
raids by police across germany routinely turn up the type of videos and literature found at the frankfurt school . jihadis " rely more on indirect communication nowadays , like videos and tapes , " said kai hirschmann , co-director of the essen-based institute for terrorism research and policy .
" that communication often takes place through the koran schools . " holy war at the school 's friday prayers but not only there .
school officials in north-rhine westphalia were appalled at the material found in textbooks seized at the king fahd academy in bonn .
the academy , funded by the saudi arabian government , caters to the sons and daughters of diplomats , arabic families who stay in germany for long periods as well as children with german citizenship or permanent resident status . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the king fahd academy in bad godesberg more than 300 textbooks were confiscated as part of a police investigation into the school 's fundamentalist tendencies in october 2003 .
the academy -lrb- photo -rrb- , which opened in the quiet bonn neighborhood of bad godesberg in 1995 , had already suspended one teacher after he had allegedly called for holy war against the west in friday prayers . bonn school officials reviewing the teaching material found in a study that students were taught that " the muslim people 's existence has been threatened by jews and christians since the crusades and it is the first duty of every muslim to prepare to fight against these enemies . " though powerless to close the school , school officials were able to force at least 53 children with german citizenship or permanent residency status to leave the academy based on what they study . the cooperation between law enforcement and school authorities is by no means typical , but can sometimes be useful .
still , investigators say that the best methods are not frequent raids but education . " one of the best tools , " said irrgang , " remains enlightenment .

but new efforts are being made to strenghten the bloc 's cultural diversity . when spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero took office earlier this year , he decided to take a new linguistic approach than his predecessor .

" it would allow people to communicate in their language , or to obtain documents in that language , " james fife of eurolang , the newsagency attached to the european buro for lesser used languages , told dw-world .

not all states are minority language-friendly , " fife said .

many of the ten new countries were forced into a life of russian , and are only too glad to have the chance to promote their own linguistic heritages . although the eu is home to more than 40 minority languages - with tens of million speakers - the only one on the whole continent actually entitled to the status of official working language , is gaelic , and that is only the case because gaelic is an official language of the republic of ireland .
but would other countries want the same treatment for their pockets of linguistic diversity ?
according to fife , it varies from place to place .
he cites hungary as great believer in the promotion of its 15 sub-languages , and france as country which is doggedly determined not to acknowledge it linguistic treasure chest . fife said germany , with its slavic sorbian minority , is somewhere in the middle .
" germany does n't have quite the same negative attitude to minority languages .
it provides some support and recognition , more than the french , " he said . keeping sorbian alive but the official association of sorbs feels that germany 's federal government could do more to integrate sorbian into the regional and national consciousness .

" we will never reach the stage where people who live in sorbian areas have to be able to speak both languages , because we do not have territorial autonomy , " zies added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 27.07.2004 a rocky road for germany 's autobahn großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 12 years in the making , and the a17 autobahn is n't finished yet the eu 's eastern expansion has made germany 's freeway system essential for cross-european freight transport .
more freeways are needed , but their construction remains controversial and expensive . the completion of the a17 autobahn , the freeway which will eventually run from the city of dresden to the czech border , will mean very different things depending on who you talk to . to its proponents , it will close a gaping hole in europe 's freeway system and encourage economic growth by keeping pace with the continent 's fast-growing international road transport needs .
to its detractors , it will dirty the air in dresden , threaten sensitive natural habitats and increase traffic in the region .
in short , it will represent a wrong approach to transport planning . all can agree on one thing though , it will have been an expensive and protracted project - in the works since 1991 , in the end the 44.6 kilometer -lrb- 27.7 mile -rrb- stretch to the czech republic , estimated to be completed in 2006 and to carry up to 72,000 vehicles per day , will have cost at least € 650 million -lrb- $ 790 million -rrb- to build . the rocky history of this costly road highlights a common problem regarding transport in germany today : how to balance the growing needs of highway transportation and economic growth with protection for the environment and the people who live near autobahn routes . armin reck , press spokesman for the saxony highway department , has been involved with the a17 since its early days .
he was brought in to sell the idea to the public , since the project was almost shelved due to vocal opposition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opponents say the stretch runs through sensitive habitats groups ranging from traditional environmental activists to farmers to the clergy - " pastors against the a17 " - hit the streets in protest , camped out in trees slated for felling , and went to court to stop the freeway . " it was astounding what kind of groups came out against this freeway , " reck told dw-world as he drove along the nine-kilometer stretch of almost-completed tunnels and bridges that has turned into once of the most expensive sections of an already costly project . eu 's transport backbone despite the sky-high sums involved , economists and business leaders agree that there is a critical need to improve and expand germany 's aging network of freeways .
given germany 's new central position within the eu , after the may 1 expansion added ten new members mostly in eastern europe , the freeway system is now the backbone of international road shipping in europe .
whether goods are going from poland to spain or sweden to greece , if they are going by road , it is likely they will pass through germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : truck traffic is estimated to increase dramatically .
as trade increases between new and old members of the eu , traffic is likely to increase .
conservative estimates say by 2010 , the number of trucks travelling on german freeways will double ; other forecasts say the number will quadruple .
if germany 's already overburdened system is not beefed up , many fear , goods could be delayed crossing the continent and economic development could suffer . " traffic and economic growth are related closely to one another , " ralf stock , head of the department of traffic engineering , told dw-world .
" it 's a fact that during the past 30 years , the development of the gross domestic product and the passenger and freight transport service has been very similar . " while other eu countries have on average increased their highway networks by 70 percent since 1991 , germany has only added 10 percent to its own system .
highway planners now work into their calculations the consequences of protests and lawsuits from various interest groups , which have become almost as inevitable as death and taxes . difficult birth plans for an autobahn between dresden and the czech border are not new .
the nazis drew up plans for a highway in 1938 , but they were scrapped during the war .
the east germans considered building as well , but their government collapsed before they could start digging .
after reunification in 1990 , the project got new priority status and in 1991 planning began - shortly thereafter , so did the protests . the issue became so contentious that the highway department , for the first time , put the matter to the public in a 1995 referendum , and won .
but , to get public approval , the department decided to accommodate many of the concerns of freeway opponents . engineers sank most of the autobahn up to twelve meters below the surface , to provide noise protection and give a psychological boost to surrounding residents .
" if they ca n't actually see the freeway , they 're less likely to complain about it , " the highway department 's reck said . spanning the road will be two so-called " green bridges , " which were demanded by environmentalists who wanted animals to be able cross the highway safely and by local residents who insisted that a wooded area near the ruins of a manor torn down by the nazis be preserved .
the two bridges cost around € 8 million to build . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other environmental protection measures include noise protection panels that line much of the freeway and tunnels and guidance systems that allow protected species of frogs to cross the road .
local bats get their own tunnel with ultrasonic technology to guide them through . " on average , every third euro for street or highway construction is spent on environmental protection , " said reck . quality of life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the costs , even those who want to see more kilometers of autobahn and more lanes to already existing ones are wary of jettisoning germany 's strict environmental laws in favor of unfettered highway construction .
they say they are necessary to maintain the quality of life in this densely populated country , whose road network is already one of the most extensive in europe . but if some costs could come down , experts say , construction could be moved along , and autobahn supply might keep up with future trucking demands . " financing is often a problem because of the large expenses involved , " kay lindemann , head of the traffic policy department at the federation of german endustry , told dw-world .
" environmental protection measures often drive those costs up . " armin reck , however , is fairly good natured about the costs as well as the drawn-out and often controversial planning and construction process .
" we have to respect people 's interests , they have to live near the autobahn after all , " he said . " besides , planning started in 1991 and we 're going to open one part in october 2004 .
for us getting such a difficult freeway built , that 's almost a world record . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putting the brakes on germany 's autobahn ?

in short , it will represent a wrong approach to transport planning . all can agree on one thing though , it will have been an expensive and protracted project - in the works since 1991 , in the end the 44.6 kilometer -lrb- 27.7 mile -rrb- stretch to the czech republic , estimated to be completed in 2006 and to carry up to 72,000 vehicles per day , will have cost at least € 650 million -lrb- $ 790 million -rrb- to build . the rocky history of this costly road highlights a common problem regarding transport in germany today : how to balance the growing needs of highway transportation and economic growth with protection for the environment and the people who live near autobahn routes . armin reck , press spokesman for the saxony highway department , has been involved with the a17 since its early days .
he was brought in to sell the idea to the public , since the project was almost shelved due to vocal opposition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opponents say the stretch runs through sensitive habitats groups ranging from traditional environmental activists to farmers to the clergy - " pastors against the a17 " - hit the streets in protest , camped out in trees slated for felling , and went to court to stop the freeway . " it was astounding what kind of groups came out against this freeway , " reck told dw-world as he drove along the nine-kilometer stretch of almost-completed tunnels and bridges that has turned into once of the most expensive sections of an already costly project . eu 's transport backbone despite the sky-high sums involved , economists and business leaders agree that there is a critical need to improve and expand germany 's aging network of freeways .
given germany 's new central position within the eu , after the may 1 expansion added ten new members mostly in eastern europe , the freeway system is now the backbone of international road shipping in europe .
whether goods are going from poland to spain or sweden to greece , if they are going by road , it is likely they will pass through germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : truck traffic is estimated to increase dramatically .
as trade increases between new and old members of the eu , traffic is likely to increase .
conservative estimates say by 2010 , the number of trucks travelling on german freeways will double ; other forecasts say the number will quadruple .
if germany 's already overburdened system is not beefed up , many fear , goods could be delayed crossing the continent and economic development could suffer . " traffic and economic growth are related closely to one another , " ralf stock , head of the department of traffic engineering , told dw-world .
" it 's a fact that during the past 30 years , the development of the gross domestic product and the passenger and freight transport service has been very similar . " while other eu countries have on average increased their highway networks by 70 percent since 1991 , germany has only added 10 percent to its own system .
highway planners now work into their calculations the consequences of protests and lawsuits from various interest groups , which have become almost as inevitable as death and taxes . difficult birth plans for an autobahn between dresden and the czech border are not new .
the nazis drew up plans for a highway in 1938 , but they were scrapped during the war .
the east germans considered building as well , but their government collapsed before they could start digging .
after reunification in 1990 , the project got new priority status and in 1991 planning began - shortly thereafter , so did the protests . the issue became so contentious that the highway department , for the first time , put the matter to the public in a 1995 referendum , and won .
but , to get public approval , the department decided to accommodate many of the concerns of freeway opponents . engineers sank most of the autobahn up to twelve meters below the surface , to provide noise protection and give a psychological boost to surrounding residents .
" if they ca n't actually see the freeway , they 're less likely to complain about it , " the highway department 's reck said . spanning the road will be two so-called " green bridges , " which were demanded by environmentalists who wanted animals to be able cross the highway safely and by local residents who insisted that a wooded area near the ruins of a manor torn down by the nazis be preserved .
the two bridges cost around € 8 million to build . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other environmental protection measures include noise protection panels that line much of the freeway and tunnels and guidance systems that allow protected species of frogs to cross the road .
local bats get their own tunnel with ultrasonic technology to guide them through . " on average , every third euro for street or highway construction is spent on environmental protection , " said reck . quality of life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the costs , even those who want to see more kilometers of autobahn and more lanes to already existing ones are wary of jettisoning germany 's strict environmental laws in favor of unfettered highway construction .
they say they are necessary to maintain the quality of life in this densely populated country , whose road network is already one of the most extensive in europe . but if some costs could come down , experts say , construction could be moved along , and autobahn supply might keep up with future trucking demands . " financing is often a problem because of the large expenses involved , " kay lindemann , head of the traffic policy department at the federation of german endustry , told dw-world .
" environmental protection measures often drive those costs up . " armin reck , however , is fairly good natured about the costs as well as the drawn-out and often controversial planning and construction process .
" we have to respect people 's interests , they have to live near the autobahn after all , " he said . " besides , planning started in 1991 and we 're going to open one part in october 2004 .
for us getting such a difficult freeway built , that 's almost a world record . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putting the brakes on germany 's autobahn ?
while many sections of germany 's freeway system , or autobahn , allow drivers to cruise as fast as they want , politicians have begun calling for a general speed limit .
public opinion on the issue looks to be changing .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 27.07.2004 the major issue of minority languages großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : language is an important part of catalan culture the newly enlarged european union has a rich linguistic variety extending far beyond its official working languages .
but new efforts are being made to strenghten the bloc 's cultural diversity . when spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero took office earlier this year , he decided to take a new linguistic approach than his predecessor .
within just a matter of weeks he had called on his counterparts in the european union to grant spain 's regional languages official recognition in the future european constitution . if the eu agrees to madrid 's request , catalan , basque and galician will be awarded ' treaty status ' .
" it would allow people to communicate in their language , or to obtain documents in that language , " james fife of eurolang , the newsagency attached to the european buro for lesser used languages , told dw-world .
and given that there are more speakers of catalan than of either slovenian or maltese - which has not yet become an eu working language - it does n't seem an altogether unfair request . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish prime minister , jose luis rodriguez zapatero however , spain 's conservative opposition slammed zapatero 's demand for recognition , saying it was nothing more than a stunt aimed at sweetening his nationalist coalition partners .
but whatever the motives , fife welcomes spain 's nurturing approach , and would like to see other european states take their cue from madrid 's lead . " even if spain were successful in achieving treaty status , it is hard to see how there would be a snowball effect .
not all states are minority language-friendly , " fife said .
for many regional languages , simply gaining recognition on home ground is a steep enough mountain to climb .
" it 's often all that national minorities can do to maintain themselves , in many cases they are losing their fight to stay alive , " he concluded . eastern europe provides new impetus interestingly enough , the new eu member states have dusted off the issue of minority european languages , and put it squarely back on the table .
while western european governments have traditionally tended to close their ears to regional tongues , the approach in the east is quite different .
many of the ten new countries were forced into a life of russian , and are only too glad to have the chance to promote their own linguistic heritages . although the eu is home to more than 40 minority languages - with tens of million speakers - the only one on the whole continent actually entitled to the status of official working language , is gaelic , and that is only the case because gaelic is an official language of the republic of ireland .
but would other countries want the same treatment for their pockets of linguistic diversity ?
according to fife , it varies from place to place .
he cites hungary as great believer in the promotion of its 15 sub-languages , and france as country which is doggedly determined not to acknowledge it linguistic treasure chest . fife said germany , with its slavic sorbian minority , is somewhere in the middle .
" germany does n't have quite the same negative attitude to minority languages .
it provides some support and recognition , more than the french , " he said . keeping sorbian alive but the official association of sorbs feels that germany 's federal government could do more to integrate sorbian into the regional and national consciousness .
although the government currently stumps up an annual budget for the promotion of sorbian culture , it has already threatened to cut its contributions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sorbian girls in traditional dress. dressed in their traditional with a total of 60,000 speakers of upper sorbian and lower sorbian in the states of saxony and brandenburg , local residents can theoretically go from one day to the next without speaking any german .
theoretical , however , is the operative word .
" many people ca n't speak sorbian , but those who work for the local authorities , and the police etc , should be bi-lingual .
if sorbs saw that they could use their language freely , they would do so , " bernhard zies , managing director of the association for lausitzer sorbs told dw-world . it 's an ideal which remains far from reality .
even measures to revitalize the language , such as the introduction of bi-lingual kindergartens and schooling , are unlikely to make it as important to germany as catalan appears to be to spain . " we will never reach the stage where people who live in sorbian areas have to be able to speak both languages , because we do not have territorial autonomy , " zies added .
that is a view shared by james fife , who believes devolution from central powers is a pre-requisite to the successful preservation of minority languages . tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de how do you say accession in maltese ?

the news follows efforts by officials in the state of north-rhine westphalia to shut down a private saudi-financed school after fundamentalist leanings were detected in the textbooks . " the state has absolutely no authority in these schools , they can do what they want and that is very troubling , " lutz irrgang , who heads the hesse state office for the protection of the constitution , told dw-world . educating the next generation of islam teachers officials know that raids alone ca n't root out radicalism in pockets of germany 's 3.2 million-strong muslim community .
one of the best hopes remains ending the monopoly on islamic teachings held by dubious imams and teachers in courtyard mosques , and bringing muslim children back into the educational mainstream .
this week , the university of münster took a step in that direction when it announced the appointment of mohammed sven kalisch , a muslim theologian who converted to islam as a teen , to head the university 's new department dedicated to educating future generations of islamic teachers .
the department , the first of its kind in germany , is designed to bridge the mistrust between german educational authorities and the country 's myriad muslim organizations .
kalisch , a favorite of both german educators and muslim leaders , said he is fully aware of the way fundamentalist imams use the koran to send the wrong message .
" by educating islamic teachers we , of course , hope to work against extremist tendencies , " kalisch said . problems begin after school school authorities in berlin , bremen , bavaria and north rhine- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish students taking islam religion classes at a school in bremen westphalia have already added islam religion classes as an option to similar course offerings in judaism and catholicism .
lower saxony recently announced similar plans to test out islam religion courses . the classes , taught by teachers who are practicing muslims , offer germany 's estimated 800,000 muslim students the possibility of learning about their religion in a way that officials can keep tabs on . " it 's like our classes on catholicism and protestantism , " said spokeswoman nina schmidt .
" by doing it in our school we can make sure that it 's taught from an academic point of view , that no fundamentalist teachings slip in . " the problems begin after school is over for the day , when many parents send their children to private koran lessons . it is at these schools that the seeds of fundamentalism are planted , say law enforcement officials .
raids by police across germany routinely turn up the type of videos and literature found at the frankfurt school . jihadis " rely more on indirect communication nowadays , like videos and tapes , " said kai hirschmann , co-director of the essen-based institute for terrorism research and policy .
" that communication often takes place through the koran schools . " holy war at the school 's friday prayers but not only there .

more freeways are needed , but their construction remains controversial and expensive . the completion of the a17 autobahn , the freeway which will eventually run from the city of dresden to the czech border , will mean very different things depending on who you talk to . to its proponents , it will close a gaping hole in europe 's freeway system and encourage economic growth by keeping pace with the continent 's fast-growing international road transport needs .
to its detractors , it will dirty the air in dresden , threaten sensitive natural habitats and increase traffic in the region .
in short , it will represent a wrong approach to transport planning . all can agree on one thing though , it will have been an expensive and protracted project - in the works since 1991 , in the end the 44.6 kilometer -lrb- 27.7 mile -rrb- stretch to the czech republic , estimated to be completed in 2006 and to carry up to 72,000 vehicles per day , will have cost at least € 650 million -lrb- $ 790 million -rrb- to build . the rocky history of this costly road highlights a common problem regarding transport in germany today : how to balance the growing needs of highway transportation and economic growth with protection for the environment and the people who live near autobahn routes . armin reck , press spokesman for the saxony highway department , has been involved with the a17 since its early days .
he was brought in to sell the idea to the public , since the project was almost shelved due to vocal opposition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opponents say the stretch runs through sensitive habitats groups ranging from traditional environmental activists to farmers to the clergy - " pastors against the a17 " - hit the streets in protest , camped out in trees slated for felling , and went to court to stop the freeway . " it was astounding what kind of groups came out against this freeway , " reck told dw-world as he drove along the nine-kilometer stretch of almost-completed tunnels and bridges that has turned into once of the most expensive sections of an already costly project . eu 's transport backbone despite the sky-high sums involved , economists and business leaders agree that there is a critical need to improve and expand germany 's aging network of freeways .
given germany 's new central position within the eu , after the may 1 expansion added ten new members mostly in eastern europe , the freeway system is now the backbone of international road shipping in europe .
whether goods are going from poland to spain or sweden to greece , if they are going by road , it is likely they will pass through germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : truck traffic is estimated to increase dramatically .
as trade increases between new and old members of the eu , traffic is likely to increase .
conservative estimates say by 2010 , the number of trucks travelling on german freeways will double ; other forecasts say the number will quadruple .
if germany 's already overburdened system is not beefed up , many fear , goods could be delayed crossing the continent and economic development could suffer . " traffic and economic growth are related closely to one another , " ralf stock , head of the department of traffic engineering , told dw-world .
" it 's a fact that during the past 30 years , the development of the gross domestic product and the passenger and freight transport service has been very similar . " while other eu countries have on average increased their highway networks by 70 percent since 1991 , germany has only added 10 percent to its own system .
highway planners now work into their calculations the consequences of protests and lawsuits from various interest groups , which have become almost as inevitable as death and taxes . difficult birth plans for an autobahn between dresden and the czech border are not new .
the nazis drew up plans for a highway in 1938 , but they were scrapped during the war .
the east germans considered building as well , but their government collapsed before they could start digging .
after reunification in 1990 , the project got new priority status and in 1991 planning began - shortly thereafter , so did the protests . the issue became so contentious that the highway department , for the first time , put the matter to the public in a 1995 referendum , and won .
but , to get public approval , the department decided to accommodate many of the concerns of freeway opponents . engineers sank most of the autobahn up to twelve meters below the surface , to provide noise protection and give a psychological boost to surrounding residents .
" if they ca n't actually see the freeway , they 're less likely to complain about it , " the highway department 's reck said . spanning the road will be two so-called " green bridges , " which were demanded by environmentalists who wanted animals to be able cross the highway safely and by local residents who insisted that a wooded area near the ruins of a manor torn down by the nazis be preserved .
the two bridges cost around € 8 million to build . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other environmental protection measures include noise protection panels that line much of the freeway and tunnels and guidance systems that allow protected species of frogs to cross the road .
local bats get their own tunnel with ultrasonic technology to guide them through .

" environmental protection measures often drive those costs up . " armin reck , however , is fairly good natured about the costs as well as the drawn-out and often controversial planning and construction process .
" we have to respect people 's interests , they have to live near the autobahn after all , " he said . " besides , planning started in 1991 and we 're going to open one part in october 2004 .

after reunification in 1990 , the project got new priority status and in 1991 planning began - shortly thereafter , so did the protests . the issue became so contentious that the highway department , for the first time , put the matter to the public in a 1995 referendum , and won .
but , to get public approval , the department decided to accommodate many of the concerns of freeway opponents . engineers sank most of the autobahn up to twelve meters below the surface , to provide noise protection and give a psychological boost to surrounding residents .
" if they ca n't actually see the freeway , they 're less likely to complain about it , " the highway department 's reck said . spanning the road will be two so-called " green bridges , " which were demanded by environmentalists who wanted animals to be able cross the highway safely and by local residents who insisted that a wooded area near the ruins of a manor torn down by the nazis be preserved .
the two bridges cost around € 8 million to build . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other environmental protection measures include noise protection panels that line much of the freeway and tunnels and guidance systems that allow protected species of frogs to cross the road .
local bats get their own tunnel with ultrasonic technology to guide them through . " on average , every third euro for street or highway construction is spent on environmental protection , " said reck . quality of life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the costs , even those who want to see more kilometers of autobahn and more lanes to already existing ones are wary of jettisoning germany 's strict environmental laws in favor of unfettered highway construction .
they say they are necessary to maintain the quality of life in this densely populated country , whose road network is already one of the most extensive in europe . but if some costs could come down , experts say , construction could be moved along , and autobahn supply might keep up with future trucking demands . " financing is often a problem because of the large expenses involved , " kay lindemann , head of the traffic policy department at the federation of german endustry , told dw-world .
" environmental protection measures often drive those costs up . " armin reck , however , is fairly good natured about the costs as well as the drawn-out and often controversial planning and construction process .
" we have to respect people 's interests , they have to live near the autobahn after all , " he said . " besides , planning started in 1991 and we 're going to open one part in october 2004 .
for us getting such a difficult freeway built , that 's almost a world record . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putting the brakes on germany 's autobahn ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 27.07.2004 a rocky road for germany 's autobahn großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 12 years in the making , and the a17 autobahn is n't finished yet the eu 's eastern expansion has made germany 's freeway system essential for cross-european freight transport .
more freeways are needed , but their construction remains controversial and expensive . the completion of the a17 autobahn , the freeway which will eventually run from the city of dresden to the czech border , will mean very different things depending on who you talk to . to its proponents , it will close a gaping hole in europe 's freeway system and encourage economic growth by keeping pace with the continent 's fast-growing international road transport needs .
to its detractors , it will dirty the air in dresden , threaten sensitive natural habitats and increase traffic in the region .
in short , it will represent a wrong approach to transport planning . all can agree on one thing though , it will have been an expensive and protracted project - in the works since 1991 , in the end the 44.6 kilometer -lrb- 27.7 mile -rrb- stretch to the czech republic , estimated to be completed in 2006 and to carry up to 72,000 vehicles per day , will have cost at least € 650 million -lrb- $ 790 million -rrb- to build . the rocky history of this costly road highlights a common problem regarding transport in germany today : how to balance the growing needs of highway transportation and economic growth with protection for the environment and the people who live near autobahn routes . armin reck , press spokesman for the saxony highway department , has been involved with the a17 since its early days .
he was brought in to sell the idea to the public , since the project was almost shelved due to vocal opposition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opponents say the stretch runs through sensitive habitats groups ranging from traditional environmental activists to farmers to the clergy - " pastors against the a17 " - hit the streets in protest , camped out in trees slated for felling , and went to court to stop the freeway . " it was astounding what kind of groups came out against this freeway , " reck told dw-world as he drove along the nine-kilometer stretch of almost-completed tunnels and bridges that has turned into once of the most expensive sections of an already costly project . eu 's transport backbone despite the sky-high sums involved , economists and business leaders agree that there is a critical need to improve and expand germany 's aging network of freeways .
given germany 's new central position within the eu , after the may 1 expansion added ten new members mostly in eastern europe , the freeway system is now the backbone of international road shipping in europe .
whether goods are going from poland to spain or sweden to greece , if they are going by road , it is likely they will pass through germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : truck traffic is estimated to increase dramatically .
as trade increases between new and old members of the eu , traffic is likely to increase .
conservative estimates say by 2010 , the number of trucks travelling on german freeways will double ; other forecasts say the number will quadruple .
if germany 's already overburdened system is not beefed up , many fear , goods could be delayed crossing the continent and economic development could suffer . " traffic and economic growth are related closely to one another , " ralf stock , head of the department of traffic engineering , told dw-world .
" it 's a fact that during the past 30 years , the development of the gross domestic product and the passenger and freight transport service has been very similar . " while other eu countries have on average increased their highway networks by 70 percent since 1991 , germany has only added 10 percent to its own system .
highway planners now work into their calculations the consequences of protests and lawsuits from various interest groups , which have become almost as inevitable as death and taxes . difficult birth plans for an autobahn between dresden and the czech border are not new .
the nazis drew up plans for a highway in 1938 , but they were scrapped during the war .
the east germans considered building as well , but their government collapsed before they could start digging .
after reunification in 1990 , the project got new priority status and in 1991 planning began - shortly thereafter , so did the protests . the issue became so contentious that the highway department , for the first time , put the matter to the public in a 1995 referendum , and won .
but , to get public approval , the department decided to accommodate many of the concerns of freeway opponents . engineers sank most of the autobahn up to twelve meters below the surface , to provide noise protection and give a psychological boost to surrounding residents .
" if they ca n't actually see the freeway , they 're less likely to complain about it , " the highway department 's reck said . spanning the road will be two so-called " green bridges , " which were demanded by environmentalists who wanted animals to be able cross the highway safely and by local residents who insisted that a wooded area near the ruins of a manor torn down by the nazis be preserved .
the two bridges cost around € 8 million to build . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other environmental protection measures include noise protection panels that line much of the freeway and tunnels and guidance systems that allow protected species of frogs to cross the road .
local bats get their own tunnel with ultrasonic technology to guide them through . " on average , every third euro for street or highway construction is spent on environmental protection , " said reck . quality of life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the costs , even those who want to see more kilometers of autobahn and more lanes to already existing ones are wary of jettisoning germany 's strict environmental laws in favor of unfettered highway construction .
they say they are necessary to maintain the quality of life in this densely populated country , whose road network is already one of the most extensive in europe . but if some costs could come down , experts say , construction could be moved along , and autobahn supply might keep up with future trucking demands . " financing is often a problem because of the large expenses involved , " kay lindemann , head of the traffic policy department at the federation of german endustry , told dw-world .
" environmental protection measures often drive those costs up . " armin reck , however , is fairly good natured about the costs as well as the drawn-out and often controversial planning and construction process .
" we have to respect people 's interests , they have to live near the autobahn after all , " he said . " besides , planning started in 1991 and we 're going to open one part in october 2004 .
for us getting such a difficult freeway built , that 's almost a world record . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putting the brakes on germany 's autobahn ?
while many sections of germany 's freeway system , or autobahn , allow drivers to cruise as fast as they want , politicians have begun calling for a general speed limit .
public opinion on the issue looks to be changing .
-lrb- july 7 , 2004 -rrb- a toll for germany 's autobahns ?
the economics minister 's comments on privatizing the autobahn has drawn a raft of criticism from politicians and experts with most unanimous that germans wo n't want to pay money to speed on their beloved freeway system .

critics said the law infringed on states ' rights . the ruling does away with so-called " junior professorships " the federal government introduced to replace a germany 's unique system of habilitation , which requires post-doctoral researchers to work with tenured professors for several years and complete another thesis before they can become professors themselves . saying that the old german system prevented people from competing on an international level , the social democratic-greens government decided to allow scholars to become professors immediately . according to the new law , they were able to hold the position for up to six years before having to move on to a regular professorship .
the new system was expected to replace the old in 2010 . some states resist federal involvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : currently , most german professors are at least 42 years old several state governments - bavaria , saxony and thuringia - had criticized the change for a number of reasons : they complained that the federal government had infringed on state rights to determine educational policies themselves - an argument five of eight judges at germany 's constitutional court agreed with in ruling against the law . government officials were quick to point out that the judges had only ruled against the federal law without calling into question the concept of junior professorships itself .
german education minister edelgard bulmahn said she expected state governments to act now and implement the change . berlin vows to stick to program several states have already done so .
berlin state government officials on tuesday said they would stick to junior professorships and lobby for the program with other states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edelgard bulmahn inside germany 's constitutional court on tuesday bulmahn -lrb- photo -rrb- added that the federal government 's jurisdiction over universities had to be expanded for german academic institutions to stay competitive internationally .
she said a committee currently working on reforming germany 's federal system should address that issue as well . supporters of the junior professorships also said the ruling would hold them back as compared to academics in other countries that do n't have to spend valuable years as assistants to another professor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's humboldt university " this way we 're never going to get competitive internationally , " claudia kemfert , an economic scientist at berlin 's humboldt university , told der spiegel newsmagazine .
the 35-year-old recently became germany 's first junior professor to move on to a regular professorship . a lack of funding ? but critics also lamented a lack of adequate funding for the positions .
universities had received about € 180 million -lrb- $ 219 million -rrb- for up to 3,000 junior professors .
so far , only 933 positions exist . " that 's definitely too little money , " katharina reiche , an education policy expert for the opposition christian democrats in the german parliament , told berliner zeitung . while saying that junior professorships were not necessarily a bad thing , reiche added that her party planned to undo the abolishment of the habilitation , which should remain as an alternative option . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students in frankfurt protesting against proposed university fees constitutional court judges are also expected to rule on a prohibition of university fees later this year after several states who would like to charge students had complained about the law . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de antarctic summit gets underway in bremen germany will pay € 26 million for the construction of the new neumayer iii polar station in the antarctic , government officials announce at the start of an international conference in bremen .

the news follows efforts by officials in the state of north-rhine westphalia to shut down a private saudi-financed school after fundamentalist leanings were detected in the textbooks . " the state has absolutely no authority in these schools , they can do what they want and that is very troubling , " lutz irrgang , who heads the hesse state office for the protection of the constitution , told dw-world . educating the next generation of islam teachers officials know that raids alone ca n't root out radicalism in pockets of germany 's 3.2 million-strong muslim community .
one of the best hopes remains ending the monopoly on islamic teachings held by dubious imams and teachers in courtyard mosques , and bringing muslim children back into the educational mainstream .
this week , the university of münster took a step in that direction when it announced the appointment of mohammed sven kalisch , a muslim theologian who converted to islam as a teen , to head the university 's new department dedicated to educating future generations of islamic teachers .
the department , the first of its kind in germany , is designed to bridge the mistrust between german educational authorities and the country 's myriad muslim organizations .
kalisch , a favorite of both german educators and muslim leaders , said he is fully aware of the way fundamentalist imams use the koran to send the wrong message .
" by educating islamic teachers we , of course , hope to work against extremist tendencies , " kalisch said . problems begin after school school authorities in berlin , bremen , bavaria and north rhine- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish students taking islam religion classes at a school in bremen westphalia have already added islam religion classes as an option to similar course offerings in judaism and catholicism .
lower saxony recently announced similar plans to test out islam religion courses . the classes , taught by teachers who are practicing muslims , offer germany 's estimated 800,000 muslim students the possibility of learning about their religion in a way that officials can keep tabs on . " it 's like our classes on catholicism and protestantism , " said spokeswoman nina schmidt .
" by doing it in our school we can make sure that it 's taught from an academic point of view , that no fundamentalist teachings slip in . " the problems begin after school is over for the day , when many parents send their children to private koran lessons . it is at these schools that the seeds of fundamentalism are planted , say law enforcement officials .
raids by police across germany routinely turn up the type of videos and literature found at the frankfurt school . jihadis " rely more on indirect communication nowadays , like videos and tapes , " said kai hirschmann , co-director of the essen-based institute for terrorism research and policy .
" that communication often takes place through the koran schools . " holy war at the school 's friday prayers but not only there .
school officials in north-rhine westphalia were appalled at the material found in textbooks seized at the king fahd academy in bonn .
the academy , funded by the saudi arabian government , caters to the sons and daughters of diplomats , arabic families who stay in germany for long periods as well as children with german citizenship or permanent resident status . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the king fahd academy in bad godesberg more than 300 textbooks were confiscated as part of a police investigation into the school 's fundamentalist tendencies in october 2003 .
the academy -lrb- photo -rrb- , which opened in the quiet bonn neighborhood of bad godesberg in 1995 , had already suspended one teacher after he had allegedly called for holy war against the west in friday prayers . bonn school officials reviewing the teaching material found in a study that students were taught that " the muslim people 's existence has been threatened by jews and christians since the crusades and it is the first duty of every muslim to prepare to fight against these enemies . " though powerless to close the school , school officials were able to force at least 53 children with german citizenship or permanent residency status to leave the academy based on what they study . the cooperation between law enforcement and school authorities is by no means typical , but can sometimes be useful .
still , investigators say that the best methods are not frequent raids but education . " one of the best tools , " said irrgang , " remains enlightenment .

in spain , the country 's southern regions have been sweltering in temperatures of more than 40 degrees celsius -lrb- 104 fahrenheit -rrb- since last week and have claimed an estimated eleven lives so far .
the most recent victims , a 32-year-old man and an 82-year-old woman who died of heat strokes in the southern cities of cordoba and jaen respectively , were discovered on monday while a 78-year-old woman died of a circulatory failure brought on by the high temperatures on the canary island of tenerife over the weekend .
in the spanish capital , madrid , temperatures have hit 39.3c -lrb- 103f -rrb- - a 73-year high .
the latest heat wave brings back memories of the extreme heat that swept through europe last summer , killing thousands .
exceptionally hot weather killed at least 141 people in spain last year .
france braces as bad memories return in france , which was hardest hit last year in the heat wave that killed an estimated 15,000 people , president jacques chirac told his ministers monday to keep their summer vacations short this year as fears of a repeat of last summer 's tragedy begin to circulate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bodies of the dead were stored in refrigerated makeshift morgues in paris .
the death of thousands of mostly elderly french citizens caused outrage as it was revealed that government ministers initially refused to cut short their holidays to respond to the extraordinary conditions in august 2003 .
the number of dead and increasing temperatures caused havoc and led to the use of makeshift insulated morgues across the french capital -lrb- photo -rrb- . jean-francois mattei , who was health minister at the time , was eventually sacked in a cabinet reshuffle months after being seen on television in a t-shirt in his villa in south of france insisting that there was nothing to worry about at the beginning of the hot weather . his replacement , philippe douste-blazy , has promised that , he would return to paris from his summer vacation " at the drop of a hat " if similar conditions look likely this summer .
jacques chirac , however , will again be overseas this year .
the french president failed to return from his vacation in canada during last summer 's deadly heat wave .
huge swathes of portugal 's forests lost meanwhile hundreds of firefighters , backed by water trucks , helicopters and planes , continued to battle fires across portugal on monday .
the tourist region of faro on portugal 's southern coast was hardest hit , with more than 150 firefighters working in mountains near the spa town of monchique , a spokesman for the national emergency service said .
it is the second consecutive year of extreme forest fires in portugal .
in 2003 , huge fires destroyed 13 percent of its forests and woodlands and claimed 18 lives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : firefighters also extinguished a major fire in the arrabida natural park , 30 miles south of lisbon on monday .
the fire in the park , which is home to protected species like the wildcat and the mongoose , was eventually put out after destroying over 900 hectares of wilderness .
several beaches in the area had to be evacuated on sunday and remained closed to the public on tuesday .
there were no reports of injuries in any of the fires .
eu neighbors on alert with aid greece is sending two planes to portugal to fight the fires while italy has put an aircraft on standby following the country 's plea for help , the eu executive commission said in a statement .
the high temperatures and strong dry winds have made it harder to control the many fires blazing all over the country .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 27.07.2004 the battle for german muslim minds großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : educators worry about what kids are taught in koran schools police raids on islamic schools may shake up fundamentalist cells , but officials agree that the right teachers are the best way to root out radical islamic leanings among germany 's muslim youth . weeks separated news of a police raid on an islamic school in frankfurt and the announcement that the university of münster had set up a department dedicated to educating islamic teachers . but the two items reveal the two-pronged approach taken in germany on what is becoming an increasingly important front in the country 's fight against terrorism : the battle for young muslim minds . after being tipped off by a 9-year-old student , police in frankfurt seized jihadist literature and videos , among them one showing a beheading , from the school hosted in a moroccan cultural center .
the news follows efforts by officials in the state of north-rhine westphalia to shut down a private saudi-financed school after fundamentalist leanings were detected in the textbooks . " the state has absolutely no authority in these schools , they can do what they want and that is very troubling , " lutz irrgang , who heads the hesse state office for the protection of the constitution , told dw-world . educating the next generation of islam teachers officials know that raids alone ca n't root out radicalism in pockets of germany 's 3.2 million-strong muslim community .
one of the best hopes remains ending the monopoly on islamic teachings held by dubious imams and teachers in courtyard mosques , and bringing muslim children back into the educational mainstream .
this week , the university of münster took a step in that direction when it announced the appointment of mohammed sven kalisch , a muslim theologian who converted to islam as a teen , to head the university 's new department dedicated to educating future generations of islamic teachers .
the department , the first of its kind in germany , is designed to bridge the mistrust between german educational authorities and the country 's myriad muslim organizations .
kalisch , a favorite of both german educators and muslim leaders , said he is fully aware of the way fundamentalist imams use the koran to send the wrong message .
" by educating islamic teachers we , of course , hope to work against extremist tendencies , " kalisch said . problems begin after school school authorities in berlin , bremen , bavaria and north rhine- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish students taking islam religion classes at a school in bremen westphalia have already added islam religion classes as an option to similar course offerings in judaism and catholicism .
lower saxony recently announced similar plans to test out islam religion courses . the classes , taught by teachers who are practicing muslims , offer germany 's estimated 800,000 muslim students the possibility of learning about their religion in a way that officials can keep tabs on . " it 's like our classes on catholicism and protestantism , " said spokeswoman nina schmidt .
" by doing it in our school we can make sure that it 's taught from an academic point of view , that no fundamentalist teachings slip in . " the problems begin after school is over for the day , when many parents send their children to private koran lessons . it is at these schools that the seeds of fundamentalism are planted , say law enforcement officials .
raids by police across germany routinely turn up the type of videos and literature found at the frankfurt school . jihadis " rely more on indirect communication nowadays , like videos and tapes , " said kai hirschmann , co-director of the essen-based institute for terrorism research and policy .
" that communication often takes place through the koran schools . " holy war at the school 's friday prayers but not only there .
school officials in north-rhine westphalia were appalled at the material found in textbooks seized at the king fahd academy in bonn .
the academy , funded by the saudi arabian government , caters to the sons and daughters of diplomats , arabic families who stay in germany for long periods as well as children with german citizenship or permanent resident status . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the king fahd academy in bad godesberg more than 300 textbooks were confiscated as part of a police investigation into the school 's fundamentalist tendencies in october 2003 .
the academy -lrb- photo -rrb- , which opened in the quiet bonn neighborhood of bad godesberg in 1995 , had already suspended one teacher after he had allegedly called for holy war against the west in friday prayers . bonn school officials reviewing the teaching material found in a study that students were taught that " the muslim people 's existence has been threatened by jews and christians since the crusades and it is the first duty of every muslim to prepare to fight against these enemies . " though powerless to close the school , school officials were able to force at least 53 children with german citizenship or permanent residency status to leave the academy based on what they study . the cooperation between law enforcement and school authorities is by no means typical , but can sometimes be useful .
still , investigators say that the best methods are not frequent raids but education . " one of the best tools , " said irrgang , " remains enlightenment . " andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de police raid islamic school in frankfurt authorities raided the islamic school of a morccan cultural association in frankfurt on sunday , searching for violent and degrading videos , including one allegedly showing a person being decapitated .
-lrb- july 12 , 2004 -rrb- when faith is more important than school german schools are increasingly grappling with cases of muslim girls pushing for exemption from co-ed swimming and sports on religious grounds , sorely testing the country 's ability to integrate its muslim population .

critics said the law infringed on states ' rights . the ruling does away with so-called " junior professorships " the federal government introduced to replace a germany 's unique system of habilitation , which requires post-doctoral researchers to work with tenured professors for several years and complete another thesis before they can become professors themselves . saying that the old german system prevented people from competing on an international level , the social democratic-greens government decided to allow scholars to become professors immediately . according to the new law , they were able to hold the position for up to six years before having to move on to a regular professorship .
the new system was expected to replace the old in 2010 . some states resist federal involvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : currently , most german professors are at least 42 years old several state governments - bavaria , saxony and thuringia - had criticized the change for a number of reasons : they complained that the federal government had infringed on state rights to determine educational policies themselves - an argument five of eight judges at germany 's constitutional court agreed with in ruling against the law . government officials were quick to point out that the judges had only ruled against the federal law without calling into question the concept of junior professorships itself .
german education minister edelgard bulmahn said she expected state governments to act now and implement the change . berlin vows to stick to program several states have already done so .
berlin state government officials on tuesday said they would stick to junior professorships and lobby for the program with other states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edelgard bulmahn inside germany 's constitutional court on tuesday bulmahn -lrb- photo -rrb- added that the federal government 's jurisdiction over universities had to be expanded for german academic institutions to stay competitive internationally .
she said a committee currently working on reforming germany 's federal system should address that issue as well . supporters of the junior professorships also said the ruling would hold them back as compared to academics in other countries that do n't have to spend valuable years as assistants to another professor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's humboldt university " this way we 're never going to get competitive internationally , " claudia kemfert , an economic scientist at berlin 's humboldt university , told der spiegel newsmagazine .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 27.07.2004 the major issue of minority languages großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : language is an important part of catalan culture the newly enlarged european union has a rich linguistic variety extending far beyond its official working languages .
but new efforts are being made to strenghten the bloc 's cultural diversity . when spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero took office earlier this year , he decided to take a new linguistic approach than his predecessor .
within just a matter of weeks he had called on his counterparts in the european union to grant spain 's regional languages official recognition in the future european constitution . if the eu agrees to madrid 's request , catalan , basque and galician will be awarded ' treaty status ' .
" it would allow people to communicate in their language , or to obtain documents in that language , " james fife of eurolang , the newsagency attached to the european buro for lesser used languages , told dw-world .
and given that there are more speakers of catalan than of either slovenian or maltese - which has not yet become an eu working language - it does n't seem an altogether unfair request . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish prime minister , jose luis rodriguez zapatero however , spain 's conservative opposition slammed zapatero 's demand for recognition , saying it was nothing more than a stunt aimed at sweetening his nationalist coalition partners .
but whatever the motives , fife welcomes spain 's nurturing approach , and would like to see other european states take their cue from madrid 's lead . " even if spain were successful in achieving treaty status , it is hard to see how there would be a snowball effect .
not all states are minority language-friendly , " fife said .
for many regional languages , simply gaining recognition on home ground is a steep enough mountain to climb .
" it 's often all that national minorities can do to maintain themselves , in many cases they are losing their fight to stay alive , " he concluded . eastern europe provides new impetus interestingly enough , the new eu member states have dusted off the issue of minority european languages , and put it squarely back on the table .
while western european governments have traditionally tended to close their ears to regional tongues , the approach in the east is quite different .
many of the ten new countries were forced into a life of russian , and are only too glad to have the chance to promote their own linguistic heritages . although the eu is home to more than 40 minority languages - with tens of million speakers - the only one on the whole continent actually entitled to the status of official working language , is gaelic , and that is only the case because gaelic is an official language of the republic of ireland .
but would other countries want the same treatment for their pockets of linguistic diversity ?
according to fife , it varies from place to place .
he cites hungary as great believer in the promotion of its 15 sub-languages , and france as country which is doggedly determined not to acknowledge it linguistic treasure chest . fife said germany , with its slavic sorbian minority , is somewhere in the middle .
" germany does n't have quite the same negative attitude to minority languages .
it provides some support and recognition , more than the french , " he said . keeping sorbian alive but the official association of sorbs feels that germany 's federal government could do more to integrate sorbian into the regional and national consciousness .
although the government currently stumps up an annual budget for the promotion of sorbian culture , it has already threatened to cut its contributions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sorbian girls in traditional dress. dressed in their traditional with a total of 60,000 speakers of upper sorbian and lower sorbian in the states of saxony and brandenburg , local residents can theoretically go from one day to the next without speaking any german .
theoretical , however , is the operative word .
" many people ca n't speak sorbian , but those who work for the local authorities , and the police etc , should be bi-lingual .
if sorbs saw that they could use their language freely , they would do so , " bernhard zies , managing director of the association for lausitzer sorbs told dw-world . it 's an ideal which remains far from reality .
even measures to revitalize the language , such as the introduction of bi-lingual kindergartens and schooling , are unlikely to make it as important to germany as catalan appears to be to spain . " we will never reach the stage where people who live in sorbian areas have to be able to speak both languages , because we do not have territorial autonomy , " zies added .
that is a view shared by james fife , who believes devolution from central powers is a pre-requisite to the successful preservation of minority languages . tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de how do you say accession in maltese ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 27.07.2004 a rocky road for germany 's autobahn großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 12 years in the making , and the a17 autobahn is n't finished yet the eu 's eastern expansion has made germany 's freeway system essential for cross-european freight transport .
more freeways are needed , but their construction remains controversial and expensive . the completion of the a17 autobahn , the freeway which will eventually run from the city of dresden to the czech border , will mean very different things depending on who you talk to . to its proponents , it will close a gaping hole in europe 's freeway system and encourage economic growth by keeping pace with the continent 's fast-growing international road transport needs .
to its detractors , it will dirty the air in dresden , threaten sensitive natural habitats and increase traffic in the region .
in short , it will represent a wrong approach to transport planning . all can agree on one thing though , it will have been an expensive and protracted project - in the works since 1991 , in the end the 44.6 kilometer -lrb- 27.7 mile -rrb- stretch to the czech republic , estimated to be completed in 2006 and to carry up to 72,000 vehicles per day , will have cost at least € 650 million -lrb- $ 790 million -rrb- to build . the rocky history of this costly road highlights a common problem regarding transport in germany today : how to balance the growing needs of highway transportation and economic growth with protection for the environment and the people who live near autobahn routes . armin reck , press spokesman for the saxony highway department , has been involved with the a17 since its early days .
he was brought in to sell the idea to the public , since the project was almost shelved due to vocal opposition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opponents say the stretch runs through sensitive habitats groups ranging from traditional environmental activists to farmers to the clergy - " pastors against the a17 " - hit the streets in protest , camped out in trees slated for felling , and went to court to stop the freeway . " it was astounding what kind of groups came out against this freeway , " reck told dw-world as he drove along the nine-kilometer stretch of almost-completed tunnels and bridges that has turned into once of the most expensive sections of an already costly project . eu 's transport backbone despite the sky-high sums involved , economists and business leaders agree that there is a critical need to improve and expand germany 's aging network of freeways .
given germany 's new central position within the eu , after the may 1 expansion added ten new members mostly in eastern europe , the freeway system is now the backbone of international road shipping in europe .
whether goods are going from poland to spain or sweden to greece , if they are going by road , it is likely they will pass through germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : truck traffic is estimated to increase dramatically .
as trade increases between new and old members of the eu , traffic is likely to increase .
conservative estimates say by 2010 , the number of trucks travelling on german freeways will double ; other forecasts say the number will quadruple .
if germany 's already overburdened system is not beefed up , many fear , goods could be delayed crossing the continent and economic development could suffer . " traffic and economic growth are related closely to one another , " ralf stock , head of the department of traffic engineering , told dw-world .
" it 's a fact that during the past 30 years , the development of the gross domestic product and the passenger and freight transport service has been very similar . " while other eu countries have on average increased their highway networks by 70 percent since 1991 , germany has only added 10 percent to its own system .
highway planners now work into their calculations the consequences of protests and lawsuits from various interest groups , which have become almost as inevitable as death and taxes . difficult birth plans for an autobahn between dresden and the czech border are not new .
the nazis drew up plans for a highway in 1938 , but they were scrapped during the war .
the east germans considered building as well , but their government collapsed before they could start digging .
after reunification in 1990 , the project got new priority status and in 1991 planning began - shortly thereafter , so did the protests . the issue became so contentious that the highway department , for the first time , put the matter to the public in a 1995 referendum , and won .
but , to get public approval , the department decided to accommodate many of the concerns of freeway opponents . engineers sank most of the autobahn up to twelve meters below the surface , to provide noise protection and give a psychological boost to surrounding residents .
" if they ca n't actually see the freeway , they 're less likely to complain about it , " the highway department 's reck said . spanning the road will be two so-called " green bridges , " which were demanded by environmentalists who wanted animals to be able cross the highway safely and by local residents who insisted that a wooded area near the ruins of a manor torn down by the nazis be preserved .
the two bridges cost around € 8 million to build . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other environmental protection measures include noise protection panels that line much of the freeway and tunnels and guidance systems that allow protected species of frogs to cross the road .
local bats get their own tunnel with ultrasonic technology to guide them through . " on average , every third euro for street or highway construction is spent on environmental protection , " said reck . quality of life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the costs , even those who want to see more kilometers of autobahn and more lanes to already existing ones are wary of jettisoning germany 's strict environmental laws in favor of unfettered highway construction .
they say they are necessary to maintain the quality of life in this densely populated country , whose road network is already one of the most extensive in europe . but if some costs could come down , experts say , construction could be moved along , and autobahn supply might keep up with future trucking demands . " financing is often a problem because of the large expenses involved , " kay lindemann , head of the traffic policy department at the federation of german endustry , told dw-world .
" environmental protection measures often drive those costs up . " armin reck , however , is fairly good natured about the costs as well as the drawn-out and often controversial planning and construction process .
" we have to respect people 's interests , they have to live near the autobahn after all , " he said . " besides , planning started in 1991 and we 're going to open one part in october 2004 .
for us getting such a difficult freeway built , that 's almost a world record . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putting the brakes on germany 's autobahn ?
while many sections of germany 's freeway system , or autobahn , allow drivers to cruise as fast as they want , politicians have begun calling for a general speed limit .

the news follows efforts by officials in the state of north-rhine westphalia to shut down a private saudi-financed school after fundamentalist leanings were detected in the textbooks . " the state has absolutely no authority in these schools , they can do what they want and that is very troubling , " lutz irrgang , who heads the hesse state office for the protection of the constitution , told dw-world . educating the next generation of islam teachers officials know that raids alone ca n't root out radicalism in pockets of germany 's 3.2 million-strong muslim community .
one of the best hopes remains ending the monopoly on islamic teachings held by dubious imams and teachers in courtyard mosques , and bringing muslim children back into the educational mainstream .
this week , the university of münster took a step in that direction when it announced the appointment of mohammed sven kalisch , a muslim theologian who converted to islam as a teen , to head the university 's new department dedicated to educating future generations of islamic teachers .
the department , the first of its kind in germany , is designed to bridge the mistrust between german educational authorities and the country 's myriad muslim organizations .
kalisch , a favorite of both german educators and muslim leaders , said he is fully aware of the way fundamentalist imams use the koran to send the wrong message .
" by educating islamic teachers we , of course , hope to work against extremist tendencies , " kalisch said . problems begin after school school authorities in berlin , bremen , bavaria and north rhine- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish students taking islam religion classes at a school in bremen westphalia have already added islam religion classes as an option to similar course offerings in judaism and catholicism .
lower saxony recently announced similar plans to test out islam religion courses . the classes , taught by teachers who are practicing muslims , offer germany 's estimated 800,000 muslim students the possibility of learning about their religion in a way that officials can keep tabs on . " it 's like our classes on catholicism and protestantism , " said spokeswoman nina schmidt .
" by doing it in our school we can make sure that it 's taught from an academic point of view , that no fundamentalist teachings slip in . " the problems begin after school is over for the day , when many parents send their children to private koran lessons . it is at these schools that the seeds of fundamentalism are planted , say law enforcement officials .
raids by police across germany routinely turn up the type of videos and literature found at the frankfurt school . jihadis " rely more on indirect communication nowadays , like videos and tapes , " said kai hirschmann , co-director of the essen-based institute for terrorism research and policy .
" that communication often takes place through the koran schools . " holy war at the school 's friday prayers but not only there .
school officials in north-rhine westphalia were appalled at the material found in textbooks seized at the king fahd academy in bonn .
the academy , funded by the saudi arabian government , caters to the sons and daughters of diplomats , arabic families who stay in germany for long periods as well as children with german citizenship or permanent resident status . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the king fahd academy in bad godesberg more than 300 textbooks were confiscated as part of a police investigation into the school 's fundamentalist tendencies in october 2003 .
the academy -lrb- photo -rrb- , which opened in the quiet bonn neighborhood of bad godesberg in 1995 , had already suspended one teacher after he had allegedly called for holy war against the west in friday prayers . bonn school officials reviewing the teaching material found in a study that students were taught that " the muslim people 's existence has been threatened by jews and christians since the crusades and it is the first duty of every muslim to prepare to fight against these enemies . " though powerless to close the school , school officials were able to force at least 53 children with german citizenship or permanent residency status to leave the academy based on what they study . the cooperation between law enforcement and school authorities is by no means typical , but can sometimes be useful .
still , investigators say that the best methods are not frequent raids but education . " one of the best tools , " said irrgang , " remains enlightenment .

more freeways are needed , but their construction remains controversial and expensive . the completion of the a17 autobahn , the freeway which will eventually run from the city of dresden to the czech border , will mean very different things depending on who you talk to . to its proponents , it will close a gaping hole in europe 's freeway system and encourage economic growth by keeping pace with the continent 's fast-growing international road transport needs .
to its detractors , it will dirty the air in dresden , threaten sensitive natural habitats and increase traffic in the region .
in short , it will represent a wrong approach to transport planning . all can agree on one thing though , it will have been an expensive and protracted project - in the works since 1991 , in the end the 44.6 kilometer -lrb- 27.7 mile -rrb- stretch to the czech republic , estimated to be completed in 2006 and to carry up to 72,000 vehicles per day , will have cost at least € 650 million -lrb- $ 790 million -rrb- to build . the rocky history of this costly road highlights a common problem regarding transport in germany today : how to balance the growing needs of highway transportation and economic growth with protection for the environment and the people who live near autobahn routes . armin reck , press spokesman for the saxony highway department , has been involved with the a17 since its early days .
he was brought in to sell the idea to the public , since the project was almost shelved due to vocal opposition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opponents say the stretch runs through sensitive habitats groups ranging from traditional environmental activists to farmers to the clergy - " pastors against the a17 " - hit the streets in protest , camped out in trees slated for felling , and went to court to stop the freeway . " it was astounding what kind of groups came out against this freeway , " reck told dw-world as he drove along the nine-kilometer stretch of almost-completed tunnels and bridges that has turned into once of the most expensive sections of an already costly project . eu 's transport backbone despite the sky-high sums involved , economists and business leaders agree that there is a critical need to improve and expand germany 's aging network of freeways .
given germany 's new central position within the eu , after the may 1 expansion added ten new members mostly in eastern europe , the freeway system is now the backbone of international road shipping in europe .
whether goods are going from poland to spain or sweden to greece , if they are going by road , it is likely they will pass through germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : truck traffic is estimated to increase dramatically .
as trade increases between new and old members of the eu , traffic is likely to increase .
conservative estimates say by 2010 , the number of trucks travelling on german freeways will double ; other forecasts say the number will quadruple .
if germany 's already overburdened system is not beefed up , many fear , goods could be delayed crossing the continent and economic development could suffer . " traffic and economic growth are related closely to one another , " ralf stock , head of the department of traffic engineering , told dw-world .
" it 's a fact that during the past 30 years , the development of the gross domestic product and the passenger and freight transport service has been very similar . " while other eu countries have on average increased their highway networks by 70 percent since 1991 , germany has only added 10 percent to its own system .
highway planners now work into their calculations the consequences of protests and lawsuits from various interest groups , which have become almost as inevitable as death and taxes . difficult birth plans for an autobahn between dresden and the czech border are not new .
the nazis drew up plans for a highway in 1938 , but they were scrapped during the war .
the east germans considered building as well , but their government collapsed before they could start digging .
after reunification in 1990 , the project got new priority status and in 1991 planning began - shortly thereafter , so did the protests . the issue became so contentious that the highway department , for the first time , put the matter to the public in a 1995 referendum , and won .
but , to get public approval , the department decided to accommodate many of the concerns of freeway opponents . engineers sank most of the autobahn up to twelve meters below the surface , to provide noise protection and give a psychological boost to surrounding residents .
" if they ca n't actually see the freeway , they 're less likely to complain about it , " the highway department 's reck said . spanning the road will be two so-called " green bridges , " which were demanded by environmentalists who wanted animals to be able cross the highway safely and by local residents who insisted that a wooded area near the ruins of a manor torn down by the nazis be preserved .
the two bridges cost around € 8 million to build . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other environmental protection measures include noise protection panels that line much of the freeway and tunnels and guidance systems that allow protected species of frogs to cross the road .
local bats get their own tunnel with ultrasonic technology to guide them through . " on average , every third euro for street or highway construction is spent on environmental protection , " said reck . quality of life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the costs , even those who want to see more kilometers of autobahn and more lanes to already existing ones are wary of jettisoning germany 's strict environmental laws in favor of unfettered highway construction .
they say they are necessary to maintain the quality of life in this densely populated country , whose road network is already one of the most extensive in europe . but if some costs could come down , experts say , construction could be moved along , and autobahn supply might keep up with future trucking demands . " financing is often a problem because of the large expenses involved , " kay lindemann , head of the traffic policy department at the federation of german endustry , told dw-world .
" environmental protection measures often drive those costs up . " armin reck , however , is fairly good natured about the costs as well as the drawn-out and often controversial planning and construction process .
" we have to respect people 's interests , they have to live near the autobahn after all , " he said . " besides , planning started in 1991 and we 're going to open one part in october 2004 .

but new efforts are being made to strenghten the bloc 's cultural diversity . when spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero took office earlier this year , he decided to take a new linguistic approach than his predecessor .
within just a matter of weeks he had called on his counterparts in the european union to grant spain 's regional languages official recognition in the future european constitution . if the eu agrees to madrid 's request , catalan , basque and galician will be awarded ' treaty status ' .
" it would allow people to communicate in their language , or to obtain documents in that language , " james fife of eurolang , the newsagency attached to the european buro for lesser used languages , told dw-world .
and given that there are more speakers of catalan than of either slovenian or maltese - which has not yet become an eu working language - it does n't seem an altogether unfair request . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish prime minister , jose luis rodriguez zapatero however , spain 's conservative opposition slammed zapatero 's demand for recognition , saying it was nothing more than a stunt aimed at sweetening his nationalist coalition partners .
but whatever the motives , fife welcomes spain 's nurturing approach , and would like to see other european states take their cue from madrid 's lead . " even if spain were successful in achieving treaty status , it is hard to see how there would be a snowball effect .
not all states are minority language-friendly , " fife said .
for many regional languages , simply gaining recognition on home ground is a steep enough mountain to climb .
" it 's often all that national minorities can do to maintain themselves , in many cases they are losing their fight to stay alive , " he concluded . eastern europe provides new impetus interestingly enough , the new eu member states have dusted off the issue of minority european languages , and put it squarely back on the table .
while western european governments have traditionally tended to close their ears to regional tongues , the approach in the east is quite different .
many of the ten new countries were forced into a life of russian , and are only too glad to have the chance to promote their own linguistic heritages . although the eu is home to more than 40 minority languages - with tens of million speakers - the only one on the whole continent actually entitled to the status of official working language , is gaelic , and that is only the case because gaelic is an official language of the republic of ireland .
but would other countries want the same treatment for their pockets of linguistic diversity ?
according to fife , it varies from place to place .
he cites hungary as great believer in the promotion of its 15 sub-languages , and france as country which is doggedly determined not to acknowledge it linguistic treasure chest . fife said germany , with its slavic sorbian minority , is somewhere in the middle .
" germany does n't have quite the same negative attitude to minority languages .
it provides some support and recognition , more than the french , " he said . keeping sorbian alive but the official association of sorbs feels that germany 's federal government could do more to integrate sorbian into the regional and national consciousness .
although the government currently stumps up an annual budget for the promotion of sorbian culture , it has already threatened to cut its contributions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sorbian girls in traditional dress. dressed in their traditional with a total of 60,000 speakers of upper sorbian and lower sorbian in the states of saxony and brandenburg , local residents can theoretically go from one day to the next without speaking any german .
theoretical , however , is the operative word .
" many people ca n't speak sorbian , but those who work for the local authorities , and the police etc , should be bi-lingual .
if sorbs saw that they could use their language freely , they would do so , " bernhard zies , managing director of the association for lausitzer sorbs told dw-world . it 's an ideal which remains far from reality .
even measures to revitalize the language , such as the introduction of bi-lingual kindergartens and schooling , are unlikely to make it as important to germany as catalan appears to be to spain . " we will never reach the stage where people who live in sorbian areas have to be able to speak both languages , because we do not have territorial autonomy , " zies added .
that is a view shared by james fife , who believes devolution from central powers is a pre-requisite to the successful preservation of minority languages . tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de how do you say accession in maltese ?

the news follows efforts by officials in the state of north-rhine westphalia to shut down a private saudi-financed school after fundamentalist leanings were detected in the textbooks . " the state has absolutely no authority in these schools , they can do what they want and that is very troubling , " lutz irrgang , who heads the hesse state office for the protection of the constitution , told dw-world . educating the next generation of islam teachers officials know that raids alone ca n't root out radicalism in pockets of germany 's 3.2 million-strong muslim community .
one of the best hopes remains ending the monopoly on islamic teachings held by dubious imams and teachers in courtyard mosques , and bringing muslim children back into the educational mainstream .
this week , the university of münster took a step in that direction when it announced the appointment of mohammed sven kalisch , a muslim theologian who converted to islam as a teen , to head the university 's new department dedicated to educating future generations of islamic teachers .
the department , the first of its kind in germany , is designed to bridge the mistrust between german educational authorities and the country 's myriad muslim organizations .

" the problems begin after school is over for the day , when many parents send their children to private koran lessons . it is at these schools that the seeds of fundamentalism are planted , say law enforcement officials .

" that communication often takes place through the koran schools . " holy war at the school 's friday prayers but not only there .
school officials in north-rhine westphalia were appalled at the material found in textbooks seized at the king fahd academy in bonn .

the news follows efforts by officials in the state of north-rhine westphalia to shut down a private saudi-financed school after fundamentalist leanings were detected in the textbooks . " the state has absolutely no authority in these schools , they can do what they want and that is very troubling , " lutz irrgang , who heads the hesse state office for the protection of the constitution , told dw-world . educating the next generation of islam teachers officials know that raids alone ca n't root out radicalism in pockets of germany 's 3.2 million-strong muslim community .
one of the best hopes remains ending the monopoly on islamic teachings held by dubious imams and teachers in courtyard mosques , and bringing muslim children back into the educational mainstream .
this week , the university of münster took a step in that direction when it announced the appointment of mohammed sven kalisch , a muslim theologian who converted to islam as a teen , to head the university 's new department dedicated to educating future generations of islamic teachers .
the department , the first of its kind in germany , is designed to bridge the mistrust between german educational authorities and the country 's myriad muslim organizations .
kalisch , a favorite of both german educators and muslim leaders , said he is fully aware of the way fundamentalist imams use the koran to send the wrong message .
" by educating islamic teachers we , of course , hope to work against extremist tendencies , " kalisch said . problems begin after school school authorities in berlin , bremen , bavaria and north rhine- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish students taking islam religion classes at a school in bremen westphalia have already added islam religion classes as an option to similar course offerings in judaism and catholicism .
lower saxony recently announced similar plans to test out islam religion courses . the classes , taught by teachers who are practicing muslims , offer germany 's estimated 800,000 muslim students the possibility of learning about their religion in a way that officials can keep tabs on . " it 's like our classes on catholicism and protestantism , " said spokeswoman nina schmidt .
" by doing it in our school we can make sure that it 's taught from an academic point of view , that no fundamentalist teachings slip in . " the problems begin after school is over for the day , when many parents send their children to private koran lessons . it is at these schools that the seeds of fundamentalism are planted , say law enforcement officials .
raids by police across germany routinely turn up the type of videos and literature found at the frankfurt school . jihadis " rely more on indirect communication nowadays , like videos and tapes , " said kai hirschmann , co-director of the essen-based institute for terrorism research and policy .
" that communication often takes place through the koran schools . " holy war at the school 's friday prayers but not only there .
school officials in north-rhine westphalia were appalled at the material found in textbooks seized at the king fahd academy in bonn .
the academy , funded by the saudi arabian government , caters to the sons and daughters of diplomats , arabic families who stay in germany for long periods as well as children with german citizenship or permanent resident status . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the king fahd academy in bad godesberg more than 300 textbooks were confiscated as part of a police investigation into the school 's fundamentalist tendencies in october 2003 .
the academy -lrb- photo -rrb- , which opened in the quiet bonn neighborhood of bad godesberg in 1995 , had already suspended one teacher after he had allegedly called for holy war against the west in friday prayers . bonn school officials reviewing the teaching material found in a study that students were taught that " the muslim people 's existence has been threatened by jews and christians since the crusades and it is the first duty of every muslim to prepare to fight against these enemies . " though powerless to close the school , school officials were able to force at least 53 children with german citizenship or permanent residency status to leave the academy based on what they study . the cooperation between law enforcement and school authorities is by no means typical , but can sometimes be useful .
still , investigators say that the best methods are not frequent raids but education . " one of the best tools , " said irrgang , " remains enlightenment .

critics said the law infringed on states ' rights . the ruling does away with so-called " junior professorships " the federal government introduced to replace a germany 's unique system of habilitation , which requires post-doctoral researchers to work with tenured professors for several years and complete another thesis before they can become professors themselves . saying that the old german system prevented people from competing on an international level , the social democratic-greens government decided to allow scholars to become professors immediately . according to the new law , they were able to hold the position for up to six years before having to move on to a regular professorship .
the new system was expected to replace the old in 2010 . some states resist federal involvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : currently , most german professors are at least 42 years old several state governments - bavaria , saxony and thuringia - had criticized the change for a number of reasons : they complained that the federal government had infringed on state rights to determine educational policies themselves - an argument five of eight judges at germany 's constitutional court agreed with in ruling against the law . government officials were quick to point out that the judges had only ruled against the federal law without calling into question the concept of junior professorships itself .
german education minister edelgard bulmahn said she expected state governments to act now and implement the change . berlin vows to stick to program several states have already done so .
berlin state government officials on tuesday said they would stick to junior professorships and lobby for the program with other states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edelgard bulmahn inside germany 's constitutional court on tuesday bulmahn -lrb- photo -rrb- added that the federal government 's jurisdiction over universities had to be expanded for german academic institutions to stay competitive internationally .
she said a committee currently working on reforming germany 's federal system should address that issue as well . supporters of the junior professorships also said the ruling would hold them back as compared to academics in other countries that do n't have to spend valuable years as assistants to another professor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's humboldt university " this way we 're never going to get competitive internationally , " claudia kemfert , an economic scientist at berlin 's humboldt university , told der spiegel newsmagazine .
the 35-year-old recently became germany 's first junior professor to move on to a regular professorship . a lack of funding ? but critics also lamented a lack of adequate funding for the positions .
universities had received about € 180 million -lrb- $ 219 million -rrb- for up to 3,000 junior professors .
so far , only 933 positions exist . " that 's definitely too little money , " katharina reiche , an education policy expert for the opposition christian democrats in the german parliament , told berliner zeitung . while saying that junior professorships were not necessarily a bad thing , reiche added that her party planned to undo the abolishment of the habilitation , which should remain as an alternative option . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students in frankfurt protesting against proposed university fees constitutional court judges are also expected to rule on a prohibition of university fees later this year after several states who would like to charge students had complained about the law . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : antarctic summit gets underway in bremen germany will pay € 26 million for the construction of the new neumayer iii polar station in the antarctic , government officials announce at the start of an international conference in bremen .

jersey could have its first non-smoking pub by next spring .
the ann street brewery says it is seriously considering making its new development at the cock and bottle in st helier a smoke-free zone .
the news comes as more uk pubs are banning smoking .
over 250 pubs owned by greene king have taken a similar step .
now the ann street group , which is owned by channel island traders , has looked at the chain of pubs it has in jersey .
chief executive paul smith said they all comply with guidelines on air conditioning and making people aware of non-smoking areas .
but he says the new development at the cock and bottle could become the first full-time non-smoking pub in the island .
he says it would not be fair to impose a ban on an existing pub , but could be acceptable at a new development .
last year the states approved plans in principle for smoking to be banned in restaurants and cafes , but rejected proposals to include pubs and nightclubs in the ban .

bbc news online talks to one woman who has suffered from pelvic inflammatory disease - a potential complication of chlamydia - for 20 years .
heidi - not her real name - was diagnosed with pelvic inflammatory disease in 1983 when she was in her late 20s .
she said : " before that , i 'd endured around 18 months of pain .
i was going to the toilet far more often than normal , i had an ache in my stomach , and backache - and i had a discharge .
" this all meant i was n't sleeping , and i was tired all the time . "
" i was being sent between urologists , bowel specialists and gynaecologists who were trying to diagnose me . "
she added : " i was in agony , i was on and off work , and i was exhausted . "
' i was left with this ' frustrated , heidi went to her gp and asked to be referred to a private gynaecologist - who was the doctor who finally diagnosed her .
go and be checked out , so you 're not left thinking ' if only ' heidi she believes her pelvic inflammatory disease -lrb- pid -rrb- was caused by her first husband infecting her with chlamydia after he had been unfaithful .
pid can lead to infertility , but doctors were able to operate on heidi and separate her ovaries from the adhesions that had grown on them .
heidi , who already had two children from her first marriage went on to have another child with her second husband .
she says : " it would have been devastating to have been told i was infertile at that stage . "
" i was lucky in that i went on to have my daughter .
that was fantastic . "
but she added : " i was left with this .
i ca n't carry shopping , i still have to take painkillers every day .
and if i 'm having a flare-up , i ca n't have sex .
it would be too painful .
" if it 's bad , i just have to go to bed with a hot water bottle and rest . "
her pid also led to heidi being medically retired from her job , because she had had so much time off work .
she added : " if women have any symptoms , they have to be checked out even though chlamydia can be a silent disease , and symptoms can be very obscure .
" there are antibiotics which can treat chlamydia , but there are none for pid . "
she advised : " go and be checked out , so you 're not left thinking ' if only ' . "

bbc news online talks to one woman who has suffered from pelvic inflammatory disease - a potential complication of chlamydia - for 20 years .
heidi - not her real name - was diagnosed with pelvic inflammatory disease in 1983 when she was in her late 20s .
she said : " before that , i 'd endured around 18 months of pain .
i was going to the toilet far more often than normal , i had an ache in my stomach , and backache - and i had a discharge .
" this all meant i was n't sleeping , and i was tired all the time . "
" i was being sent between urologists , bowel specialists and gynaecologists who were trying to diagnose me . "

heidi , who already had two children from her first marriage went on to have another child with her second husband .

bbc news online talks to doctors in genitourinary clinics about their battle to cope with the increasing number of patients .
" we 'd always had a walk-in service , but about two to three years ago , we had to start turning people away , " says dr phillip hay , head of the courtyard gum clinic at st george 's hospital in london .
" it went completely against the grain , but we just did n't have the capacity to cope with demand .
" since then , in line with other clinics , we have modified our practices so we can see more people .
but we 're faced with seeing 15 to 20 % more people more each year . "
the clinic now sees over 40,000 people a year .
it has just four full-time consultants at st george 's , and another four at other hospitals who see patients .
we 're dealing with acute infections , so it is n't logical for people to have to wait for that length of time dr jan clarke , consultant leeds teaching hospital dr hay added : " we saw a big increase in the number of diagnoses of significant clamydia and gonorrhoea a couple of years ago .
but at the moment , it 's slightly lower than that .
" that might be because things have calmed down a little bit - or maybe those most at risk have stopped coming to see us . "
dr hay said patients at the clinic are given advice about how to prevent themselves being infected again in the future - but it usually took a few visits before the message got through .
he said the key to reducing the numbers who need treatment at a gum clinic is to educate people of the risk of stis before they become infected .
" it 's a question of getting the public health message across .
" here , we 're dealing with problems after they have happened .
we 're not getting people to think about the behaviour that 's led to them getting an sti .
" there has to be a public health message before people come to us . "
spreading infection dr eric monteiro , head of the gum clinic at leeds teaching hospital , said the rise in sexually transmitted infections was " quite clearly " due to changes in the sexual behaviour in the population .
he added : " the rate of partner change is greater ; more people have sex at an earlier age .
people having unprotected sex is also an issue .
" it may also be that the aids epidemic warnings of the 1980s had some effect , and its worn off , although that is just conjecture . "
the clinic has recently changed the way it books appointments to try and reduce its average of five hour waits .
it is now introducing a system where patients have to phone in 48 hours ahead to secure an appointment .
specialists there said they hoped the new system would enable them to reduce the amount of time people had to wait for appointments .
dr jan clarke , a consultant in genitourinary medicine at the clinic , told bbc news online : " we 're dealing with acute infections , so it is n't logical for people to have to wait for that length of time . "
she said it was crucial to make it as easy as possible for people - especially young people - to access services .
dr clarke said she hoped recent reports would raise awareness of the need to look after sexual health .
but if people could n't access services , then it made it difficult to help them .
she added : " if people are infected , they have n't been able to get treatment and they have n't got a steady partner , they could be passing the infection on to others before they are seen . "

bbc news online talks to doctors in genitourinary clinics about their battle to cope with the increasing number of patients .
" we 'd always had a walk-in service , but about two to three years ago , we had to start turning people away , " says dr phillip hay , head of the courtyard gum clinic at st george 's hospital in london .
" it went completely against the grain , but we just did n't have the capacity to cope with demand .
" since then , in line with other clinics , we have modified our practices so we can see more people .
but we 're faced with seeing 15 to 20 % more people more each year . "
the clinic now sees over 40,000 people a year .
it has just four full-time consultants at st george 's , and another four at other hospitals who see patients .
we 're dealing with acute infections , so it is n't logical for people to have to wait for that length of time dr jan clarke , consultant leeds teaching hospital dr hay added : " we saw a big increase in the number of diagnoses of significant clamydia and gonorrhoea a couple of years ago .
but at the moment , it 's slightly lower than that .
" that might be because things have calmed down a little bit - or maybe those most at risk have stopped coming to see us . "
dr hay said patients at the clinic are given advice about how to prevent themselves being infected again in the future - but it usually took a few visits before the message got through .
he said the key to reducing the numbers who need treatment at a gum clinic is to educate people of the risk of stis before they become infected .
" it 's a question of getting the public health message across .
" here , we 're dealing with problems after they have happened .
we 're not getting people to think about the behaviour that 's led to them getting an sti .
" there has to be a public health message before people come to us . "
spreading infection dr eric monteiro , head of the gum clinic at leeds teaching hospital , said the rise in sexually transmitted infections was " quite clearly " due to changes in the sexual behaviour in the population .
he added : " the rate of partner change is greater ; more people have sex at an earlier age .
people having unprotected sex is also an issue .
" it may also be that the aids epidemic warnings of the 1980s had some effect , and its worn off , although that is just conjecture . "
the clinic has recently changed the way it books appointments to try and reduce its average of five hour waits .
it is now introducing a system where patients have to phone in 48 hours ahead to secure an appointment .
specialists there said they hoped the new system would enable them to reduce the amount of time people had to wait for appointments .
dr jan clarke , a consultant in genitourinary medicine at the clinic , told bbc news online : " we 're dealing with acute infections , so it is n't logical for people to have to wait for that length of time . "
she said it was crucial to make it as easy as possible for people - especially young people - to access services .
dr clarke said she hoped recent reports would raise awareness of the need to look after sexual health .
but if people could n't access services , then it made it difficult to help them .
she added : " if people are infected , they have n't been able to get treatment and they have n't got a steady partner , they could be passing the infection on to others before they are seen . "

russia 's business oligarchs - greek for the few who rule - have enriched themselves over the past 15 years beyond most people 's wildest dreams .
they count their fortunes in billions of dollars .
but even more spectacular than their rapid rise is the way some rags-to-riches adventures have ended in tears .
the careers of two of russia 's most successful oligarchs , mikhael khodorkovsky and platon lebedev , are now under the microscope in a moscow court where they face charges of fraud , forgery and tax evasion .
the story about the risks they - and other oligarchs - ran and the deals they made says much about russia 's recent history .
perestroika the first fortunes made in the new russia resulted from wheeling and dealing .
while the majority of russians queued for bread , a group of young entrepreneurs experimented with business .
thousands of banks and insurance companies sprang up overnight in the early 1990s .
for instance , a high powered mathematician and future oligarch , boris berezovsky , turned his hand to car dealing .
many businessmen dropped off along the way and failed to make vast fortunes , yet their early forays into the world of capitalism followed similar paths to those taken by mr khodorkovsky and mr lebedev .
these were risky paths .
after 70 years of communism , many russians regarded even honest businessmen as thieves .
an early victim of his own success was computer importer artyom tarasov , a communist who loyally dedicated 3 % of his salary to the party .
but that was not enough to prevent his vast fame and fortune from annoying the authorities .
when it became clear that he earned a million dollars in 1989 he was immediately put on trial for " economic crimes " .
he was found to be innocent , but his business was ruined .
mr khodorkovsky was in the same game , importing computers , though he did it under the auspices of the komsomol , the young communist league where he was a leader .
mr khodorkovsky kept a low profile and escaped the fate of mr tarasov , though some believe the start of his troubles came several years later , in 2001 , when he became the first oligarch to declare his fortune publicly .
banking in the early 1990s , the best way to make money was to work with money .
thousands of banks and insurance companies sprang up overnight .
mr khodorkovsky used cash from his computer importing business to found menatep bank .
the banks that prospered had licences to work in hard currency .
businesses needed dollars to import goods and banks charged high rates of interest for hard currency .
khodorkovsky 's associate platon lebedev set up a labyrinth of offshore banking affiliates .
this lead to suspicion that menatep was involved in money laundering .
it bothered the cia , but it has not appeared on the charge sheet against the two men .
democracy offshore banking was barred to all but the select few , but mr khodorkovsky cultivated the right contacts to get approvals for his schemes .
in sharp contrast to many of his rivals , he had a modest and deferential manner which put those in authority at their ease .
mr khodorkovsky backed the right horse during the coup attempt in 1991 .
like most of the new businessmen , he saw the link between democratic reforms and the free market .
he sided with reformist communists like boris yeltsin , president of russia which was then still part of the ussr .
mr khodorkovsky 's links with the politicians were further strengthened by his presence in the parliament building during the 1991 military coup by hard line communists .
having stood shoulder to shoulder with the ' democrats ' in their hour of need , he was perfectly placed when they prevailed .
soon thereafter , mr khodorkovsky briefly served as deputy fuel and oil minister .
later on , the oligarch boris berezovsky would become a member of president yeltsin 's inner circle by masterminding his re-election in 1996 .
but mr khodorkovsky was the first businessman to get close to the heart of power .
privatisation but political contacts offered no guarantee for a businessman 's life .
oligarch boris berezovsky was a member of president yeltsin 's inner circle .
throughout the 1990s , many bankers met early deaths at the hands of hired assassins .
menatep 's legal adviser was one of the first to be killed .
undeterred , mr khodorkovsky and his partners pressed on the path to riches .
among the many businesses menatep bought from the state in 1994 was a bankrupt fertiliser factory called apatit .
menatep won the tender by promising an unfeasibly large investment into the business .
after it gained control it quickly forgot this obligation .
the dispute with russia 's privatisation board about the failure to invest in apatit rumbled on for years and was eventually settled by an arbitration court .
but the fertiliser deal would come back to haunt messrs khodorkovsky and lebedev .
one of the charges of fraud that has been laid against them is related to the deal .
crown jewels relatively small deals like the acquisition of apatit helped make the russian businessmen wealthy , but it was only in 1995 , when russia 's broke government started to auction off the crown jewels of the economy , that the winners were sorted from the also-rans .
offshore banking was barred to all but the select few .
minerals and oil assets were sold off en masse as the government tried to fight the threat from resurgent communists and finalise russian capitalism .
russia 's most valuable assets were sold at bargain prices to insiders such as mr khodorkovsky .
other assets were squeezed out by a process which many said was rigged .
the banker vladimir potanin got the most valuable prize of all - the norilsk nickel , one of the world 's richest suppliers of raw materials .
menatep bought russia 's second largest oil company , yukos , for $ 300m .
it also took on $ 2bn in debts , which made the price more realistic .
by the end of 2003 it was worth $ 27bn , but only after the management had vastly increased production .
the wild frontiers of finance the auctions of 1995 are the most controversial episode in the history of the oligarchs , but no charges have arisen from them .
yukos is in danger of collapsing under the weight of a massive tax claim .
moreover , any gains were almost wiped out three years later when the russian economy all but collapsed .
the failure of the economy was the result of wild speculation and financial schemes that were too good to be true .
the most egocentric financier of the age , sergei mavrodi , issued bank notes bearing his own face as part of a giant pyramid scheme .
the public saw this as a chance to join in the capitalist race for riches , but the scheme collapsed taking the savings of the gullible with it .
the more sophisticated were investing in government bonds , called gkos .
fantastic profits were made in this market , but it turned out to be as big a pyramid as mr mavrodi 's .
when the government defaulted in august 1998 , the banks followed hard on its heels .
the bankers who survived the crisis were those , like mr potanin and mr khodorkovsky , who had other non-financial assets such as minerals .
taxes mr khodorkovsky proved himself to be a better owner of yukos than many had expected .
the business grew and paid $ 1.9bn in taxes in 2000 .
but the authorities say this was not enough .
yukos is currently in danger of being torn apart by bailiffs who have said they might sell off its main operating arm to settle a $ 3.4bn bill for back taxes .
under russian law , directors face charges , while shareholders foot the bill for corporate misdemeanours .
so as a former chief , mr khodorkovsky is charged with both corporate and personal tax evasion .
at stake is yukos 's decision to arrange its affairs to benefit from low local tax rates introduced as part of the government 's efforts to bring developments to the regions .
but yukos was not the boldest in this regard .
the owner of chelsea football club , roman abramovich , was elected as governor of the remote region of chukotia .
he moved the legal address of his oil companies to chukotia and awarded them tax breaks .
the charges the charges of fraud which mr khodorkovsky and mr lebedev face go back to the early to the very early days of privatisation which now seem like distant history .
the charges of tax evasion are more recent , but yukos 's accounts had been signed off by government tax inspectors .
the most controversial episode of all , the 1995 auction of yukos , has been left off the charge sheet .
to include it would be seen as an attack on all the oligarchs who won the auctions for russia 's mineral wealth .
nor has there been any mention of menatep 's offshore network which might have concealed many ill-gotten gains of its clients .
the events which have been left off the charge sheet speak volumes about the current situation russia .
there are some stones which the authorities still think are best left unturned .

mr khodorkovsky 's links with the politicians were further strengthened by his presence in the parliament building during the 1991 military coup by hard line communists .
having stood shoulder to shoulder with the ' democrats ' in their hour of need , he was perfectly placed when they prevailed .
soon thereafter , mr khodorkovsky briefly served as deputy fuel and oil minister .

oligarch boris berezovsky was a member of president yeltsin 's inner circle .
throughout the 1990s , many bankers met early deaths at the hands of hired assassins .
menatep 's legal adviser was one of the first to be killed .
undeterred , mr khodorkovsky and his partners pressed on the path to riches .
among the many businesses menatep bought from the state in 1994 was a bankrupt fertiliser factory called apatit .
menatep won the tender by promising an unfeasibly large investment into the business .
after it gained control it quickly forgot this obligation .
the dispute with russia 's privatisation board about the failure to invest in apatit rumbled on for years and was eventually settled by an arbitration court .

one of the charges of fraud that has been laid against them is related to the deal .

russia 's business oligarchs - greek for the few who rule - have enriched themselves over the past 15 years beyond most people 's wildest dreams .
they count their fortunes in billions of dollars .
but even more spectacular than their rapid rise is the way some rags-to-riches adventures have ended in tears .
the careers of two of russia 's most successful oligarchs , mikhael khodorkovsky and platon lebedev , are now under the microscope in a moscow court where they face charges of fraud , forgery and tax evasion .
the story about the risks they - and other oligarchs - ran and the deals they made says much about russia 's recent history .
perestroika the first fortunes made in the new russia resulted from wheeling and dealing .
while the majority of russians queued for bread , a group of young entrepreneurs experimented with business .
thousands of banks and insurance companies sprang up overnight in the early 1990s .
for instance , a high powered mathematician and future oligarch , boris berezovsky , turned his hand to car dealing .
many businessmen dropped off along the way and failed to make vast fortunes , yet their early forays into the world of capitalism followed similar paths to those taken by mr khodorkovsky and mr lebedev .
these were risky paths .
after 70 years of communism , many russians regarded even honest businessmen as thieves .
an early victim of his own success was computer importer artyom tarasov , a communist who loyally dedicated 3 % of his salary to the party .
but that was not enough to prevent his vast fame and fortune from annoying the authorities .
when it became clear that he earned a million dollars in 1989 he was immediately put on trial for " economic crimes " .
he was found to be innocent , but his business was ruined .
mr khodorkovsky was in the same game , importing computers , though he did it under the auspices of the komsomol , the young communist league where he was a leader .
mr khodorkovsky kept a low profile and escaped the fate of mr tarasov , though some believe the start of his troubles came several years later , in 2001 , when he became the first oligarch to declare his fortune publicly .
banking in the early 1990s , the best way to make money was to work with money .
thousands of banks and insurance companies sprang up overnight .
mr khodorkovsky used cash from his computer importing business to found menatep bank .
the banks that prospered had licences to work in hard currency .
businesses needed dollars to import goods and banks charged high rates of interest for hard currency .
khodorkovsky 's associate platon lebedev set up a labyrinth of offshore banking affiliates .
this lead to suspicion that menatep was involved in money laundering .
it bothered the cia , but it has not appeared on the charge sheet against the two men .
democracy offshore banking was barred to all but the select few , but mr khodorkovsky cultivated the right contacts to get approvals for his schemes .
in sharp contrast to many of his rivals , he had a modest and deferential manner which put those in authority at their ease .
mr khodorkovsky backed the right horse during the coup attempt in 1991 .
like most of the new businessmen , he saw the link between democratic reforms and the free market .
he sided with reformist communists like boris yeltsin , president of russia which was then still part of the ussr .
mr khodorkovsky 's links with the politicians were further strengthened by his presence in the parliament building during the 1991 military coup by hard line communists .
