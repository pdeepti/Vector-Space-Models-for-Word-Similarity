the announcement coincided with a renewed international debate to reform the un 's enforcement arm in maintaining international peace and security . with the security council 's five permanent veto-wielding members - france , england , america , china and russia - still representing the world of 1945 , there is broad agreement that an overhaul is overdue . while a revamp is being hotly debated within the un , germany is already drumming up support for its bid for a permanent seat .
with a two-thirds majority of the 191-member un general assembly required to pass any kind of reform resolution , germany is not just lobbying the global heavyweights but even smaller countries . " working towards the same goal " the most recent campaign offensive involves a ten-day tour of south asia by german foreign minister joschka fischer .
stops include india , china , pakistan , bangladesh and sri lanka . fischer became the first european leader to visit the newly-elected congress government and the new indian prime minister manmohan singh on wednesday .
the two sides confirmed they would support each other in their attempts to get permanent un security council seats . in the run-up to the meeting , experts agreed the german bid would find acceptance in india .
not least because new delhi has made no secret of its own ambition to seek a spot in the powerful club . a further reason , said some , are the smooth ties the two countries enjoy . " there 's nothing negative in their relationship , no conflict of interest , so the two could really work together towards the same goal , " anuradha chenoy , international relations expert at new delhi 's jawaharlal nehru university told dw-world . indeed , the indo-german relationship , traditionally close , has grown stronger since german reunification and india 's economic reform process in the 1990s .
trade and investment have picked up in recent years along with deepening cooperation in the fields of science and technology . last year , former german president johannes rau endorsed a permanent indian seat on the security council during a visit to india . a common stance on iraq bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shakti 3 , one of four nuclear test sites in the thar desert .
india conducted five nculear tests in may 1998 .
though india 's nuclear tests in 1998 -lrb- photo -rrb- , tensions with pakistan following the attack on the indian parliament in 2001 and , most recently , a flare-up of religious violence in the western state of gujarat in 2002 have cast a shadow on bilateral relations , experts said there has n't been any lasting damage . they instead pointed out that the two countries ' similar position on recent world events is an indication that the two could complement each other in their bid for permanent security council seats . " after the sept .
11 attacks , there was a shift in the foreign policies of many countries .
both india and germany refused to go along with the us , reflecting a common thinking , " said chenoy , adding that the recent change in the indian government would also boost chances of the two working in tandem .
" the hindu nationalists in the last government pursued a more militaristic , chauvinist foreign policy .
the congress is more moderate . " subrata mitra , head of the political science department at heidelberg 's south asia institute , stressed that india 's traditional role as leader of the non-aligned movement -lrb- an international organization of over 100 states which consider themselves not formally aligned with or against any major power bloc -rrb- would be strengthened if it got in with germany on the security council . " in its search for a new global role , india views germany , which has shown itself to be balanced and neutral , as an important western partner , " mitra said .
" a german-indian axis in the security council would provide an important and much-needed voice in a multi-polar world . " promising candidates while both nations have the backing of various countries for their bids , the position of the single-most powerful member of the security council - the us - is still unknown . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers in belet huen , somalia , on a united nations peacekeeping mission in 1993 .
still , analysts agreed that both countries stand a good chance of getting what they want .
germany is already the third-largest contributor to the un budget and the largest troop-contributor to peacekeeping missions from the balkans to the hindukush . though india has also been active in un peacekeeping missions , the reform debate focusing largely on the need for the security council to be more globally representative is expected to speak in its favor . " the outdated security council has to reflect the current world reality and include countries of the third world .
by that measure , india - the world 's largest democracy and second-most populous nation - is a leading candidate , " said un expert günther unser . what about pakistan ? some , however , warned that considering india to be a " natural choice " could prove dangerous for the stability of the south asian region - a further topic of discussion during fischer 's visit . hans maull , who holds the chair for foreign policy and international relations at the university of trier said pakistan , with whom india has thrice gone to war , was the key . " german foreign policy towards india should be positive , " he said .
" but its endorsement of the indian bid is not going to please pakistan .
if it 's angry that india gets in , it could endanger the security of the region , " maull said . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de summit endorses reforms to strengthen u.n. chancellor schröder on friday pushed for a permanent german seat on the u.n. security council at the eu-latin america summit , that urged the u.s. to drop its go-it-alone stance and stressed the need for u.n. reform .

the growing aid business in germany alone , there are thousands of aid organizations whose business it is to help the needy at home and abroad .
among them are state , half-state , religious and private organizations of all sizes .
in some cases , they 're run by a small staff of volunteers , in others by a huge apparatus with hundreds of permanent employees . a glance at the annual reports of some of these larger organizations gives an idea of the financial frameworks some aid organizations have at their disposal .

in recent years , many governments have chosen to outsource development aid .

their advertising campaigns have to be louder if they want to reach donor 's wallets .
attempts to make a name for themselves - particularly in the media - drive some organizations toward flashier pr activities , or worse , exploitation of the very people they 're meant to be helping . exploitation for a good cause children are ideal in this regard , as are old people and women - images presented without detailing the context of the problem , or the role the aid agencies have taken in these structures .
the problem of small arms and posed photos is a prime example , lock said . " we often hear the message that , in the development of violent societies in which small arms play a big role , woman and children are the central victims .
but when you analyze violence in the third world , you come to the conclusion that violent incidents are most frequently carried out by , and most frequently affect , young men , " lock told deutsche welle .

he is also widely believed to be involved in the party slush-fund scandal that tainted kohl and his conservative christian democratic union party .

following his arrest , new light could be cast on one of germany 's biggest political scandals . german prosecutors on wednesday called for the immediate extradition of holger pfahls , who is suspected of accepting a bribe while serving as deputy defense minister under former conservative chancellor helmut kohl .
the state prosecutor 's office in augsburg said it would likely file an extradition application with french authorities by the end of the week .
french police arrested pfahls on tuesday as he left a paris apartment .
for five years , he had been on germany 's " most wanted " list , suspected of taking nearly € 2 million -lrb- $ 2.4 million -rrb- in bribes for helping german industrial giant thyssen obtain a government arms contract for delivering fuchs tanks to saudi arabia .
he is also widely believed to be involved in the party slush-fund scandal that tainted kohl and his conservative christian democratic union party .
state investigators in the bavarian city of augsburg allege that senior officials in kohl 's government , if not the chancellor himself , authorized the negotiations between pfahls and thyssen which were orchestrated by german-canadian arms dealer karl-heinz schreiber .
tentacles that touched crime after crime bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludwig-holger pfahls in addition to the tank bribes and slush fund scandal , pfahls -lrb- photo -rrb- is also under investigation by french authorities for his suspected involvement in the leuna refinery scandal .
the french federal prosecutor 's office said it suspects pfahls accepted a bribes from french oil giant elf-aquitaine when it purchased the east german refinery in the early 1990s .
if the french seek to pursue the investigation , it could delay or complicate pfahls ' extradition to germany .

arrest came as surprise in germany , pfahls ' arrest could lead to a reopening of the slush fund investigation .
volker neumann , the man who chaired a parliamentary committee investigating pfahls before he disappeared , said the arrest came unexpectedly .
" mr. pfahls trail was lost in 1999 between taipei and hong kong , and then he disappeared , " neumann said .
" his arrest in france was a big surprise because we believed he was still in asia . "
neumann said pfahls might be able to explain why the alleged bribes flowed in the first place .
but he said the courts would have to be the first to take action .
" first , the courts have priority to bring him to trial for the charges already filed against him .
this concerns the supply of tanks to saudi arabia , " he said .
" whether other charges are brought is not yet clear , although the statute of limitations has expired for most of the allegations . "
however , the opposition christian democrats are refusing to reopen the commission 's work .
wolfgang bosbach , the deputy chairman of the cdu 's parliamentary group , told german public radio broadcaster deutschlandradio he did n't know what purpose a " reanimation " of the commission would serve .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 14.07.2004 much ado about nothing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grasping for thin air and the title at the air guitar championship in berlin , contestants duke it out to see who 's best a stroking imaginary instruments .
the winner will represent germany at the world championships in finland . it 's standing room only tonight at the knorre in berlin .
about 200 people are sitting , standing or huddling body to body at the berlin culture center , with its bar-like atmosphere .
the crowd , hungry for scandalous behavior , is ready to see some sweating and passion at the first-ever national air guitar championship .
the winner will receive an air mattress and a flight to finland , where he or she will represent germany at the ninth-annual air guitar world championship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mark böhmer has winning on his mind tonight there are 14 air guitarists who have dared to make their way to the small stage in an effort to win over the audience and the judges .
" i 'm going to win , obviously , " says mark böhmer -lrb- photo -rrb- , 29 , who 's driven in from hanover to participate .
when he is n't strumming a make-believe guitar , böhmer normally plays the drums , but for the championships in berlin , he 's " playing " a double necked guitar with acoustic strings on one neck and electric strings on the other .
he 's been training for months for the big night : he 's been walking , he 's toned his biceps and he 's done finger exercises .
yet despite all that preparation , he says his performance tonight will mostly be spontaneous , " with the exception of two or three small things i 've put in my program .
instead i 'm going to just look and see what 's happening on stage and what the atmosphere is like . "
when asked if , like in the real world of rock and roll , drugs play an important part in his work , böhmer nods .
" a huge role , " he says , " but i ca n't tell you anything else about that .
but obviously you have to have a beer or two " before going on stage .
it 's an understatement that will be highlighted by events later in the evening .
fighting for world peace before the show , competition organizer friedericke van meer is being chased down by microphone brandishing journalists .
six months ago , the transsexual founded the german air guitar federation with a group of friends .
" i just randomly came across the world association 's web site and was really impressed with what i saw there , especially that air guitar is , in part , a service for world peace , " she explains .
" i was also very interested in the mix between seriousness and self-irony .
i 've never found that kind of mix anywhere else . "
an emcee clad in a velvet pin-striped and a pink-frilled shirt explains the rules and history of the air guitar to the audience , which is already growing impatient .
each contestant gets 60 seconds to persuade the audience .
" the decisive factors are the overall artistic impression , the visual presentation , technical ability , the song , everything .
you can , of course , influence the judges through your applause , " he explained .
the three-member jury , comprised of has-been german musicians , awards each contestant with between four and six points .
14 air guitarists give their all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this audience is hungry for scandalous behavior !
after a short performance by a real , e.g. live , band , it 's finally time for the competition .
" hell sinki , " is the first air guitarist to enter the stage .
he 's got a beer in his hand , which he slowly imbibes before starting his performance .
the man in his late 20s sporting a haircut not unlike members of the british band oasis , abuses his imaginary guitar to powerful rock ' n ' roll riffs , his fingers unrhythmically running over the imaginary strings .
he jumps into the air , then slams back down to the ground .
at the end of his performance , he falls off the stage to howls from the audience .
but the jury is stingier with its praise , giving him a 5.7 , 5.5 and a 5.4 .
more embarrassingly good performances follow .
" echodrive , " an older guy , is hopping around the stage chaotically , unaided by the pink floyd music he 's supposed to be accompanying .
with horn-rimmed glasses , an undershirt and red swimming trunks , he fiddles around for most of his performance with his fantasy amplifier which keeps making interference sounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : move over buddy holly , this is our new guitar hiro .
but there are also some highlights , like hiro , a young japanese guy who quickly becomes a crowd favorite .
dressed in a tie , pressed pants and designer glasses , his face is washed over in an ecstatic look as he performs .
then he turns his back to the audience and begins waggling his ass .
by the time he starts wriggling with his fake guitar on the stage floor , it appears he 's already clinched the title .
the stage is then covered in a hail storm of bras and tissues .
when the jury just gives him medium marks , booing fills the hall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i guess i should n't drink before the show next time . "
next up is mark böhmer , the cocky dude from hanover .
for the event , he 's brought along a roadie , who first tests out the guitar .
donning a wife-beater undershirt , böhmer launches into an air guitar version of " delay nuclear " by the hives .
he competently strums his instrument , rolls around on the floor and gets down on his knees .
it 's a powerful performance , but this crowd is not easily pleased .
" you 're an inbred , " yells one member of the audience .
the judges each give him a 5.7 - not bad , but still not enough .
" it did n't go all that well , " he says .
" i would have thought that the jury would have concentrated more on stylistic things or creativity .
but i had the feeling that the most important things to them were appearance and fun factor . "
but soon enough he 's laughing again .
" next time i know that i ca n't drink anything before the performance , otherwise i 'll forget how the song goes . "
the accidental champion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german air guitar champion ingo schulz : i 'm too sexy for my shirt !
one candidate first decided to join the competition when he got to the hall .
ingo schulz -lrb- photo -rrb- , a 33-year-old from berlin , says he did n't even know he was coming here tonight .
he says he did n't feel like going to a disco with techno or house music .
instead , the businessman decided to come here , but only as a spectator .

the winner will represent germany at the world championships in finland . it 's standing room only tonight at the knorre in berlin .
about 200 people are sitting , standing or huddling body to body at the berlin culture center , with its bar-like atmosphere .
the crowd , hungry for scandalous behavior , is ready to see some sweating and passion at the first-ever national air guitar championship .
the winner will receive an air mattress and a flight to finland , where he or she will represent germany at the ninth-annual air guitar world championship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mark böhmer has winning on his mind tonight there are 14 air guitarists who have dared to make their way to the small stage in an effort to win over the audience and the judges .
" i 'm going to win , obviously , " says mark böhmer -lrb- photo -rrb- , 29 , who 's driven in from hanover to participate .
when he is n't strumming a make-believe guitar , böhmer normally plays the drums , but for the championships in berlin , he 's " playing " a double necked guitar with acoustic strings on one neck and electric strings on the other .
he 's been training for months for the big night : he 's been walking , he 's toned his biceps and he 's done finger exercises .
yet despite all that preparation , he says his performance tonight will mostly be spontaneous , " with the exception of two or three small things i 've put in my program .
instead i 'm going to just look and see what 's happening on stage and what the atmosphere is like . "
when asked if , like in the real world of rock and roll , drugs play an important part in his work , böhmer nods .
" a huge role , " he says , " but i ca n't tell you anything else about that .
but obviously you have to have a beer or two " before going on stage .
it 's an understatement that will be highlighted by events later in the evening .
fighting for world peace before the show , competition organizer friedericke van meer is being chased down by microphone brandishing journalists .
six months ago , the transsexual founded the german air guitar federation with a group of friends .
" i just randomly came across the world association 's web site and was really impressed with what i saw there , especially that air guitar is , in part , a service for world peace , " she explains .
" i was also very interested in the mix between seriousness and self-irony .
i 've never found that kind of mix anywhere else . "
an emcee clad in a velvet pin-striped and a pink-frilled shirt explains the rules and history of the air guitar to the audience , which is already growing impatient .
each contestant gets 60 seconds to persuade the audience .
" the decisive factors are the overall artistic impression , the visual presentation , technical ability , the song , everything .
you can , of course , influence the judges through your applause , " he explained .
the three-member jury , comprised of has-been german musicians , awards each contestant with between four and six points .
14 air guitarists give their all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this audience is hungry for scandalous behavior !
after a short performance by a real , e.g. live , band , it 's finally time for the competition .
" hell sinki , " is the first air guitarist to enter the stage .
he 's got a beer in his hand , which he slowly imbibes before starting his performance .
the man in his late 20s sporting a haircut not unlike members of the british band oasis , abuses his imaginary guitar to powerful rock ' n ' roll riffs , his fingers unrhythmically running over the imaginary strings .
he jumps into the air , then slams back down to the ground .
at the end of his performance , he falls off the stage to howls from the audience .
but the jury is stingier with its praise , giving him a 5.7 , 5.5 and a 5.4 .
more embarrassingly good performances follow .
" echodrive , " an older guy , is hopping around the stage chaotically , unaided by the pink floyd music he 's supposed to be accompanying .
with horn-rimmed glasses , an undershirt and red swimming trunks , he fiddles around for most of his performance with his fantasy amplifier which keeps making interference sounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : move over buddy holly , this is our new guitar hiro .
but there are also some highlights , like hiro , a young japanese guy who quickly becomes a crowd favorite .
dressed in a tie , pressed pants and designer glasses , his face is washed over in an ecstatic look as he performs .
then he turns his back to the audience and begins waggling his ass .
by the time he starts wriggling with his fake guitar on the stage floor , it appears he 's already clinched the title .
the stage is then covered in a hail storm of bras and tissues .
when the jury just gives him medium marks , booing fills the hall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i guess i should n't drink before the show next time . "
next up is mark böhmer , the cocky dude from hanover .
for the event , he 's brought along a roadie , who first tests out the guitar .
donning a wife-beater undershirt , böhmer launches into an air guitar version of " delay nuclear " by the hives .
he competently strums his instrument , rolls around on the floor and gets down on his knees .
it 's a powerful performance , but this crowd is not easily pleased .
" you 're an inbred , " yells one member of the audience .
the judges each give him a 5.7 - not bad , but still not enough .
" it did n't go all that well , " he says .
" i would have thought that the jury would have concentrated more on stylistic things or creativity .
but i had the feeling that the most important things to them were appearance and fun factor . "
but soon enough he 's laughing again .
" next time i know that i ca n't drink anything before the performance , otherwise i 'll forget how the song goes . "
the accidental champion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german air guitar champion ingo schulz : i 'm too sexy for my shirt !
one candidate first decided to join the competition when he got to the hall .
ingo schulz -lrb- photo -rrb- , a 33-year-old from berlin , says he did n't even know he was coming here tonight .
he says he did n't feel like going to a disco with techno or house music .
instead , the businessman decided to come here , but only as a spectator .
but then he thought , " why not ? "

the winner will represent germany at the world championships in finland . it 's standing room only tonight at the knorre in berlin .
about 200 people are sitting , standing or huddling body to body at the berlin culture center , with its bar-like atmosphere .
the crowd , hungry for scandalous behavior , is ready to see some sweating and passion at the first-ever national air guitar championship .
the winner will receive an air mattress and a flight to finland , where he or she will represent germany at the ninth-annual air guitar world championship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mark böhmer has winning on his mind tonight there are 14 air guitarists who have dared to make their way to the small stage in an effort to win over the audience and the judges .
" i 'm going to win , obviously , " says mark böhmer -lrb- photo -rrb- , 29 , who 's driven in from hanover to participate .
when he is n't strumming a make-believe guitar , böhmer normally plays the drums , but for the championships in berlin , he 's " playing " a double necked guitar with acoustic strings on one neck and electric strings on the other .
he 's been training for months for the big night : he 's been walking , he 's toned his biceps and he 's done finger exercises .
yet despite all that preparation , he says his performance tonight will mostly be spontaneous , " with the exception of two or three small things i 've put in my program .
instead i 'm going to just look and see what 's happening on stage and what the atmosphere is like . "
when asked if , like in the real world of rock and roll , drugs play an important part in his work , böhmer nods .
" a huge role , " he says , " but i ca n't tell you anything else about that .
but obviously you have to have a beer or two " before going on stage .
it 's an understatement that will be highlighted by events later in the evening .
fighting for world peace before the show , competition organizer friedericke van meer is being chased down by microphone brandishing journalists .
six months ago , the transsexual founded the german air guitar federation with a group of friends .
" i just randomly came across the world association 's web site and was really impressed with what i saw there , especially that air guitar is , in part , a service for world peace , " she explains .
" i was also very interested in the mix between seriousness and self-irony .
i 've never found that kind of mix anywhere else . "
an emcee clad in a velvet pin-striped and a pink-frilled shirt explains the rules and history of the air guitar to the audience , which is already growing impatient .
each contestant gets 60 seconds to persuade the audience .
" the decisive factors are the overall artistic impression , the visual presentation , technical ability , the song , everything .
you can , of course , influence the judges through your applause , " he explained .
the three-member jury , comprised of has-been german musicians , awards each contestant with between four and six points .
14 air guitarists give their all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this audience is hungry for scandalous behavior !
after a short performance by a real , e.g. live , band , it 's finally time for the competition .
" hell sinki , " is the first air guitarist to enter the stage .
he 's got a beer in his hand , which he slowly imbibes before starting his performance .
the man in his late 20s sporting a haircut not unlike members of the british band oasis , abuses his imaginary guitar to powerful rock ' n ' roll riffs , his fingers unrhythmically running over the imaginary strings .
he jumps into the air , then slams back down to the ground .
at the end of his performance , he falls off the stage to howls from the audience .
but the jury is stingier with its praise , giving him a 5.7 , 5.5 and a 5.4 .
more embarrassingly good performances follow .
" echodrive , " an older guy , is hopping around the stage chaotically , unaided by the pink floyd music he 's supposed to be accompanying .
with horn-rimmed glasses , an undershirt and red swimming trunks , he fiddles around for most of his performance with his fantasy amplifier which keeps making interference sounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : move over buddy holly , this is our new guitar hiro .
but there are also some highlights , like hiro , a young japanese guy who quickly becomes a crowd favorite .
dressed in a tie , pressed pants and designer glasses , his face is washed over in an ecstatic look as he performs .
then he turns his back to the audience and begins waggling his ass .
by the time he starts wriggling with his fake guitar on the stage floor , it appears he 's already clinched the title .
the stage is then covered in a hail storm of bras and tissues .
when the jury just gives him medium marks , booing fills the hall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i guess i should n't drink before the show next time . "
next up is mark böhmer , the cocky dude from hanover .
for the event , he 's brought along a roadie , who first tests out the guitar .
donning a wife-beater undershirt , böhmer launches into an air guitar version of " delay nuclear " by the hives .
he competently strums his instrument , rolls around on the floor and gets down on his knees .
it 's a powerful performance , but this crowd is not easily pleased .
" you 're an inbred , " yells one member of the audience .
the judges each give him a 5.7 - not bad , but still not enough .
" it did n't go all that well , " he says .
" i would have thought that the jury would have concentrated more on stylistic things or creativity .
but i had the feeling that the most important things to them were appearance and fun factor . "
but soon enough he 's laughing again .
" next time i know that i ca n't drink anything before the performance , otherwise i 'll forget how the song goes . "
the accidental champion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german air guitar champion ingo schulz : i 'm too sexy for my shirt !
one candidate first decided to join the competition when he got to the hall .
ingo schulz -lrb- photo -rrb- , a 33-year-old from berlin , says he did n't even know he was coming here tonight .
he says he did n't feel like going to a disco with techno or house music .
instead , the businessman decided to come here , but only as a spectator .
but then he thought , " why not ? "
he chose a song by ac / dc and grabbed his " guitar . "
with jeans and a checkered shirt he does a mean angus young impersonation , licking his instrument with his tongue and pulling at the strings .
it 's an exceptional performance - pure , honest and without any twaddle .
the jury then crowns schulz the german championship , and this time the audience has no objections .
" when i play songs from ac / dc , " schulz explains , " i get the feeling that the 10 meters that separated me from angus young at his last berlin concert are a lot smaller .
i feel like the music is alive again , and not just for me .
if it pleases the audience , then it 's even better . "
he 's also got a pretty laid back attitude about representing germany at the world championships in finland next month .
" i 'm definitely going to do ac / dc again , " he says .
" i do n't know if it will be the same song .
so , now it 's time to go to finland for world peace .

about 200 people are sitting , standing or huddling body to body at the berlin culture center , with its bar-like atmosphere .
the crowd , hungry for scandalous behavior , is ready to see some sweating and passion at the first-ever national air guitar championship .
the winner will receive an air mattress and a flight to finland , where he or she will represent germany at the ninth-annual air guitar world championship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mark böhmer has winning on his mind tonight there are 14 air guitarists who have dared to make their way to the small stage in an effort to win over the audience and the judges .
" i 'm going to win , obviously , " says mark böhmer -lrb- photo -rrb- , 29 , who 's driven in from hanover to participate .
when he is n't strumming a make-believe guitar , böhmer normally plays the drums , but for the championships in berlin , he 's " playing " a double necked guitar with acoustic strings on one neck and electric strings on the other .
he 's been training for months for the big night : he 's been walking , he 's toned his biceps and he 's done finger exercises .
yet despite all that preparation , he says his performance tonight will mostly be spontaneous , " with the exception of two or three small things i 've put in my program .
instead i 'm going to just look and see what 's happening on stage and what the atmosphere is like . "
when asked if , like in the real world of rock and roll , drugs play an important part in his work , böhmer nods .
" a huge role , " he says , " but i ca n't tell you anything else about that .
but obviously you have to have a beer or two " before going on stage .
it 's an understatement that will be highlighted by events later in the evening .
fighting for world peace before the show , competition organizer friedericke van meer is being chased down by microphone brandishing journalists .
six months ago , the transsexual founded the german air guitar federation with a group of friends .
" i just randomly came across the world association 's web site and was really impressed with what i saw there , especially that air guitar is , in part , a service for world peace , " she explains .
" i was also very interested in the mix between seriousness and self-irony .
i 've never found that kind of mix anywhere else . "
an emcee clad in a velvet pin-striped and a pink-frilled shirt explains the rules and history of the air guitar to the audience , which is already growing impatient .
each contestant gets 60 seconds to persuade the audience .
" the decisive factors are the overall artistic impression , the visual presentation , technical ability , the song , everything .
you can , of course , influence the judges through your applause , " he explained .
the three-member jury , comprised of has-been german musicians , awards each contestant with between four and six points .
14 air guitarists give their all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this audience is hungry for scandalous behavior !
after a short performance by a real , e.g. live , band , it 's finally time for the competition .
" hell sinki , " is the first air guitarist to enter the stage .
he 's got a beer in his hand , which he slowly imbibes before starting his performance .
the man in his late 20s sporting a haircut not unlike members of the british band oasis , abuses his imaginary guitar to powerful rock ' n ' roll riffs , his fingers unrhythmically running over the imaginary strings .
he jumps into the air , then slams back down to the ground .
at the end of his performance , he falls off the stage to howls from the audience .
but the jury is stingier with its praise , giving him a 5.7 , 5.5 and a 5.4 .
more embarrassingly good performances follow .
" echodrive , " an older guy , is hopping around the stage chaotically , unaided by the pink floyd music he 's supposed to be accompanying .
with horn-rimmed glasses , an undershirt and red swimming trunks , he fiddles around for most of his performance with his fantasy amplifier which keeps making interference sounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : move over buddy holly , this is our new guitar hiro .
but there are also some highlights , like hiro , a young japanese guy who quickly becomes a crowd favorite .
dressed in a tie , pressed pants and designer glasses , his face is washed over in an ecstatic look as he performs .
then he turns his back to the audience and begins waggling his ass .
by the time he starts wriggling with his fake guitar on the stage floor , it appears he 's already clinched the title .
the stage is then covered in a hail storm of bras and tissues .
when the jury just gives him medium marks , booing fills the hall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i guess i should n't drink before the show next time . "
next up is mark böhmer , the cocky dude from hanover .
for the event , he 's brought along a roadie , who first tests out the guitar .
donning a wife-beater undershirt , böhmer launches into an air guitar version of " delay nuclear " by the hives .
he competently strums his instrument , rolls around on the floor and gets down on his knees .
it 's a powerful performance , but this crowd is not easily pleased .
" you 're an inbred , " yells one member of the audience .
the judges each give him a 5.7 - not bad , but still not enough .
" it did n't go all that well , " he says .
" i would have thought that the jury would have concentrated more on stylistic things or creativity .
but i had the feeling that the most important things to them were appearance and fun factor . "
but soon enough he 's laughing again .
" next time i know that i ca n't drink anything before the performance , otherwise i 'll forget how the song goes . "
the accidental champion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german air guitar champion ingo schulz : i 'm too sexy for my shirt !
one candidate first decided to join the competition when he got to the hall .
ingo schulz -lrb- photo -rrb- , a 33-year-old from berlin , says he did n't even know he was coming here tonight .
he says he did n't feel like going to a disco with techno or house music .
instead , the businessman decided to come here , but only as a spectator .
but then he thought , " why not ? "
he chose a song by ac / dc and grabbed his " guitar . "
with jeans and a checkered shirt he does a mean angus young impersonation , licking his instrument with his tongue and pulling at the strings .
it 's an exceptional performance - pure , honest and without any twaddle .
the jury then crowns schulz the german championship , and this time the audience has no objections .
" when i play songs from ac / dc , " schulz explains , " i get the feeling that the 10 meters that separated me from angus young at his last berlin concert are a lot smaller .
i feel like the music is alive again , and not just for me .
if it pleases the audience , then it 's even better . "
he 's also got a pretty laid back attitude about representing germany at the world championships in finland next month .
" i 'm definitely going to do ac / dc again , " he says .
" i do n't know if it will be the same song .
so , now it 's time to go to finland for world peace .

france has the worst record of the eu 15 member states with 62 directives pending followed by greece , germany , italy and the benelux countries with more than 30 directives each .
the commission said 134 or 9 percent of internal market directives have not been transposed into eu 15 national law on time .

" additional savings plans or tax increases would be counter-productive and damaging , they would endanger our economic recovery , " eichel wrote in an article published in the german business daily handelsblatt on wednesday .
the eu court overturned a decision last year to exempt germany and france from fines for overstepping eurozone budget deficit limits .
eichel said he is sticking to plans to inject around € 15 billion -lrb- $ 18.6 billion -rrb- into the 2005 budget through privatizations in order to keep new debt in check .
eichel welcomed what he said was a " wise ruling " by the eu court , and said that germany is no closer to sanctions than it was before .
according to a report in the financial times deutschland , the eu is working on recommendations as to how germany and france can keep their deficits in 2005 under the 3 percent of gdp limit set by the eu 's growth and stability pact , without incurring sanctions . dw-world.de court annulls eu stability pact suspension the european court of justice ruled against a decision by the eu council of finance ministers that had suspended excessive deficit measures launched against france and germany .

the former aide to ex-chancellor helmut kohl is wanted in connection with clandestine arms deals . he was on germany 's ' most wanted ' list for the past five years .
suspected of tax fraud and of taking nearly € 2 million -lrb- $ 2.4 million -rrb- in bribes in connection with the sale of 36 armored vehicles to saudi arabia , holger pfahls has been on the run from the german government .
on tuesday , police in paris tracked down the former defense official and apprehended him as he left his apartment .
the state prosecutor 's office in the southern german city of augsburg , where the charges were originally brought , confirmed the 62-year old had been arrested .
it is not clear yet when he will be extradicted . pfahls , who is accused of accepting bribes during the 1991 gulf war for helping german industrial giant thyssen obtain a government arms contract for delivering fuchs tanks to saudi arabia , disappeared in the late 1990s before he could be brought to court .
german interior minister otto schily welcomed pfahls ' arrest , saying it was " the result of the excellent work of german federal police -lrb- bka -rrb- . "
" for years , its investigators followed all possible leads .
this persevering work has now been rewarded , " he said .
high-level political scandal pfahls is also widely believed to be involved in the party slush-fund scandal that tainted former chancellor helmut kohl and his conservative christian democrats union .
state investigators allege that senior officials in kohl 's government , if not the chancellor himself , authorized the negotiations between pfahls and thyssen which were orchestrated by german-canadian arms dealer karl-heinz schreiber .
in 2002 , an augsburg state court found that two former managers at thyssen took millions of euros in bribes related to the delivery of the tanks , money they failed to declare to tax authorities .
schreiber , who also took a cut in the deal , was arrested in toronto in 1999 for tax evasion and is currently appealing extradition to germany .

pfahls himself has evaded arrest for five years .
initially bka investigators believed he had fled to the philippines , while the media reported he might be dead .
in recent press reports , however , it was reported that pfahls might be hiding in an upscale paris neighborhood .

the former aide to ex-chancellor helmut kohl is wanted in connection with clandestine arms deals . he was on germany 's ' most wanted ' list for the past five years .
suspected of tax fraud and of taking nearly € 2 million -lrb- $ 2.4 million -rrb- in bribes in connection with the sale of 36 armored vehicles to saudi arabia , holger pfahls has been on the run from the german government .
on tuesday , police in paris tracked down the former defense official and apprehended him as he left his apartment .
the state prosecutor 's office in the southern german city of augsburg , where the charges were originally brought , confirmed the 62-year old had been arrested .
it is not clear yet when he will be extradicted . pfahls , who is accused of accepting bribes during the 1991 gulf war for helping german industrial giant thyssen obtain a government arms contract for delivering fuchs tanks to saudi arabia , disappeared in the late 1990s before he could be brought to court .
german interior minister otto schily welcomed pfahls ' arrest , saying it was " the result of the excellent work of german federal police -lrb- bka -rrb- . "
" for years , its investigators followed all possible leads .
this persevering work has now been rewarded , " he said .
high-level political scandal pfahls is also widely believed to be involved in the party slush-fund scandal that tainted former chancellor helmut kohl and his conservative christian democrats union .
state investigators allege that senior officials in kohl 's government , if not the chancellor himself , authorized the negotiations between pfahls and thyssen which were orchestrated by german-canadian arms dealer karl-heinz schreiber .
in 2002 , an augsburg state court found that two former managers at thyssen took millions of euros in bribes related to the delivery of the tanks , money they failed to declare to tax authorities .
schreiber , who also took a cut in the deal , was arrested in toronto in 1999 for tax evasion and is currently appealing extradition to germany .

the former aide to ex-chancellor helmut kohl is wanted in connection with clandestine arms deals . he was on germany 's ' most wanted ' list for the past five years .
suspected of tax fraud and of taking nearly € 2 million -lrb- $ 2.4 million -rrb- in bribes in connection with the sale of 36 armored vehicles to saudi arabia , holger pfahls has been on the run from the german government .
on tuesday , police in paris tracked down the former defense official and apprehended him as he left his apartment .
the state prosecutor 's office in the southern german city of augsburg , where the charges were originally brought , confirmed the 62-year old had been arrested .
it is not clear yet when he will be extradicted . pfahls , who is accused of accepting bribes during the 1991 gulf war for helping german industrial giant thyssen obtain a government arms contract for delivering fuchs tanks to saudi arabia , disappeared in the late 1990s before he could be brought to court .
german interior minister otto schily welcomed pfahls ' arrest , saying it was " the result of the excellent work of german federal police -lrb- bka -rrb- . "

after years of stalling on the issue , the german car industry has decided to introduce serial production of emission filters for diesel cars .
the announcement comes amidst mounting pressure from environmentalists . while their european neighbors are already driving diesel cars outfitted with emission filters , germans have been wondering why their own carmakers have n't introduced the technology given the government 's pro-environmental stance .
activists from within the greens party and other campaigners for clean air and the reduction of green-house gases had been arguing for years in favor of serial production of filters in new diesel model .
they claim diesel cars emit more carcinogenic sooty particles than traditional fossil-fuel burning cars and are linked to increases in lung cancer and adverse respiratory problems : a study conducted by the federal environmental agency , showed that 14,000 people die prematurely each year as a result of diesel pollution .
filters on the cars can reduce particle emissions by 99 percent , and yet the german automobile branch has in the past adamantly resisted introducing the technology , saying that outfitting smaller cars with the filter would be much too expensive .
now the makers of volkswagen , bmw and mercedes are reversing their position .
they vow that by 2008/2009 all domestic diesel cars will contain a filter .
" diesel cars will be practically emissions free by the end of the decade , " said bernd gottschalk , president of the association of automobile manufacturers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diesel particle filter from bosch government support the german government was integral in implementing the change .
chancellor gerhard schröder , who had previously resisted calls from the greens to reduce diesel emission limits , is now offering tax breaks for owners whose cars fall under the more restrictive eu emissions standards of euro 5 , expected to be introduced in the fall .
currently , all cars with the euro 4 limit of 0.025 grams of particles per kilometer are eligible for tax reductions .
given the guaranteed tax breaks in the future , gottschalk said that by the end of 2006 nearly a quarter of all new diesel cars will be outfitted with the filter ; by the end of 2007 , some 75 percent of all new diesel motors will have filters .
meeting customer demand by offering the filters on all new models , the carmakers are responding to the demands of their customers , gottschalk said .
daimlerchrysler recently announced that more than 80 percent of all its mercedes owners were requesting the inclusion of a built-in emissions filter at purchase .

after years of stalling on the issue , the german car industry has decided to introduce serial production of emission filters for diesel cars .
the announcement comes amidst mounting pressure from environmentalists . while their european neighbors are already driving diesel cars outfitted with emission filters , germans have been wondering why their own carmakers have n't introduced the technology given the government 's pro-environmental stance .
activists from within the greens party and other campaigners for clean air and the reduction of green-house gases had been arguing for years in favor of serial production of filters in new diesel model .
they claim diesel cars emit more carcinogenic sooty particles than traditional fossil-fuel burning cars and are linked to increases in lung cancer and adverse respiratory problems : a study conducted by the federal environmental agency , showed that 14,000 people die prematurely each year as a result of diesel pollution .
filters on the cars can reduce particle emissions by 99 percent , and yet the german automobile branch has in the past adamantly resisted introducing the technology , saying that outfitting smaller cars with the filter would be much too expensive .
now the makers of volkswagen , bmw and mercedes are reversing their position .
they vow that by 2008/2009 all domestic diesel cars will contain a filter .
" diesel cars will be practically emissions free by the end of the decade , " said bernd gottschalk , president of the association of automobile manufacturers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diesel particle filter from bosch government support the german government was integral in implementing the change .
chancellor gerhard schröder , who had previously resisted calls from the greens to reduce diesel emission limits , is now offering tax breaks for owners whose cars fall under the more restrictive eu emissions standards of euro 5 , expected to be introduced in the fall .
currently , all cars with the euro 4 limit of 0.025 grams of particles per kilometer are eligible for tax reductions .
given the guaranteed tax breaks in the future , gottschalk said that by the end of 2006 nearly a quarter of all new diesel cars will be outfitted with the filter ; by the end of 2007 , some 75 percent of all new diesel motors will have filters .
meeting customer demand by offering the filters on all new models , the carmakers are responding to the demands of their customers , gottschalk said .
daimlerchrysler recently announced that more than 80 percent of all its mercedes owners were requesting the inclusion of a built-in emissions filter at purchase .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 14.07.2004 blair faces verdict on iraq intelligence großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report is to probe intelligence that led to iraq 's invasion a report on the quality of british intelligence used to justify the invasion of iraq will be released on wednesday .
it could raise further uncomfortable questions for beleaguered british prime minister tony blair . the five- person committee headed by lord butler was set up by the british government to review the quality of intelligence about weapons of mass destruction .
the group is meant to be independent and therefore is not expected to hold back with criticism for the sake of political allegiances . the so-called “ butler report ” comes just a few days after a us senate intelligence committee inquiry concluded that most of the cia 's claims on saddam hussein 's alleged arsenal were overstated or unsupported . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair the key issue for british prime minister , tony blair , will be whether the report finds that his government put any pressure on intelligence services to overestimate the risk posed by former iraqi dictator saddam hussein . the stakes for blair are high .
the butler report will deal in depth with british intelligence about weapons of mass destruction in iraq before the war . blair based his case for war on the confident assertion that saddam hussein had stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons and was a " serious and current threat . " but the iraq survey group , the team that has been scouring iraq for those weapons , has yet to find anything .
last week , blair acknowledged that wmd may never be found . iraq better off today on tuesday tony blair refused to comment about the butler report before it was made public and instead focused on the improvements in iraq , again putting this progress forward as his new justification for the war . " i think it is very hard to look at iraq today , see the country with , yes all the problems from terrorism , but with an internationally backed government that will eventually lead to a properly elected democratic government , a country that can be a stable partner in the international community , a country that can make use of the enormous wealth that it has , " blair said . " i think that it is very difficult to look at iraq today , look at iraq under saddam , and say that we ’ d be better off , the world would be safer , we ’ d be more secure , if saddam was still in charge of iraq . " did blair put pressure intelligence ? lord butler ’ s committee did its work behind closed doors and has made few statements about how it has been progressing .
media speculation about what the findings of the butler report might be has been intense . tony blair got an advance copy of the report on tuesday and so will be ready to respond to the findings .
the findings could reflect badly on blair . in particular the report might say his government pressured intelligence services in some way to overestimate the risk posed by iraq or misrepresented that risk .
many people in britain will be waiting to hear what the butler report has to say about a september 2002 british government dossier that claimed saddam hussein 's forces could deploy chemical and biological weapons within 45 minutes . the report comes a day before two by-elections in the uk .
the elections are in safe labor party strongholds , but opposition to the war , particularly among muslim communities , could cost tony blair ’ s party votes . martin vogl -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair bracing for another tough test it 's a tough week ahead for british prime minister tony blair as he braces for a fresh hit over iraq on the eve of two closely watched by-elections , in which voters could deliver stinging defeats to his labour party .
-lrb- july 12 , 2004 -rrb- blair calls for an end to guantanamo prison camp during a meeting with lawmakers on tuesday , british prime minister tony blair called the u.s. prison camp at guantanamo bay an " anomaly that must end " during tough questioning over his relationship with washington .

it could raise further uncomfortable questions for beleaguered british prime minister tony blair . the five- person committee headed by lord butler was set up by the british government to review the quality of intelligence about weapons of mass destruction .
the group is meant to be independent and therefore is not expected to hold back with criticism for the sake of political allegiances . the so-called “ butler report ” comes just a few days after a us senate intelligence committee inquiry concluded that most of the cia 's claims on saddam hussein 's alleged arsenal were overstated or unsupported . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair the key issue for british prime minister , tony blair , will be whether the report finds that his government put any pressure on intelligence services to overestimate the risk posed by former iraqi dictator saddam hussein . the stakes for blair are high .
the butler report will deal in depth with british intelligence about weapons of mass destruction in iraq before the war . blair based his case for war on the confident assertion that saddam hussein had stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons and was a " serious and current threat . " but the iraq survey group , the team that has been scouring iraq for those weapons , has yet to find anything .
last week , blair acknowledged that wmd may never be found . iraq better off today on tuesday tony blair refused to comment about the butler report before it was made public and instead focused on the improvements in iraq , again putting this progress forward as his new justification for the war . " i think it is very hard to look at iraq today , see the country with , yes all the problems from terrorism , but with an internationally backed government that will eventually lead to a properly elected democratic government , a country that can be a stable partner in the international community , a country that can make use of the enormous wealth that it has , " blair said . " i think that it is very difficult to look at iraq today , look at iraq under saddam , and say that we ’ d be better off , the world would be safer , we ’ d be more secure , if saddam was still in charge of iraq . " did blair put pressure intelligence ? lord butler ’ s committee did its work behind closed doors and has made few statements about how it has been progressing .
media speculation about what the findings of the butler report might be has been intense . tony blair got an advance copy of the report on tuesday and so will be ready to respond to the findings .
the findings could reflect badly on blair . in particular the report might say his government pressured intelligence services in some way to overestimate the risk posed by iraq or misrepresented that risk .
many people in britain will be waiting to hear what the butler report has to say about a september 2002 british government dossier that claimed saddam hussein 's forces could deploy chemical and biological weapons within 45 minutes . the report comes a day before two by-elections in the uk .

it could raise further uncomfortable questions for beleaguered british prime minister tony blair . the five- person committee headed by lord butler was set up by the british government to review the quality of intelligence about weapons of mass destruction .
the group is meant to be independent and therefore is not expected to hold back with criticism for the sake of political allegiances . the so-called “ butler report ” comes just a few days after a us senate intelligence committee inquiry concluded that most of the cia 's claims on saddam hussein 's alleged arsenal were overstated or unsupported . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair the key issue for british prime minister , tony blair , will be whether the report finds that his government put any pressure on intelligence services to overestimate the risk posed by former iraqi dictator saddam hussein . the stakes for blair are high .
the butler report will deal in depth with british intelligence about weapons of mass destruction in iraq before the war . blair based his case for war on the confident assertion that saddam hussein had stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons and was a " serious and current threat . " but the iraq survey group , the team that has been scouring iraq for those weapons , has yet to find anything .
last week , blair acknowledged that wmd may never be found . iraq better off today on tuesday tony blair refused to comment about the butler report before it was made public and instead focused on the improvements in iraq , again putting this progress forward as his new justification for the war . " i think it is very hard to look at iraq today , see the country with , yes all the problems from terrorism , but with an internationally backed government that will eventually lead to a properly elected democratic government , a country that can be a stable partner in the international community , a country that can make use of the enormous wealth that it has , " blair said . " i think that it is very difficult to look at iraq today , look at iraq under saddam , and say that we ’ d be better off , the world would be safer , we ’ d be more secure , if saddam was still in charge of iraq . " did blair put pressure intelligence ? lord butler ’ s committee did its work behind closed doors and has made few statements about how it has been progressing .
media speculation about what the findings of the butler report might be has been intense . tony blair got an advance copy of the report on tuesday and so will be ready to respond to the findings .
the findings could reflect badly on blair . in particular the report might say his government pressured intelligence services in some way to overestimate the risk posed by iraq or misrepresented that risk .
many people in britain will be waiting to hear what the butler report has to say about a september 2002 british government dossier that claimed saddam hussein 's forces could deploy chemical and biological weapons within 45 minutes . the report comes a day before two by-elections in the uk .
the elections are in safe labor party strongholds , but opposition to the war , particularly among muslim communities , could cost tony blair ’ s party votes . martin vogl -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair bracing for another tough test it 's a tough week ahead for british prime minister tony blair as he braces for a fresh hit over iraq on the eve of two closely watched by-elections , in which voters could deliver stinging defeats to his labour party .

the reason : the hotel was fully booked .
legionnaire 's disease is a form of pneumonia caused by bacteria that lives in water droplets .
in most major outbreaks , the source of infection has been water in the air-conditioning system of large buildings .
the hotel immediately called berlin 's health department upon identifying the bacteria , and the hydraulic system was disinfected . more briefs 13.07.2004 -pipe- paris police arrest former german defense official 13.07.2004 -pipe- hamburg moves to deport terror suspects 13.07.2004 -pipe- police release cologne bombing suspects 13.07.2004 -pipe- cdu demands positive pr for berlin 12.07.2004 -pipe- clinton praises us-german friendship 12.07.2004 -pipe- right-wing extremists start campaign to sway students 12.07.2004 -pipe- schröder faces showdown over labor market reform 09.07.2004 -pipe- police nab suspect in cologne bomb attack radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

a model project shows that biomass created from farm and factory waste can produce energy for 1,000 homes . sven nevigmann , one of the workers at the loick biomass plant in the village of dorsten , is looking over the operation , which is filled with swine and other animals whose manure is combined with food and other organic substances to create biomass , which in turns makes biogas that can be used for energy production .
the biomass goes through several production processes here at the plant before it is ready for consumption .
biomass projects like this across germany are essential elements of the government 's plan to increase its reliance on renewable energies – including wind and solar power – to 12.5 percent of all electricity development by 2010 .
in the western german state of north rhine-westphalia , where the loick plant is located , about 6 percent of energy production already comes from renewable energy supplies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i 'm good eating and i can heat your home ! "
" we use about 12,000 tons of biomass a year , that is about 6,000 tons of manure , pig and cow manure , and renewable biomass , and about 6,000 tons of food waste and other biodegradable biomass , " said marcel hengst , supervisor at the loick plant .
fermenting the future at loick , manure is mixed with other organic materials that mostly come from a small company nearby that produces deep frozen vegetables .
what the company can ’ t use in its products is then sent to loick to make energy .
it is combined with pig and cow manure that is brought in from nearby farms .
along with these products , corn grown at the plant and food waste are also fed in stages through a number of processing tanks where the organic waste products are fermented .
this then produces biogas along with a rich fertilizer that is highly sought after by local farmers .
in total , the fermentation process takes about 25-30 days .
" this is a single-step fermentation process , " explains hengst , " the fermentation process can be divided into four steps , and those four steps take place in the digester , a 1,000 cubic meter facility that contains a tank that degrades the biomass into valuable fertilizer and biogas . "
the biogras is then placed in a so-called " co-generation unit " that combines heat and power to generate electricity .
the company is paid an attractive premium of about 10 euro cents a kilowatt hour for the electricity it produces from biomass .
a showcase project the loick plant , which is located on an operating farm owned by hubert loick and sponsored by the state of north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- and the fraunhofer institute for environmental , safety and energy technology , was opened in september 2001 as a demonstration facility for biomass technology .
bernd kunott of nrw ’ s ministry of research , says projects like loick are important elements of germany ’ s ambitious renewable energies strategy .
because it transforms waste into valuable energy , it is also innovative , he says .
" there is very much waste you can use for energy purposes .
this one produces energy , electricity for nearly 1,000 households with four persons . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a backhoe picks up chipped wood that is going to be used for biomass production .
because it relies fermentation to produce its energy , biomass also has a major advantage over other renewable energy sources : it is not dependant on the sun shining or the wind blowing to produce energy .
it also has great potential – the german agricultural ministry estimates that , across the country , more than 190 million tons of manure , along with 25 million tons of organic waste , are available for biomass production .
if only 50 percent of that figure were put to the production of electricity or heat , the ministry estimates , either 1.7 million german homes could be provided with heating or the entire electricity needs for 4 million homes could be covered .
helping farmers help themselves but biomass is still largely in its infancy in germany .
of the potential 200,000 biomass facilities that could be built in the country , there are currently only about 1,000 .
still , for farmers like loick , it ’ s an attractive proposition that can help expand the bottom line .
" a farmer can better calculate his annual earnings -lrb- by creating a biomass plant -rrb- , " north rhine-westphalia environment minister bärbel höhn recently said .

biomass projects like this across germany are essential elements of the government 's plan to increase its reliance on renewable energies – including wind and solar power – to 12.5 percent of all electricity development by 2010 .
in the western german state of north rhine-westphalia , where the loick plant is located , about 6 percent of energy production already comes from renewable energy supplies .

" we use about 12,000 tons of biomass a year , that is about 6,000 tons of manure , pig and cow manure , and renewable biomass , and about 6,000 tons of food waste and other biodegradable biomass , " said marcel hengst , supervisor at the loick plant .
fermenting the future at loick , manure is mixed with other organic materials that mostly come from a small company nearby that produces deep frozen vegetables .
what the company can ’ t use in its products is then sent to loick to make energy .
it is combined with pig and cow manure that is brought in from nearby farms .
along with these products , corn grown at the plant and food waste are also fed in stages through a number of processing tanks where the organic waste products are fermented .
this then produces biogas along with a rich fertilizer that is highly sought after by local farmers .
in total , the fermentation process takes about 25-30 days .
" this is a single-step fermentation process , " explains hengst , " the fermentation process can be divided into four steps , and those four steps take place in the digester , a 1,000 cubic meter facility that contains a tank that degrades the biomass into valuable fertilizer and biogas . "
the biogras is then placed in a so-called " co-generation unit " that combines heat and power to generate electricity .
the company is paid an attractive premium of about 10 euro cents a kilowatt hour for the electricity it produces from biomass .
a showcase project the loick plant , which is located on an operating farm owned by hubert loick and sponsored by the state of north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- and the fraunhofer institute for environmental , safety and energy technology , was opened in september 2001 as a demonstration facility for biomass technology .
bernd kunott of nrw ’ s ministry of research , says projects like loick are important elements of germany ’ s ambitious renewable energies strategy .
because it transforms waste into valuable energy , it is also innovative , he says .
" there is very much waste you can use for energy purposes .
this one produces energy , electricity for nearly 1,000 households with four persons . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a backhoe picks up chipped wood that is going to be used for biomass production .
because it relies fermentation to produce its energy , biomass also has a major advantage over other renewable energy sources : it is not dependant on the sun shining or the wind blowing to produce energy .
it also has great potential – the german agricultural ministry estimates that , across the country , more than 190 million tons of manure , along with 25 million tons of organic waste , are available for biomass production .
if only 50 percent of that figure were put to the production of electricity or heat , the ministry estimates , either 1.7 million german homes could be provided with heating or the entire electricity needs for 4 million homes could be covered .
helping farmers help themselves but biomass is still largely in its infancy in germany .
of the potential 200,000 biomass facilities that could be built in the country , there are currently only about 1,000 .
still , for farmers like loick , it ’ s an attractive proposition that can help expand the bottom line .
" a farmer can better calculate his annual earnings -lrb- by creating a biomass plant -rrb- , " north rhine-westphalia environment minister bärbel höhn recently said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.07.2004 dung good großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : compost may not smell nice , but it can create energy for thousands germany wants to increase its use of renewable energies for electricity production to 12.5 percent by 2010 .
a model project shows that biomass created from farm and factory waste can produce energy for 1,000 homes . sven nevigmann , one of the workers at the loick biomass plant in the village of dorsten , is looking over the operation , which is filled with swine and other animals whose manure is combined with food and other organic substances to create biomass , which in turns makes biogas that can be used for energy production .
the biomass goes through several production processes here at the plant before it is ready for consumption .
biomass projects like this across germany are essential elements of the government 's plan to increase its reliance on renewable energies – including wind and solar power – to 12.5 percent of all electricity development by 2010 .
in the western german state of north rhine-westphalia , where the loick plant is located , about 6 percent of energy production already comes from renewable energy supplies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i 'm good eating and i can heat your home ! "
" we use about 12,000 tons of biomass a year , that is about 6,000 tons of manure , pig and cow manure , and renewable biomass , and about 6,000 tons of food waste and other biodegradable biomass , " said marcel hengst , supervisor at the loick plant .
fermenting the future at loick , manure is mixed with other organic materials that mostly come from a small company nearby that produces deep frozen vegetables .
what the company can ’ t use in its products is then sent to loick to make energy .
it is combined with pig and cow manure that is brought in from nearby farms .
along with these products , corn grown at the plant and food waste are also fed in stages through a number of processing tanks where the organic waste products are fermented .
this then produces biogas along with a rich fertilizer that is highly sought after by local farmers .
in total , the fermentation process takes about 25-30 days .
" this is a single-step fermentation process , " explains hengst , " the fermentation process can be divided into four steps , and those four steps take place in the digester , a 1,000 cubic meter facility that contains a tank that degrades the biomass into valuable fertilizer and biogas . "
the biogras is then placed in a so-called " co-generation unit " that combines heat and power to generate electricity .
the company is paid an attractive premium of about 10 euro cents a kilowatt hour for the electricity it produces from biomass .
a showcase project the loick plant , which is located on an operating farm owned by hubert loick and sponsored by the state of north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- and the fraunhofer institute for environmental , safety and energy technology , was opened in september 2001 as a demonstration facility for biomass technology .
bernd kunott of nrw ’ s ministry of research , says projects like loick are important elements of germany ’ s ambitious renewable energies strategy .
because it transforms waste into valuable energy , it is also innovative , he says .
" there is very much waste you can use for energy purposes .
this one produces energy , electricity for nearly 1,000 households with four persons . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a backhoe picks up chipped wood that is going to be used for biomass production .
because it relies fermentation to produce its energy , biomass also has a major advantage over other renewable energy sources : it is not dependant on the sun shining or the wind blowing to produce energy .
it also has great potential – the german agricultural ministry estimates that , across the country , more than 190 million tons of manure , along with 25 million tons of organic waste , are available for biomass production .
if only 50 percent of that figure were put to the production of electricity or heat , the ministry estimates , either 1.7 million german homes could be provided with heating or the entire electricity needs for 4 million homes could be covered .
helping farmers help themselves but biomass is still largely in its infancy in germany .
of the potential 200,000 biomass facilities that could be built in the country , there are currently only about 1,000 .
still , for farmers like loick , it ’ s an attractive proposition that can help expand the bottom line .

salvage efforts had been hampered by fears of an explosion . the " ena 2 " , a chemical tanker carrying 960 tons of sulphuric acid , collided with a container ship in the port of hamburg on monday .
since then , efforts to clear the wreckage had been hampered by fears of an explosion : when sulphuric acid mixes with water , it creates sulphurous , presenting the danger that the highly flammable fumes could explode . thus , firefighters have been treading lightly , taking time to come-up with a plan to set the tanker - now resting bottom-up - right and pump-out the remaining acid . on saturday , those involved in the rescue operation said that the tanker 's entire load had leaked into the water . despite these revised figures , local environmental authorities and greenpeace experts say a major environmental disaster has been avoided . " in light of these new facts , hamburg has been extraordinarily lucky , " said greenpeace shipping expert christian bussau , adding that the port would probably recover from the accident within a few months . due to the danger of an explosion , the salvage operation had been progressing slowly with a particular emphasis on safety . the tanks were filled with non-flammable nitrogen before the ship was turned upright slowly with the help of cranes . major disaster was avoided at the time of the collision , the driver had a blood alcohol level more than twice the legal limit , according to authorities .
he now faces serious charges carrying a sentence of up to five years in jail and will never be allowed to drive a ship again , according to officials . considering the tanker 's load , it 's a miracle that the disaster did not result in a greater number of injuries and more far-reaching environmental damage , experts said .
eleven people were treated at the time of the explosion for injuries to the respiratory tract and it is estimated that 1,000 fish in the immediate vicinity were killed . " we were lucky that there was n't a further chemical reaction , " said jörg feddern , another expert for greenpeace .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.07.2004 dung good großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : compost may not smell nice , but it can create energy for thousands germany wants to increase its use of renewable energies for electricity production to 12.5 percent by 2010 .
a model project shows that biomass created from farm and factory waste can produce energy for 1,000 homes . sven nevigmann , one of the workers at the loick biomass plant in the village of dorsten , is looking over the operation , which is filled with swine and other animals whose manure is combined with food and other organic substances to create biomass , which in turns makes biogas that can be used for energy production .
the biomass goes through several production processes here at the plant before it is ready for consumption .
biomass projects like this across germany are essential elements of the government 's plan to increase its reliance on renewable energies – including wind and solar power – to 12.5 percent of all electricity development by 2010 .
in the western german state of north rhine-westphalia , where the loick plant is located , about 6 percent of energy production already comes from renewable energy supplies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i 'm good eating and i can heat your home ! "
" we use about 12,000 tons of biomass a year , that is about 6,000 tons of manure , pig and cow manure , and renewable biomass , and about 6,000 tons of food waste and other biodegradable biomass , " said marcel hengst , supervisor at the loick plant .
fermenting the future at loick , manure is mixed with other organic materials that mostly come from a small company nearby that produces deep frozen vegetables .
what the company can ’ t use in its products is then sent to loick to make energy .
it is combined with pig and cow manure that is brought in from nearby farms .
along with these products , corn grown at the plant and food waste are also fed in stages through a number of processing tanks where the organic waste products are fermented .
this then produces biogas along with a rich fertilizer that is highly sought after by local farmers .
in total , the fermentation process takes about 25-30 days .
" this is a single-step fermentation process , " explains hengst , " the fermentation process can be divided into four steps , and those four steps take place in the digester , a 1,000 cubic meter facility that contains a tank that degrades the biomass into valuable fertilizer and biogas . "
the biogras is then placed in a so-called " co-generation unit " that combines heat and power to generate electricity .
the company is paid an attractive premium of about 10 euro cents a kilowatt hour for the electricity it produces from biomass .
a showcase project the loick plant , which is located on an operating farm owned by hubert loick and sponsored by the state of north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- and the fraunhofer institute for environmental , safety and energy technology , was opened in september 2001 as a demonstration facility for biomass technology .
bernd kunott of nrw ’ s ministry of research , says projects like loick are important elements of germany ’ s ambitious renewable energies strategy .
because it transforms waste into valuable energy , it is also innovative , he says .
" there is very much waste you can use for energy purposes .
this one produces energy , electricity for nearly 1,000 households with four persons . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a backhoe picks up chipped wood that is going to be used for biomass production .
because it relies fermentation to produce its energy , biomass also has a major advantage over other renewable energy sources : it is not dependant on the sun shining or the wind blowing to produce energy .
it also has great potential – the german agricultural ministry estimates that , across the country , more than 190 million tons of manure , along with 25 million tons of organic waste , are available for biomass production .
if only 50 percent of that figure were put to the production of electricity or heat , the ministry estimates , either 1.7 million german homes could be provided with heating or the entire electricity needs for 4 million homes could be covered .
helping farmers help themselves but biomass is still largely in its infancy in germany .
of the potential 200,000 biomass facilities that could be built in the country , there are currently only about 1,000 .
still , for farmers like loick , it ’ s an attractive proposition that can help expand the bottom line .
" a farmer can better calculate his annual earnings -lrb- by creating a biomass plant -rrb- , " north rhine-westphalia environment minister bärbel höhn recently said .

the winner will represent germany at the world championships in finland . it 's standing room only tonight at the knorre in berlin .
about 200 people are sitting , standing or huddling body to body at the berlin culture center , with its bar-like atmosphere .
the crowd , hungry for scandalous behavior , is ready to see some sweating and passion at the first-ever national air guitar championship .
the winner will receive an air mattress and a flight to finland , where he or she will represent germany at the ninth-annual air guitar world championship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mark böhmer has winning on his mind tonight there are 14 air guitarists who have dared to make their way to the small stage in an effort to win over the audience and the judges .
" i 'm going to win , obviously , " says mark böhmer -lrb- photo -rrb- , 29 , who 's driven in from hanover to participate .
when he is n't strumming a make-believe guitar , böhmer normally plays the drums , but for the championships in berlin , he 's " playing " a double necked guitar with acoustic strings on one neck and electric strings on the other .
he 's been training for months for the big night : he 's been walking , he 's toned his biceps and he 's done finger exercises .
yet despite all that preparation , he says his performance tonight will mostly be spontaneous , " with the exception of two or three small things i 've put in my program .
instead i 'm going to just look and see what 's happening on stage and what the atmosphere is like . "
when asked if , like in the real world of rock and roll , drugs play an important part in his work , böhmer nods .
" a huge role , " he says , " but i ca n't tell you anything else about that .
but obviously you have to have a beer or two " before going on stage .
it 's an understatement that will be highlighted by events later in the evening .
fighting for world peace before the show , competition organizer friedericke van meer is being chased down by microphone brandishing journalists .
six months ago , the transsexual founded the german air guitar federation with a group of friends .
" i just randomly came across the world association 's web site and was really impressed with what i saw there , especially that air guitar is , in part , a service for world peace , " she explains .
" i was also very interested in the mix between seriousness and self-irony .
i 've never found that kind of mix anywhere else . "
an emcee clad in a velvet pin-striped and a pink-frilled shirt explains the rules and history of the air guitar to the audience , which is already growing impatient .
each contestant gets 60 seconds to persuade the audience .
" the decisive factors are the overall artistic impression , the visual presentation , technical ability , the song , everything .
you can , of course , influence the judges through your applause , " he explained .
the three-member jury , comprised of has-been german musicians , awards each contestant with between four and six points .
14 air guitarists give their all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this audience is hungry for scandalous behavior !
after a short performance by a real , e.g. live , band , it 's finally time for the competition .
" hell sinki , " is the first air guitarist to enter the stage .
he 's got a beer in his hand , which he slowly imbibes before starting his performance .
the man in his late 20s sporting a haircut not unlike members of the british band oasis , abuses his imaginary guitar to powerful rock ' n ' roll riffs , his fingers unrhythmically running over the imaginary strings .
he jumps into the air , then slams back down to the ground .
at the end of his performance , he falls off the stage to howls from the audience .
but the jury is stingier with its praise , giving him a 5.7 , 5.5 and a 5.4 .
more embarrassingly good performances follow .
" echodrive , " an older guy , is hopping around the stage chaotically , unaided by the pink floyd music he 's supposed to be accompanying .
with horn-rimmed glasses , an undershirt and red swimming trunks , he fiddles around for most of his performance with his fantasy amplifier which keeps making interference sounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : move over buddy holly , this is our new guitar hiro .
but there are also some highlights , like hiro , a young japanese guy who quickly becomes a crowd favorite .
dressed in a tie , pressed pants and designer glasses , his face is washed over in an ecstatic look as he performs .
then he turns his back to the audience and begins waggling his ass .
by the time he starts wriggling with his fake guitar on the stage floor , it appears he 's already clinched the title .
the stage is then covered in a hail storm of bras and tissues .
when the jury just gives him medium marks , booing fills the hall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i guess i should n't drink before the show next time . "
next up is mark böhmer , the cocky dude from hanover .
for the event , he 's brought along a roadie , who first tests out the guitar .
donning a wife-beater undershirt , böhmer launches into an air guitar version of " delay nuclear " by the hives .
he competently strums his instrument , rolls around on the floor and gets down on his knees .
it 's a powerful performance , but this crowd is not easily pleased .
" you 're an inbred , " yells one member of the audience .
the judges each give him a 5.7 - not bad , but still not enough .
" it did n't go all that well , " he says .
" i would have thought that the jury would have concentrated more on stylistic things or creativity .
but i had the feeling that the most important things to them were appearance and fun factor . "
but soon enough he 's laughing again .
" next time i know that i ca n't drink anything before the performance , otherwise i 'll forget how the song goes . "
the accidental champion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german air guitar champion ingo schulz : i 'm too sexy for my shirt !
one candidate first decided to join the competition when he got to the hall .
ingo schulz -lrb- photo -rrb- , a 33-year-old from berlin , says he did n't even know he was coming here tonight .
he says he did n't feel like going to a disco with techno or house music .
instead , the businessman decided to come here , but only as a spectator .
but then he thought , " why not ? "
he chose a song by ac / dc and grabbed his " guitar . "
with jeans and a checkered shirt he does a mean angus young impersonation , licking his instrument with his tongue and pulling at the strings .
it 's an exceptional performance - pure , honest and without any twaddle .
the jury then crowns schulz the german championship , and this time the audience has no objections .
" when i play songs from ac / dc , " schulz explains , " i get the feeling that the 10 meters that separated me from angus young at his last berlin concert are a lot smaller .
i feel like the music is alive again , and not just for me .
if it pleases the audience , then it 's even better . "
he 's also got a pretty laid back attitude about representing germany at the world championships in finland next month .
" i 'm definitely going to do ac / dc again , " he says .
" i do n't know if it will be the same song .
so , now it 's time to go to finland for world peace . " andreas leixnering -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links air guitar world championships the official web site of the air guitar world 's premier event .

the winner will represent germany at the world championships in finland . it 's standing room only tonight at the knorre in berlin .
about 200 people are sitting , standing or huddling body to body at the berlin culture center , with its bar-like atmosphere .
the crowd , hungry for scandalous behavior , is ready to see some sweating and passion at the first-ever national air guitar championship .
the winner will receive an air mattress and a flight to finland , where he or she will represent germany at the ninth-annual air guitar world championship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mark böhmer has winning on his mind tonight there are 14 air guitarists who have dared to make their way to the small stage in an effort to win over the audience and the judges .
" i 'm going to win , obviously , " says mark böhmer -lrb- photo -rrb- , 29 , who 's driven in from hanover to participate .
when he is n't strumming a make-believe guitar , böhmer normally plays the drums , but for the championships in berlin , he 's " playing " a double necked guitar with acoustic strings on one neck and electric strings on the other .
he 's been training for months for the big night : he 's been walking , he 's toned his biceps and he 's done finger exercises .
yet despite all that preparation , he says his performance tonight will mostly be spontaneous , " with the exception of two or three small things i 've put in my program .
instead i 'm going to just look and see what 's happening on stage and what the atmosphere is like . "
when asked if , like in the real world of rock and roll , drugs play an important part in his work , böhmer nods .
" a huge role , " he says , " but i ca n't tell you anything else about that .
but obviously you have to have a beer or two " before going on stage .
it 's an understatement that will be highlighted by events later in the evening .
fighting for world peace before the show , competition organizer friedericke van meer is being chased down by microphone brandishing journalists .
six months ago , the transsexual founded the german air guitar federation with a group of friends .
" i just randomly came across the world association 's web site and was really impressed with what i saw there , especially that air guitar is , in part , a service for world peace , " she explains .
" i was also very interested in the mix between seriousness and self-irony .
i 've never found that kind of mix anywhere else . "
an emcee clad in a velvet pin-striped and a pink-frilled shirt explains the rules and history of the air guitar to the audience , which is already growing impatient .
each contestant gets 60 seconds to persuade the audience .
" the decisive factors are the overall artistic impression , the visual presentation , technical ability , the song , everything .
you can , of course , influence the judges through your applause , " he explained .
the three-member jury , comprised of has-been german musicians , awards each contestant with between four and six points .
14 air guitarists give their all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this audience is hungry for scandalous behavior !
after a short performance by a real , e.g. live , band , it 's finally time for the competition .
" hell sinki , " is the first air guitarist to enter the stage .
he 's got a beer in his hand , which he slowly imbibes before starting his performance .
the man in his late 20s sporting a haircut not unlike members of the british band oasis , abuses his imaginary guitar to powerful rock ' n ' roll riffs , his fingers unrhythmically running over the imaginary strings .
he jumps into the air , then slams back down to the ground .
at the end of his performance , he falls off the stage to howls from the audience .
but the jury is stingier with its praise , giving him a 5.7 , 5.5 and a 5.4 .
more embarrassingly good performances follow .
" echodrive , " an older guy , is hopping around the stage chaotically , unaided by the pink floyd music he 's supposed to be accompanying .
with horn-rimmed glasses , an undershirt and red swimming trunks , he fiddles around for most of his performance with his fantasy amplifier which keeps making interference sounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : move over buddy holly , this is our new guitar hiro .
but there are also some highlights , like hiro , a young japanese guy who quickly becomes a crowd favorite .
dressed in a tie , pressed pants and designer glasses , his face is washed over in an ecstatic look as he performs .
then he turns his back to the audience and begins waggling his ass .
by the time he starts wriggling with his fake guitar on the stage floor , it appears he 's already clinched the title .
the stage is then covered in a hail storm of bras and tissues .
when the jury just gives him medium marks , booing fills the hall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i guess i should n't drink before the show next time . "
next up is mark böhmer , the cocky dude from hanover .
for the event , he 's brought along a roadie , who first tests out the guitar .
donning a wife-beater undershirt , böhmer launches into an air guitar version of " delay nuclear " by the hives .
he competently strums his instrument , rolls around on the floor and gets down on his knees .
it 's a powerful performance , but this crowd is not easily pleased .
" you 're an inbred , " yells one member of the audience .
the judges each give him a 5.7 - not bad , but still not enough .
" it did n't go all that well , " he says .
" i would have thought that the jury would have concentrated more on stylistic things or creativity .
but i had the feeling that the most important things to them were appearance and fun factor . "
but soon enough he 's laughing again .
" next time i know that i ca n't drink anything before the performance , otherwise i 'll forget how the song goes . "
the accidental champion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german air guitar champion ingo schulz : i 'm too sexy for my shirt !
one candidate first decided to join the competition when he got to the hall .
ingo schulz -lrb- photo -rrb- , a 33-year-old from berlin , says he did n't even know he was coming here tonight .
he says he did n't feel like going to a disco with techno or house music .
instead , the businessman decided to come here , but only as a spectator .
but then he thought , " why not ? "
he chose a song by ac / dc and grabbed his " guitar . "
with jeans and a checkered shirt he does a mean angus young impersonation , licking his instrument with his tongue and pulling at the strings .
it 's an exceptional performance - pure , honest and without any twaddle .
the jury then crowns schulz the german championship , and this time the audience has no objections .
" when i play songs from ac / dc , " schulz explains , " i get the feeling that the 10 meters that separated me from angus young at his last berlin concert are a lot smaller .
i feel like the music is alive again , and not just for me .
if it pleases the audience , then it 's even better . "
he 's also got a pretty laid back attitude about representing germany at the world championships in finland next month .
" i 'm definitely going to do ac / dc again , " he says .
" i do n't know if it will be the same song .
so , now it 's time to go to finland for world peace . " andreas leixnering -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links air guitar world championships the official web site of the air guitar world 's premier event .

the winner will represent germany at the world championships in finland . it 's standing room only tonight at the knorre in berlin .
about 200 people are sitting , standing or huddling body to body at the berlin culture center , with its bar-like atmosphere .
the crowd , hungry for scandalous behavior , is ready to see some sweating and passion at the first-ever national air guitar championship .
the winner will receive an air mattress and a flight to finland , where he or she will represent germany at the ninth-annual air guitar world championship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mark böhmer has winning on his mind tonight there are 14 air guitarists who have dared to make their way to the small stage in an effort to win over the audience and the judges .
" i 'm going to win , obviously , " says mark böhmer -lrb- photo -rrb- , 29 , who 's driven in from hanover to participate .
when he is n't strumming a make-believe guitar , böhmer normally plays the drums , but for the championships in berlin , he 's " playing " a double necked guitar with acoustic strings on one neck and electric strings on the other .
he 's been training for months for the big night : he 's been walking , he 's toned his biceps and he 's done finger exercises .
yet despite all that preparation , he says his performance tonight will mostly be spontaneous , " with the exception of two or three small things i 've put in my program .
instead i 'm going to just look and see what 's happening on stage and what the atmosphere is like . "
when asked if , like in the real world of rock and roll , drugs play an important part in his work , böhmer nods .
" a huge role , " he says , " but i ca n't tell you anything else about that .
but obviously you have to have a beer or two " before going on stage .
it 's an understatement that will be highlighted by events later in the evening .
fighting for world peace before the show , competition organizer friedericke van meer is being chased down by microphone brandishing journalists .
six months ago , the transsexual founded the german air guitar federation with a group of friends .
" i just randomly came across the world association 's web site and was really impressed with what i saw there , especially that air guitar is , in part , a service for world peace , " she explains .
" i was also very interested in the mix between seriousness and self-irony .
i 've never found that kind of mix anywhere else . "
an emcee clad in a velvet pin-striped and a pink-frilled shirt explains the rules and history of the air guitar to the audience , which is already growing impatient .
each contestant gets 60 seconds to persuade the audience .
" the decisive factors are the overall artistic impression , the visual presentation , technical ability , the song , everything .
you can , of course , influence the judges through your applause , " he explained .
the three-member jury , comprised of has-been german musicians , awards each contestant with between four and six points .
14 air guitarists give their all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this audience is hungry for scandalous behavior !
after a short performance by a real , e.g. live , band , it 's finally time for the competition .
" hell sinki , " is the first air guitarist to enter the stage .
he 's got a beer in his hand , which he slowly imbibes before starting his performance .
the man in his late 20s sporting a haircut not unlike members of the british band oasis , abuses his imaginary guitar to powerful rock ' n ' roll riffs , his fingers unrhythmically running over the imaginary strings .
he jumps into the air , then slams back down to the ground .
at the end of his performance , he falls off the stage to howls from the audience .
but the jury is stingier with its praise , giving him a 5.7 , 5.5 and a 5.4 .
more embarrassingly good performances follow .
" echodrive , " an older guy , is hopping around the stage chaotically , unaided by the pink floyd music he 's supposed to be accompanying .
with horn-rimmed glasses , an undershirt and red swimming trunks , he fiddles around for most of his performance with his fantasy amplifier which keeps making interference sounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : move over buddy holly , this is our new guitar hiro .
but there are also some highlights , like hiro , a young japanese guy who quickly becomes a crowd favorite .
dressed in a tie , pressed pants and designer glasses , his face is washed over in an ecstatic look as he performs .
then he turns his back to the audience and begins waggling his ass .
by the time he starts wriggling with his fake guitar on the stage floor , it appears he 's already clinched the title .
the stage is then covered in a hail storm of bras and tissues .
when the jury just gives him medium marks , booing fills the hall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i guess i should n't drink before the show next time . "
next up is mark böhmer , the cocky dude from hanover .
for the event , he 's brought along a roadie , who first tests out the guitar .
donning a wife-beater undershirt , böhmer launches into an air guitar version of " delay nuclear " by the hives .
he competently strums his instrument , rolls around on the floor and gets down on his knees .
it 's a powerful performance , but this crowd is not easily pleased .
" you 're an inbred , " yells one member of the audience .
the judges each give him a 5.7 - not bad , but still not enough .
" it did n't go all that well , " he says .
" i would have thought that the jury would have concentrated more on stylistic things or creativity .
but i had the feeling that the most important things to them were appearance and fun factor . "
but soon enough he 's laughing again .
" next time i know that i ca n't drink anything before the performance , otherwise i 'll forget how the song goes . "
the accidental champion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german air guitar champion ingo schulz : i 'm too sexy for my shirt !
one candidate first decided to join the competition when he got to the hall .
ingo schulz -lrb- photo -rrb- , a 33-year-old from berlin , says he did n't even know he was coming here tonight .
he says he did n't feel like going to a disco with techno or house music .
instead , the businessman decided to come here , but only as a spectator .
but then he thought , " why not ? "
he chose a song by ac / dc and grabbed his " guitar . "
with jeans and a checkered shirt he does a mean angus young impersonation , licking his instrument with his tongue and pulling at the strings .
it 's an exceptional performance - pure , honest and without any twaddle .
the jury then crowns schulz the german championship , and this time the audience has no objections .
" when i play songs from ac / dc , " schulz explains , " i get the feeling that the 10 meters that separated me from angus young at his last berlin concert are a lot smaller .
i feel like the music is alive again , and not just for me .
if it pleases the audience , then it 's even better . "
he 's also got a pretty laid back attitude about representing germany at the world championships in finland next month .
" i 'm definitely going to do ac / dc again , " he says .
" i do n't know if it will be the same song .
so , now it 's time to go to finland for world peace . " andreas leixnering -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links air guitar world championships the official web site of the air guitar world 's premier event .

as widely predicted by british newspapers , butler 's report did not contain any direct allegations that blair or his government deliberately exaggerated the case for war . flak for intelligence and blair 's style of governance the harshest criticism was directed at the intelligence efforts , largely mirroring a senate report on us spying published last week , which exonerated the regime of president george w. bush . much of britain 's intelligence was based on human sources , the report said . " validation of human intelligence sources after war has thrown doubt on a high proportion of those sources and of their reports ; and hence on the quality of the intelligence assessments received by ministers and officials in the period from summer 2002 to the outbreak of hostilities , " it concluded . additionally , blair 's style of government was criticized , with the report saying that its " informality and circumscribed character " shut much of his cabinet out of the decision-making process . " we do not suggest that there is or should be an ideal or unchangeable system of collective government , still less that procedures are in aggregate any less effective now than in earlier times , " the report said .
" however , we are concerned that the informality and circumscribed character of the government 's procedures which we saw in the context of policy-making towards iraq risks reducing the scope for informed collective political judgment . " no wmd perhaps the most damning indictment for the premier was the conclusion on iraq 's wmd , which blair insisted did exist long after the fall of baghdad in april 2003 , although none have been found by coalition troops . while iraq might have been developing missiles with a longer range than allowed under united nations sanctions , it " did not have significant - if any - stocks of chemical or biological weapons in a state fit for deployment , or developed plans for using them , " the report said . however , it added : " we believe it would be a rash person who asserted at this stage that evidence of iraqi possession of stocks of biological or chemical agents , or even of banned missiles , does not exist or will never be found , " the inquiry found . in one small victory for blair , while the report had some criticisms of sir john scarlett , who co-ordinated intelligence efforts before the war , it recommended that he stay on in his new job as head of the secret intelligence service , or mi6 . there would likely be calls for scarlett to step down , the report said , but added : " we greatly hope that he will not do so .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 14.07.2004 blair faces verdict on iraq intelligence großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report is to probe intelligence that led to iraq 's invasion a report on the quality of british intelligence used to justify the invasion of iraq will be released on wednesday .
it could raise further uncomfortable questions for beleaguered british prime minister tony blair . the five- person committee headed by lord butler was set up by the british government to review the quality of intelligence about weapons of mass destruction .
the group is meant to be independent and therefore is not expected to hold back with criticism for the sake of political allegiances . the so-called “ butler report ” comes just a few days after a us senate intelligence committee inquiry concluded that most of the cia 's claims on saddam hussein 's alleged arsenal were overstated or unsupported . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair the key issue for british prime minister , tony blair , will be whether the report finds that his government put any pressure on intelligence services to overestimate the risk posed by former iraqi dictator saddam hussein . the stakes for blair are high .
the butler report will deal in depth with british intelligence about weapons of mass destruction in iraq before the war . blair based his case for war on the confident assertion that saddam hussein had stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons and was a " serious and current threat . " but the iraq survey group , the team that has been scouring iraq for those weapons , has yet to find anything .

after years of stalling on the issue , the german car industry has decided to introduce serial production of emission filters for diesel cars .
the announcement comes amidst mounting pressure from environmentalists . while their european neighbors are already driving diesel cars outfitted with emission filters , germans have been wondering why their own carmakers have n't introduced the technology given the government 's pro-environmental stance .
activists from within the greens party and other campaigners for clean air and the reduction of green-house gases had been arguing for years in favor of serial production of filters in new diesel model .
they claim diesel cars emit more carcinogenic sooty particles than traditional fossil-fuel burning cars and are linked to increases in lung cancer and adverse respiratory problems : a study conducted by the federal environmental agency , showed that 14,000 people die prematurely each year as a result of diesel pollution .
filters on the cars can reduce particle emissions by 99 percent , and yet the german automobile branch has in the past adamantly resisted introducing the technology , saying that outfitting smaller cars with the filter would be much too expensive .
now the makers of volkswagen , bmw and mercedes are reversing their position .
they vow that by 2008/2009 all domestic diesel cars will contain a filter .
" diesel cars will be practically emissions free by the end of the decade , " said bernd gottschalk , president of the association of automobile manufacturers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diesel particle filter from bosch government support the german government was integral in implementing the change .
chancellor gerhard schröder , who had previously resisted calls from the greens to reduce diesel emission limits , is now offering tax breaks for owners whose cars fall under the more restrictive eu emissions standards of euro 5 , expected to be introduced in the fall .
currently , all cars with the euro 4 limit of 0.025 grams of particles per kilometer are eligible for tax reductions .
given the guaranteed tax breaks in the future , gottschalk said that by the end of 2006 nearly a quarter of all new diesel cars will be outfitted with the filter ; by the end of 2007 , some 75 percent of all new diesel motors will have filters .
meeting customer demand by offering the filters on all new models , the carmakers are responding to the demands of their customers , gottschalk said .
daimlerchrysler recently announced that more than 80 percent of all its mercedes owners were requesting the inclusion of a built-in emissions filter at purchase .

after years of stalling on the issue , the german car industry has decided to introduce serial production of emission filters for diesel cars .
the announcement comes amidst mounting pressure from environmentalists . while their european neighbors are already driving diesel cars outfitted with emission filters , germans have been wondering why their own carmakers have n't introduced the technology given the government 's pro-environmental stance .
activists from within the greens party and other campaigners for clean air and the reduction of green-house gases had been arguing for years in favor of serial production of filters in new diesel model .
they claim diesel cars emit more carcinogenic sooty particles than traditional fossil-fuel burning cars and are linked to increases in lung cancer and adverse respiratory problems : a study conducted by the federal environmental agency , showed that 14,000 people die prematurely each year as a result of diesel pollution .
filters on the cars can reduce particle emissions by 99 percent , and yet the german automobile branch has in the past adamantly resisted introducing the technology , saying that outfitting smaller cars with the filter would be much too expensive .
now the makers of volkswagen , bmw and mercedes are reversing their position .

currently , all cars with the euro 4 limit of 0.025 grams of particles per kilometer are eligible for tax reductions .
given the guaranteed tax breaks in the future , gottschalk said that by the end of 2006 nearly a quarter of all new diesel cars will be outfitted with the filter ; by the end of 2007 , some 75 percent of all new diesel motors will have filters .

the former aide to ex-chancellor helmut kohl is wanted in connection with clandestine arms deals . he was on germany 's ' most wanted ' list for the past five years .
suspected of tax fraud and of taking nearly € 2 million -lrb- $ 2.4 million -rrb- in bribes in connection with the sale of 36 armored vehicles to saudi arabia , holger pfahls has been on the run from the german government .
on tuesday , police in paris tracked down the former defense official and apprehended him as he left his apartment .
the state prosecutor 's office in the southern german city of augsburg , where the charges were originally brought , confirmed the 62-year old had been arrested .
it is not clear yet when he will be extradicted . pfahls , who is accused of accepting bribes during the 1991 gulf war for helping german industrial giant thyssen obtain a government arms contract for delivering fuchs tanks to saudi arabia , disappeared in the late 1990s before he could be brought to court .
german interior minister otto schily welcomed pfahls ' arrest , saying it was " the result of the excellent work of german federal police -lrb- bka -rrb- . "
" for years , its investigators followed all possible leads .
this persevering work has now been rewarded , " he said .
high-level political scandal pfahls is also widely believed to be involved in the party slush-fund scandal that tainted former chancellor helmut kohl and his conservative christian democrats union .
state investigators allege that senior officials in kohl 's government , if not the chancellor himself , authorized the negotiations between pfahls and thyssen which were orchestrated by german-canadian arms dealer karl-heinz schreiber .
in 2002 , an augsburg state court found that two former managers at thyssen took millions of euros in bribes related to the delivery of the tanks , money they failed to declare to tax authorities .
schreiber , who also took a cut in the deal , was arrested in toronto in 1999 for tax evasion and is currently appealing extradition to germany .

pfahls himself has evaded arrest for five years .
initially bka investigators believed he had fled to the philippines , while the media reported he might be dead .
in recent press reports , however , it was reported that pfahls might be hiding in an upscale paris neighborhood .
the former deputy minister for defense was close to the late ultra-conservative bavarian state premier franz josef strauss and headed his state cabinet between 1981 and 1985 .

the former aide to ex-chancellor helmut kohl is wanted in connection with clandestine arms deals . he was on germany 's ' most wanted ' list for the past five years .
suspected of tax fraud and of taking nearly € 2 million -lrb- $ 2.4 million -rrb- in bribes in connection with the sale of 36 armored vehicles to saudi arabia , holger pfahls has been on the run from the german government .
on tuesday , police in paris tracked down the former defense official and apprehended him as he left his apartment .
the state prosecutor 's office in the southern german city of augsburg , where the charges were originally brought , confirmed the 62-year old had been arrested .
it is not clear yet when he will be extradicted . pfahls , who is accused of accepting bribes during the 1991 gulf war for helping german industrial giant thyssen obtain a government arms contract for delivering fuchs tanks to saudi arabia , disappeared in the late 1990s before he could be brought to court .

high-level political scandal pfahls is also widely believed to be involved in the party slush-fund scandal that tainted former chancellor helmut kohl and his conservative christian democrats union .
state investigators allege that senior officials in kohl 's government , if not the chancellor himself , authorized the negotiations between pfahls and thyssen which were orchestrated by german-canadian arms dealer karl-heinz schreiber .
in 2002 , an augsburg state court found that two former managers at thyssen took millions of euros in bribes related to the delivery of the tanks , money they failed to declare to tax authorities .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.07.2004 government calls for swift extradition of fallen politician großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french police found holger pfahls in this parisian neighborhood holger pfahls is considered a key figure in the political slush fund scandals of the christian democrats in the 1990s .
following his arrest , new light could be cast on one of germany 's biggest political scandals . german prosecutors on wednesday called for the immediate extradition of holger pfahls , who is suspected of accepting a bribe while serving as deputy defense minister under former conservative chancellor helmut kohl .
the state prosecutor 's office in augsburg said it would likely file an extradition application with french authorities by the end of the week .
french police arrested pfahls on tuesday as he left a paris apartment .
for five years , he had been on germany 's " most wanted " list , suspected of taking nearly € 2 million -lrb- $ 2.4 million -rrb- in bribes for helping german industrial giant thyssen obtain a government arms contract for delivering fuchs tanks to saudi arabia .
he is also widely believed to be involved in the party slush-fund scandal that tainted kohl and his conservative christian democratic union party .
state investigators in the bavarian city of augsburg allege that senior officials in kohl 's government , if not the chancellor himself , authorized the negotiations between pfahls and thyssen which were orchestrated by german-canadian arms dealer karl-heinz schreiber .
tentacles that touched crime after crime bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludwig-holger pfahls in addition to the tank bribes and slush fund scandal , pfahls -lrb- photo -rrb- is also under investigation by french authorities for his suspected involvement in the leuna refinery scandal .
the french federal prosecutor 's office said it suspects pfahls accepted a bribes from french oil giant elf-aquitaine when it purchased the east german refinery in the early 1990s .
if the french seek to pursue the investigation , it could delay or complicate pfahls ' extradition to germany .
prosecution documents in the 2003 elf trial in paris accuse pfahls of pocketing € 8 million of the € 40 million in commissions elf paid out as part of the purchase .
arrest came as surprise in germany , pfahls ' arrest could lead to a reopening of the slush fund investigation .
volker neumann , the man who chaired a parliamentary committee investigating pfahls before he disappeared , said the arrest came unexpectedly .
" mr. pfahls trail was lost in 1999 between taipei and hong kong , and then he disappeared , " neumann said .
" his arrest in france was a big surprise because we believed he was still in asia . "
neumann said pfahls might be able to explain why the alleged bribes flowed in the first place .
but he said the courts would have to be the first to take action .
" first , the courts have priority to bring him to trial for the charges already filed against him .
this concerns the supply of tanks to saudi arabia , " he said .
" whether other charges are brought is not yet clear , although the statute of limitations has expired for most of the allegations . "
however , the opposition christian democrats are refusing to reopen the commission 's work .
wolfgang bosbach , the deputy chairman of the cdu 's parliamentary group , told german public radio broadcaster deutschlandradio he did n't know what purpose a " reanimation " of the commission would serve .
" the ball is now in the court of justice , " bosbach said .
meanwhile , the ruling social democrats are taking a wait-and-see approach .
prosecutors first need to bring pfahls to germany , said spd chief hans müntefering .
" we 're just waiting , there 's no reason to move at a hectic pace , " he said . dw staff -lrb- gb / dsl / ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fugitive german defense official arrested for bribery french police on tuesday apprehended holger pfahls , who served as deputy defense minister from 1989 to 1992 .

following his arrest , new light could be cast on one of germany 's biggest political scandals . german prosecutors on wednesday called for the immediate extradition of holger pfahls , who is suspected of accepting a bribe while serving as deputy defense minister under former conservative chancellor helmut kohl .
the state prosecutor 's office in augsburg said it would likely file an extradition application with french authorities by the end of the week .
french police arrested pfahls on tuesday as he left a paris apartment .
for five years , he had been on germany 's " most wanted " list , suspected of taking nearly € 2 million -lrb- $ 2.4 million -rrb- in bribes for helping german industrial giant thyssen obtain a government arms contract for delivering fuchs tanks to saudi arabia .
he is also widely believed to be involved in the party slush-fund scandal that tainted kohl and his conservative christian democratic union party .
state investigators in the bavarian city of augsburg allege that senior officials in kohl 's government , if not the chancellor himself , authorized the negotiations between pfahls and thyssen which were orchestrated by german-canadian arms dealer karl-heinz schreiber .
tentacles that touched crime after crime bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludwig-holger pfahls in addition to the tank bribes and slush fund scandal , pfahls -lrb- photo -rrb- is also under investigation by french authorities for his suspected involvement in the leuna refinery scandal .
the french federal prosecutor 's office said it suspects pfahls accepted a bribes from french oil giant elf-aquitaine when it purchased the east german refinery in the early 1990s .
if the french seek to pursue the investigation , it could delay or complicate pfahls ' extradition to germany .
prosecution documents in the 2003 elf trial in paris accuse pfahls of pocketing € 8 million of the € 40 million in commissions elf paid out as part of the purchase .
arrest came as surprise in germany , pfahls ' arrest could lead to a reopening of the slush fund investigation .
volker neumann , the man who chaired a parliamentary committee investigating pfahls before he disappeared , said the arrest came unexpectedly .
" mr. pfahls trail was lost in 1999 between taipei and hong kong , and then he disappeared , " neumann said .
" his arrest in france was a big surprise because we believed he was still in asia . "
neumann said pfahls might be able to explain why the alleged bribes flowed in the first place .
but he said the courts would have to be the first to take action .
" first , the courts have priority to bring him to trial for the charges already filed against him .
this concerns the supply of tanks to saudi arabia , " he said .
" whether other charges are brought is not yet clear , although the statute of limitations has expired for most of the allegations . "
however , the opposition christian democrats are refusing to reopen the commission 's work .
wolfgang bosbach , the deputy chairman of the cdu 's parliamentary group , told german public radio broadcaster deutschlandradio he did n't know what purpose a " reanimation " of the commission would serve .
" the ball is now in the court of justice , " bosbach said .
meanwhile , the ruling social democrats are taking a wait-and-see approach .
prosecutors first need to bring pfahls to germany , said spd chief hans müntefering .
" we 're just waiting , there 's no reason to move at a hectic pace , " he said . dw staff -lrb- gb / dsl / ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fugitive german defense official arrested for bribery french police on tuesday apprehended holger pfahls , who served as deputy defense minister from 1989 to 1992 .

the growing aid business in germany alone , there are thousands of aid organizations whose business it is to help the needy at home and abroad .

the growing aid business in germany alone , there are thousands of aid organizations whose business it is to help the needy at home and abroad .
among them are state , half-state , religious and private organizations of all sizes .

unions are alarmed . when daimlerchrysler on tuesday told workers they would move 6,000 jobs from their main plant in southern germany elsewhere to save € 500 million -lrb- $ 617 million -rrb- , state union leader jörg hofmann saw red . the threats came just a few weeks after siemens forced the country 's powerful ig metall union into getting plant workers to work longer for no compensation .
siemens had threatened to move 2,000 jobs to hungary had ig metall not agreed to the 40-hour work week . " what is happening right now is dramatic , " hofmann , who heads ig metall in baden-württemberg told the tagesspiegel newspaper .
" siemens encouraged them to attack us . " " us " refers to around 6,000 workers at daimlerchrysler 's main production facilities in sindelfingen who could lose their jobs should unions and management fail to reach agreement on cost-cutting measures . not working long enough daimler management wants concessions from the unions on cutting payment bonuses workers currently earn for working afternoon and late shifts . workers at daimler 's plants in baden-württemberg work , on average , 30.1 hours a week , far too little for daimler management at a time when some german companies are beginning to re-introduce the 40-hour work week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new c-class as a result , daimler has threatened to move production of the c-class car -lrb- photo -rrb- normally built in sindelfingen to either bremen , where cars cost € 500 less to produce , or south africa .

following his arrest , new light could be cast on one of germany 's biggest political scandals . german prosecutors on wednesday called for the immediate extradition of holger pfahls , who is suspected of accepting a bribe while serving as deputy defense minister under former conservative chancellor helmut kohl .
the state prosecutor 's office in augsburg said it would likely file an extradition application with french authorities by the end of the week .
french police arrested pfahls on tuesday as he left a paris apartment .
for five years , he had been on germany 's " most wanted " list , suspected of taking nearly € 2 million -lrb- $ 2.4 million -rrb- in bribes for helping german industrial giant thyssen obtain a government arms contract for delivering fuchs tanks to saudi arabia .
he is also widely believed to be involved in the party slush-fund scandal that tainted kohl and his conservative christian democratic union party .
state investigators in the bavarian city of augsburg allege that senior officials in kohl 's government , if not the chancellor himself , authorized the negotiations between pfahls and thyssen which were orchestrated by german-canadian arms dealer karl-heinz schreiber .
tentacles that touched crime after crime bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludwig-holger pfahls in addition to the tank bribes and slush fund scandal , pfahls -lrb- photo -rrb- is also under investigation by french authorities for his suspected involvement in the leuna refinery scandal .
the french federal prosecutor 's office said it suspects pfahls accepted a bribes from french oil giant elf-aquitaine when it purchased the east german refinery in the early 1990s .
if the french seek to pursue the investigation , it could delay or complicate pfahls ' extradition to germany .
prosecution documents in the 2003 elf trial in paris accuse pfahls of pocketing € 8 million of the € 40 million in commissions elf paid out as part of the purchase .
arrest came as surprise in germany , pfahls ' arrest could lead to a reopening of the slush fund investigation .
volker neumann , the man who chaired a parliamentary committee investigating pfahls before he disappeared , said the arrest came unexpectedly .
" mr. pfahls trail was lost in 1999 between taipei and hong kong , and then he disappeared , " neumann said .
" his arrest in france was a big surprise because we believed he was still in asia . "
neumann said pfahls might be able to explain why the alleged bribes flowed in the first place .
but he said the courts would have to be the first to take action .
" first , the courts have priority to bring him to trial for the charges already filed against him .
this concerns the supply of tanks to saudi arabia , " he said .
" whether other charges are brought is not yet clear , although the statute of limitations has expired for most of the allegations . "
however , the opposition christian democrats are refusing to reopen the commission 's work .
wolfgang bosbach , the deputy chairman of the cdu 's parliamentary group , told german public radio broadcaster deutschlandradio he did n't know what purpose a " reanimation " of the commission would serve .
" the ball is now in the court of justice , " bosbach said .
meanwhile , the ruling social democrats are taking a wait-and-see approach .
prosecutors first need to bring pfahls to germany , said spd chief hans müntefering .

a model project shows that biomass created from farm and factory waste can produce energy for 1,000 homes . sven nevigmann , one of the workers at the loick biomass plant in the village of dorsten , is looking over the operation , which is filled with swine and other animals whose manure is combined with food and other organic substances to create biomass , which in turns makes biogas that can be used for energy production .
the biomass goes through several production processes here at the plant before it is ready for consumption .
biomass projects like this across germany are essential elements of the government 's plan to increase its reliance on renewable energies – including wind and solar power – to 12.5 percent of all electricity development by 2010 .
in the western german state of north rhine-westphalia , where the loick plant is located , about 6 percent of energy production already comes from renewable energy supplies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i 'm good eating and i can heat your home ! "
" we use about 12,000 tons of biomass a year , that is about 6,000 tons of manure , pig and cow manure , and renewable biomass , and about 6,000 tons of food waste and other biodegradable biomass , " said marcel hengst , supervisor at the loick plant .
fermenting the future at loick , manure is mixed with other organic materials that mostly come from a small company nearby that produces deep frozen vegetables .
what the company can ’ t use in its products is then sent to loick to make energy .
it is combined with pig and cow manure that is brought in from nearby farms .
along with these products , corn grown at the plant and food waste are also fed in stages through a number of processing tanks where the organic waste products are fermented .
this then produces biogas along with a rich fertilizer that is highly sought after by local farmers .
in total , the fermentation process takes about 25-30 days .
" this is a single-step fermentation process , " explains hengst , " the fermentation process can be divided into four steps , and those four steps take place in the digester , a 1,000 cubic meter facility that contains a tank that degrades the biomass into valuable fertilizer and biogas . "
the biogras is then placed in a so-called " co-generation unit " that combines heat and power to generate electricity .
the company is paid an attractive premium of about 10 euro cents a kilowatt hour for the electricity it produces from biomass .
a showcase project the loick plant , which is located on an operating farm owned by hubert loick and sponsored by the state of north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- and the fraunhofer institute for environmental , safety and energy technology , was opened in september 2001 as a demonstration facility for biomass technology .
bernd kunott of nrw ’ s ministry of research , says projects like loick are important elements of germany ’ s ambitious renewable energies strategy .
because it transforms waste into valuable energy , it is also innovative , he says .
" there is very much waste you can use for energy purposes .
this one produces energy , electricity for nearly 1,000 households with four persons . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a backhoe picks up chipped wood that is going to be used for biomass production .
because it relies fermentation to produce its energy , biomass also has a major advantage over other renewable energy sources : it is not dependant on the sun shining or the wind blowing to produce energy .
it also has great potential – the german agricultural ministry estimates that , across the country , more than 190 million tons of manure , along with 25 million tons of organic waste , are available for biomass production .
if only 50 percent of that figure were put to the production of electricity or heat , the ministry estimates , either 1.7 million german homes could be provided with heating or the entire electricity needs for 4 million homes could be covered .
helping farmers help themselves but biomass is still largely in its infancy in germany .
of the potential 200,000 biomass facilities that could be built in the country , there are currently only about 1,000 .
still , for farmers like loick , it ’ s an attractive proposition that can help expand the bottom line .
" a farmer can better calculate his annual earnings -lrb- by creating a biomass plant -rrb- , " north rhine-westphalia environment minister bärbel höhn recently said .

a model project shows that biomass created from farm and factory waste can produce energy for 1,000 homes . sven nevigmann , one of the workers at the loick biomass plant in the village of dorsten , is looking over the operation , which is filled with swine and other animals whose manure is combined with food and other organic substances to create biomass , which in turns makes biogas that can be used for energy production .
the biomass goes through several production processes here at the plant before it is ready for consumption .
biomass projects like this across germany are essential elements of the government 's plan to increase its reliance on renewable energies – including wind and solar power – to 12.5 percent of all electricity development by 2010 .
in the western german state of north rhine-westphalia , where the loick plant is located , about 6 percent of energy production already comes from renewable energy supplies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i 'm good eating and i can heat your home ! "
" we use about 12,000 tons of biomass a year , that is about 6,000 tons of manure , pig and cow manure , and renewable biomass , and about 6,000 tons of food waste and other biodegradable biomass , " said marcel hengst , supervisor at the loick plant .
fermenting the future at loick , manure is mixed with other organic materials that mostly come from a small company nearby that produces deep frozen vegetables .
what the company can ’ t use in its products is then sent to loick to make energy .
it is combined with pig and cow manure that is brought in from nearby farms .
along with these products , corn grown at the plant and food waste are also fed in stages through a number of processing tanks where the organic waste products are fermented .
this then produces biogas along with a rich fertilizer that is highly sought after by local farmers .
in total , the fermentation process takes about 25-30 days .
" this is a single-step fermentation process , " explains hengst , " the fermentation process can be divided into four steps , and those four steps take place in the digester , a 1,000 cubic meter facility that contains a tank that degrades the biomass into valuable fertilizer and biogas . "
the biogras is then placed in a so-called " co-generation unit " that combines heat and power to generate electricity .
the company is paid an attractive premium of about 10 euro cents a kilowatt hour for the electricity it produces from biomass .
a showcase project the loick plant , which is located on an operating farm owned by hubert loick and sponsored by the state of north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- and the fraunhofer institute for environmental , safety and energy technology , was opened in september 2001 as a demonstration facility for biomass technology .
bernd kunott of nrw ’ s ministry of research , says projects like loick are important elements of germany ’ s ambitious renewable energies strategy .
because it transforms waste into valuable energy , it is also innovative , he says .
" there is very much waste you can use for energy purposes .
this one produces energy , electricity for nearly 1,000 households with four persons . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a backhoe picks up chipped wood that is going to be used for biomass production .
because it relies fermentation to produce its energy , biomass also has a major advantage over other renewable energy sources : it is not dependant on the sun shining or the wind blowing to produce energy .
it also has great potential – the german agricultural ministry estimates that , across the country , more than 190 million tons of manure , along with 25 million tons of organic waste , are available for biomass production .
if only 50 percent of that figure were put to the production of electricity or heat , the ministry estimates , either 1.7 million german homes could be provided with heating or the entire electricity needs for 4 million homes could be covered .
helping farmers help themselves but biomass is still largely in its infancy in germany .
of the potential 200,000 biomass facilities that could be built in the country , there are currently only about 1,000 .
still , for farmers like loick , it ’ s an attractive proposition that can help expand the bottom line .
" a farmer can better calculate his annual earnings -lrb- by creating a biomass plant -rrb- , " north rhine-westphalia environment minister bärbel höhn recently said .

the former aide to ex-chancellor helmut kohl is wanted in connection with clandestine arms deals . he was on germany 's ' most wanted ' list for the past five years .
suspected of tax fraud and of taking nearly € 2 million -lrb- $ 2.4 million -rrb- in bribes in connection with the sale of 36 armored vehicles to saudi arabia , holger pfahls has been on the run from the german government .
on tuesday , police in paris tracked down the former defense official and apprehended him as he left his apartment .
the state prosecutor 's office in the southern german city of augsburg , where the charges were originally brought , confirmed the 62-year old had been arrested .
it is not clear yet when he will be extradicted . pfahls , who is accused of accepting bribes during the 1991 gulf war for helping german industrial giant thyssen obtain a government arms contract for delivering fuchs tanks to saudi arabia , disappeared in the late 1990s before he could be brought to court .
german interior minister otto schily welcomed pfahls ' arrest , saying it was " the result of the excellent work of german federal police -lrb- bka -rrb- . "
" for years , its investigators followed all possible leads .
this persevering work has now been rewarded , " he said .
high-level political scandal pfahls is also widely believed to be involved in the party slush-fund scandal that tainted former chancellor helmut kohl and his conservative christian democrats union .
state investigators allege that senior officials in kohl 's government , if not the chancellor himself , authorized the negotiations between pfahls and thyssen which were orchestrated by german-canadian arms dealer karl-heinz schreiber .
in 2002 , an augsburg state court found that two former managers at thyssen took millions of euros in bribes related to the delivery of the tanks , money they failed to declare to tax authorities .
schreiber , who also took a cut in the deal , was arrested in toronto in 1999 for tax evasion and is currently appealing extradition to germany .

pfahls himself has evaded arrest for five years .
initially bka investigators believed he had fled to the philippines , while the media reported he might be dead .
in recent press reports , however , it was reported that pfahls might be hiding in an upscale paris neighborhood .
the former deputy minister for defense was close to the late ultra-conservative bavarian state premier franz josef strauss and headed his state cabinet between 1981 and 1985 .
before entering kohl 's administration , pfahls directed the former west german domestic intelligence agency . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de how corrupt is germany ?

a model project shows that biomass created from farm and factory waste can produce energy for 1,000 homes . sven nevigmann , one of the workers at the loick biomass plant in the village of dorsten , is looking over the operation , which is filled with swine and other animals whose manure is combined with food and other organic substances to create biomass , which in turns makes biogas that can be used for energy production .
the biomass goes through several production processes here at the plant before it is ready for consumption .
biomass projects like this across germany are essential elements of the government 's plan to increase its reliance on renewable energies – including wind and solar power – to 12.5 percent of all electricity development by 2010 .
in the western german state of north rhine-westphalia , where the loick plant is located , about 6 percent of energy production already comes from renewable energy supplies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i 'm good eating and i can heat your home ! "
" we use about 12,000 tons of biomass a year , that is about 6,000 tons of manure , pig and cow manure , and renewable biomass , and about 6,000 tons of food waste and other biodegradable biomass , " said marcel hengst , supervisor at the loick plant .
fermenting the future at loick , manure is mixed with other organic materials that mostly come from a small company nearby that produces deep frozen vegetables .
what the company can ’ t use in its products is then sent to loick to make energy .
it is combined with pig and cow manure that is brought in from nearby farms .
along with these products , corn grown at the plant and food waste are also fed in stages through a number of processing tanks where the organic waste products are fermented .
this then produces biogas along with a rich fertilizer that is highly sought after by local farmers .
in total , the fermentation process takes about 25-30 days .
" this is a single-step fermentation process , " explains hengst , " the fermentation process can be divided into four steps , and those four steps take place in the digester , a 1,000 cubic meter facility that contains a tank that degrades the biomass into valuable fertilizer and biogas . "
the biogras is then placed in a so-called " co-generation unit " that combines heat and power to generate electricity .
the company is paid an attractive premium of about 10 euro cents a kilowatt hour for the electricity it produces from biomass .
a showcase project the loick plant , which is located on an operating farm owned by hubert loick and sponsored by the state of north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- and the fraunhofer institute for environmental , safety and energy technology , was opened in september 2001 as a demonstration facility for biomass technology .
bernd kunott of nrw ’ s ministry of research , says projects like loick are important elements of germany ’ s ambitious renewable energies strategy .
because it transforms waste into valuable energy , it is also innovative , he says .
" there is very much waste you can use for energy purposes .
this one produces energy , electricity for nearly 1,000 households with four persons . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a backhoe picks up chipped wood that is going to be used for biomass production .
because it relies fermentation to produce its energy , biomass also has a major advantage over other renewable energy sources : it is not dependant on the sun shining or the wind blowing to produce energy .
it also has great potential – the german agricultural ministry estimates that , across the country , more than 190 million tons of manure , along with 25 million tons of organic waste , are available for biomass production .
if only 50 percent of that figure were put to the production of electricity or heat , the ministry estimates , either 1.7 million german homes could be provided with heating or the entire electricity needs for 4 million homes could be covered .
helping farmers help themselves but biomass is still largely in its infancy in germany .
of the potential 200,000 biomass facilities that could be built in the country , there are currently only about 1,000 .
still , for farmers like loick , it ’ s an attractive proposition that can help expand the bottom line .
" a farmer can better calculate his annual earnings -lrb- by creating a biomass plant -rrb- , " north rhine-westphalia environment minister bärbel höhn recently said .
" the idea of making a farmer an energy producer is a realistic perspective .

" we use about 12,000 tons of biomass a year , that is about 6,000 tons of manure , pig and cow manure , and renewable biomass , and about 6,000 tons of food waste and other biodegradable biomass , " said marcel hengst , supervisor at the loick plant .
fermenting the future at loick , manure is mixed with other organic materials that mostly come from a small company nearby that produces deep frozen vegetables .
what the company can ’ t use in its products is then sent to loick to make energy .
it is combined with pig and cow manure that is brought in from nearby farms .
along with these products , corn grown at the plant and food waste are also fed in stages through a number of processing tanks where the organic waste products are fermented .
this then produces biogas along with a rich fertilizer that is highly sought after by local farmers .
in total , the fermentation process takes about 25-30 days .
" this is a single-step fermentation process , " explains hengst , " the fermentation process can be divided into four steps , and those four steps take place in the digester , a 1,000 cubic meter facility that contains a tank that degrades the biomass into valuable fertilizer and biogas . "
the biogras is then placed in a so-called " co-generation unit " that combines heat and power to generate electricity .
the company is paid an attractive premium of about 10 euro cents a kilowatt hour for the electricity it produces from biomass .
a showcase project the loick plant , which is located on an operating farm owned by hubert loick and sponsored by the state of north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- and the fraunhofer institute for environmental , safety and energy technology , was opened in september 2001 as a demonstration facility for biomass technology .
bernd kunott of nrw ’ s ministry of research , says projects like loick are important elements of germany ’ s ambitious renewable energies strategy .
because it transforms waste into valuable energy , it is also innovative , he says .
" there is very much waste you can use for energy purposes .
this one produces energy , electricity for nearly 1,000 households with four persons . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a backhoe picks up chipped wood that is going to be used for biomass production .
because it relies fermentation to produce its energy , biomass also has a major advantage over other renewable energy sources : it is not dependant on the sun shining or the wind blowing to produce energy .
it also has great potential – the german agricultural ministry estimates that , across the country , more than 190 million tons of manure , along with 25 million tons of organic waste , are available for biomass production .
if only 50 percent of that figure were put to the production of electricity or heat , the ministry estimates , either 1.7 million german homes could be provided with heating or the entire electricity needs for 4 million homes could be covered .
helping farmers help themselves but biomass is still largely in its infancy in germany .
of the potential 200,000 biomass facilities that could be built in the country , there are currently only about 1,000 .
still , for farmers like loick , it ’ s an attractive proposition that can help expand the bottom line .

following his arrest , new light could be cast on one of germany 's biggest political scandals . german prosecutors on wednesday called for the immediate extradition of holger pfahls , who is suspected of accepting a bribe while serving as deputy defense minister under former conservative chancellor helmut kohl .
the state prosecutor 's office in augsburg said it would likely file an extradition application with french authorities by the end of the week .
french police arrested pfahls on tuesday as he left a paris apartment .
for five years , he had been on germany 's " most wanted " list , suspected of taking nearly € 2 million -lrb- $ 2.4 million -rrb- in bribes for helping german industrial giant thyssen obtain a government arms contract for delivering fuchs tanks to saudi arabia .
he is also widely believed to be involved in the party slush-fund scandal that tainted kohl and his conservative christian democratic union party .
state investigators in the bavarian city of augsburg allege that senior officials in kohl 's government , if not the chancellor himself , authorized the negotiations between pfahls and thyssen which were orchestrated by german-canadian arms dealer karl-heinz schreiber .

" mr. pfahls trail was lost in 1999 between taipei and hong kong , and then he disappeared , " neumann said .
" his arrest in france was a big surprise because we believed he was still in asia . "
neumann said pfahls might be able to explain why the alleged bribes flowed in the first place .
but he said the courts would have to be the first to take action .
" first , the courts have priority to bring him to trial for the charges already filed against him .
this concerns the supply of tanks to saudi arabia , " he said .

the winner will represent germany at the world championships in finland . it 's standing room only tonight at the knorre in berlin .
about 200 people are sitting , standing or huddling body to body at the berlin culture center , with its bar-like atmosphere .
the crowd , hungry for scandalous behavior , is ready to see some sweating and passion at the first-ever national air guitar championship .
the winner will receive an air mattress and a flight to finland , where he or she will represent germany at the ninth-annual air guitar world championship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mark böhmer has winning on his mind tonight there are 14 air guitarists who have dared to make their way to the small stage in an effort to win over the audience and the judges .
" i 'm going to win , obviously , " says mark böhmer -lrb- photo -rrb- , 29 , who 's driven in from hanover to participate .
when he is n't strumming a make-believe guitar , böhmer normally plays the drums , but for the championships in berlin , he 's " playing " a double necked guitar with acoustic strings on one neck and electric strings on the other .
he 's been training for months for the big night : he 's been walking , he 's toned his biceps and he 's done finger exercises .
yet despite all that preparation , he says his performance tonight will mostly be spontaneous , " with the exception of two or three small things i 've put in my program .
instead i 'm going to just look and see what 's happening on stage and what the atmosphere is like . "
when asked if , like in the real world of rock and roll , drugs play an important part in his work , böhmer nods .
" a huge role , " he says , " but i ca n't tell you anything else about that .
but obviously you have to have a beer or two " before going on stage .
it 's an understatement that will be highlighted by events later in the evening .
fighting for world peace before the show , competition organizer friedericke van meer is being chased down by microphone brandishing journalists .
six months ago , the transsexual founded the german air guitar federation with a group of friends .
" i just randomly came across the world association 's web site and was really impressed with what i saw there , especially that air guitar is , in part , a service for world peace , " she explains .
" i was also very interested in the mix between seriousness and self-irony .
i 've never found that kind of mix anywhere else . "
an emcee clad in a velvet pin-striped and a pink-frilled shirt explains the rules and history of the air guitar to the audience , which is already growing impatient .
each contestant gets 60 seconds to persuade the audience .
" the decisive factors are the overall artistic impression , the visual presentation , technical ability , the song , everything .
you can , of course , influence the judges through your applause , " he explained .
the three-member jury , comprised of has-been german musicians , awards each contestant with between four and six points .
14 air guitarists give their all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this audience is hungry for scandalous behavior !
after a short performance by a real , e.g. live , band , it 's finally time for the competition .
" hell sinki , " is the first air guitarist to enter the stage .
he 's got a beer in his hand , which he slowly imbibes before starting his performance .
the man in his late 20s sporting a haircut not unlike members of the british band oasis , abuses his imaginary guitar to powerful rock ' n ' roll riffs , his fingers unrhythmically running over the imaginary strings .
he jumps into the air , then slams back down to the ground .
at the end of his performance , he falls off the stage to howls from the audience .
but the jury is stingier with its praise , giving him a 5.7 , 5.5 and a 5.4 .
more embarrassingly good performances follow .
" echodrive , " an older guy , is hopping around the stage chaotically , unaided by the pink floyd music he 's supposed to be accompanying .
with horn-rimmed glasses , an undershirt and red swimming trunks , he fiddles around for most of his performance with his fantasy amplifier which keeps making interference sounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : move over buddy holly , this is our new guitar hiro .
but there are also some highlights , like hiro , a young japanese guy who quickly becomes a crowd favorite .
dressed in a tie , pressed pants and designer glasses , his face is washed over in an ecstatic look as he performs .
then he turns his back to the audience and begins waggling his ass .
by the time he starts wriggling with his fake guitar on the stage floor , it appears he 's already clinched the title .
the stage is then covered in a hail storm of bras and tissues .
when the jury just gives him medium marks , booing fills the hall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i guess i should n't drink before the show next time . "
next up is mark böhmer , the cocky dude from hanover .
for the event , he 's brought along a roadie , who first tests out the guitar .
donning a wife-beater undershirt , böhmer launches into an air guitar version of " delay nuclear " by the hives .
he competently strums his instrument , rolls around on the floor and gets down on his knees .
it 's a powerful performance , but this crowd is not easily pleased .
" you 're an inbred , " yells one member of the audience .
the judges each give him a 5.7 - not bad , but still not enough .
" it did n't go all that well , " he says .
" i would have thought that the jury would have concentrated more on stylistic things or creativity .
but i had the feeling that the most important things to them were appearance and fun factor . "
but soon enough he 's laughing again .
" next time i know that i ca n't drink anything before the performance , otherwise i 'll forget how the song goes . "
the accidental champion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german air guitar champion ingo schulz : i 'm too sexy for my shirt !
one candidate first decided to join the competition when he got to the hall .
ingo schulz -lrb- photo -rrb- , a 33-year-old from berlin , says he did n't even know he was coming here tonight .
he says he did n't feel like going to a disco with techno or house music .
instead , the businessman decided to come here , but only as a spectator .
but then he thought , " why not ? "
he chose a song by ac / dc and grabbed his " guitar . "
with jeans and a checkered shirt he does a mean angus young impersonation , licking his instrument with his tongue and pulling at the strings .
it 's an exceptional performance - pure , honest and without any twaddle .
the jury then crowns schulz the german championship , and this time the audience has no objections .
" when i play songs from ac / dc , " schulz explains , " i get the feeling that the 10 meters that separated me from angus young at his last berlin concert are a lot smaller .
i feel like the music is alive again , and not just for me .
if it pleases the audience , then it 's even better . "
he 's also got a pretty laid back attitude about representing germany at the world championships in finland next month .
" i 'm definitely going to do ac / dc again , " he says .
" i do n't know if it will be the same song .
so , now it 's time to go to finland for world peace . " andreas leixnering -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links air guitar world championships the official web site of the air guitar world 's premier event .

" i 'm going to win , obviously , " says mark böhmer -lrb- photo -rrb- , 29 , who 's driven in from hanover to participate .
when he is n't strumming a make-believe guitar , böhmer normally plays the drums , but for the championships in berlin , he 's " playing " a double necked guitar with acoustic strings on one neck and electric strings on the other .
he 's been training for months for the big night : he 's been walking , he 's toned his biceps and he 's done finger exercises .
yet despite all that preparation , he says his performance tonight will mostly be spontaneous , " with the exception of two or three small things i 've put in my program .
instead i 'm going to just look and see what 's happening on stage and what the atmosphere is like . "
when asked if , like in the real world of rock and roll , drugs play an important part in his work , böhmer nods .
" a huge role , " he says , " but i ca n't tell you anything else about that .
but obviously you have to have a beer or two " before going on stage .
it 's an understatement that will be highlighted by events later in the evening .
fighting for world peace before the show , competition organizer friedericke van meer is being chased down by microphone brandishing journalists .
six months ago , the transsexual founded the german air guitar federation with a group of friends .
" i just randomly came across the world association 's web site and was really impressed with what i saw there , especially that air guitar is , in part , a service for world peace , " she explains .
" i was also very interested in the mix between seriousness and self-irony .
i 've never found that kind of mix anywhere else . "
an emcee clad in a velvet pin-striped and a pink-frilled shirt explains the rules and history of the air guitar to the audience , which is already growing impatient .
each contestant gets 60 seconds to persuade the audience .
" the decisive factors are the overall artistic impression , the visual presentation , technical ability , the song , everything .
you can , of course , influence the judges through your applause , " he explained .
the three-member jury , comprised of has-been german musicians , awards each contestant with between four and six points .
14 air guitarists give their all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this audience is hungry for scandalous behavior !
after a short performance by a real , e.g. live , band , it 's finally time for the competition .
" hell sinki , " is the first air guitarist to enter the stage .
he 's got a beer in his hand , which he slowly imbibes before starting his performance .
the man in his late 20s sporting a haircut not unlike members of the british band oasis , abuses his imaginary guitar to powerful rock ' n ' roll riffs , his fingers unrhythmically running over the imaginary strings .
he jumps into the air , then slams back down to the ground .
at the end of his performance , he falls off the stage to howls from the audience .
but the jury is stingier with its praise , giving him a 5.7 , 5.5 and a 5.4 .
more embarrassingly good performances follow .
" echodrive , " an older guy , is hopping around the stage chaotically , unaided by the pink floyd music he 's supposed to be accompanying .
with horn-rimmed glasses , an undershirt and red swimming trunks , he fiddles around for most of his performance with his fantasy amplifier which keeps making interference sounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : move over buddy holly , this is our new guitar hiro .
but there are also some highlights , like hiro , a young japanese guy who quickly becomes a crowd favorite .
dressed in a tie , pressed pants and designer glasses , his face is washed over in an ecstatic look as he performs .
then he turns his back to the audience and begins waggling his ass .
by the time he starts wriggling with his fake guitar on the stage floor , it appears he 's already clinched the title .
the stage is then covered in a hail storm of bras and tissues .
when the jury just gives him medium marks , booing fills the hall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i guess i should n't drink before the show next time . "
next up is mark böhmer , the cocky dude from hanover .
for the event , he 's brought along a roadie , who first tests out the guitar .
donning a wife-beater undershirt , böhmer launches into an air guitar version of " delay nuclear " by the hives .
he competently strums his instrument , rolls around on the floor and gets down on his knees .
it 's a powerful performance , but this crowd is not easily pleased .
" you 're an inbred , " yells one member of the audience .
the judges each give him a 5.7 - not bad , but still not enough .
" it did n't go all that well , " he says .
" i would have thought that the jury would have concentrated more on stylistic things or creativity .
but i had the feeling that the most important things to them were appearance and fun factor . "
but soon enough he 's laughing again .
" next time i know that i ca n't drink anything before the performance , otherwise i 'll forget how the song goes . "
the accidental champion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german air guitar champion ingo schulz : i 'm too sexy for my shirt !
one candidate first decided to join the competition when he got to the hall .
ingo schulz -lrb- photo -rrb- , a 33-year-old from berlin , says he did n't even know he was coming here tonight .
he says he did n't feel like going to a disco with techno or house music .
instead , the businessman decided to come here , but only as a spectator .
but then he thought , " why not ? "
he chose a song by ac / dc and grabbed his " guitar . "
with jeans and a checkered shirt he does a mean angus young impersonation , licking his instrument with his tongue and pulling at the strings .
it 's an exceptional performance - pure , honest and without any twaddle .
the jury then crowns schulz the german championship , and this time the audience has no objections .
" when i play songs from ac / dc , " schulz explains , " i get the feeling that the 10 meters that separated me from angus young at his last berlin concert are a lot smaller .
i feel like the music is alive again , and not just for me .
if it pleases the audience , then it 's even better . "
he 's also got a pretty laid back attitude about representing germany at the world championships in finland next month .
" i 'm definitely going to do ac / dc again , " he says .
" i do n't know if it will be the same song .
so , now it 's time to go to finland for world peace . " andreas leixnering -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links air guitar world championships the official web site of the air guitar world 's premier event .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 14.07.2004 -pipe- 14:00 utc no new savings measures , eichel promises german finance minister hans eichel said he has no plans to introduce additional savings measures in the wake of a ruling by the european court of justice on germany 's inflated budget deficit .
" additional savings plans or tax increases would be counter-productive and damaging , they would endanger our economic recovery , " eichel wrote in an article published in the german business daily handelsblatt on wednesday .
the eu court overturned a decision last year to exempt germany and france from fines for overstepping eurozone budget deficit limits .
eichel said he is sticking to plans to inject around € 15 billion -lrb- $ 18.6 billion -rrb- into the 2005 budget through privatizations in order to keep new debt in check .
eichel welcomed what he said was a " wise ruling " by the eu court , and said that germany is no closer to sanctions than it was before .
according to a report in the financial times deutschland , the eu is working on recommendations as to how germany and france can keep their deficits in 2005 under the 3 percent of gdp limit set by the eu 's growth and stability pact , without incurring sanctions . dw-world.de court annulls eu stability pact suspension the european court of justice ruled against a decision by the eu council of finance ministers that had suspended excessive deficit measures launched against france and germany .

the announcement coincided with a renewed international debate to reform the un 's enforcement arm in maintaining international peace and security . with the security council 's five permanent veto-wielding members - france , england , america , china and russia - still representing the world of 1945 , there is broad agreement that an overhaul is overdue . while a revamp is being hotly debated within the un , germany is already drumming up support for its bid for a permanent seat .
with a two-thirds majority of the 191-member un general assembly required to pass any kind of reform resolution , germany is not just lobbying the global heavyweights but even smaller countries . " working towards the same goal " the most recent campaign offensive involves a ten-day tour of south asia by german foreign minister joschka fischer .
stops include india , china , pakistan , bangladesh and sri lanka . fischer became the first european leader to visit the newly-elected congress government and the new indian prime minister manmohan singh on wednesday .
the two sides confirmed they would support each other in their attempts to get permanent un security council seats . in the run-up to the meeting , experts agreed the german bid would find acceptance in india .
not least because new delhi has made no secret of its own ambition to seek a spot in the powerful club . a further reason , said some , are the smooth ties the two countries enjoy . " there 's nothing negative in their relationship , no conflict of interest , so the two could really work together towards the same goal , " anuradha chenoy , international relations expert at new delhi 's jawaharlal nehru university told dw-world . indeed , the indo-german relationship , traditionally close , has grown stronger since german reunification and india 's economic reform process in the 1990s .
trade and investment have picked up in recent years along with deepening cooperation in the fields of science and technology . last year , former german president johannes rau endorsed a permanent indian seat on the security council during a visit to india . a common stance on iraq bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shakti 3 , one of four nuclear test sites in the thar desert .
india conducted five nculear tests in may 1998 .
though india 's nuclear tests in 1998 -lrb- photo -rrb- , tensions with pakistan following the attack on the indian parliament in 2001 and , most recently , a flare-up of religious violence in the western state of gujarat in 2002 have cast a shadow on bilateral relations , experts said there has n't been any lasting damage . they instead pointed out that the two countries ' similar position on recent world events is an indication that the two could complement each other in their bid for permanent security council seats . " after the sept .
11 attacks , there was a shift in the foreign policies of many countries .
both india and germany refused to go along with the us , reflecting a common thinking , " said chenoy , adding that the recent change in the indian government would also boost chances of the two working in tandem .
" the hindu nationalists in the last government pursued a more militaristic , chauvinist foreign policy .
the congress is more moderate . " subrata mitra , head of the political science department at heidelberg 's south asia institute , stressed that india 's traditional role as leader of the non-aligned movement -lrb- an international organization of over 100 states which consider themselves not formally aligned with or against any major power bloc -rrb- would be strengthened if it got in with germany on the security council . " in its search for a new global role , india views germany , which has shown itself to be balanced and neutral , as an important western partner , " mitra said .
" a german-indian axis in the security council would provide an important and much-needed voice in a multi-polar world . " promising candidates while both nations have the backing of various countries for their bids , the position of the single-most powerful member of the security council - the us - is still unknown . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers in belet huen , somalia , on a united nations peacekeeping mission in 1993 .
still , analysts agreed that both countries stand a good chance of getting what they want .
germany is already the third-largest contributor to the un budget and the largest troop-contributor to peacekeeping missions from the balkans to the hindukush . though india has also been active in un peacekeeping missions , the reform debate focusing largely on the need for the security council to be more globally representative is expected to speak in its favor . " the outdated security council has to reflect the current world reality and include countries of the third world .
by that measure , india - the world 's largest democracy and second-most populous nation - is a leading candidate , " said un expert günther unser . what about pakistan ? some , however , warned that considering india to be a " natural choice " could prove dangerous for the stability of the south asian region - a further topic of discussion during fischer 's visit . hans maull , who holds the chair for foreign policy and international relations at the university of trier said pakistan , with whom india has thrice gone to war , was the key . " german foreign policy towards india should be positive , " he said .
" but its endorsement of the indian bid is not going to please pakistan .
if it 's angry that india gets in , it could endanger the security of the region , " maull said . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de summit endorses reforms to strengthen u.n. chancellor schröder on friday pushed for a permanent german seat on the u.n. security council at the eu-latin america summit , that urged the u.s. to drop its go-it-alone stance and stressed the need for u.n. reform .

the announcement coincided with a renewed international debate to reform the un 's enforcement arm in maintaining international peace and security . with the security council 's five permanent veto-wielding members - france , england , america , china and russia - still representing the world of 1945 , there is broad agreement that an overhaul is overdue . while a revamp is being hotly debated within the un , germany is already drumming up support for its bid for a permanent seat .
with a two-thirds majority of the 191-member un general assembly required to pass any kind of reform resolution , germany is not just lobbying the global heavyweights but even smaller countries . " working towards the same goal " the most recent campaign offensive involves a ten-day tour of south asia by german foreign minister joschka fischer .
stops include india , china , pakistan , bangladesh and sri lanka . fischer became the first european leader to visit the newly-elected congress government and the new indian prime minister manmohan singh on wednesday .
the two sides confirmed they would support each other in their attempts to get permanent un security council seats . in the run-up to the meeting , experts agreed the german bid would find acceptance in india .
not least because new delhi has made no secret of its own ambition to seek a spot in the powerful club . a further reason , said some , are the smooth ties the two countries enjoy . " there 's nothing negative in their relationship , no conflict of interest , so the two could really work together towards the same goal , " anuradha chenoy , international relations expert at new delhi 's jawaharlal nehru university told dw-world . indeed , the indo-german relationship , traditionally close , has grown stronger since german reunification and india 's economic reform process in the 1990s .
trade and investment have picked up in recent years along with deepening cooperation in the fields of science and technology . last year , former german president johannes rau endorsed a permanent indian seat on the security council during a visit to india . a common stance on iraq bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shakti 3 , one of four nuclear test sites in the thar desert .
india conducted five nculear tests in may 1998 .
though india 's nuclear tests in 1998 -lrb- photo -rrb- , tensions with pakistan following the attack on the indian parliament in 2001 and , most recently , a flare-up of religious violence in the western state of gujarat in 2002 have cast a shadow on bilateral relations , experts said there has n't been any lasting damage . they instead pointed out that the two countries ' similar position on recent world events is an indication that the two could complement each other in their bid for permanent security council seats . " after the sept .
11 attacks , there was a shift in the foreign policies of many countries .
both india and germany refused to go along with the us , reflecting a common thinking , " said chenoy , adding that the recent change in the indian government would also boost chances of the two working in tandem .
" the hindu nationalists in the last government pursued a more militaristic , chauvinist foreign policy .
the congress is more moderate . " subrata mitra , head of the political science department at heidelberg 's south asia institute , stressed that india 's traditional role as leader of the non-aligned movement -lrb- an international organization of over 100 states which consider themselves not formally aligned with or against any major power bloc -rrb- would be strengthened if it got in with germany on the security council . " in its search for a new global role , india views germany , which has shown itself to be balanced and neutral , as an important western partner , " mitra said .
" a german-indian axis in the security council would provide an important and much-needed voice in a multi-polar world . " promising candidates while both nations have the backing of various countries for their bids , the position of the single-most powerful member of the security council - the us - is still unknown . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers in belet huen , somalia , on a united nations peacekeeping mission in 1993 .
still , analysts agreed that both countries stand a good chance of getting what they want .
germany is already the third-largest contributor to the un budget and the largest troop-contributor to peacekeeping missions from the balkans to the hindukush . though india has also been active in un peacekeeping missions , the reform debate focusing largely on the need for the security council to be more globally representative is expected to speak in its favor . " the outdated security council has to reflect the current world reality and include countries of the third world .
by that measure , india - the world 's largest democracy and second-most populous nation - is a leading candidate , " said un expert günther unser . what about pakistan ? some , however , warned that considering india to be a " natural choice " could prove dangerous for the stability of the south asian region - a further topic of discussion during fischer 's visit . hans maull , who holds the chair for foreign policy and international relations at the university of trier said pakistan , with whom india has thrice gone to war , was the key . " german foreign policy towards india should be positive , " he said .
" but its endorsement of the indian bid is not going to please pakistan .
if it 's angry that india gets in , it could endanger the security of the region , " maull said . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de summit endorses reforms to strengthen u.n. chancellor schröder on friday pushed for a permanent german seat on the u.n. security council at the eu-latin america summit , that urged the u.s. to drop its go-it-alone stance and stressed the need for u.n. reform .

it could raise further uncomfortable questions for beleaguered british prime minister tony blair . the five- person committee headed by lord butler was set up by the british government to review the quality of intelligence about weapons of mass destruction .
the group is meant to be independent and therefore is not expected to hold back with criticism for the sake of political allegiances . the so-called “ butler report ” comes just a few days after a us senate intelligence committee inquiry concluded that most of the cia 's claims on saddam hussein 's alleged arsenal were overstated or unsupported . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair the key issue for british prime minister , tony blair , will be whether the report finds that his government put any pressure on intelligence services to overestimate the risk posed by former iraqi dictator saddam hussein . the stakes for blair are high .
the butler report will deal in depth with british intelligence about weapons of mass destruction in iraq before the war . blair based his case for war on the confident assertion that saddam hussein had stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons and was a " serious and current threat . " but the iraq survey group , the team that has been scouring iraq for those weapons , has yet to find anything .
last week , blair acknowledged that wmd may never be found . iraq better off today on tuesday tony blair refused to comment about the butler report before it was made public and instead focused on the improvements in iraq , again putting this progress forward as his new justification for the war .

" i think that it is very difficult to look at iraq today , look at iraq under saddam , and say that we ’ d be better off , the world would be safer , we ’ d be more secure , if saddam was still in charge of iraq . " did blair put pressure intelligence ? lord butler ’ s committee did its work behind closed doors and has made few statements about how it has been progressing .
media speculation about what the findings of the butler report might be has been intense . tony blair got an advance copy of the report on tuesday and so will be ready to respond to the findings .
the findings could reflect badly on blair . in particular the report might say his government pressured intelligence services in some way to overestimate the risk posed by iraq or misrepresented that risk .

it could raise further uncomfortable questions for beleaguered british prime minister tony blair . the five- person committee headed by lord butler was set up by the british government to review the quality of intelligence about weapons of mass destruction .
the group is meant to be independent and therefore is not expected to hold back with criticism for the sake of political allegiances . the so-called “ butler report ” comes just a few days after a us senate intelligence committee inquiry concluded that most of the cia 's claims on saddam hussein 's alleged arsenal were overstated or unsupported . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair the key issue for british prime minister , tony blair , will be whether the report finds that his government put any pressure on intelligence services to overestimate the risk posed by former iraqi dictator saddam hussein . the stakes for blair are high .
the butler report will deal in depth with british intelligence about weapons of mass destruction in iraq before the war . blair based his case for war on the confident assertion that saddam hussein had stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons and was a " serious and current threat . " but the iraq survey group , the team that has been scouring iraq for those weapons , has yet to find anything .
last week , blair acknowledged that wmd may never be found . iraq better off today on tuesday tony blair refused to comment about the butler report before it was made public and instead focused on the improvements in iraq , again putting this progress forward as his new justification for the war . " i think it is very hard to look at iraq today , see the country with , yes all the problems from terrorism , but with an internationally backed government that will eventually lead to a properly elected democratic government , a country that can be a stable partner in the international community , a country that can make use of the enormous wealth that it has , " blair said . " i think that it is very difficult to look at iraq today , look at iraq under saddam , and say that we ’ d be better off , the world would be safer , we ’ d be more secure , if saddam was still in charge of iraq . " did blair put pressure intelligence ? lord butler ’ s committee did its work behind closed doors and has made few statements about how it has been progressing .
media speculation about what the findings of the butler report might be has been intense . tony blair got an advance copy of the report on tuesday and so will be ready to respond to the findings .
the findings could reflect badly on blair . in particular the report might say his government pressured intelligence services in some way to overestimate the risk posed by iraq or misrepresented that risk .
many people in britain will be waiting to hear what the butler report has to say about a september 2002 british government dossier that claimed saddam hussein 's forces could deploy chemical and biological weapons within 45 minutes . the report comes a day before two by-elections in the uk .

after years of stalling on the issue , the german car industry has decided to introduce serial production of emission filters for diesel cars .
the announcement comes amidst mounting pressure from environmentalists . while their european neighbors are already driving diesel cars outfitted with emission filters , germans have been wondering why their own carmakers have n't introduced the technology given the government 's pro-environmental stance .
activists from within the greens party and other campaigners for clean air and the reduction of green-house gases had been arguing for years in favor of serial production of filters in new diesel model .
they claim diesel cars emit more carcinogenic sooty particles than traditional fossil-fuel burning cars and are linked to increases in lung cancer and adverse respiratory problems : a study conducted by the federal environmental agency , showed that 14,000 people die prematurely each year as a result of diesel pollution .
filters on the cars can reduce particle emissions by 99 percent , and yet the german automobile branch has in the past adamantly resisted introducing the technology , saying that outfitting smaller cars with the filter would be much too expensive .
now the makers of volkswagen , bmw and mercedes are reversing their position .
they vow that by 2008/2009 all domestic diesel cars will contain a filter .
" diesel cars will be practically emissions free by the end of the decade , " said bernd gottschalk , president of the association of automobile manufacturers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diesel particle filter from bosch government support the german government was integral in implementing the change .
chancellor gerhard schröder , who had previously resisted calls from the greens to reduce diesel emission limits , is now offering tax breaks for owners whose cars fall under the more restrictive eu emissions standards of euro 5 , expected to be introduced in the fall .
currently , all cars with the euro 4 limit of 0.025 grams of particles per kilometer are eligible for tax reductions .
given the guaranteed tax breaks in the future , gottschalk said that by the end of 2006 nearly a quarter of all new diesel cars will be outfitted with the filter ; by the end of 2007 , some 75 percent of all new diesel motors will have filters .
meeting customer demand by offering the filters on all new models , the carmakers are responding to the demands of their customers , gottschalk said .
daimlerchrysler recently announced that more than 80 percent of all its mercedes owners were requesting the inclusion of a built-in emissions filter at purchase .

the announcement comes amidst mounting pressure from environmentalists . while their european neighbors are already driving diesel cars outfitted with emission filters , germans have been wondering why their own carmakers have n't introduced the technology given the government 's pro-environmental stance .

they claim diesel cars emit more carcinogenic sooty particles than traditional fossil-fuel burning cars and are linked to increases in lung cancer and adverse respiratory problems : a study conducted by the federal environmental agency , showed that 14,000 people die prematurely each year as a result of diesel pollution .
filters on the cars can reduce particle emissions by 99 percent , and yet the german automobile branch has in the past adamantly resisted introducing the technology , saying that outfitting smaller cars with the filter would be much too expensive .

currently , all cars with the euro 4 limit of 0.025 grams of particles per kilometer are eligible for tax reductions .

the growing aid business in germany alone , there are thousands of aid organizations whose business it is to help the needy at home and abroad .
among them are state , half-state , religious and private organizations of all sizes .

" the state has pulled back , and now , aid organizations are in the situation where they are subject to the typical growth constraints . " humanitarian aid organizations in the third world often find themselves in a helpless situation .

their advertising campaigns have to be louder if they want to reach donor 's wallets .
attempts to make a name for themselves - particularly in the media - drive some organizations toward flashier pr activities , or worse , exploitation of the very people they 're meant to be helping . exploitation for a good cause children are ideal in this regard , as are old people and women - images presented without detailing the context of the problem , or the role the aid agencies have taken in these structures .
the problem of small arms and posed photos is a prime example , lock said . " we often hear the message that , in the development of violent societies in which small arms play a big role , woman and children are the central victims .
but when you analyze violence in the third world , you come to the conclusion that violent incidents are most frequently carried out by , and most frequently affect , young men , " lock told deutsche welle . " another example is the use of photo-journalism in ads that , to put it carefully , work with contrived photographs meant to project human suffering out of its social context and into our televisions .
and that 's not very helpful when it comes to finding lasting political solutions for these problems .

after years of stalling on the issue , the german car industry has decided to introduce serial production of emission filters for diesel cars .
the announcement comes amidst mounting pressure from environmentalists . while their european neighbors are already driving diesel cars outfitted with emission filters , germans have been wondering why their own carmakers have n't introduced the technology given the government 's pro-environmental stance .
activists from within the greens party and other campaigners for clean air and the reduction of green-house gases had been arguing for years in favor of serial production of filters in new diesel model .
they claim diesel cars emit more carcinogenic sooty particles than traditional fossil-fuel burning cars and are linked to increases in lung cancer and adverse respiratory problems : a study conducted by the federal environmental agency , showed that 14,000 people die prematurely each year as a result of diesel pollution .
filters on the cars can reduce particle emissions by 99 percent , and yet the german automobile branch has in the past adamantly resisted introducing the technology , saying that outfitting smaller cars with the filter would be much too expensive .
now the makers of volkswagen , bmw and mercedes are reversing their position .
they vow that by 2008/2009 all domestic diesel cars will contain a filter .
" diesel cars will be practically emissions free by the end of the decade , " said bernd gottschalk , president of the association of automobile manufacturers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diesel particle filter from bosch government support the german government was integral in implementing the change .
chancellor gerhard schröder , who had previously resisted calls from the greens to reduce diesel emission limits , is now offering tax breaks for owners whose cars fall under the more restrictive eu emissions standards of euro 5 , expected to be introduced in the fall .
currently , all cars with the euro 4 limit of 0.025 grams of particles per kilometer are eligible for tax reductions .
given the guaranteed tax breaks in the future , gottschalk said that by the end of 2006 nearly a quarter of all new diesel cars will be outfitted with the filter ; by the end of 2007 , some 75 percent of all new diesel motors will have filters .
meeting customer demand by offering the filters on all new models , the carmakers are responding to the demands of their customers , gottschalk said .
daimlerchrysler recently announced that more than 80 percent of all its mercedes owners were requesting the inclusion of a built-in emissions filter at purchase .
german environment minister jürgen trittin , one of the strongest advocates of tighter restrictions on emissions welcomed the " insight of the german car industry that they can contribute significantly to the reduction of emissions in the environment .

the former aide to ex-chancellor helmut kohl is wanted in connection with clandestine arms deals . he was on germany 's ' most wanted ' list for the past five years .
suspected of tax fraud and of taking nearly € 2 million -lrb- $ 2.4 million -rrb- in bribes in connection with the sale of 36 armored vehicles to saudi arabia , holger pfahls has been on the run from the german government .
on tuesday , police in paris tracked down the former defense official and apprehended him as he left his apartment .
the state prosecutor 's office in the southern german city of augsburg , where the charges were originally brought , confirmed the 62-year old had been arrested .
it is not clear yet when he will be extradicted . pfahls , who is accused of accepting bribes during the 1991 gulf war for helping german industrial giant thyssen obtain a government arms contract for delivering fuchs tanks to saudi arabia , disappeared in the late 1990s before he could be brought to court .
german interior minister otto schily welcomed pfahls ' arrest , saying it was " the result of the excellent work of german federal police -lrb- bka -rrb- . "
" for years , its investigators followed all possible leads .
this persevering work has now been rewarded , " he said .
high-level political scandal pfahls is also widely believed to be involved in the party slush-fund scandal that tainted former chancellor helmut kohl and his conservative christian democrats union .
state investigators allege that senior officials in kohl 's government , if not the chancellor himself , authorized the negotiations between pfahls and thyssen which were orchestrated by german-canadian arms dealer karl-heinz schreiber .
in 2002 , an augsburg state court found that two former managers at thyssen took millions of euros in bribes related to the delivery of the tanks , money they failed to declare to tax authorities .
schreiber , who also took a cut in the deal , was arrested in toronto in 1999 for tax evasion and is currently appealing extradition to germany .

the former aide to ex-chancellor helmut kohl is wanted in connection with clandestine arms deals . he was on germany 's ' most wanted ' list for the past five years .
suspected of tax fraud and of taking nearly € 2 million -lrb- $ 2.4 million -rrb- in bribes in connection with the sale of 36 armored vehicles to saudi arabia , holger pfahls has been on the run from the german government .
on tuesday , police in paris tracked down the former defense official and apprehended him as he left his apartment .
the state prosecutor 's office in the southern german city of augsburg , where the charges were originally brought , confirmed the 62-year old had been arrested .
it is not clear yet when he will be extradicted . pfahls , who is accused of accepting bribes during the 1991 gulf war for helping german industrial giant thyssen obtain a government arms contract for delivering fuchs tanks to saudi arabia , disappeared in the late 1990s before he could be brought to court .
german interior minister otto schily welcomed pfahls ' arrest , saying it was " the result of the excellent work of german federal police -lrb- bka -rrb- . "
" for years , its investigators followed all possible leads .
this persevering work has now been rewarded , " he said .
high-level political scandal pfahls is also widely believed to be involved in the party slush-fund scandal that tainted former chancellor helmut kohl and his conservative christian democrats union .
state investigators allege that senior officials in kohl 's government , if not the chancellor himself , authorized the negotiations between pfahls and thyssen which were orchestrated by german-canadian arms dealer karl-heinz schreiber .
in 2002 , an augsburg state court found that two former managers at thyssen took millions of euros in bribes related to the delivery of the tanks , money they failed to declare to tax authorities .
schreiber , who also took a cut in the deal , was arrested in toronto in 1999 for tax evasion and is currently appealing extradition to germany .

pfahls himself has evaded arrest for five years .
initially bka investigators believed he had fled to the philippines , while the media reported he might be dead .
in recent press reports , however , it was reported that pfahls might be hiding in an upscale paris neighborhood .
the former deputy minister for defense was close to the late ultra-conservative bavarian state premier franz josef strauss and headed his state cabinet between 1981 and 1985 .
before entering kohl 's administration , pfahls directed the former west german domestic intelligence agency . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de how corrupt is germany ?

the winner will represent germany at the world championships in finland . it 's standing room only tonight at the knorre in berlin .
about 200 people are sitting , standing or huddling body to body at the berlin culture center , with its bar-like atmosphere .
the crowd , hungry for scandalous behavior , is ready to see some sweating and passion at the first-ever national air guitar championship .
the winner will receive an air mattress and a flight to finland , where he or she will represent germany at the ninth-annual air guitar world championship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mark böhmer has winning on his mind tonight there are 14 air guitarists who have dared to make their way to the small stage in an effort to win over the audience and the judges .
" i 'm going to win , obviously , " says mark böhmer -lrb- photo -rrb- , 29 , who 's driven in from hanover to participate .
when he is n't strumming a make-believe guitar , böhmer normally plays the drums , but for the championships in berlin , he 's " playing " a double necked guitar with acoustic strings on one neck and electric strings on the other .
he 's been training for months for the big night : he 's been walking , he 's toned his biceps and he 's done finger exercises .
yet despite all that preparation , he says his performance tonight will mostly be spontaneous , " with the exception of two or three small things i 've put in my program .
instead i 'm going to just look and see what 's happening on stage and what the atmosphere is like . "
when asked if , like in the real world of rock and roll , drugs play an important part in his work , böhmer nods .
" a huge role , " he says , " but i ca n't tell you anything else about that .
but obviously you have to have a beer or two " before going on stage .
it 's an understatement that will be highlighted by events later in the evening .
fighting for world peace before the show , competition organizer friedericke van meer is being chased down by microphone brandishing journalists .
six months ago , the transsexual founded the german air guitar federation with a group of friends .
" i just randomly came across the world association 's web site and was really impressed with what i saw there , especially that air guitar is , in part , a service for world peace , " she explains .
" i was also very interested in the mix between seriousness and self-irony .
i 've never found that kind of mix anywhere else . "
an emcee clad in a velvet pin-striped and a pink-frilled shirt explains the rules and history of the air guitar to the audience , which is already growing impatient .
each contestant gets 60 seconds to persuade the audience .
" the decisive factors are the overall artistic impression , the visual presentation , technical ability , the song , everything .
you can , of course , influence the judges through your applause , " he explained .
the three-member jury , comprised of has-been german musicians , awards each contestant with between four and six points .
14 air guitarists give their all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this audience is hungry for scandalous behavior !
after a short performance by a real , e.g. live , band , it 's finally time for the competition .
" hell sinki , " is the first air guitarist to enter the stage .
he 's got a beer in his hand , which he slowly imbibes before starting his performance .
the man in his late 20s sporting a haircut not unlike members of the british band oasis , abuses his imaginary guitar to powerful rock ' n ' roll riffs , his fingers unrhythmically running over the imaginary strings .
he jumps into the air , then slams back down to the ground .
at the end of his performance , he falls off the stage to howls from the audience .
but the jury is stingier with its praise , giving him a 5.7 , 5.5 and a 5.4 .
more embarrassingly good performances follow .
" echodrive , " an older guy , is hopping around the stage chaotically , unaided by the pink floyd music he 's supposed to be accompanying .
with horn-rimmed glasses , an undershirt and red swimming trunks , he fiddles around for most of his performance with his fantasy amplifier which keeps making interference sounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : move over buddy holly , this is our new guitar hiro .
but there are also some highlights , like hiro , a young japanese guy who quickly becomes a crowd favorite .
dressed in a tie , pressed pants and designer glasses , his face is washed over in an ecstatic look as he performs .
then he turns his back to the audience and begins waggling his ass .
by the time he starts wriggling with his fake guitar on the stage floor , it appears he 's already clinched the title .
the stage is then covered in a hail storm of bras and tissues .
when the jury just gives him medium marks , booing fills the hall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i guess i should n't drink before the show next time . "
next up is mark böhmer , the cocky dude from hanover .
for the event , he 's brought along a roadie , who first tests out the guitar .
donning a wife-beater undershirt , böhmer launches into an air guitar version of " delay nuclear " by the hives .
he competently strums his instrument , rolls around on the floor and gets down on his knees .
it 's a powerful performance , but this crowd is not easily pleased .
" you 're an inbred , " yells one member of the audience .
the judges each give him a 5.7 - not bad , but still not enough .
" it did n't go all that well , " he says .
" i would have thought that the jury would have concentrated more on stylistic things or creativity .
but i had the feeling that the most important things to them were appearance and fun factor . "
but soon enough he 's laughing again .
" next time i know that i ca n't drink anything before the performance , otherwise i 'll forget how the song goes . "
the accidental champion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german air guitar champion ingo schulz : i 'm too sexy for my shirt !
one candidate first decided to join the competition when he got to the hall .
ingo schulz -lrb- photo -rrb- , a 33-year-old from berlin , says he did n't even know he was coming here tonight .
he says he did n't feel like going to a disco with techno or house music .
instead , the businessman decided to come here , but only as a spectator .
but then he thought , " why not ? "
he chose a song by ac / dc and grabbed his " guitar . "
with jeans and a checkered shirt he does a mean angus young impersonation , licking his instrument with his tongue and pulling at the strings .
it 's an exceptional performance - pure , honest and without any twaddle .
the jury then crowns schulz the german championship , and this time the audience has no objections .
" when i play songs from ac / dc , " schulz explains , " i get the feeling that the 10 meters that separated me from angus young at his last berlin concert are a lot smaller .
i feel like the music is alive again , and not just for me .
if it pleases the audience , then it 's even better . "
he 's also got a pretty laid back attitude about representing germany at the world championships in finland next month .
" i 'm definitely going to do ac / dc again , " he says .
" i do n't know if it will be the same song .
so , now it 's time to go to finland for world peace . " andreas leixnering -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links air guitar world championships the official web site of the air guitar world 's premier event .

the winner will represent germany at the world championships in finland . it 's standing room only tonight at the knorre in berlin .
about 200 people are sitting , standing or huddling body to body at the berlin culture center , with its bar-like atmosphere .
the crowd , hungry for scandalous behavior , is ready to see some sweating and passion at the first-ever national air guitar championship .
the winner will receive an air mattress and a flight to finland , where he or she will represent germany at the ninth-annual air guitar world championship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mark böhmer has winning on his mind tonight there are 14 air guitarists who have dared to make their way to the small stage in an effort to win over the audience and the judges .
" i 'm going to win , obviously , " says mark böhmer -lrb- photo -rrb- , 29 , who 's driven in from hanover to participate .
when he is n't strumming a make-believe guitar , böhmer normally plays the drums , but for the championships in berlin , he 's " playing " a double necked guitar with acoustic strings on one neck and electric strings on the other .
he 's been training for months for the big night : he 's been walking , he 's toned his biceps and he 's done finger exercises .
yet despite all that preparation , he says his performance tonight will mostly be spontaneous , " with the exception of two or three small things i 've put in my program .
instead i 'm going to just look and see what 's happening on stage and what the atmosphere is like . "
when asked if , like in the real world of rock and roll , drugs play an important part in his work , böhmer nods .
" a huge role , " he says , " but i ca n't tell you anything else about that .
but obviously you have to have a beer or two " before going on stage .
it 's an understatement that will be highlighted by events later in the evening .
fighting for world peace before the show , competition organizer friedericke van meer is being chased down by microphone brandishing journalists .
six months ago , the transsexual founded the german air guitar federation with a group of friends .
" i just randomly came across the world association 's web site and was really impressed with what i saw there , especially that air guitar is , in part , a service for world peace , " she explains .
" i was also very interested in the mix between seriousness and self-irony .
i 've never found that kind of mix anywhere else . "
an emcee clad in a velvet pin-striped and a pink-frilled shirt explains the rules and history of the air guitar to the audience , which is already growing impatient .
each contestant gets 60 seconds to persuade the audience .
" the decisive factors are the overall artistic impression , the visual presentation , technical ability , the song , everything .
you can , of course , influence the judges through your applause , " he explained .
the three-member jury , comprised of has-been german musicians , awards each contestant with between four and six points .
14 air guitarists give their all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this audience is hungry for scandalous behavior !
after a short performance by a real , e.g. live , band , it 's finally time for the competition .
" hell sinki , " is the first air guitarist to enter the stage .
he 's got a beer in his hand , which he slowly imbibes before starting his performance .
the man in his late 20s sporting a haircut not unlike members of the british band oasis , abuses his imaginary guitar to powerful rock ' n ' roll riffs , his fingers unrhythmically running over the imaginary strings .
he jumps into the air , then slams back down to the ground .
at the end of his performance , he falls off the stage to howls from the audience .
but the jury is stingier with its praise , giving him a 5.7 , 5.5 and a 5.4 .
more embarrassingly good performances follow .
" echodrive , " an older guy , is hopping around the stage chaotically , unaided by the pink floyd music he 's supposed to be accompanying .
with horn-rimmed glasses , an undershirt and red swimming trunks , he fiddles around for most of his performance with his fantasy amplifier which keeps making interference sounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : move over buddy holly , this is our new guitar hiro .
but there are also some highlights , like hiro , a young japanese guy who quickly becomes a crowd favorite .
dressed in a tie , pressed pants and designer glasses , his face is washed over in an ecstatic look as he performs .
then he turns his back to the audience and begins waggling his ass .
by the time he starts wriggling with his fake guitar on the stage floor , it appears he 's already clinched the title .
the stage is then covered in a hail storm of bras and tissues .
when the jury just gives him medium marks , booing fills the hall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i guess i should n't drink before the show next time . "
next up is mark böhmer , the cocky dude from hanover .
for the event , he 's brought along a roadie , who first tests out the guitar .
donning a wife-beater undershirt , böhmer launches into an air guitar version of " delay nuclear " by the hives .
he competently strums his instrument , rolls around on the floor and gets down on his knees .
it 's a powerful performance , but this crowd is not easily pleased .
" you 're an inbred , " yells one member of the audience .
the judges each give him a 5.7 - not bad , but still not enough .
" it did n't go all that well , " he says .
" i would have thought that the jury would have concentrated more on stylistic things or creativity .
but i had the feeling that the most important things to them were appearance and fun factor . "
but soon enough he 's laughing again .
" next time i know that i ca n't drink anything before the performance , otherwise i 'll forget how the song goes . "
the accidental champion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german air guitar champion ingo schulz : i 'm too sexy for my shirt !
one candidate first decided to join the competition when he got to the hall .
ingo schulz -lrb- photo -rrb- , a 33-year-old from berlin , says he did n't even know he was coming here tonight .
he says he did n't feel like going to a disco with techno or house music .
instead , the businessman decided to come here , but only as a spectator .
but then he thought , " why not ? "
he chose a song by ac / dc and grabbed his " guitar . "
with jeans and a checkered shirt he does a mean angus young impersonation , licking his instrument with his tongue and pulling at the strings .
it 's an exceptional performance - pure , honest and without any twaddle .
the jury then crowns schulz the german championship , and this time the audience has no objections .
" when i play songs from ac / dc , " schulz explains , " i get the feeling that the 10 meters that separated me from angus young at his last berlin concert are a lot smaller .
i feel like the music is alive again , and not just for me .
if it pleases the audience , then it 's even better . "
he 's also got a pretty laid back attitude about representing germany at the world championships in finland next month .
" i 'm definitely going to do ac / dc again , " he says .
" i do n't know if it will be the same song .

a model project shows that biomass created from farm and factory waste can produce energy for 1,000 homes . sven nevigmann , one of the workers at the loick biomass plant in the village of dorsten , is looking over the operation , which is filled with swine and other animals whose manure is combined with food and other organic substances to create biomass , which in turns makes biogas that can be used for energy production .
the biomass goes through several production processes here at the plant before it is ready for consumption .
biomass projects like this across germany are essential elements of the government 's plan to increase its reliance on renewable energies – including wind and solar power – to 12.5 percent of all electricity development by 2010 .
in the western german state of north rhine-westphalia , where the loick plant is located , about 6 percent of energy production already comes from renewable energy supplies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i 'm good eating and i can heat your home ! "
" we use about 12,000 tons of biomass a year , that is about 6,000 tons of manure , pig and cow manure , and renewable biomass , and about 6,000 tons of food waste and other biodegradable biomass , " said marcel hengst , supervisor at the loick plant .
fermenting the future at loick , manure is mixed with other organic materials that mostly come from a small company nearby that produces deep frozen vegetables .
what the company can ’ t use in its products is then sent to loick to make energy .
it is combined with pig and cow manure that is brought in from nearby farms .
along with these products , corn grown at the plant and food waste are also fed in stages through a number of processing tanks where the organic waste products are fermented .
this then produces biogas along with a rich fertilizer that is highly sought after by local farmers .
in total , the fermentation process takes about 25-30 days .
" this is a single-step fermentation process , " explains hengst , " the fermentation process can be divided into four steps , and those four steps take place in the digester , a 1,000 cubic meter facility that contains a tank that degrades the biomass into valuable fertilizer and biogas . "
the biogras is then placed in a so-called " co-generation unit " that combines heat and power to generate electricity .
the company is paid an attractive premium of about 10 euro cents a kilowatt hour for the electricity it produces from biomass .
a showcase project the loick plant , which is located on an operating farm owned by hubert loick and sponsored by the state of north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- and the fraunhofer institute for environmental , safety and energy technology , was opened in september 2001 as a demonstration facility for biomass technology .
bernd kunott of nrw ’ s ministry of research , says projects like loick are important elements of germany ’ s ambitious renewable energies strategy .
because it transforms waste into valuable energy , it is also innovative , he says .
" there is very much waste you can use for energy purposes .
this one produces energy , electricity for nearly 1,000 households with four persons . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a backhoe picks up chipped wood that is going to be used for biomass production .
because it relies fermentation to produce its energy , biomass also has a major advantage over other renewable energy sources : it is not dependant on the sun shining or the wind blowing to produce energy .
it also has great potential – the german agricultural ministry estimates that , across the country , more than 190 million tons of manure , along with 25 million tons of organic waste , are available for biomass production .
if only 50 percent of that figure were put to the production of electricity or heat , the ministry estimates , either 1.7 million german homes could be provided with heating or the entire electricity needs for 4 million homes could be covered .
helping farmers help themselves but biomass is still largely in its infancy in germany .
of the potential 200,000 biomass facilities that could be built in the country , there are currently only about 1,000 .
still , for farmers like loick , it ’ s an attractive proposition that can help expand the bottom line .
" a farmer can better calculate his annual earnings -lrb- by creating a biomass plant -rrb- , " north rhine-westphalia environment minister bärbel höhn recently said .

a model project shows that biomass created from farm and factory waste can produce energy for 1,000 homes . sven nevigmann , one of the workers at the loick biomass plant in the village of dorsten , is looking over the operation , which is filled with swine and other animals whose manure is combined with food and other organic substances to create biomass , which in turns makes biogas that can be used for energy production .
the biomass goes through several production processes here at the plant before it is ready for consumption .
biomass projects like this across germany are essential elements of the government 's plan to increase its reliance on renewable energies – including wind and solar power – to 12.5 percent of all electricity development by 2010 .
in the western german state of north rhine-westphalia , where the loick plant is located , about 6 percent of energy production already comes from renewable energy supplies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i 'm good eating and i can heat your home ! "
" we use about 12,000 tons of biomass a year , that is about 6,000 tons of manure , pig and cow manure , and renewable biomass , and about 6,000 tons of food waste and other biodegradable biomass , " said marcel hengst , supervisor at the loick plant .
fermenting the future at loick , manure is mixed with other organic materials that mostly come from a small company nearby that produces deep frozen vegetables .
what the company can ’ t use in its products is then sent to loick to make energy .
it is combined with pig and cow manure that is brought in from nearby farms .
along with these products , corn grown at the plant and food waste are also fed in stages through a number of processing tanks where the organic waste products are fermented .
this then produces biogas along with a rich fertilizer that is highly sought after by local farmers .
in total , the fermentation process takes about 25-30 days .
" this is a single-step fermentation process , " explains hengst , " the fermentation process can be divided into four steps , and those four steps take place in the digester , a 1,000 cubic meter facility that contains a tank that degrades the biomass into valuable fertilizer and biogas . "
the biogras is then placed in a so-called " co-generation unit " that combines heat and power to generate electricity .
the company is paid an attractive premium of about 10 euro cents a kilowatt hour for the electricity it produces from biomass .
a showcase project the loick plant , which is located on an operating farm owned by hubert loick and sponsored by the state of north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- and the fraunhofer institute for environmental , safety and energy technology , was opened in september 2001 as a demonstration facility for biomass technology .
bernd kunott of nrw ’ s ministry of research , says projects like loick are important elements of germany ’ s ambitious renewable energies strategy .
because it transforms waste into valuable energy , it is also innovative , he says .
" there is very much waste you can use for energy purposes .
this one produces energy , electricity for nearly 1,000 households with four persons . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a backhoe picks up chipped wood that is going to be used for biomass production .
because it relies fermentation to produce its energy , biomass also has a major advantage over other renewable energy sources : it is not dependant on the sun shining or the wind blowing to produce energy .
it also has great potential – the german agricultural ministry estimates that , across the country , more than 190 million tons of manure , along with 25 million tons of organic waste , are available for biomass production .
if only 50 percent of that figure were put to the production of electricity or heat , the ministry estimates , either 1.7 million german homes could be provided with heating or the entire electricity needs for 4 million homes could be covered .
helping farmers help themselves but biomass is still largely in its infancy in germany .
of the potential 200,000 biomass facilities that could be built in the country , there are currently only about 1,000 .
still , for farmers like loick , it ’ s an attractive proposition that can help expand the bottom line .
" a farmer can better calculate his annual earnings -lrb- by creating a biomass plant -rrb- , " north rhine-westphalia environment minister bärbel höhn recently said .
" the idea of making a farmer an energy producer is a realistic perspective .

the winner will represent germany at the world championships in finland . it 's standing room only tonight at the knorre in berlin .
about 200 people are sitting , standing or huddling body to body at the berlin culture center , with its bar-like atmosphere .
the crowd , hungry for scandalous behavior , is ready to see some sweating and passion at the first-ever national air guitar championship .
the winner will receive an air mattress and a flight to finland , where he or she will represent germany at the ninth-annual air guitar world championship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mark böhmer has winning on his mind tonight there are 14 air guitarists who have dared to make their way to the small stage in an effort to win over the audience and the judges .
" i 'm going to win , obviously , " says mark böhmer -lrb- photo -rrb- , 29 , who 's driven in from hanover to participate .
when he is n't strumming a make-believe guitar , böhmer normally plays the drums , but for the championships in berlin , he 's " playing " a double necked guitar with acoustic strings on one neck and electric strings on the other .
he 's been training for months for the big night : he 's been walking , he 's toned his biceps and he 's done finger exercises .
yet despite all that preparation , he says his performance tonight will mostly be spontaneous , " with the exception of two or three small things i 've put in my program .
instead i 'm going to just look and see what 's happening on stage and what the atmosphere is like . "
when asked if , like in the real world of rock and roll , drugs play an important part in his work , böhmer nods .
" a huge role , " he says , " but i ca n't tell you anything else about that .
but obviously you have to have a beer or two " before going on stage .
it 's an understatement that will be highlighted by events later in the evening .
fighting for world peace before the show , competition organizer friedericke van meer is being chased down by microphone brandishing journalists .
six months ago , the transsexual founded the german air guitar federation with a group of friends .
" i just randomly came across the world association 's web site and was really impressed with what i saw there , especially that air guitar is , in part , a service for world peace , " she explains .
" i was also very interested in the mix between seriousness and self-irony .
i 've never found that kind of mix anywhere else . "
an emcee clad in a velvet pin-striped and a pink-frilled shirt explains the rules and history of the air guitar to the audience , which is already growing impatient .
each contestant gets 60 seconds to persuade the audience .
" the decisive factors are the overall artistic impression , the visual presentation , technical ability , the song , everything .
you can , of course , influence the judges through your applause , " he explained .
the three-member jury , comprised of has-been german musicians , awards each contestant with between four and six points .
14 air guitarists give their all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this audience is hungry for scandalous behavior !
after a short performance by a real , e.g. live , band , it 's finally time for the competition .
" hell sinki , " is the first air guitarist to enter the stage .
he 's got a beer in his hand , which he slowly imbibes before starting his performance .
the man in his late 20s sporting a haircut not unlike members of the british band oasis , abuses his imaginary guitar to powerful rock ' n ' roll riffs , his fingers unrhythmically running over the imaginary strings .
he jumps into the air , then slams back down to the ground .
at the end of his performance , he falls off the stage to howls from the audience .
but the jury is stingier with its praise , giving him a 5.7 , 5.5 and a 5.4 .
more embarrassingly good performances follow .
" echodrive , " an older guy , is hopping around the stage chaotically , unaided by the pink floyd music he 's supposed to be accompanying .
with horn-rimmed glasses , an undershirt and red swimming trunks , he fiddles around for most of his performance with his fantasy amplifier which keeps making interference sounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : move over buddy holly , this is our new guitar hiro .
but there are also some highlights , like hiro , a young japanese guy who quickly becomes a crowd favorite .
dressed in a tie , pressed pants and designer glasses , his face is washed over in an ecstatic look as he performs .
then he turns his back to the audience and begins waggling his ass .
by the time he starts wriggling with his fake guitar on the stage floor , it appears he 's already clinched the title .
the stage is then covered in a hail storm of bras and tissues .
when the jury just gives him medium marks , booing fills the hall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i guess i should n't drink before the show next time . "
next up is mark böhmer , the cocky dude from hanover .
for the event , he 's brought along a roadie , who first tests out the guitar .
donning a wife-beater undershirt , böhmer launches into an air guitar version of " delay nuclear " by the hives .
he competently strums his instrument , rolls around on the floor and gets down on his knees .
it 's a powerful performance , but this crowd is not easily pleased .
" you 're an inbred , " yells one member of the audience .
the judges each give him a 5.7 - not bad , but still not enough .
" it did n't go all that well , " he says .
" i would have thought that the jury would have concentrated more on stylistic things or creativity .
but i had the feeling that the most important things to them were appearance and fun factor . "
but soon enough he 's laughing again .
" next time i know that i ca n't drink anything before the performance , otherwise i 'll forget how the song goes . "
the accidental champion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german air guitar champion ingo schulz : i 'm too sexy for my shirt !
one candidate first decided to join the competition when he got to the hall .
ingo schulz -lrb- photo -rrb- , a 33-year-old from berlin , says he did n't even know he was coming here tonight .
he says he did n't feel like going to a disco with techno or house music .
instead , the businessman decided to come here , but only as a spectator .
but then he thought , " why not ? "
he chose a song by ac / dc and grabbed his " guitar . "
with jeans and a checkered shirt he does a mean angus young impersonation , licking his instrument with his tongue and pulling at the strings .
it 's an exceptional performance - pure , honest and without any twaddle .
the jury then crowns schulz the german championship , and this time the audience has no objections .
" when i play songs from ac / dc , " schulz explains , " i get the feeling that the 10 meters that separated me from angus young at his last berlin concert are a lot smaller .
i feel like the music is alive again , and not just for me .
if it pleases the audience , then it 's even better . "
he 's also got a pretty laid back attitude about representing germany at the world championships in finland next month .
" i 'm definitely going to do ac / dc again , " he says .
" i do n't know if it will be the same song .
so , now it 's time to go to finland for world peace . " andreas leixnering -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links air guitar world championships the official web site of the air guitar world 's premier event .

the biomass goes through several production processes here at the plant before it is ready for consumption .
biomass projects like this across germany are essential elements of the government 's plan to increase its reliance on renewable energies – including wind and solar power – to 12.5 percent of all electricity development by 2010 .

the announcement coincided with a renewed international debate to reform the un 's enforcement arm in maintaining international peace and security . with the security council 's five permanent veto-wielding members - france , england , america , china and russia - still representing the world of 1945 , there is broad agreement that an overhaul is overdue . while a revamp is being hotly debated within the un , germany is already drumming up support for its bid for a permanent seat .
with a two-thirds majority of the 191-member un general assembly required to pass any kind of reform resolution , germany is not just lobbying the global heavyweights but even smaller countries . " working towards the same goal " the most recent campaign offensive involves a ten-day tour of south asia by german foreign minister joschka fischer .
stops include india , china , pakistan , bangladesh and sri lanka . fischer became the first european leader to visit the newly-elected congress government and the new indian prime minister manmohan singh on wednesday .
the two sides confirmed they would support each other in their attempts to get permanent un security council seats . in the run-up to the meeting , experts agreed the german bid would find acceptance in india .
not least because new delhi has made no secret of its own ambition to seek a spot in the powerful club . a further reason , said some , are the smooth ties the two countries enjoy . " there 's nothing negative in their relationship , no conflict of interest , so the two could really work together towards the same goal , " anuradha chenoy , international relations expert at new delhi 's jawaharlal nehru university told dw-world . indeed , the indo-german relationship , traditionally close , has grown stronger since german reunification and india 's economic reform process in the 1990s .
trade and investment have picked up in recent years along with deepening cooperation in the fields of science and technology . last year , former german president johannes rau endorsed a permanent indian seat on the security council during a visit to india . a common stance on iraq bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shakti 3 , one of four nuclear test sites in the thar desert .
india conducted five nculear tests in may 1998 .
though india 's nuclear tests in 1998 -lrb- photo -rrb- , tensions with pakistan following the attack on the indian parliament in 2001 and , most recently , a flare-up of religious violence in the western state of gujarat in 2002 have cast a shadow on bilateral relations , experts said there has n't been any lasting damage . they instead pointed out that the two countries ' similar position on recent world events is an indication that the two could complement each other in their bid for permanent security council seats . " after the sept .
11 attacks , there was a shift in the foreign policies of many countries .
both india and germany refused to go along with the us , reflecting a common thinking , " said chenoy , adding that the recent change in the indian government would also boost chances of the two working in tandem .
" the hindu nationalists in the last government pursued a more militaristic , chauvinist foreign policy .
the congress is more moderate . " subrata mitra , head of the political science department at heidelberg 's south asia institute , stressed that india 's traditional role as leader of the non-aligned movement -lrb- an international organization of over 100 states which consider themselves not formally aligned with or against any major power bloc -rrb- would be strengthened if it got in with germany on the security council . " in its search for a new global role , india views germany , which has shown itself to be balanced and neutral , as an important western partner , " mitra said .
" a german-indian axis in the security council would provide an important and much-needed voice in a multi-polar world . " promising candidates while both nations have the backing of various countries for their bids , the position of the single-most powerful member of the security council - the us - is still unknown . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers in belet huen , somalia , on a united nations peacekeeping mission in 1993 .
still , analysts agreed that both countries stand a good chance of getting what they want .
germany is already the third-largest contributor to the un budget and the largest troop-contributor to peacekeeping missions from the balkans to the hindukush . though india has also been active in un peacekeeping missions , the reform debate focusing largely on the need for the security council to be more globally representative is expected to speak in its favor . " the outdated security council has to reflect the current world reality and include countries of the third world .
by that measure , india - the world 's largest democracy and second-most populous nation - is a leading candidate , " said un expert günther unser . what about pakistan ? some , however , warned that considering india to be a " natural choice " could prove dangerous for the stability of the south asian region - a further topic of discussion during fischer 's visit . hans maull , who holds the chair for foreign policy and international relations at the university of trier said pakistan , with whom india has thrice gone to war , was the key . " german foreign policy towards india should be positive , " he said .
" but its endorsement of the indian bid is not going to please pakistan .
if it 's angry that india gets in , it could endanger the security of the region , " maull said . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de summit endorses reforms to strengthen u.n. chancellor schröder on friday pushed for a permanent german seat on the u.n. security council at the eu-latin america summit , that urged the u.s. to drop its go-it-alone stance and stressed the need for u.n. reform .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.07.2004 government calls for swift extradition of fallen politician großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french police found holger pfahls in this parisian neighborhood holger pfahls is considered a key figure in the political slush fund scandals of the christian democrats in the 1990s .
following his arrest , new light could be cast on one of germany 's biggest political scandals . german prosecutors on wednesday called for the immediate extradition of holger pfahls , who is suspected of accepting a bribe while serving as deputy defense minister under former conservative chancellor helmut kohl .
the state prosecutor 's office in augsburg said it would likely file an extradition application with french authorities by the end of the week .
french police arrested pfahls on tuesday as he left a paris apartment .
for five years , he had been on germany 's " most wanted " list , suspected of taking nearly € 2 million -lrb- $ 2.4 million -rrb- in bribes for helping german industrial giant thyssen obtain a government arms contract for delivering fuchs tanks to saudi arabia .
he is also widely believed to be involved in the party slush-fund scandal that tainted kohl and his conservative christian democratic union party .
state investigators in the bavarian city of augsburg allege that senior officials in kohl 's government , if not the chancellor himself , authorized the negotiations between pfahls and thyssen which were orchestrated by german-canadian arms dealer karl-heinz schreiber .
tentacles that touched crime after crime bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludwig-holger pfahls in addition to the tank bribes and slush fund scandal , pfahls -lrb- photo -rrb- is also under investigation by french authorities for his suspected involvement in the leuna refinery scandal .
the french federal prosecutor 's office said it suspects pfahls accepted a bribes from french oil giant elf-aquitaine when it purchased the east german refinery in the early 1990s .
if the french seek to pursue the investigation , it could delay or complicate pfahls ' extradition to germany .
prosecution documents in the 2003 elf trial in paris accuse pfahls of pocketing € 8 million of the € 40 million in commissions elf paid out as part of the purchase .
arrest came as surprise in germany , pfahls ' arrest could lead to a reopening of the slush fund investigation .
volker neumann , the man who chaired a parliamentary committee investigating pfahls before he disappeared , said the arrest came unexpectedly .
" mr. pfahls trail was lost in 1999 between taipei and hong kong , and then he disappeared , " neumann said .
" his arrest in france was a big surprise because we believed he was still in asia . "
neumann said pfahls might be able to explain why the alleged bribes flowed in the first place .
but he said the courts would have to be the first to take action .
" first , the courts have priority to bring him to trial for the charges already filed against him .
this concerns the supply of tanks to saudi arabia , " he said .
" whether other charges are brought is not yet clear , although the statute of limitations has expired for most of the allegations . "
however , the opposition christian democrats are refusing to reopen the commission 's work .
wolfgang bosbach , the deputy chairman of the cdu 's parliamentary group , told german public radio broadcaster deutschlandradio he did n't know what purpose a " reanimation " of the commission would serve .
" the ball is now in the court of justice , " bosbach said .
meanwhile , the ruling social democrats are taking a wait-and-see approach .
prosecutors first need to bring pfahls to germany , said spd chief hans müntefering .
" we 're just waiting , there 's no reason to move at a hectic pace , " he said . dw staff -lrb- gb / dsl / ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fugitive german defense official arrested for bribery french police on tuesday apprehended holger pfahls , who served as deputy defense minister from 1989 to 1992 .

for five years , he had been on germany 's " most wanted " list , suspected of taking nearly € 2 million -lrb- $ 2.4 million -rrb- in bribes for helping german industrial giant thyssen obtain a government arms contract for delivering fuchs tanks to saudi arabia .
he is also widely believed to be involved in the party slush-fund scandal that tainted kohl and his conservative christian democratic union party .

" mr. pfahls trail was lost in 1999 between taipei and hong kong , and then he disappeared , " neumann said .
" his arrest in france was a big surprise because we believed he was still in asia . "
neumann said pfahls might be able to explain why the alleged bribes flowed in the first place .
but he said the courts would have to be the first to take action .
" first , the courts have priority to bring him to trial for the charges already filed against him .
this concerns the supply of tanks to saudi arabia , " he said .
" whether other charges are brought is not yet clear , although the statute of limitations has expired for most of the allegations . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 14.07.2004 much ado about nothing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grasping for thin air and the title at the air guitar championship in berlin , contestants duke it out to see who 's best a stroking imaginary instruments .
the winner will represent germany at the world championships in finland . it 's standing room only tonight at the knorre in berlin .
about 200 people are sitting , standing or huddling body to body at the berlin culture center , with its bar-like atmosphere .
the crowd , hungry for scandalous behavior , is ready to see some sweating and passion at the first-ever national air guitar championship .
the winner will receive an air mattress and a flight to finland , where he or she will represent germany at the ninth-annual air guitar world championship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mark böhmer has winning on his mind tonight there are 14 air guitarists who have dared to make their way to the small stage in an effort to win over the audience and the judges .
" i 'm going to win , obviously , " says mark böhmer -lrb- photo -rrb- , 29 , who 's driven in from hanover to participate .
when he is n't strumming a make-believe guitar , böhmer normally plays the drums , but for the championships in berlin , he 's " playing " a double necked guitar with acoustic strings on one neck and electric strings on the other .
he 's been training for months for the big night : he 's been walking , he 's toned his biceps and he 's done finger exercises .
yet despite all that preparation , he says his performance tonight will mostly be spontaneous , " with the exception of two or three small things i 've put in my program .
instead i 'm going to just look and see what 's happening on stage and what the atmosphere is like . "
when asked if , like in the real world of rock and roll , drugs play an important part in his work , böhmer nods .
" a huge role , " he says , " but i ca n't tell you anything else about that .
but obviously you have to have a beer or two " before going on stage .
it 's an understatement that will be highlighted by events later in the evening .
fighting for world peace before the show , competition organizer friedericke van meer is being chased down by microphone brandishing journalists .
six months ago , the transsexual founded the german air guitar federation with a group of friends .
" i just randomly came across the world association 's web site and was really impressed with what i saw there , especially that air guitar is , in part , a service for world peace , " she explains .
" i was also very interested in the mix between seriousness and self-irony .
i 've never found that kind of mix anywhere else . "
an emcee clad in a velvet pin-striped and a pink-frilled shirt explains the rules and history of the air guitar to the audience , which is already growing impatient .
each contestant gets 60 seconds to persuade the audience .
" the decisive factors are the overall artistic impression , the visual presentation , technical ability , the song , everything .
you can , of course , influence the judges through your applause , " he explained .
the three-member jury , comprised of has-been german musicians , awards each contestant with between four and six points .
14 air guitarists give their all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this audience is hungry for scandalous behavior !
after a short performance by a real , e.g. live , band , it 's finally time for the competition .
" hell sinki , " is the first air guitarist to enter the stage .
he 's got a beer in his hand , which he slowly imbibes before starting his performance .
the man in his late 20s sporting a haircut not unlike members of the british band oasis , abuses his imaginary guitar to powerful rock ' n ' roll riffs , his fingers unrhythmically running over the imaginary strings .
he jumps into the air , then slams back down to the ground .
at the end of his performance , he falls off the stage to howls from the audience .
but the jury is stingier with its praise , giving him a 5.7 , 5.5 and a 5.4 .
more embarrassingly good performances follow .
" echodrive , " an older guy , is hopping around the stage chaotically , unaided by the pink floyd music he 's supposed to be accompanying .
with horn-rimmed glasses , an undershirt and red swimming trunks , he fiddles around for most of his performance with his fantasy amplifier which keeps making interference sounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : move over buddy holly , this is our new guitar hiro .
but there are also some highlights , like hiro , a young japanese guy who quickly becomes a crowd favorite .
dressed in a tie , pressed pants and designer glasses , his face is washed over in an ecstatic look as he performs .
then he turns his back to the audience and begins waggling his ass .
by the time he starts wriggling with his fake guitar on the stage floor , it appears he 's already clinched the title .
the stage is then covered in a hail storm of bras and tissues .
when the jury just gives him medium marks , booing fills the hall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i guess i should n't drink before the show next time . "
next up is mark böhmer , the cocky dude from hanover .
for the event , he 's brought along a roadie , who first tests out the guitar .
donning a wife-beater undershirt , böhmer launches into an air guitar version of " delay nuclear " by the hives .
he competently strums his instrument , rolls around on the floor and gets down on his knees .
it 's a powerful performance , but this crowd is not easily pleased .
" you 're an inbred , " yells one member of the audience .
the judges each give him a 5.7 - not bad , but still not enough .
" it did n't go all that well , " he says .
" i would have thought that the jury would have concentrated more on stylistic things or creativity .
but i had the feeling that the most important things to them were appearance and fun factor . "
but soon enough he 's laughing again .
" next time i know that i ca n't drink anything before the performance , otherwise i 'll forget how the song goes . "
the accidental champion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german air guitar champion ingo schulz : i 'm too sexy for my shirt !
one candidate first decided to join the competition when he got to the hall .
ingo schulz -lrb- photo -rrb- , a 33-year-old from berlin , says he did n't even know he was coming here tonight .
he says he did n't feel like going to a disco with techno or house music .
instead , the businessman decided to come here , but only as a spectator .
but then he thought , " why not ? "
he chose a song by ac / dc and grabbed his " guitar . "
with jeans and a checkered shirt he does a mean angus young impersonation , licking his instrument with his tongue and pulling at the strings .

the winner will represent germany at the world championships in finland . it 's standing room only tonight at the knorre in berlin .
about 200 people are sitting , standing or huddling body to body at the berlin culture center , with its bar-like atmosphere .
the crowd , hungry for scandalous behavior , is ready to see some sweating and passion at the first-ever national air guitar championship .
the winner will receive an air mattress and a flight to finland , where he or she will represent germany at the ninth-annual air guitar world championship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mark böhmer has winning on his mind tonight there are 14 air guitarists who have dared to make their way to the small stage in an effort to win over the audience and the judges .
" i 'm going to win , obviously , " says mark böhmer -lrb- photo -rrb- , 29 , who 's driven in from hanover to participate .
when he is n't strumming a make-believe guitar , böhmer normally plays the drums , but for the championships in berlin , he 's " playing " a double necked guitar with acoustic strings on one neck and electric strings on the other .
he 's been training for months for the big night : he 's been walking , he 's toned his biceps and he 's done finger exercises .
yet despite all that preparation , he says his performance tonight will mostly be spontaneous , " with the exception of two or three small things i 've put in my program .
instead i 'm going to just look and see what 's happening on stage and what the atmosphere is like . "
when asked if , like in the real world of rock and roll , drugs play an important part in his work , böhmer nods .
" a huge role , " he says , " but i ca n't tell you anything else about that .
but obviously you have to have a beer or two " before going on stage .
it 's an understatement that will be highlighted by events later in the evening .
fighting for world peace before the show , competition organizer friedericke van meer is being chased down by microphone brandishing journalists .
six months ago , the transsexual founded the german air guitar federation with a group of friends .
" i just randomly came across the world association 's web site and was really impressed with what i saw there , especially that air guitar is , in part , a service for world peace , " she explains .
" i was also very interested in the mix between seriousness and self-irony .
i 've never found that kind of mix anywhere else . "
an emcee clad in a velvet pin-striped and a pink-frilled shirt explains the rules and history of the air guitar to the audience , which is already growing impatient .
each contestant gets 60 seconds to persuade the audience .
" the decisive factors are the overall artistic impression , the visual presentation , technical ability , the song , everything .
you can , of course , influence the judges through your applause , " he explained .
the three-member jury , comprised of has-been german musicians , awards each contestant with between four and six points .
14 air guitarists give their all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this audience is hungry for scandalous behavior !
after a short performance by a real , e.g. live , band , it 's finally time for the competition .
" hell sinki , " is the first air guitarist to enter the stage .
he 's got a beer in his hand , which he slowly imbibes before starting his performance .
the man in his late 20s sporting a haircut not unlike members of the british band oasis , abuses his imaginary guitar to powerful rock ' n ' roll riffs , his fingers unrhythmically running over the imaginary strings .
he jumps into the air , then slams back down to the ground .
at the end of his performance , he falls off the stage to howls from the audience .
but the jury is stingier with its praise , giving him a 5.7 , 5.5 and a 5.4 .
more embarrassingly good performances follow .
" echodrive , " an older guy , is hopping around the stage chaotically , unaided by the pink floyd music he 's supposed to be accompanying .
with horn-rimmed glasses , an undershirt and red swimming trunks , he fiddles around for most of his performance with his fantasy amplifier which keeps making interference sounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : move over buddy holly , this is our new guitar hiro .
but there are also some highlights , like hiro , a young japanese guy who quickly becomes a crowd favorite .
dressed in a tie , pressed pants and designer glasses , his face is washed over in an ecstatic look as he performs .
then he turns his back to the audience and begins waggling his ass .
by the time he starts wriggling with his fake guitar on the stage floor , it appears he 's already clinched the title .
the stage is then covered in a hail storm of bras and tissues .
when the jury just gives him medium marks , booing fills the hall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i guess i should n't drink before the show next time . "
next up is mark böhmer , the cocky dude from hanover .
for the event , he 's brought along a roadie , who first tests out the guitar .
donning a wife-beater undershirt , böhmer launches into an air guitar version of " delay nuclear " by the hives .
he competently strums his instrument , rolls around on the floor and gets down on his knees .
it 's a powerful performance , but this crowd is not easily pleased .
" you 're an inbred , " yells one member of the audience .
the judges each give him a 5.7 - not bad , but still not enough .
" it did n't go all that well , " he says .
" i would have thought that the jury would have concentrated more on stylistic things or creativity .
but i had the feeling that the most important things to them were appearance and fun factor . "
but soon enough he 's laughing again .
" next time i know that i ca n't drink anything before the performance , otherwise i 'll forget how the song goes . "
the accidental champion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german air guitar champion ingo schulz : i 'm too sexy for my shirt !
one candidate first decided to join the competition when he got to the hall .
ingo schulz -lrb- photo -rrb- , a 33-year-old from berlin , says he did n't even know he was coming here tonight .
he says he did n't feel like going to a disco with techno or house music .
instead , the businessman decided to come here , but only as a spectator .
but then he thought , " why not ? "
he chose a song by ac / dc and grabbed his " guitar . "
with jeans and a checkered shirt he does a mean angus young impersonation , licking his instrument with his tongue and pulling at the strings .
it 's an exceptional performance - pure , honest and without any twaddle .
the jury then crowns schulz the german championship , and this time the audience has no objections .
" when i play songs from ac / dc , " schulz explains , " i get the feeling that the 10 meters that separated me from angus young at his last berlin concert are a lot smaller .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.07.2004 government calls for swift extradition of fallen politician großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french police found holger pfahls in this parisian neighborhood holger pfahls is considered a key figure in the political slush fund scandals of the christian democrats in the 1990s .
following his arrest , new light could be cast on one of germany 's biggest political scandals . german prosecutors on wednesday called for the immediate extradition of holger pfahls , who is suspected of accepting a bribe while serving as deputy defense minister under former conservative chancellor helmut kohl .
the state prosecutor 's office in augsburg said it would likely file an extradition application with french authorities by the end of the week .
french police arrested pfahls on tuesday as he left a paris apartment .
for five years , he had been on germany 's " most wanted " list , suspected of taking nearly € 2 million -lrb- $ 2.4 million -rrb- in bribes for helping german industrial giant thyssen obtain a government arms contract for delivering fuchs tanks to saudi arabia .
he is also widely believed to be involved in the party slush-fund scandal that tainted kohl and his conservative christian democratic union party .
state investigators in the bavarian city of augsburg allege that senior officials in kohl 's government , if not the chancellor himself , authorized the negotiations between pfahls and thyssen which were orchestrated by german-canadian arms dealer karl-heinz schreiber .
tentacles that touched crime after crime bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludwig-holger pfahls in addition to the tank bribes and slush fund scandal , pfahls -lrb- photo -rrb- is also under investigation by french authorities for his suspected involvement in the leuna refinery scandal .
the french federal prosecutor 's office said it suspects pfahls accepted a bribes from french oil giant elf-aquitaine when it purchased the east german refinery in the early 1990s .
if the french seek to pursue the investigation , it could delay or complicate pfahls ' extradition to germany .
prosecution documents in the 2003 elf trial in paris accuse pfahls of pocketing € 8 million of the € 40 million in commissions elf paid out as part of the purchase .
arrest came as surprise in germany , pfahls ' arrest could lead to a reopening of the slush fund investigation .
volker neumann , the man who chaired a parliamentary committee investigating pfahls before he disappeared , said the arrest came unexpectedly .
" mr. pfahls trail was lost in 1999 between taipei and hong kong , and then he disappeared , " neumann said .
" his arrest in france was a big surprise because we believed he was still in asia . "
neumann said pfahls might be able to explain why the alleged bribes flowed in the first place .
but he said the courts would have to be the first to take action .
" first , the courts have priority to bring him to trial for the charges already filed against him .
this concerns the supply of tanks to saudi arabia , " he said .
" whether other charges are brought is not yet clear , although the statute of limitations has expired for most of the allegations . "
however , the opposition christian democrats are refusing to reopen the commission 's work .
wolfgang bosbach , the deputy chairman of the cdu 's parliamentary group , told german public radio broadcaster deutschlandradio he did n't know what purpose a " reanimation " of the commission would serve .
" the ball is now in the court of justice , " bosbach said .
meanwhile , the ruling social democrats are taking a wait-and-see approach .
prosecutors first need to bring pfahls to germany , said spd chief hans müntefering .

following his arrest , new light could be cast on one of germany 's biggest political scandals . german prosecutors on wednesday called for the immediate extradition of holger pfahls , who is suspected of accepting a bribe while serving as deputy defense minister under former conservative chancellor helmut kohl .
the state prosecutor 's office in augsburg said it would likely file an extradition application with french authorities by the end of the week .
french police arrested pfahls on tuesday as he left a paris apartment .
for five years , he had been on germany 's " most wanted " list , suspected of taking nearly € 2 million -lrb- $ 2.4 million -rrb- in bribes for helping german industrial giant thyssen obtain a government arms contract for delivering fuchs tanks to saudi arabia .
he is also widely believed to be involved in the party slush-fund scandal that tainted kohl and his conservative christian democratic union party .
state investigators in the bavarian city of augsburg allege that senior officials in kohl 's government , if not the chancellor himself , authorized the negotiations between pfahls and thyssen which were orchestrated by german-canadian arms dealer karl-heinz schreiber .
tentacles that touched crime after crime bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludwig-holger pfahls in addition to the tank bribes and slush fund scandal , pfahls -lrb- photo -rrb- is also under investigation by french authorities for his suspected involvement in the leuna refinery scandal .
the french federal prosecutor 's office said it suspects pfahls accepted a bribes from french oil giant elf-aquitaine when it purchased the east german refinery in the early 1990s .
if the french seek to pursue the investigation , it could delay or complicate pfahls ' extradition to germany .
prosecution documents in the 2003 elf trial in paris accuse pfahls of pocketing € 8 million of the € 40 million in commissions elf paid out as part of the purchase .
arrest came as surprise in germany , pfahls ' arrest could lead to a reopening of the slush fund investigation .
volker neumann , the man who chaired a parliamentary committee investigating pfahls before he disappeared , said the arrest came unexpectedly .
" mr. pfahls trail was lost in 1999 between taipei and hong kong , and then he disappeared , " neumann said .
" his arrest in france was a big surprise because we believed he was still in asia . "
neumann said pfahls might be able to explain why the alleged bribes flowed in the first place .
but he said the courts would have to be the first to take action .
" first , the courts have priority to bring him to trial for the charges already filed against him .
this concerns the supply of tanks to saudi arabia , " he said .
" whether other charges are brought is not yet clear , although the statute of limitations has expired for most of the allegations . "
however , the opposition christian democrats are refusing to reopen the commission 's work .
wolfgang bosbach , the deputy chairman of the cdu 's parliamentary group , told german public radio broadcaster deutschlandradio he did n't know what purpose a " reanimation " of the commission would serve .
" the ball is now in the court of justice , " bosbach said .
meanwhile , the ruling social democrats are taking a wait-and-see approach .
prosecutors first need to bring pfahls to germany , said spd chief hans müntefering .
" we 're just waiting , there 's no reason to move at a hectic pace , " he said . dw staff -lrb- gb / dsl / ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fugitive german defense official arrested for bribery french police on tuesday apprehended holger pfahls , who served as deputy defense minister from 1989 to 1992 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.07.2004 the business of helping people großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aid organizations depend on the right images to raise money the nature of humanitarian aid has changed as governments outsource more of their development programs to privately-run organizations.the result : the needy are often exploited by the people meant to be helping them . a senior german minister demanded italian police release the captain of a relief ship caught up in a refugee drama off the italian coast . heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , germany 's development minister , said tuesday that elias bierdel could not be punished for wanting to help 37 african refugees he rescued from the water off the coast of sicily . the media storm surrounding bierdel , who captained a ship owned by the german aid organization cap anamur , and the refugees has thrust the work of aid organizations into the public spotlight in the past week .
the growing aid business in germany alone , there are thousands of aid organizations whose business it is to help the needy at home and abroad .
among them are state , half-state , religious and private organizations of all sizes .
in some cases , they 're run by a small staff of volunteers , in others by a huge apparatus with hundreds of permanent employees . a glance at the annual reports of some of these larger organizations gives an idea of the financial frameworks some aid organizations have at their disposal .
together , the groups " brot für die welt " and " caritas " have a budget of around € 170 million -lrb- $ 210 million -rrb- - mostly made up from donations and state grants . along with globalization and privatization , the number of humanitarian and development ngo 's has grown .
in recent years , many governments have chosen to outsource development aid .
aid organizations initially welcomed the trend , seeing themselves more as a part of the civil society alternative , rather than as an extension of state bureaucracy . but in the process , the founders of these organizations failed to notice that they 've become subject to the practical constraints any company experiences , with far-reaching consequences . with new independence , a degree of helplessness " this growth in the private aid industry can be explained by the fact that it 's become common practice in the neo-liberal strain of thought , to privatize any possible state role in this area , " peter lock of the european association for research on transformation told deutsche welle .
" the state has pulled back , and now , aid organizations are in the situation where they are subject to the typical growth constraints . " humanitarian aid organizations in the third world often find themselves in a helpless situation .
caught up in a web of violence that is often perpetrated by war lords who refuse to respect their neutrality , the organizations are denied access to those who need their help .
often , they 're only allowed access when one or both of the warring parties can directly profit from it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a baby is fed via a syringe at a therapeutic feeding centre for malnourished children run by the french aid agency " action contre la faim " in liberia this relative helplessness , coupled with an economic crisis in the donating countries , is changing the character of aid organizations .
their advertising campaigns have to be louder if they want to reach donor 's wallets .
attempts to make a name for themselves - particularly in the media - drive some organizations toward flashier pr activities , or worse , exploitation of the very people they 're meant to be helping . exploitation for a good cause children are ideal in this regard , as are old people and women - images presented without detailing the context of the problem , or the role the aid agencies have taken in these structures .
the problem of small arms and posed photos is a prime example , lock said . " we often hear the message that , in the development of violent societies in which small arms play a big role , woman and children are the central victims .
but when you analyze violence in the third world , you come to the conclusion that violent incidents are most frequently carried out by , and most frequently affect , young men , " lock told deutsche welle . " another example is the use of photo-journalism in ads that , to put it carefully , work with contrived photographs meant to project human suffering out of its social context and into our televisions .
and that 's not very helpful when it comes to finding lasting political solutions for these problems .

" additional savings plans or tax increases would be counter-productive and damaging , they would endanger our economic recovery , " eichel wrote in an article published in the german business daily handelsblatt on wednesday .

eichel said he is sticking to plans to inject around € 15 billion -lrb- $ 18.6 billion -rrb- into the 2005 budget through privatizations in order to keep new debt in check .
eichel welcomed what he said was a " wise ruling " by the eu court , and said that germany is no closer to sanctions than it was before .

as widely predicted by british newspapers , butler 's report did not contain any direct allegations that blair or his government deliberately exaggerated the case for war . flak for intelligence and blair 's style of governance the harshest criticism was directed at the intelligence efforts , largely mirroring a senate report on us spying published last week , which exonerated the regime of president george w. bush . much of britain 's intelligence was based on human sources , the report said . " validation of human intelligence sources after war has thrown doubt on a high proportion of those sources and of their reports ; and hence on the quality of the intelligence assessments received by ministers and officials in the period from summer 2002 to the outbreak of hostilities , " it concluded . additionally , blair 's style of government was criticized , with the report saying that its " informality and circumscribed character " shut much of his cabinet out of the decision-making process . " we do not suggest that there is or should be an ideal or unchangeable system of collective government , still less that procedures are in aggregate any less effective now than in earlier times , " the report said .
" however , we are concerned that the informality and circumscribed character of the government 's procedures which we saw in the context of policy-making towards iraq risks reducing the scope for informed collective political judgment . " no wmd perhaps the most damning indictment for the premier was the conclusion on iraq 's wmd , which blair insisted did exist long after the fall of baghdad in april 2003 , although none have been found by coalition troops . while iraq might have been developing missiles with a longer range than allowed under united nations sanctions , it " did not have significant - if any - stocks of chemical or biological weapons in a state fit for deployment , or developed plans for using them , " the report said . however , it added : " we believe it would be a rash person who asserted at this stage that evidence of iraqi possession of stocks of biological or chemical agents , or even of banned missiles , does not exist or will never be found , " the inquiry found . in one small victory for blair , while the report had some criticisms of sir john scarlett , who co-ordinated intelligence efforts before the war , it recommended that he stay on in his new job as head of the secret intelligence service , or mi6 . there would likely be calls for scarlett to step down , the report said , but added : " we greatly hope that he will not do so .

after years of stalling on the issue , the german car industry has decided to introduce serial production of emission filters for diesel cars .
the announcement comes amidst mounting pressure from environmentalists . while their european neighbors are already driving diesel cars outfitted with emission filters , germans have been wondering why their own carmakers have n't introduced the technology given the government 's pro-environmental stance .
activists from within the greens party and other campaigners for clean air and the reduction of green-house gases had been arguing for years in favor of serial production of filters in new diesel model .
they claim diesel cars emit more carcinogenic sooty particles than traditional fossil-fuel burning cars and are linked to increases in lung cancer and adverse respiratory problems : a study conducted by the federal environmental agency , showed that 14,000 people die prematurely each year as a result of diesel pollution .
filters on the cars can reduce particle emissions by 99 percent , and yet the german automobile branch has in the past adamantly resisted introducing the technology , saying that outfitting smaller cars with the filter would be much too expensive .
now the makers of volkswagen , bmw and mercedes are reversing their position .
they vow that by 2008/2009 all domestic diesel cars will contain a filter .
" diesel cars will be practically emissions free by the end of the decade , " said bernd gottschalk , president of the association of automobile manufacturers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diesel particle filter from bosch government support the german government was integral in implementing the change .
chancellor gerhard schröder , who had previously resisted calls from the greens to reduce diesel emission limits , is now offering tax breaks for owners whose cars fall under the more restrictive eu emissions standards of euro 5 , expected to be introduced in the fall .
currently , all cars with the euro 4 limit of 0.025 grams of particles per kilometer are eligible for tax reductions .
given the guaranteed tax breaks in the future , gottschalk said that by the end of 2006 nearly a quarter of all new diesel cars will be outfitted with the filter ; by the end of 2007 , some 75 percent of all new diesel motors will have filters .
meeting customer demand by offering the filters on all new models , the carmakers are responding to the demands of their customers , gottschalk said .
daimlerchrysler recently announced that more than 80 percent of all its mercedes owners were requesting the inclusion of a built-in emissions filter at purchase .
german environment minister jürgen trittin , one of the strongest advocates of tighter restrictions on emissions welcomed the " insight of the german car industry that they can contribute significantly to the reduction of emissions in the environment .

" i have confidence in the french " that they will not reject the constitution , he added .
after nearly two years of wrangling , european union leaders agreed to the first-ever constitution for the bloc at a historic summit in brussels last month .
the document , which is designed to streamline the expanding eu 's creaking institutions and prevent decision-making deadlock in the now 25-member bloc , must be ratified by all eu member states in the next two years before it comes into full force .
france has now become the latest in a line of countries who have signaled willingness to hold popular votes on the issue .
britain , ireland , denmark and luxembourg have already said they favored letting the people , not the parliament , decide on ratification .
poland , spain , belgium , portugal the netherlands , and the czech republic may also decide to call for a referendum .
risking a " no " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uk independence party urges prime minister , tony blair , not to endorse the european constitution .
analysts agree that a " no " vote in any one eu member state could plunge the eu into a serious crisis , given the sensitive nature of the constitution , which only came into existence through fragile compromises and marathon negotiations .
chirac , however , said it was worth the risk to allow the people a direct say in what effects them .
" the french are directly concerned , and therefore will be directly consulted , " he said in a televised interview and added that he had " confidence in their ability -lrb- the french -rrb- to join in a real debate on their future . "
chirac can rest assured that his countrymen will vote for the constitution .
unlike in britain , recent opinion polls in france have shown that the public is decidedly pro-european and generally endorses more integration on the continent . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european leaders agree on constitution after more than a year of back and forth , european leaders approved the constitution that will serve as the blueprint for the future direction of the eu .

the former aide to ex-chancellor helmut kohl is wanted in connection with clandestine arms deals . he was on germany 's ' most wanted ' list for the past five years .
suspected of tax fraud and of taking nearly € 2 million -lrb- $ 2.4 million -rrb- in bribes in connection with the sale of 36 armored vehicles to saudi arabia , holger pfahls has been on the run from the german government .
on tuesday , police in paris tracked down the former defense official and apprehended him as he left his apartment .
the state prosecutor 's office in the southern german city of augsburg , where the charges were originally brought , confirmed the 62-year old had been arrested .
it is not clear yet when he will be extradicted . pfahls , who is accused of accepting bribes during the 1991 gulf war for helping german industrial giant thyssen obtain a government arms contract for delivering fuchs tanks to saudi arabia , disappeared in the late 1990s before he could be brought to court .
german interior minister otto schily welcomed pfahls ' arrest , saying it was " the result of the excellent work of german federal police -lrb- bka -rrb- . "
" for years , its investigators followed all possible leads .
this persevering work has now been rewarded , " he said .
high-level political scandal pfahls is also widely believed to be involved in the party slush-fund scandal that tainted former chancellor helmut kohl and his conservative christian democrats union .
state investigators allege that senior officials in kohl 's government , if not the chancellor himself , authorized the negotiations between pfahls and thyssen which were orchestrated by german-canadian arms dealer karl-heinz schreiber .
in 2002 , an augsburg state court found that two former managers at thyssen took millions of euros in bribes related to the delivery of the tanks , money they failed to declare to tax authorities .
schreiber , who also took a cut in the deal , was arrested in toronto in 1999 for tax evasion and is currently appealing extradition to germany .

pfahls himself has evaded arrest for five years .
initially bka investigators believed he had fled to the philippines , while the media reported he might be dead .
in recent press reports , however , it was reported that pfahls might be hiding in an upscale paris neighborhood .
the former deputy minister for defense was close to the late ultra-conservative bavarian state premier franz josef strauss and headed his state cabinet between 1981 and 1985 .
before entering kohl 's administration , pfahls directed the former west german domestic intelligence agency . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de how corrupt is germany ?

it could raise further uncomfortable questions for beleaguered british prime minister tony blair . the five- person committee headed by lord butler was set up by the british government to review the quality of intelligence about weapons of mass destruction .
the group is meant to be independent and therefore is not expected to hold back with criticism for the sake of political allegiances . the so-called “ butler report ” comes just a few days after a us senate intelligence committee inquiry concluded that most of the cia 's claims on saddam hussein 's alleged arsenal were overstated or unsupported . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair the key issue for british prime minister , tony blair , will be whether the report finds that his government put any pressure on intelligence services to overestimate the risk posed by former iraqi dictator saddam hussein . the stakes for blair are high .
the butler report will deal in depth with british intelligence about weapons of mass destruction in iraq before the war . blair based his case for war on the confident assertion that saddam hussein had stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons and was a " serious and current threat . " but the iraq survey group , the team that has been scouring iraq for those weapons , has yet to find anything .
last week , blair acknowledged that wmd may never be found . iraq better off today on tuesday tony blair refused to comment about the butler report before it was made public and instead focused on the improvements in iraq , again putting this progress forward as his new justification for the war . " i think it is very hard to look at iraq today , see the country with , yes all the problems from terrorism , but with an internationally backed government that will eventually lead to a properly elected democratic government , a country that can be a stable partner in the international community , a country that can make use of the enormous wealth that it has , " blair said . " i think that it is very difficult to look at iraq today , look at iraq under saddam , and say that we ’ d be better off , the world would be safer , we ’ d be more secure , if saddam was still in charge of iraq . " did blair put pressure intelligence ? lord butler ’ s committee did its work behind closed doors and has made few statements about how it has been progressing .
media speculation about what the findings of the butler report might be has been intense . tony blair got an advance copy of the report on tuesday and so will be ready to respond to the findings .
the findings could reflect badly on blair . in particular the report might say his government pressured intelligence services in some way to overestimate the risk posed by iraq or misrepresented that risk .
many people in britain will be waiting to hear what the butler report has to say about a september 2002 british government dossier that claimed saddam hussein 's forces could deploy chemical and biological weapons within 45 minutes . the report comes a day before two by-elections in the uk .

after years of stalling on the issue , the german car industry has decided to introduce serial production of emission filters for diesel cars .
the announcement comes amidst mounting pressure from environmentalists . while their european neighbors are already driving diesel cars outfitted with emission filters , germans have been wondering why their own carmakers have n't introduced the technology given the government 's pro-environmental stance .
activists from within the greens party and other campaigners for clean air and the reduction of green-house gases had been arguing for years in favor of serial production of filters in new diesel model .
they claim diesel cars emit more carcinogenic sooty particles than traditional fossil-fuel burning cars and are linked to increases in lung cancer and adverse respiratory problems : a study conducted by the federal environmental agency , showed that 14,000 people die prematurely each year as a result of diesel pollution .
filters on the cars can reduce particle emissions by 99 percent , and yet the german automobile branch has in the past adamantly resisted introducing the technology , saying that outfitting smaller cars with the filter would be much too expensive .
now the makers of volkswagen , bmw and mercedes are reversing their position .
they vow that by 2008/2009 all domestic diesel cars will contain a filter .
" diesel cars will be practically emissions free by the end of the decade , " said bernd gottschalk , president of the association of automobile manufacturers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diesel particle filter from bosch government support the german government was integral in implementing the change .
chancellor gerhard schröder , who had previously resisted calls from the greens to reduce diesel emission limits , is now offering tax breaks for owners whose cars fall under the more restrictive eu emissions standards of euro 5 , expected to be introduced in the fall .
currently , all cars with the euro 4 limit of 0.025 grams of particles per kilometer are eligible for tax reductions .
given the guaranteed tax breaks in the future , gottschalk said that by the end of 2006 nearly a quarter of all new diesel cars will be outfitted with the filter ; by the end of 2007 , some 75 percent of all new diesel motors will have filters .
meeting customer demand by offering the filters on all new models , the carmakers are responding to the demands of their customers , gottschalk said .
daimlerchrysler recently announced that more than 80 percent of all its mercedes owners were requesting the inclusion of a built-in emissions filter at purchase .
german environment minister jürgen trittin , one of the strongest advocates of tighter restrictions on emissions welcomed the " insight of the german car industry that they can contribute significantly to the reduction of emissions in the environment .

the former aide to ex-chancellor helmut kohl is wanted in connection with clandestine arms deals . he was on germany 's ' most wanted ' list for the past five years .
suspected of tax fraud and of taking nearly € 2 million -lrb- $ 2.4 million -rrb- in bribes in connection with the sale of 36 armored vehicles to saudi arabia , holger pfahls has been on the run from the german government .
on tuesday , police in paris tracked down the former defense official and apprehended him as he left his apartment .
the state prosecutor 's office in the southern german city of augsburg , where the charges were originally brought , confirmed the 62-year old had been arrested .
it is not clear yet when he will be extradicted . pfahls , who is accused of accepting bribes during the 1991 gulf war for helping german industrial giant thyssen obtain a government arms contract for delivering fuchs tanks to saudi arabia , disappeared in the late 1990s before he could be brought to court .
german interior minister otto schily welcomed pfahls ' arrest , saying it was " the result of the excellent work of german federal police -lrb- bka -rrb- . "
" for years , its investigators followed all possible leads .
this persevering work has now been rewarded , " he said .
high-level political scandal pfahls is also widely believed to be involved in the party slush-fund scandal that tainted former chancellor helmut kohl and his conservative christian democrats union .
state investigators allege that senior officials in kohl 's government , if not the chancellor himself , authorized the negotiations between pfahls and thyssen which were orchestrated by german-canadian arms dealer karl-heinz schreiber .
in 2002 , an augsburg state court found that two former managers at thyssen took millions of euros in bribes related to the delivery of the tanks , money they failed to declare to tax authorities .
schreiber , who also took a cut in the deal , was arrested in toronto in 1999 for tax evasion and is currently appealing extradition to germany .

pfahls himself has evaded arrest for five years .
initially bka investigators believed he had fled to the philippines , while the media reported he might be dead .
in recent press reports , however , it was reported that pfahls might be hiding in an upscale paris neighborhood .
the former deputy minister for defense was close to the late ultra-conservative bavarian state premier franz josef strauss and headed his state cabinet between 1981 and 1985 .
before entering kohl 's administration , pfahls directed the former west german domestic intelligence agency . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de how corrupt is germany ?

on tuesday , police in paris tracked down the former defense official and apprehended him as he left his apartment .
the state prosecutor 's office in the southern german city of augsburg , where the charges were originally brought , confirmed the 62-year old had been arrested .
it is not clear yet when he will be extradicted . pfahls , who is accused of accepting bribes during the 1991 gulf war for helping german industrial giant thyssen obtain a government arms contract for delivering fuchs tanks to saudi arabia , disappeared in the late 1990s before he could be brought to court .
german interior minister otto schily welcomed pfahls ' arrest , saying it was " the result of the excellent work of german federal police -lrb- bka -rrb- . "
" for years , its investigators followed all possible leads .
this persevering work has now been rewarded , " he said .
high-level political scandal pfahls is also widely believed to be involved in the party slush-fund scandal that tainted former chancellor helmut kohl and his conservative christian democrats union .
state investigators allege that senior officials in kohl 's government , if not the chancellor himself , authorized the negotiations between pfahls and thyssen which were orchestrated by german-canadian arms dealer karl-heinz schreiber .
in 2002 , an augsburg state court found that two former managers at thyssen took millions of euros in bribes related to the delivery of the tanks , money they failed to declare to tax authorities .
schreiber , who also took a cut in the deal , was arrested in toronto in 1999 for tax evasion and is currently appealing extradition to germany .

after years of stalling on the issue , the german car industry has decided to introduce serial production of emission filters for diesel cars .
the announcement comes amidst mounting pressure from environmentalists . while their european neighbors are already driving diesel cars outfitted with emission filters , germans have been wondering why their own carmakers have n't introduced the technology given the government 's pro-environmental stance .
activists from within the greens party and other campaigners for clean air and the reduction of green-house gases had been arguing for years in favor of serial production of filters in new diesel model .
they claim diesel cars emit more carcinogenic sooty particles than traditional fossil-fuel burning cars and are linked to increases in lung cancer and adverse respiratory problems : a study conducted by the federal environmental agency , showed that 14,000 people die prematurely each year as a result of diesel pollution .
filters on the cars can reduce particle emissions by 99 percent , and yet the german automobile branch has in the past adamantly resisted introducing the technology , saying that outfitting smaller cars with the filter would be much too expensive .
now the makers of volkswagen , bmw and mercedes are reversing their position .
they vow that by 2008/2009 all domestic diesel cars will contain a filter .
" diesel cars will be practically emissions free by the end of the decade , " said bernd gottschalk , president of the association of automobile manufacturers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diesel particle filter from bosch government support the german government was integral in implementing the change .
chancellor gerhard schröder , who had previously resisted calls from the greens to reduce diesel emission limits , is now offering tax breaks for owners whose cars fall under the more restrictive eu emissions standards of euro 5 , expected to be introduced in the fall .
currently , all cars with the euro 4 limit of 0.025 grams of particles per kilometer are eligible for tax reductions .
given the guaranteed tax breaks in the future , gottschalk said that by the end of 2006 nearly a quarter of all new diesel cars will be outfitted with the filter ; by the end of 2007 , some 75 percent of all new diesel motors will have filters .
meeting customer demand by offering the filters on all new models , the carmakers are responding to the demands of their customers , gottschalk said .
daimlerchrysler recently announced that more than 80 percent of all its mercedes owners were requesting the inclusion of a built-in emissions filter at purchase .

after years of stalling on the issue , the german car industry has decided to introduce serial production of emission filters for diesel cars .
the announcement comes amidst mounting pressure from environmentalists . while their european neighbors are already driving diesel cars outfitted with emission filters , germans have been wondering why their own carmakers have n't introduced the technology given the government 's pro-environmental stance .
activists from within the greens party and other campaigners for clean air and the reduction of green-house gases had been arguing for years in favor of serial production of filters in new diesel model .
they claim diesel cars emit more carcinogenic sooty particles than traditional fossil-fuel burning cars and are linked to increases in lung cancer and adverse respiratory problems : a study conducted by the federal environmental agency , showed that 14,000 people die prematurely each year as a result of diesel pollution .
filters on the cars can reduce particle emissions by 99 percent , and yet the german automobile branch has in the past adamantly resisted introducing the technology , saying that outfitting smaller cars with the filter would be much too expensive .
now the makers of volkswagen , bmw and mercedes are reversing their position .
they vow that by 2008/2009 all domestic diesel cars will contain a filter .
" diesel cars will be practically emissions free by the end of the decade , " said bernd gottschalk , president of the association of automobile manufacturers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diesel particle filter from bosch government support the german government was integral in implementing the change .
chancellor gerhard schröder , who had previously resisted calls from the greens to reduce diesel emission limits , is now offering tax breaks for owners whose cars fall under the more restrictive eu emissions standards of euro 5 , expected to be introduced in the fall .
currently , all cars with the euro 4 limit of 0.025 grams of particles per kilometer are eligible for tax reductions .
given the guaranteed tax breaks in the future , gottschalk said that by the end of 2006 nearly a quarter of all new diesel cars will be outfitted with the filter ; by the end of 2007 , some 75 percent of all new diesel motors will have filters .
meeting customer demand by offering the filters on all new models , the carmakers are responding to the demands of their customers , gottschalk said .
daimlerchrysler recently announced that more than 80 percent of all its mercedes owners were requesting the inclusion of a built-in emissions filter at purchase .
german environment minister jürgen trittin , one of the strongest advocates of tighter restrictions on emissions welcomed the " insight of the german car industry that they can contribute significantly to the reduction of emissions in the environment . " dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debate over diesel car filters heats up german car manufacturers and environmentalists are battling over diesel cars .
should they be fitted with filters , and should motorists who opt for so-called " clean diesel " models be given tax breaks ?
-lrb- july 6 , 2004 -rrb- government split on ' clean diesel ' initiatives berlin says it wants to give tax breaks for cars with clean diesel , but a divided cabinet and automobile industry have stalled the effort - at least for now .

salvage efforts had been hampered by fears of an explosion . the " ena 2 " , a chemical tanker carrying 960 tons of sulphuric acid , collided with a container ship in the port of hamburg on monday .
since then , efforts to clear the wreckage had been hampered by fears of an explosion : when sulphuric acid mixes with water , it creates sulphurous , presenting the danger that the highly flammable fumes could explode . thus , firefighters have been treading lightly , taking time to come-up with a plan to set the tanker - now resting bottom-up - right and pump-out the remaining acid . on saturday , those involved in the rescue operation said that the tanker 's entire load had leaked into the water . despite these revised figures , local environmental authorities and greenpeace experts say a major environmental disaster has been avoided . " in light of these new facts , hamburg has been extraordinarily lucky , " said greenpeace shipping expert christian bussau , adding that the port would probably recover from the accident within a few months . due to the danger of an explosion , the salvage operation had been progressing slowly with a particular emphasis on safety . the tanks were filled with non-flammable nitrogen before the ship was turned upright slowly with the help of cranes . major disaster was avoided at the time of the collision , the driver had a blood alcohol level more than twice the legal limit , according to authorities .
he now faces serious charges carrying a sentence of up to five years in jail and will never be allowed to drive a ship again , according to officials . considering the tanker 's load , it 's a miracle that the disaster did not result in a greater number of injuries and more far-reaching environmental damage , experts said .
eleven people were treated at the time of the explosion for injuries to the respiratory tract and it is estimated that 1,000 fish in the immediate vicinity were killed . " we were lucky that there was n't a further chemical reaction , " said jörg feddern , another expert for greenpeace .

following his arrest , new light could be cast on one of germany 's biggest political scandals . german prosecutors on wednesday called for the immediate extradition of holger pfahls , who is suspected of accepting a bribe while serving as deputy defense minister under former conservative chancellor helmut kohl .
the state prosecutor 's office in augsburg said it would likely file an extradition application with french authorities by the end of the week .
french police arrested pfahls on tuesday as he left a paris apartment .
for five years , he had been on germany 's " most wanted " list , suspected of taking nearly € 2 million -lrb- $ 2.4 million -rrb- in bribes for helping german industrial giant thyssen obtain a government arms contract for delivering fuchs tanks to saudi arabia .
he is also widely believed to be involved in the party slush-fund scandal that tainted kohl and his conservative christian democratic union party .
state investigators in the bavarian city of augsburg allege that senior officials in kohl 's government , if not the chancellor himself , authorized the negotiations between pfahls and thyssen which were orchestrated by german-canadian arms dealer karl-heinz schreiber .
tentacles that touched crime after crime bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludwig-holger pfahls in addition to the tank bribes and slush fund scandal , pfahls -lrb- photo -rrb- is also under investigation by french authorities for his suspected involvement in the leuna refinery scandal .
the french federal prosecutor 's office said it suspects pfahls accepted a bribes from french oil giant elf-aquitaine when it purchased the east german refinery in the early 1990s .
if the french seek to pursue the investigation , it could delay or complicate pfahls ' extradition to germany .
prosecution documents in the 2003 elf trial in paris accuse pfahls of pocketing € 8 million of the € 40 million in commissions elf paid out as part of the purchase .
arrest came as surprise in germany , pfahls ' arrest could lead to a reopening of the slush fund investigation .
volker neumann , the man who chaired a parliamentary committee investigating pfahls before he disappeared , said the arrest came unexpectedly .
" mr. pfahls trail was lost in 1999 between taipei and hong kong , and then he disappeared , " neumann said .
" his arrest in france was a big surprise because we believed he was still in asia . "
neumann said pfahls might be able to explain why the alleged bribes flowed in the first place .
but he said the courts would have to be the first to take action .
" first , the courts have priority to bring him to trial for the charges already filed against him .
this concerns the supply of tanks to saudi arabia , " he said .
" whether other charges are brought is not yet clear , although the statute of limitations has expired for most of the allegations . "
however , the opposition christian democrats are refusing to reopen the commission 's work .
wolfgang bosbach , the deputy chairman of the cdu 's parliamentary group , told german public radio broadcaster deutschlandradio he did n't know what purpose a " reanimation " of the commission would serve .
" the ball is now in the court of justice , " bosbach said .
meanwhile , the ruling social democrats are taking a wait-and-see approach .

the winner will represent germany at the world championships in finland . it 's standing room only tonight at the knorre in berlin .
about 200 people are sitting , standing or huddling body to body at the berlin culture center , with its bar-like atmosphere .
the crowd , hungry for scandalous behavior , is ready to see some sweating and passion at the first-ever national air guitar championship .
the winner will receive an air mattress and a flight to finland , where he or she will represent germany at the ninth-annual air guitar world championship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mark böhmer has winning on his mind tonight there are 14 air guitarists who have dared to make their way to the small stage in an effort to win over the audience and the judges .
" i 'm going to win , obviously , " says mark böhmer -lrb- photo -rrb- , 29 , who 's driven in from hanover to participate .
when he is n't strumming a make-believe guitar , böhmer normally plays the drums , but for the championships in berlin , he 's " playing " a double necked guitar with acoustic strings on one neck and electric strings on the other .
he 's been training for months for the big night : he 's been walking , he 's toned his biceps and he 's done finger exercises .
yet despite all that preparation , he says his performance tonight will mostly be spontaneous , " with the exception of two or three small things i 've put in my program .
instead i 'm going to just look and see what 's happening on stage and what the atmosphere is like . "
when asked if , like in the real world of rock and roll , drugs play an important part in his work , böhmer nods .
" a huge role , " he says , " but i ca n't tell you anything else about that .
but obviously you have to have a beer or two " before going on stage .
it 's an understatement that will be highlighted by events later in the evening .
fighting for world peace before the show , competition organizer friedericke van meer is being chased down by microphone brandishing journalists .
six months ago , the transsexual founded the german air guitar federation with a group of friends .
" i just randomly came across the world association 's web site and was really impressed with what i saw there , especially that air guitar is , in part , a service for world peace , " she explains .
" i was also very interested in the mix between seriousness and self-irony .
i 've never found that kind of mix anywhere else . "
an emcee clad in a velvet pin-striped and a pink-frilled shirt explains the rules and history of the air guitar to the audience , which is already growing impatient .
each contestant gets 60 seconds to persuade the audience .
" the decisive factors are the overall artistic impression , the visual presentation , technical ability , the song , everything .
you can , of course , influence the judges through your applause , " he explained .
the three-member jury , comprised of has-been german musicians , awards each contestant with between four and six points .
14 air guitarists give their all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this audience is hungry for scandalous behavior !
after a short performance by a real , e.g. live , band , it 's finally time for the competition .
" hell sinki , " is the first air guitarist to enter the stage .
he 's got a beer in his hand , which he slowly imbibes before starting his performance .
the man in his late 20s sporting a haircut not unlike members of the british band oasis , abuses his imaginary guitar to powerful rock ' n ' roll riffs , his fingers unrhythmically running over the imaginary strings .
he jumps into the air , then slams back down to the ground .
at the end of his performance , he falls off the stage to howls from the audience .
but the jury is stingier with its praise , giving him a 5.7 , 5.5 and a 5.4 .
more embarrassingly good performances follow .
" echodrive , " an older guy , is hopping around the stage chaotically , unaided by the pink floyd music he 's supposed to be accompanying .
with horn-rimmed glasses , an undershirt and red swimming trunks , he fiddles around for most of his performance with his fantasy amplifier which keeps making interference sounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : move over buddy holly , this is our new guitar hiro .
but there are also some highlights , like hiro , a young japanese guy who quickly becomes a crowd favorite .
dressed in a tie , pressed pants and designer glasses , his face is washed over in an ecstatic look as he performs .
then he turns his back to the audience and begins waggling his ass .
by the time he starts wriggling with his fake guitar on the stage floor , it appears he 's already clinched the title .
the stage is then covered in a hail storm of bras and tissues .
when the jury just gives him medium marks , booing fills the hall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i guess i should n't drink before the show next time . "
next up is mark böhmer , the cocky dude from hanover .
for the event , he 's brought along a roadie , who first tests out the guitar .
donning a wife-beater undershirt , böhmer launches into an air guitar version of " delay nuclear " by the hives .
he competently strums his instrument , rolls around on the floor and gets down on his knees .
it 's a powerful performance , but this crowd is not easily pleased .
" you 're an inbred , " yells one member of the audience .
the judges each give him a 5.7 - not bad , but still not enough .
" it did n't go all that well , " he says .
" i would have thought that the jury would have concentrated more on stylistic things or creativity .
but i had the feeling that the most important things to them were appearance and fun factor . "
but soon enough he 's laughing again .
" next time i know that i ca n't drink anything before the performance , otherwise i 'll forget how the song goes . "
the accidental champion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german air guitar champion ingo schulz : i 'm too sexy for my shirt !
one candidate first decided to join the competition when he got to the hall .
ingo schulz -lrb- photo -rrb- , a 33-year-old from berlin , says he did n't even know he was coming here tonight .
he says he did n't feel like going to a disco with techno or house music .
instead , the businessman decided to come here , but only as a spectator .
but then he thought , " why not ? "
he chose a song by ac / dc and grabbed his " guitar . "
with jeans and a checkered shirt he does a mean angus young impersonation , licking his instrument with his tongue and pulling at the strings .
it 's an exceptional performance - pure , honest and without any twaddle .
the jury then crowns schulz the german championship , and this time the audience has no objections .
" when i play songs from ac / dc , " schulz explains , " i get the feeling that the 10 meters that separated me from angus young at his last berlin concert are a lot smaller .
i feel like the music is alive again , and not just for me .
if it pleases the audience , then it 's even better . "
he 's also got a pretty laid back attitude about representing germany at the world championships in finland next month .
" i 'm definitely going to do ac / dc again , " he says .
" i do n't know if it will be the same song .
so , now it 's time to go to finland for world peace . " andreas leixnering -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links air guitar world championships the official web site of the air guitar world 's premier event .

the stage is then covered in a hail storm of bras and tissues .
when the jury just gives him medium marks , booing fills the hall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i guess i should n't drink before the show next time . "
next up is mark böhmer , the cocky dude from hanover .
for the event , he 's brought along a roadie , who first tests out the guitar .
donning a wife-beater undershirt , böhmer launches into an air guitar version of " delay nuclear " by the hives .
he competently strums his instrument , rolls around on the floor and gets down on his knees .
it 's a powerful performance , but this crowd is not easily pleased .
" you 're an inbred , " yells one member of the audience .
the judges each give him a 5.7 - not bad , but still not enough .
" it did n't go all that well , " he says .
" i would have thought that the jury would have concentrated more on stylistic things or creativity .
but i had the feeling that the most important things to them were appearance and fun factor . "
but soon enough he 's laughing again .
" next time i know that i ca n't drink anything before the performance , otherwise i 'll forget how the song goes . "
the accidental champion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german air guitar champion ingo schulz : i 'm too sexy for my shirt !
one candidate first decided to join the competition when he got to the hall .
ingo schulz -lrb- photo -rrb- , a 33-year-old from berlin , says he did n't even know he was coming here tonight .
he says he did n't feel like going to a disco with techno or house music .
instead , the businessman decided to come here , but only as a spectator .
but then he thought , " why not ? "
he chose a song by ac / dc and grabbed his " guitar . "
with jeans and a checkered shirt he does a mean angus young impersonation , licking his instrument with his tongue and pulling at the strings .
it 's an exceptional performance - pure , honest and without any twaddle .
the jury then crowns schulz the german championship , and this time the audience has no objections .
" when i play songs from ac / dc , " schulz explains , " i get the feeling that the 10 meters that separated me from angus young at his last berlin concert are a lot smaller .
i feel like the music is alive again , and not just for me .
if it pleases the audience , then it 's even better . "
he 's also got a pretty laid back attitude about representing germany at the world championships in finland next month .
" i 'm definitely going to do ac / dc again , " he says .
" i do n't know if it will be the same song .
so , now it 's time to go to finland for world peace . " andreas leixnering -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links air guitar world championships the official web site of the air guitar world 's premier event .

the winner will represent germany at the world championships in finland . it 's standing room only tonight at the knorre in berlin .
about 200 people are sitting , standing or huddling body to body at the berlin culture center , with its bar-like atmosphere .
the crowd , hungry for scandalous behavior , is ready to see some sweating and passion at the first-ever national air guitar championship .
the winner will receive an air mattress and a flight to finland , where he or she will represent germany at the ninth-annual air guitar world championship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mark böhmer has winning on his mind tonight there are 14 air guitarists who have dared to make their way to the small stage in an effort to win over the audience and the judges .
" i 'm going to win , obviously , " says mark böhmer -lrb- photo -rrb- , 29 , who 's driven in from hanover to participate .
when he is n't strumming a make-believe guitar , böhmer normally plays the drums , but for the championships in berlin , he 's " playing " a double necked guitar with acoustic strings on one neck and electric strings on the other .
he 's been training for months for the big night : he 's been walking , he 's toned his biceps and he 's done finger exercises .
yet despite all that preparation , he says his performance tonight will mostly be spontaneous , " with the exception of two or three small things i 've put in my program .
instead i 'm going to just look and see what 's happening on stage and what the atmosphere is like . "
when asked if , like in the real world of rock and roll , drugs play an important part in his work , böhmer nods .
" a huge role , " he says , " but i ca n't tell you anything else about that .
but obviously you have to have a beer or two " before going on stage .
it 's an understatement that will be highlighted by events later in the evening .
fighting for world peace before the show , competition organizer friedericke van meer is being chased down by microphone brandishing journalists .
six months ago , the transsexual founded the german air guitar federation with a group of friends .
" i just randomly came across the world association 's web site and was really impressed with what i saw there , especially that air guitar is , in part , a service for world peace , " she explains .
" i was also very interested in the mix between seriousness and self-irony .
i 've never found that kind of mix anywhere else . "
an emcee clad in a velvet pin-striped and a pink-frilled shirt explains the rules and history of the air guitar to the audience , which is already growing impatient .
each contestant gets 60 seconds to persuade the audience .
" the decisive factors are the overall artistic impression , the visual presentation , technical ability , the song , everything .
you can , of course , influence the judges through your applause , " he explained .
the three-member jury , comprised of has-been german musicians , awards each contestant with between four and six points .
14 air guitarists give their all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this audience is hungry for scandalous behavior !
after a short performance by a real , e.g. live , band , it 's finally time for the competition .
" hell sinki , " is the first air guitarist to enter the stage .
he 's got a beer in his hand , which he slowly imbibes before starting his performance .
the man in his late 20s sporting a haircut not unlike members of the british band oasis , abuses his imaginary guitar to powerful rock ' n ' roll riffs , his fingers unrhythmically running over the imaginary strings .
he jumps into the air , then slams back down to the ground .
at the end of his performance , he falls off the stage to howls from the audience .
but the jury is stingier with its praise , giving him a 5.7 , 5.5 and a 5.4 .
more embarrassingly good performances follow .
" echodrive , " an older guy , is hopping around the stage chaotically , unaided by the pink floyd music he 's supposed to be accompanying .
with horn-rimmed glasses , an undershirt and red swimming trunks , he fiddles around for most of his performance with his fantasy amplifier which keeps making interference sounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : move over buddy holly , this is our new guitar hiro .
but there are also some highlights , like hiro , a young japanese guy who quickly becomes a crowd favorite .
dressed in a tie , pressed pants and designer glasses , his face is washed over in an ecstatic look as he performs .
then he turns his back to the audience and begins waggling his ass .
by the time he starts wriggling with his fake guitar on the stage floor , it appears he 's already clinched the title .
the stage is then covered in a hail storm of bras and tissues .
when the jury just gives him medium marks , booing fills the hall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i guess i should n't drink before the show next time . "
next up is mark böhmer , the cocky dude from hanover .
for the event , he 's brought along a roadie , who first tests out the guitar .
donning a wife-beater undershirt , böhmer launches into an air guitar version of " delay nuclear " by the hives .
he competently strums his instrument , rolls around on the floor and gets down on his knees .
it 's a powerful performance , but this crowd is not easily pleased .
" you 're an inbred , " yells one member of the audience .
the judges each give him a 5.7 - not bad , but still not enough .
" it did n't go all that well , " he says .
" i would have thought that the jury would have concentrated more on stylistic things or creativity .
but i had the feeling that the most important things to them were appearance and fun factor . "
but soon enough he 's laughing again .
" next time i know that i ca n't drink anything before the performance , otherwise i 'll forget how the song goes . "
the accidental champion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german air guitar champion ingo schulz : i 'm too sexy for my shirt !
one candidate first decided to join the competition when he got to the hall .
ingo schulz -lrb- photo -rrb- , a 33-year-old from berlin , says he did n't even know he was coming here tonight .
he says he did n't feel like going to a disco with techno or house music .
instead , the businessman decided to come here , but only as a spectator .
but then he thought , " why not ? "
he chose a song by ac / dc and grabbed his " guitar . "
with jeans and a checkered shirt he does a mean angus young impersonation , licking his instrument with his tongue and pulling at the strings .
it 's an exceptional performance - pure , honest and without any twaddle .
the jury then crowns schulz the german championship , and this time the audience has no objections .
" when i play songs from ac / dc , " schulz explains , " i get the feeling that the 10 meters that separated me from angus young at his last berlin concert are a lot smaller .
i feel like the music is alive again , and not just for me .
if it pleases the audience , then it 's even better . "
he 's also got a pretty laid back attitude about representing germany at the world championships in finland next month .
" i 'm definitely going to do ac / dc again , " he says .
" i do n't know if it will be the same song .
so , now it 's time to go to finland for world peace . " andreas leixnering -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links air guitar world championships the official web site of the air guitar world 's premier event .

the former aide to ex-chancellor helmut kohl is wanted in connection with clandestine arms deals . he was on germany 's ' most wanted ' list for the past five years .
suspected of tax fraud and of taking nearly € 2 million -lrb- $ 2.4 million -rrb- in bribes in connection with the sale of 36 armored vehicles to saudi arabia , holger pfahls has been on the run from the german government .
on tuesday , police in paris tracked down the former defense official and apprehended him as he left his apartment .
the state prosecutor 's office in the southern german city of augsburg , where the charges were originally brought , confirmed the 62-year old had been arrested .
it is not clear yet when he will be extradicted . pfahls , who is accused of accepting bribes during the 1991 gulf war for helping german industrial giant thyssen obtain a government arms contract for delivering fuchs tanks to saudi arabia , disappeared in the late 1990s before he could be brought to court .
german interior minister otto schily welcomed pfahls ' arrest , saying it was " the result of the excellent work of german federal police -lrb- bka -rrb- . "
" for years , its investigators followed all possible leads .
this persevering work has now been rewarded , " he said .
high-level political scandal pfahls is also widely believed to be involved in the party slush-fund scandal that tainted former chancellor helmut kohl and his conservative christian democrats union .
state investigators allege that senior officials in kohl 's government , if not the chancellor himself , authorized the negotiations between pfahls and thyssen which were orchestrated by german-canadian arms dealer karl-heinz schreiber .
in 2002 , an augsburg state court found that two former managers at thyssen took millions of euros in bribes related to the delivery of the tanks , money they failed to declare to tax authorities .
schreiber , who also took a cut in the deal , was arrested in toronto in 1999 for tax evasion and is currently appealing extradition to germany .

the former aide to ex-chancellor helmut kohl is wanted in connection with clandestine arms deals . he was on germany 's ' most wanted ' list for the past five years .
suspected of tax fraud and of taking nearly € 2 million -lrb- $ 2.4 million -rrb- in bribes in connection with the sale of 36 armored vehicles to saudi arabia , holger pfahls has been on the run from the german government .
on tuesday , police in paris tracked down the former defense official and apprehended him as he left his apartment .
the state prosecutor 's office in the southern german city of augsburg , where the charges were originally brought , confirmed the 62-year old had been arrested .
it is not clear yet when he will be extradicted . pfahls , who is accused of accepting bribes during the 1991 gulf war for helping german industrial giant thyssen obtain a government arms contract for delivering fuchs tanks to saudi arabia , disappeared in the late 1990s before he could be brought to court .
german interior minister otto schily welcomed pfahls ' arrest , saying it was " the result of the excellent work of german federal police -lrb- bka -rrb- . "
" for years , its investigators followed all possible leads .
this persevering work has now been rewarded , " he said .
high-level political scandal pfahls is also widely believed to be involved in the party slush-fund scandal that tainted former chancellor helmut kohl and his conservative christian democrats union .
state investigators allege that senior officials in kohl 's government , if not the chancellor himself , authorized the negotiations between pfahls and thyssen which were orchestrated by german-canadian arms dealer karl-heinz schreiber .
in 2002 , an augsburg state court found that two former managers at thyssen took millions of euros in bribes related to the delivery of the tanks , money they failed to declare to tax authorities .
schreiber , who also took a cut in the deal , was arrested in toronto in 1999 for tax evasion and is currently appealing extradition to germany .

pfahls himself has evaded arrest for five years .
initially bka investigators believed he had fled to the philippines , while the media reported he might be dead .
in recent press reports , however , it was reported that pfahls might be hiding in an upscale paris neighborhood .
the former deputy minister for defense was close to the late ultra-conservative bavarian state premier franz josef strauss and headed his state cabinet between 1981 and 1985 .

" i have confidence in the french " that they will not reject the constitution , he added .
after nearly two years of wrangling , european union leaders agreed to the first-ever constitution for the bloc at a historic summit in brussels last month .
the document , which is designed to streamline the expanding eu 's creaking institutions and prevent decision-making deadlock in the now 25-member bloc , must be ratified by all eu member states in the next two years before it comes into full force .
france has now become the latest in a line of countries who have signaled willingness to hold popular votes on the issue .
britain , ireland , denmark and luxembourg have already said they favored letting the people , not the parliament , decide on ratification .
poland , spain , belgium , portugal the netherlands , and the czech republic may also decide to call for a referendum .
risking a " no " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uk independence party urges prime minister , tony blair , not to endorse the european constitution .
analysts agree that a " no " vote in any one eu member state could plunge the eu into a serious crisis , given the sensitive nature of the constitution , which only came into existence through fragile compromises and marathon negotiations .
chirac , however , said it was worth the risk to allow the people a direct say in what effects them .
" the french are directly concerned , and therefore will be directly consulted , " he said in a televised interview and added that he had " confidence in their ability -lrb- the french -rrb- to join in a real debate on their future . "
chirac can rest assured that his countrymen will vote for the constitution .

following his arrest , new light could be cast on one of germany 's biggest political scandals . german prosecutors on wednesday called for the immediate extradition of holger pfahls , who is suspected of accepting a bribe while serving as deputy defense minister under former conservative chancellor helmut kohl .
the state prosecutor 's office in augsburg said it would likely file an extradition application with french authorities by the end of the week .
french police arrested pfahls on tuesday as he left a paris apartment .
for five years , he had been on germany 's " most wanted " list , suspected of taking nearly € 2 million -lrb- $ 2.4 million -rrb- in bribes for helping german industrial giant thyssen obtain a government arms contract for delivering fuchs tanks to saudi arabia .
he is also widely believed to be involved in the party slush-fund scandal that tainted kohl and his conservative christian democratic union party .
state investigators in the bavarian city of augsburg allege that senior officials in kohl 's government , if not the chancellor himself , authorized the negotiations between pfahls and thyssen which were orchestrated by german-canadian arms dealer karl-heinz schreiber .
tentacles that touched crime after crime bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludwig-holger pfahls in addition to the tank bribes and slush fund scandal , pfahls -lrb- photo -rrb- is also under investigation by french authorities for his suspected involvement in the leuna refinery scandal .
the french federal prosecutor 's office said it suspects pfahls accepted a bribes from french oil giant elf-aquitaine when it purchased the east german refinery in the early 1990s .
if the french seek to pursue the investigation , it could delay or complicate pfahls ' extradition to germany .
prosecution documents in the 2003 elf trial in paris accuse pfahls of pocketing € 8 million of the € 40 million in commissions elf paid out as part of the purchase .
arrest came as surprise in germany , pfahls ' arrest could lead to a reopening of the slush fund investigation .
volker neumann , the man who chaired a parliamentary committee investigating pfahls before he disappeared , said the arrest came unexpectedly .
" mr. pfahls trail was lost in 1999 between taipei and hong kong , and then he disappeared , " neumann said .
" his arrest in france was a big surprise because we believed he was still in asia . "
neumann said pfahls might be able to explain why the alleged bribes flowed in the first place .
but he said the courts would have to be the first to take action .
" first , the courts have priority to bring him to trial for the charges already filed against him .
this concerns the supply of tanks to saudi arabia , " he said .
" whether other charges are brought is not yet clear , although the statute of limitations has expired for most of the allegations . "
however , the opposition christian democrats are refusing to reopen the commission 's work .
wolfgang bosbach , the deputy chairman of the cdu 's parliamentary group , told german public radio broadcaster deutschlandradio he did n't know what purpose a " reanimation " of the commission would serve .
" the ball is now in the court of justice , " bosbach said .
meanwhile , the ruling social democrats are taking a wait-and-see approach .
prosecutors first need to bring pfahls to germany , said spd chief hans müntefering .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 14.07.2004 german cars get diesel filters by 2009 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diesel gas may be cheaper , but it 's a lot more deadly .
after years of stalling on the issue , the german car industry has decided to introduce serial production of emission filters for diesel cars .
the announcement comes amidst mounting pressure from environmentalists . while their european neighbors are already driving diesel cars outfitted with emission filters , germans have been wondering why their own carmakers have n't introduced the technology given the government 's pro-environmental stance .
activists from within the greens party and other campaigners for clean air and the reduction of green-house gases had been arguing for years in favor of serial production of filters in new diesel model .
they claim diesel cars emit more carcinogenic sooty particles than traditional fossil-fuel burning cars and are linked to increases in lung cancer and adverse respiratory problems : a study conducted by the federal environmental agency , showed that 14,000 people die prematurely each year as a result of diesel pollution .

the group is meant to be independent and therefore is not expected to hold back with criticism for the sake of political allegiances . the so-called “ butler report ” comes just a few days after a us senate intelligence committee inquiry concluded that most of the cia 's claims on saddam hussein 's alleged arsenal were overstated or unsupported . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair the key issue for british prime minister , tony blair , will be whether the report finds that his government put any pressure on intelligence services to overestimate the risk posed by former iraqi dictator saddam hussein . the stakes for blair are high .
the butler report will deal in depth with british intelligence about weapons of mass destruction in iraq before the war . blair based his case for war on the confident assertion that saddam hussein had stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons and was a " serious and current threat . " but the iraq survey group , the team that has been scouring iraq for those weapons , has yet to find anything .
last week , blair acknowledged that wmd may never be found . iraq better off today on tuesday tony blair refused to comment about the butler report before it was made public and instead focused on the improvements in iraq , again putting this progress forward as his new justification for the war . " i think it is very hard to look at iraq today , see the country with , yes all the problems from terrorism , but with an internationally backed government that will eventually lead to a properly elected democratic government , a country that can be a stable partner in the international community , a country that can make use of the enormous wealth that it has , " blair said . " i think that it is very difficult to look at iraq today , look at iraq under saddam , and say that we ’ d be better off , the world would be safer , we ’ d be more secure , if saddam was still in charge of iraq . " did blair put pressure intelligence ? lord butler ’ s committee did its work behind closed doors and has made few statements about how it has been progressing .
media speculation about what the findings of the butler report might be has been intense . tony blair got an advance copy of the report on tuesday and so will be ready to respond to the findings .
the findings could reflect badly on blair . in particular the report might say his government pressured intelligence services in some way to overestimate the risk posed by iraq or misrepresented that risk .
many people in britain will be waiting to hear what the butler report has to say about a september 2002 british government dossier that claimed saddam hussein 's forces could deploy chemical and biological weapons within 45 minutes . the report comes a day before two by-elections in the uk .
the elections are in safe labor party strongholds , but opposition to the war , particularly among muslim communities , could cost tony blair ’ s party votes . martin vogl -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair bracing for another tough test it 's a tough week ahead for british prime minister tony blair as he braces for a fresh hit over iraq on the eve of two closely watched by-elections , in which voters could deliver stinging defeats to his labour party .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.07.2004 dung good großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : compost may not smell nice , but it can create energy for thousands germany wants to increase its use of renewable energies for electricity production to 12.5 percent by 2010 .
a model project shows that biomass created from farm and factory waste can produce energy for 1,000 homes . sven nevigmann , one of the workers at the loick biomass plant in the village of dorsten , is looking over the operation , which is filled with swine and other animals whose manure is combined with food and other organic substances to create biomass , which in turns makes biogas that can be used for energy production .
the biomass goes through several production processes here at the plant before it is ready for consumption .
biomass projects like this across germany are essential elements of the government 's plan to increase its reliance on renewable energies – including wind and solar power – to 12.5 percent of all electricity development by 2010 .
in the western german state of north rhine-westphalia , where the loick plant is located , about 6 percent of energy production already comes from renewable energy supplies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i 'm good eating and i can heat your home ! "
" we use about 12,000 tons of biomass a year , that is about 6,000 tons of manure , pig and cow manure , and renewable biomass , and about 6,000 tons of food waste and other biodegradable biomass , " said marcel hengst , supervisor at the loick plant .
fermenting the future at loick , manure is mixed with other organic materials that mostly come from a small company nearby that produces deep frozen vegetables .
what the company can ’ t use in its products is then sent to loick to make energy .
it is combined with pig and cow manure that is brought in from nearby farms .
along with these products , corn grown at the plant and food waste are also fed in stages through a number of processing tanks where the organic waste products are fermented .
this then produces biogas along with a rich fertilizer that is highly sought after by local farmers .
in total , the fermentation process takes about 25-30 days .
" this is a single-step fermentation process , " explains hengst , " the fermentation process can be divided into four steps , and those four steps take place in the digester , a 1,000 cubic meter facility that contains a tank that degrades the biomass into valuable fertilizer and biogas . "
the biogras is then placed in a so-called " co-generation unit " that combines heat and power to generate electricity .
the company is paid an attractive premium of about 10 euro cents a kilowatt hour for the electricity it produces from biomass .
a showcase project the loick plant , which is located on an operating farm owned by hubert loick and sponsored by the state of north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- and the fraunhofer institute for environmental , safety and energy technology , was opened in september 2001 as a demonstration facility for biomass technology .
bernd kunott of nrw ’ s ministry of research , says projects like loick are important elements of germany ’ s ambitious renewable energies strategy .
because it transforms waste into valuable energy , it is also innovative , he says .
" there is very much waste you can use for energy purposes .
this one produces energy , electricity for nearly 1,000 households with four persons . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a backhoe picks up chipped wood that is going to be used for biomass production .
because it relies fermentation to produce its energy , biomass also has a major advantage over other renewable energy sources : it is not dependant on the sun shining or the wind blowing to produce energy .
it also has great potential – the german agricultural ministry estimates that , across the country , more than 190 million tons of manure , along with 25 million tons of organic waste , are available for biomass production .
if only 50 percent of that figure were put to the production of electricity or heat , the ministry estimates , either 1.7 million german homes could be provided with heating or the entire electricity needs for 4 million homes could be covered .
helping farmers help themselves but biomass is still largely in its infancy in germany .
of the potential 200,000 biomass facilities that could be built in the country , there are currently only about 1,000 .
still , for farmers like loick , it ’ s an attractive proposition that can help expand the bottom line .
" a farmer can better calculate his annual earnings -lrb- by creating a biomass plant -rrb- , " north rhine-westphalia environment minister bärbel höhn recently said .

a model project shows that biomass created from farm and factory waste can produce energy for 1,000 homes . sven nevigmann , one of the workers at the loick biomass plant in the village of dorsten , is looking over the operation , which is filled with swine and other animals whose manure is combined with food and other organic substances to create biomass , which in turns makes biogas that can be used for energy production .
the biomass goes through several production processes here at the plant before it is ready for consumption .
biomass projects like this across germany are essential elements of the government 's plan to increase its reliance on renewable energies – including wind and solar power – to 12.5 percent of all electricity development by 2010 .
in the western german state of north rhine-westphalia , where the loick plant is located , about 6 percent of energy production already comes from renewable energy supplies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i 'm good eating and i can heat your home ! "
" we use about 12,000 tons of biomass a year , that is about 6,000 tons of manure , pig and cow manure , and renewable biomass , and about 6,000 tons of food waste and other biodegradable biomass , " said marcel hengst , supervisor at the loick plant .
fermenting the future at loick , manure is mixed with other organic materials that mostly come from a small company nearby that produces deep frozen vegetables .
what the company can ’ t use in its products is then sent to loick to make energy .
it is combined with pig and cow manure that is brought in from nearby farms .
along with these products , corn grown at the plant and food waste are also fed in stages through a number of processing tanks where the organic waste products are fermented .
this then produces biogas along with a rich fertilizer that is highly sought after by local farmers .
in total , the fermentation process takes about 25-30 days .
" this is a single-step fermentation process , " explains hengst , " the fermentation process can be divided into four steps , and those four steps take place in the digester , a 1,000 cubic meter facility that contains a tank that degrades the biomass into valuable fertilizer and biogas . "
the biogras is then placed in a so-called " co-generation unit " that combines heat and power to generate electricity .
the company is paid an attractive premium of about 10 euro cents a kilowatt hour for the electricity it produces from biomass .
a showcase project the loick plant , which is located on an operating farm owned by hubert loick and sponsored by the state of north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- and the fraunhofer institute for environmental , safety and energy technology , was opened in september 2001 as a demonstration facility for biomass technology .
bernd kunott of nrw ’ s ministry of research , says projects like loick are important elements of germany ’ s ambitious renewable energies strategy .
because it transforms waste into valuable energy , it is also innovative , he says .
" there is very much waste you can use for energy purposes .
this one produces energy , electricity for nearly 1,000 households with four persons . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a backhoe picks up chipped wood that is going to be used for biomass production .
because it relies fermentation to produce its energy , biomass also has a major advantage over other renewable energy sources : it is not dependant on the sun shining or the wind blowing to produce energy .
it also has great potential – the german agricultural ministry estimates that , across the country , more than 190 million tons of manure , along with 25 million tons of organic waste , are available for biomass production .
if only 50 percent of that figure were put to the production of electricity or heat , the ministry estimates , either 1.7 million german homes could be provided with heating or the entire electricity needs for 4 million homes could be covered .
helping farmers help themselves but biomass is still largely in its infancy in germany .
of the potential 200,000 biomass facilities that could be built in the country , there are currently only about 1,000 .
still , for farmers like loick , it ’ s an attractive proposition that can help expand the bottom line .
" a farmer can better calculate his annual earnings -lrb- by creating a biomass plant -rrb- , " north rhine-westphalia environment minister bärbel höhn recently said .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i 'm good eating and i can heat your home ! "
" we use about 12,000 tons of biomass a year , that is about 6,000 tons of manure , pig and cow manure , and renewable biomass , and about 6,000 tons of food waste and other biodegradable biomass , " said marcel hengst , supervisor at the loick plant .
fermenting the future at loick , manure is mixed with other organic materials that mostly come from a small company nearby that produces deep frozen vegetables .
what the company can ’ t use in its products is then sent to loick to make energy .
it is combined with pig and cow manure that is brought in from nearby farms .
along with these products , corn grown at the plant and food waste are also fed in stages through a number of processing tanks where the organic waste products are fermented .
this then produces biogas along with a rich fertilizer that is highly sought after by local farmers .
in total , the fermentation process takes about 25-30 days .
" this is a single-step fermentation process , " explains hengst , " the fermentation process can be divided into four steps , and those four steps take place in the digester , a 1,000 cubic meter facility that contains a tank that degrades the biomass into valuable fertilizer and biogas . "
the biogras is then placed in a so-called " co-generation unit " that combines heat and power to generate electricity .
the company is paid an attractive premium of about 10 euro cents a kilowatt hour for the electricity it produces from biomass .
a showcase project the loick plant , which is located on an operating farm owned by hubert loick and sponsored by the state of north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- and the fraunhofer institute for environmental , safety and energy technology , was opened in september 2001 as a demonstration facility for biomass technology .
bernd kunott of nrw ’ s ministry of research , says projects like loick are important elements of germany ’ s ambitious renewable energies strategy .
because it transforms waste into valuable energy , it is also innovative , he says .
" there is very much waste you can use for energy purposes .
this one produces energy , electricity for nearly 1,000 households with four persons . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a backhoe picks up chipped wood that is going to be used for biomass production .
because it relies fermentation to produce its energy , biomass also has a major advantage over other renewable energy sources : it is not dependant on the sun shining or the wind blowing to produce energy .
it also has great potential – the german agricultural ministry estimates that , across the country , more than 190 million tons of manure , along with 25 million tons of organic waste , are available for biomass production .
if only 50 percent of that figure were put to the production of electricity or heat , the ministry estimates , either 1.7 million german homes could be provided with heating or the entire electricity needs for 4 million homes could be covered .
helping farmers help themselves but biomass is still largely in its infancy in germany .
of the potential 200,000 biomass facilities that could be built in the country , there are currently only about 1,000 .
still , for farmers like loick , it ’ s an attractive proposition that can help expand the bottom line .
" a farmer can better calculate his annual earnings -lrb- by creating a biomass plant -rrb- , " north rhine-westphalia environment minister bärbel höhn recently said .
" the idea of making a farmer an energy producer is a realistic perspective .

the document , which is designed to streamline the expanding eu 's creaking institutions and prevent decision-making deadlock in the now 25-member bloc , must be ratified by all eu member states in the next two years before it comes into full force .
france has now become the latest in a line of countries who have signaled willingness to hold popular votes on the issue .

salvage efforts had been hampered by fears of an explosion . the " ena 2 " , a chemical tanker carrying 960 tons of sulphuric acid , collided with a container ship in the port of hamburg on monday .
since then , efforts to clear the wreckage had been hampered by fears of an explosion : when sulphuric acid mixes with water , it creates sulphurous , presenting the danger that the highly flammable fumes could explode . thus , firefighters have been treading lightly , taking time to come-up with a plan to set the tanker - now resting bottom-up - right and pump-out the remaining acid . on saturday , those involved in the rescue operation said that the tanker 's entire load had leaked into the water . despite these revised figures , local environmental authorities and greenpeace experts say a major environmental disaster has been avoided . " in light of these new facts , hamburg has been extraordinarily lucky , " said greenpeace shipping expert christian bussau , adding that the port would probably recover from the accident within a few months . due to the danger of an explosion , the salvage operation had been progressing slowly with a particular emphasis on safety . the tanks were filled with non-flammable nitrogen before the ship was turned upright slowly with the help of cranes . major disaster was avoided at the time of the collision , the driver had a blood alcohol level more than twice the legal limit , according to authorities .

the winner will represent germany at the world championships in finland . it 's standing room only tonight at the knorre in berlin .
about 200 people are sitting , standing or huddling body to body at the berlin culture center , with its bar-like atmosphere .
the crowd , hungry for scandalous behavior , is ready to see some sweating and passion at the first-ever national air guitar championship .
the winner will receive an air mattress and a flight to finland , where he or she will represent germany at the ninth-annual air guitar world championship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mark böhmer has winning on his mind tonight there are 14 air guitarists who have dared to make their way to the small stage in an effort to win over the audience and the judges .
" i 'm going to win , obviously , " says mark böhmer -lrb- photo -rrb- , 29 , who 's driven in from hanover to participate .
when he is n't strumming a make-believe guitar , böhmer normally plays the drums , but for the championships in berlin , he 's " playing " a double necked guitar with acoustic strings on one neck and electric strings on the other .
he 's been training for months for the big night : he 's been walking , he 's toned his biceps and he 's done finger exercises .
yet despite all that preparation , he says his performance tonight will mostly be spontaneous , " with the exception of two or three small things i 've put in my program .
instead i 'm going to just look and see what 's happening on stage and what the atmosphere is like . "
when asked if , like in the real world of rock and roll , drugs play an important part in his work , böhmer nods .
" a huge role , " he says , " but i ca n't tell you anything else about that .
but obviously you have to have a beer or two " before going on stage .
it 's an understatement that will be highlighted by events later in the evening .
fighting for world peace before the show , competition organizer friedericke van meer is being chased down by microphone brandishing journalists .
six months ago , the transsexual founded the german air guitar federation with a group of friends .
" i just randomly came across the world association 's web site and was really impressed with what i saw there , especially that air guitar is , in part , a service for world peace , " she explains .
" i was also very interested in the mix between seriousness and self-irony .
i 've never found that kind of mix anywhere else . "
an emcee clad in a velvet pin-striped and a pink-frilled shirt explains the rules and history of the air guitar to the audience , which is already growing impatient .
each contestant gets 60 seconds to persuade the audience .
" the decisive factors are the overall artistic impression , the visual presentation , technical ability , the song , everything .
you can , of course , influence the judges through your applause , " he explained .
the three-member jury , comprised of has-been german musicians , awards each contestant with between four and six points .
14 air guitarists give their all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this audience is hungry for scandalous behavior !
after a short performance by a real , e.g. live , band , it 's finally time for the competition .
" hell sinki , " is the first air guitarist to enter the stage .
he 's got a beer in his hand , which he slowly imbibes before starting his performance .
the man in his late 20s sporting a haircut not unlike members of the british band oasis , abuses his imaginary guitar to powerful rock ' n ' roll riffs , his fingers unrhythmically running over the imaginary strings .
he jumps into the air , then slams back down to the ground .
at the end of his performance , he falls off the stage to howls from the audience .
but the jury is stingier with its praise , giving him a 5.7 , 5.5 and a 5.4 .
more embarrassingly good performances follow .
" echodrive , " an older guy , is hopping around the stage chaotically , unaided by the pink floyd music he 's supposed to be accompanying .
with horn-rimmed glasses , an undershirt and red swimming trunks , he fiddles around for most of his performance with his fantasy amplifier which keeps making interference sounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : move over buddy holly , this is our new guitar hiro .
but there are also some highlights , like hiro , a young japanese guy who quickly becomes a crowd favorite .
dressed in a tie , pressed pants and designer glasses , his face is washed over in an ecstatic look as he performs .
then he turns his back to the audience and begins waggling his ass .
by the time he starts wriggling with his fake guitar on the stage floor , it appears he 's already clinched the title .
the stage is then covered in a hail storm of bras and tissues .
when the jury just gives him medium marks , booing fills the hall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i guess i should n't drink before the show next time . "
next up is mark böhmer , the cocky dude from hanover .
for the event , he 's brought along a roadie , who first tests out the guitar .
donning a wife-beater undershirt , böhmer launches into an air guitar version of " delay nuclear " by the hives .
he competently strums his instrument , rolls around on the floor and gets down on his knees .
it 's a powerful performance , but this crowd is not easily pleased .
" you 're an inbred , " yells one member of the audience .
the judges each give him a 5.7 - not bad , but still not enough .
" it did n't go all that well , " he says .
" i would have thought that the jury would have concentrated more on stylistic things or creativity .
but i had the feeling that the most important things to them were appearance and fun factor . "
but soon enough he 's laughing again .
" next time i know that i ca n't drink anything before the performance , otherwise i 'll forget how the song goes . "
the accidental champion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german air guitar champion ingo schulz : i 'm too sexy for my shirt !
one candidate first decided to join the competition when he got to the hall .
ingo schulz -lrb- photo -rrb- , a 33-year-old from berlin , says he did n't even know he was coming here tonight .
he says he did n't feel like going to a disco with techno or house music .
instead , the businessman decided to come here , but only as a spectator .
but then he thought , " why not ? "
he chose a song by ac / dc and grabbed his " guitar . "
with jeans and a checkered shirt he does a mean angus young impersonation , licking his instrument with his tongue and pulling at the strings .
it 's an exceptional performance - pure , honest and without any twaddle .
the jury then crowns schulz the german championship , and this time the audience has no objections .
" when i play songs from ac / dc , " schulz explains , " i get the feeling that the 10 meters that separated me from angus young at his last berlin concert are a lot smaller .
i feel like the music is alive again , and not just for me .
if it pleases the audience , then it 's even better . "
he 's also got a pretty laid back attitude about representing germany at the world championships in finland next month .
" i 'm definitely going to do ac / dc again , " he says .
" i do n't know if it will be the same song .
so , now it 's time to go to finland for world peace . " andreas leixnering -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links air guitar world championships the official web site of the air guitar world 's premier event .

but there are also some highlights , like hiro , a young japanese guy who quickly becomes a crowd favorite .
dressed in a tie , pressed pants and designer glasses , his face is washed over in an ecstatic look as he performs .
then he turns his back to the audience and begins waggling his ass .
by the time he starts wriggling with his fake guitar on the stage floor , it appears he 's already clinched the title .
the stage is then covered in a hail storm of bras and tissues .
when the jury just gives him medium marks , booing fills the hall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i guess i should n't drink before the show next time . "
next up is mark böhmer , the cocky dude from hanover .
for the event , he 's brought along a roadie , who first tests out the guitar .
donning a wife-beater undershirt , böhmer launches into an air guitar version of " delay nuclear " by the hives .
he competently strums his instrument , rolls around on the floor and gets down on his knees .
it 's a powerful performance , but this crowd is not easily pleased .
" you 're an inbred , " yells one member of the audience .
the judges each give him a 5.7 - not bad , but still not enough .
" it did n't go all that well , " he says .
" i would have thought that the jury would have concentrated more on stylistic things or creativity .
but i had the feeling that the most important things to them were appearance and fun factor . "
but soon enough he 's laughing again .
" next time i know that i ca n't drink anything before the performance , otherwise i 'll forget how the song goes . "
the accidental champion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german air guitar champion ingo schulz : i 'm too sexy for my shirt !
one candidate first decided to join the competition when he got to the hall .
ingo schulz -lrb- photo -rrb- , a 33-year-old from berlin , says he did n't even know he was coming here tonight .
he says he did n't feel like going to a disco with techno or house music .
instead , the businessman decided to come here , but only as a spectator .
but then he thought , " why not ? "
he chose a song by ac / dc and grabbed his " guitar . "
with jeans and a checkered shirt he does a mean angus young impersonation , licking his instrument with his tongue and pulling at the strings .
it 's an exceptional performance - pure , honest and without any twaddle .
the jury then crowns schulz the german championship , and this time the audience has no objections .
" when i play songs from ac / dc , " schulz explains , " i get the feeling that the 10 meters that separated me from angus young at his last berlin concert are a lot smaller .
i feel like the music is alive again , and not just for me .
if it pleases the audience , then it 's even better . "
he 's also got a pretty laid back attitude about representing germany at the world championships in finland next month .
" i 'm definitely going to do ac / dc again , " he says .
" i do n't know if it will be the same song .
so , now it 's time to go to finland for world peace . " andreas leixnering -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links air guitar world championships the official web site of the air guitar world 's premier event .

" i have confidence in the french " that they will not reject the constitution , he added .
after nearly two years of wrangling , european union leaders agreed to the first-ever constitution for the bloc at a historic summit in brussels last month .
the document , which is designed to streamline the expanding eu 's creaking institutions and prevent decision-making deadlock in the now 25-member bloc , must be ratified by all eu member states in the next two years before it comes into full force .
france has now become the latest in a line of countries who have signaled willingness to hold popular votes on the issue .
britain , ireland , denmark and luxembourg have already said they favored letting the people , not the parliament , decide on ratification .

with a two-thirds majority of the 191-member un general assembly required to pass any kind of reform resolution , germany is not just lobbying the global heavyweights but even smaller countries . " working towards the same goal " the most recent campaign offensive involves a ten-day tour of south asia by german foreign minister joschka fischer .

" there 's nothing negative in their relationship , no conflict of interest , so the two could really work together towards the same goal , " anuradha chenoy , international relations expert at new delhi 's jawaharlal nehru university told dw-world . indeed , the indo-german relationship , traditionally close , has grown stronger since german reunification and india 's economic reform process in the 1990s .

salvage efforts had been hampered by fears of an explosion . the " ena 2 " , a chemical tanker carrying 960 tons of sulphuric acid , collided with a container ship in the port of hamburg on monday .
since then , efforts to clear the wreckage had been hampered by fears of an explosion : when sulphuric acid mixes with water , it creates sulphurous , presenting the danger that the highly flammable fumes could explode . thus , firefighters have been treading lightly , taking time to come-up with a plan to set the tanker - now resting bottom-up - right and pump-out the remaining acid . on saturday , those involved in the rescue operation said that the tanker 's entire load had leaked into the water . despite these revised figures , local environmental authorities and greenpeace experts say a major environmental disaster has been avoided . " in light of these new facts , hamburg has been extraordinarily lucky , " said greenpeace shipping expert christian bussau , adding that the port would probably recover from the accident within a few months . due to the danger of an explosion , the salvage operation had been progressing slowly with a particular emphasis on safety . the tanks were filled with non-flammable nitrogen before the ship was turned upright slowly with the help of cranes . major disaster was avoided at the time of the collision , the driver had a blood alcohol level more than twice the legal limit , according to authorities .
he now faces serious charges carrying a sentence of up to five years in jail and will never be allowed to drive a ship again , according to officials . considering the tanker 's load , it 's a miracle that the disaster did not result in a greater number of injuries and more far-reaching environmental damage , experts said .
eleven people were treated at the time of the explosion for injuries to the respiratory tract and it is estimated that 1,000 fish in the immediate vicinity were killed . " we were lucky that there was n't a further chemical reaction , " said jörg feddern , another expert for greenpeace .

" i have confidence in the french " that they will not reject the constitution , he added .
after nearly two years of wrangling , european union leaders agreed to the first-ever constitution for the bloc at a historic summit in brussels last month .
the document , which is designed to streamline the expanding eu 's creaking institutions and prevent decision-making deadlock in the now 25-member bloc , must be ratified by all eu member states in the next two years before it comes into full force .
france has now become the latest in a line of countries who have signaled willingness to hold popular votes on the issue .
britain , ireland , denmark and luxembourg have already said they favored letting the people , not the parliament , decide on ratification .
poland , spain , belgium , portugal the netherlands , and the czech republic may also decide to call for a referendum .
risking a " no " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uk independence party urges prime minister , tony blair , not to endorse the european constitution .
analysts agree that a " no " vote in any one eu member state could plunge the eu into a serious crisis , given the sensitive nature of the constitution , which only came into existence through fragile compromises and marathon negotiations .
chirac , however , said it was worth the risk to allow the people a direct say in what effects them .
" the french are directly concerned , and therefore will be directly consulted , " he said in a televised interview and added that he had " confidence in their ability -lrb- the french -rrb- to join in a real debate on their future . "
chirac can rest assured that his countrymen will vote for the constitution .

a model project shows that biomass created from farm and factory waste can produce energy for 1,000 homes . sven nevigmann , one of the workers at the loick biomass plant in the village of dorsten , is looking over the operation , which is filled with swine and other animals whose manure is combined with food and other organic substances to create biomass , which in turns makes biogas that can be used for energy production .
the biomass goes through several production processes here at the plant before it is ready for consumption .
biomass projects like this across germany are essential elements of the government 's plan to increase its reliance on renewable energies – including wind and solar power – to 12.5 percent of all electricity development by 2010 .
in the western german state of north rhine-westphalia , where the loick plant is located , about 6 percent of energy production already comes from renewable energy supplies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i 'm good eating and i can heat your home ! "
" we use about 12,000 tons of biomass a year , that is about 6,000 tons of manure , pig and cow manure , and renewable biomass , and about 6,000 tons of food waste and other biodegradable biomass , " said marcel hengst , supervisor at the loick plant .
fermenting the future at loick , manure is mixed with other organic materials that mostly come from a small company nearby that produces deep frozen vegetables .
what the company can ’ t use in its products is then sent to loick to make energy .
it is combined with pig and cow manure that is brought in from nearby farms .
along with these products , corn grown at the plant and food waste are also fed in stages through a number of processing tanks where the organic waste products are fermented .
this then produces biogas along with a rich fertilizer that is highly sought after by local farmers .
in total , the fermentation process takes about 25-30 days .
" this is a single-step fermentation process , " explains hengst , " the fermentation process can be divided into four steps , and those four steps take place in the digester , a 1,000 cubic meter facility that contains a tank that degrades the biomass into valuable fertilizer and biogas . "
the biogras is then placed in a so-called " co-generation unit " that combines heat and power to generate electricity .
the company is paid an attractive premium of about 10 euro cents a kilowatt hour for the electricity it produces from biomass .
a showcase project the loick plant , which is located on an operating farm owned by hubert loick and sponsored by the state of north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- and the fraunhofer institute for environmental , safety and energy technology , was opened in september 2001 as a demonstration facility for biomass technology .
bernd kunott of nrw ’ s ministry of research , says projects like loick are important elements of germany ’ s ambitious renewable energies strategy .
because it transforms waste into valuable energy , it is also innovative , he says .
" there is very much waste you can use for energy purposes .
this one produces energy , electricity for nearly 1,000 households with four persons . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a backhoe picks up chipped wood that is going to be used for biomass production .
because it relies fermentation to produce its energy , biomass also has a major advantage over other renewable energy sources : it is not dependant on the sun shining or the wind blowing to produce energy .
it also has great potential – the german agricultural ministry estimates that , across the country , more than 190 million tons of manure , along with 25 million tons of organic waste , are available for biomass production .
if only 50 percent of that figure were put to the production of electricity or heat , the ministry estimates , either 1.7 million german homes could be provided with heating or the entire electricity needs for 4 million homes could be covered .
helping farmers help themselves but biomass is still largely in its infancy in germany .
of the potential 200,000 biomass facilities that could be built in the country , there are currently only about 1,000 .
still , for farmers like loick , it ’ s an attractive proposition that can help expand the bottom line .
" a farmer can better calculate his annual earnings -lrb- by creating a biomass plant -rrb- , " north rhine-westphalia environment minister bärbel höhn recently said .
" the idea of making a farmer an energy producer is a realistic perspective .

biomass projects like this across germany are essential elements of the government 's plan to increase its reliance on renewable energies – including wind and solar power – to 12.5 percent of all electricity development by 2010 .
in the western german state of north rhine-westphalia , where the loick plant is located , about 6 percent of energy production already comes from renewable energy supplies .

" we use about 12,000 tons of biomass a year , that is about 6,000 tons of manure , pig and cow manure , and renewable biomass , and about 6,000 tons of food waste and other biodegradable biomass , " said marcel hengst , supervisor at the loick plant .
fermenting the future at loick , manure is mixed with other organic materials that mostly come from a small company nearby that produces deep frozen vegetables .
what the company can ’ t use in its products is then sent to loick to make energy .
it is combined with pig and cow manure that is brought in from nearby farms .
along with these products , corn grown at the plant and food waste are also fed in stages through a number of processing tanks where the organic waste products are fermented .
this then produces biogas along with a rich fertilizer that is highly sought after by local farmers .
in total , the fermentation process takes about 25-30 days .
" this is a single-step fermentation process , " explains hengst , " the fermentation process can be divided into four steps , and those four steps take place in the digester , a 1,000 cubic meter facility that contains a tank that degrades the biomass into valuable fertilizer and biogas . "
the biogras is then placed in a so-called " co-generation unit " that combines heat and power to generate electricity .
the company is paid an attractive premium of about 10 euro cents a kilowatt hour for the electricity it produces from biomass .
a showcase project the loick plant , which is located on an operating farm owned by hubert loick and sponsored by the state of north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- and the fraunhofer institute for environmental , safety and energy technology , was opened in september 2001 as a demonstration facility for biomass technology .
bernd kunott of nrw ’ s ministry of research , says projects like loick are important elements of germany ’ s ambitious renewable energies strategy .
because it transforms waste into valuable energy , it is also innovative , he says .
" there is very much waste you can use for energy purposes .
this one produces energy , electricity for nearly 1,000 households with four persons . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a backhoe picks up chipped wood that is going to be used for biomass production .
because it relies fermentation to produce its energy , biomass also has a major advantage over other renewable energy sources : it is not dependant on the sun shining or the wind blowing to produce energy .
it also has great potential – the german agricultural ministry estimates that , across the country , more than 190 million tons of manure , along with 25 million tons of organic waste , are available for biomass production .
if only 50 percent of that figure were put to the production of electricity or heat , the ministry estimates , either 1.7 million german homes could be provided with heating or the entire electricity needs for 4 million homes could be covered .
helping farmers help themselves but biomass is still largely in its infancy in germany .
of the potential 200,000 biomass facilities that could be built in the country , there are currently only about 1,000 .
still , for farmers like loick , it ’ s an attractive proposition that can help expand the bottom line .
" a farmer can better calculate his annual earnings -lrb- by creating a biomass plant -rrb- , " north rhine-westphalia environment minister bärbel höhn recently said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.07.2004 dung good großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : compost may not smell nice , but it can create energy for thousands germany wants to increase its use of renewable energies for electricity production to 12.5 percent by 2010 .
a model project shows that biomass created from farm and factory waste can produce energy for 1,000 homes . sven nevigmann , one of the workers at the loick biomass plant in the village of dorsten , is looking over the operation , which is filled with swine and other animals whose manure is combined with food and other organic substances to create biomass , which in turns makes biogas that can be used for energy production .
the biomass goes through several production processes here at the plant before it is ready for consumption .
biomass projects like this across germany are essential elements of the government 's plan to increase its reliance on renewable energies – including wind and solar power – to 12.5 percent of all electricity development by 2010 .
in the western german state of north rhine-westphalia , where the loick plant is located , about 6 percent of energy production already comes from renewable energy supplies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i 'm good eating and i can heat your home ! "
" we use about 12,000 tons of biomass a year , that is about 6,000 tons of manure , pig and cow manure , and renewable biomass , and about 6,000 tons of food waste and other biodegradable biomass , " said marcel hengst , supervisor at the loick plant .
fermenting the future at loick , manure is mixed with other organic materials that mostly come from a small company nearby that produces deep frozen vegetables .
what the company can ’ t use in its products is then sent to loick to make energy .
it is combined with pig and cow manure that is brought in from nearby farms .
along with these products , corn grown at the plant and food waste are also fed in stages through a number of processing tanks where the organic waste products are fermented .
this then produces biogas along with a rich fertilizer that is highly sought after by local farmers .
in total , the fermentation process takes about 25-30 days .
" this is a single-step fermentation process , " explains hengst , " the fermentation process can be divided into four steps , and those four steps take place in the digester , a 1,000 cubic meter facility that contains a tank that degrades the biomass into valuable fertilizer and biogas . "
the biogras is then placed in a so-called " co-generation unit " that combines heat and power to generate electricity .
the company is paid an attractive premium of about 10 euro cents a kilowatt hour for the electricity it produces from biomass .
a showcase project the loick plant , which is located on an operating farm owned by hubert loick and sponsored by the state of north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- and the fraunhofer institute for environmental , safety and energy technology , was opened in september 2001 as a demonstration facility for biomass technology .
bernd kunott of nrw ’ s ministry of research , says projects like loick are important elements of germany ’ s ambitious renewable energies strategy .
because it transforms waste into valuable energy , it is also innovative , he says .
" there is very much waste you can use for energy purposes .
this one produces energy , electricity for nearly 1,000 households with four persons . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a backhoe picks up chipped wood that is going to be used for biomass production .
because it relies fermentation to produce its energy , biomass also has a major advantage over other renewable energy sources : it is not dependant on the sun shining or the wind blowing to produce energy .
it also has great potential – the german agricultural ministry estimates that , across the country , more than 190 million tons of manure , along with 25 million tons of organic waste , are available for biomass production .
if only 50 percent of that figure were put to the production of electricity or heat , the ministry estimates , either 1.7 million german homes could be provided with heating or the entire electricity needs for 4 million homes could be covered .
helping farmers help themselves but biomass is still largely in its infancy in germany .
of the potential 200,000 biomass facilities that could be built in the country , there are currently only about 1,000 .
still , for farmers like loick , it ’ s an attractive proposition that can help expand the bottom line .

salvage efforts had been hampered by fears of an explosion . the " ena 2 " , a chemical tanker carrying 960 tons of sulphuric acid , collided with a container ship in the port of hamburg on monday .
since then , efforts to clear the wreckage had been hampered by fears of an explosion : when sulphuric acid mixes with water , it creates sulphurous , presenting the danger that the highly flammable fumes could explode . thus , firefighters have been treading lightly , taking time to come-up with a plan to set the tanker - now resting bottom-up - right and pump-out the remaining acid . on saturday , those involved in the rescue operation said that the tanker 's entire load had leaked into the water . despite these revised figures , local environmental authorities and greenpeace experts say a major environmental disaster has been avoided . " in light of these new facts , hamburg has been extraordinarily lucky , " said greenpeace shipping expert christian bussau , adding that the port would probably recover from the accident within a few months . due to the danger of an explosion , the salvage operation had been progressing slowly with a particular emphasis on safety . the tanks were filled with non-flammable nitrogen before the ship was turned upright slowly with the help of cranes . major disaster was avoided at the time of the collision , the driver had a blood alcohol level more than twice the legal limit , according to authorities .
he now faces serious charges carrying a sentence of up to five years in jail and will never be allowed to drive a ship again , according to officials . considering the tanker 's load , it 's a miracle that the disaster did not result in a greater number of injuries and more far-reaching environmental damage , experts said .
eleven people were treated at the time of the explosion for injuries to the respiratory tract and it is estimated that 1,000 fish in the immediate vicinity were killed . " we were lucky that there was n't a further chemical reaction , " said jörg feddern , another expert for greenpeace .

for five years , he had been on germany 's " most wanted " list , suspected of taking nearly € 2 million -lrb- $ 2.4 million -rrb- in bribes for helping german industrial giant thyssen obtain a government arms contract for delivering fuchs tanks to saudi arabia .
he is also widely believed to be involved in the party slush-fund scandal that tainted kohl and his conservative christian democratic union party .

" his arrest in france was a big surprise because we believed he was still in asia . "
neumann said pfahls might be able to explain why the alleged bribes flowed in the first place .

the winner will receive an air mattress and a flight to finland , where he or she will represent germany at the ninth-annual air guitar world championship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mark böhmer has winning on his mind tonight there are 14 air guitarists who have dared to make their way to the small stage in an effort to win over the audience and the judges .
" i 'm going to win , obviously , " says mark böhmer -lrb- photo -rrb- , 29 , who 's driven in from hanover to participate .
when he is n't strumming a make-believe guitar , böhmer normally plays the drums , but for the championships in berlin , he 's " playing " a double necked guitar with acoustic strings on one neck and electric strings on the other .
he 's been training for months for the big night : he 's been walking , he 's toned his biceps and he 's done finger exercises .
yet despite all that preparation , he says his performance tonight will mostly be spontaneous , " with the exception of two or three small things i 've put in my program .
instead i 'm going to just look and see what 's happening on stage and what the atmosphere is like . "
when asked if , like in the real world of rock and roll , drugs play an important part in his work , böhmer nods .
" a huge role , " he says , " but i ca n't tell you anything else about that .
but obviously you have to have a beer or two " before going on stage .
it 's an understatement that will be highlighted by events later in the evening .
fighting for world peace before the show , competition organizer friedericke van meer is being chased down by microphone brandishing journalists .
six months ago , the transsexual founded the german air guitar federation with a group of friends .
" i just randomly came across the world association 's web site and was really impressed with what i saw there , especially that air guitar is , in part , a service for world peace , " she explains .
" i was also very interested in the mix between seriousness and self-irony .
i 've never found that kind of mix anywhere else . "
an emcee clad in a velvet pin-striped and a pink-frilled shirt explains the rules and history of the air guitar to the audience , which is already growing impatient .
each contestant gets 60 seconds to persuade the audience .
" the decisive factors are the overall artistic impression , the visual presentation , technical ability , the song , everything .
you can , of course , influence the judges through your applause , " he explained .
the three-member jury , comprised of has-been german musicians , awards each contestant with between four and six points .
14 air guitarists give their all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this audience is hungry for scandalous behavior !
after a short performance by a real , e.g. live , band , it 's finally time for the competition .
" hell sinki , " is the first air guitarist to enter the stage .
he 's got a beer in his hand , which he slowly imbibes before starting his performance .
the man in his late 20s sporting a haircut not unlike members of the british band oasis , abuses his imaginary guitar to powerful rock ' n ' roll riffs , his fingers unrhythmically running over the imaginary strings .
he jumps into the air , then slams back down to the ground .
at the end of his performance , he falls off the stage to howls from the audience .
but the jury is stingier with its praise , giving him a 5.7 , 5.5 and a 5.4 .
more embarrassingly good performances follow .
" echodrive , " an older guy , is hopping around the stage chaotically , unaided by the pink floyd music he 's supposed to be accompanying .
with horn-rimmed glasses , an undershirt and red swimming trunks , he fiddles around for most of his performance with his fantasy amplifier which keeps making interference sounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : move over buddy holly , this is our new guitar hiro .
but there are also some highlights , like hiro , a young japanese guy who quickly becomes a crowd favorite .
dressed in a tie , pressed pants and designer glasses , his face is washed over in an ecstatic look as he performs .
then he turns his back to the audience and begins waggling his ass .
by the time he starts wriggling with his fake guitar on the stage floor , it appears he 's already clinched the title .
the stage is then covered in a hail storm of bras and tissues .
when the jury just gives him medium marks , booing fills the hall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i guess i should n't drink before the show next time . "
next up is mark böhmer , the cocky dude from hanover .
for the event , he 's brought along a roadie , who first tests out the guitar .
donning a wife-beater undershirt , böhmer launches into an air guitar version of " delay nuclear " by the hives .
he competently strums his instrument , rolls around on the floor and gets down on his knees .
it 's a powerful performance , but this crowd is not easily pleased .
" you 're an inbred , " yells one member of the audience .
the judges each give him a 5.7 - not bad , but still not enough .
" it did n't go all that well , " he says .
" i would have thought that the jury would have concentrated more on stylistic things or creativity .
but i had the feeling that the most important things to them were appearance and fun factor . "
but soon enough he 's laughing again .
" next time i know that i ca n't drink anything before the performance , otherwise i 'll forget how the song goes . "
the accidental champion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german air guitar champion ingo schulz : i 'm too sexy for my shirt !
one candidate first decided to join the competition when he got to the hall .
ingo schulz -lrb- photo -rrb- , a 33-year-old from berlin , says he did n't even know he was coming here tonight .
he says he did n't feel like going to a disco with techno or house music .
instead , the businessman decided to come here , but only as a spectator .
but then he thought , " why not ? "
he chose a song by ac / dc and grabbed his " guitar . "
with jeans and a checkered shirt he does a mean angus young impersonation , licking his instrument with his tongue and pulling at the strings .
it 's an exceptional performance - pure , honest and without any twaddle .
the jury then crowns schulz the german championship , and this time the audience has no objections .
" when i play songs from ac / dc , " schulz explains , " i get the feeling that the 10 meters that separated me from angus young at his last berlin concert are a lot smaller .
i feel like the music is alive again , and not just for me .
if it pleases the audience , then it 's even better . "
he 's also got a pretty laid back attitude about representing germany at the world championships in finland next month .
" i 'm definitely going to do ac / dc again , " he says .
" i do n't know if it will be the same song .
so , now it 's time to go to finland for world peace . " andreas leixnering -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links air guitar world championships the official web site of the air guitar world 's premier event .

the announcement coincided with a renewed international debate to reform the un 's enforcement arm in maintaining international peace and security . with the security council 's five permanent veto-wielding members - france , england , america , china and russia - still representing the world of 1945 , there is broad agreement that an overhaul is overdue . while a revamp is being hotly debated within the un , germany is already drumming up support for its bid for a permanent seat .
with a two-thirds majority of the 191-member un general assembly required to pass any kind of reform resolution , germany is not just lobbying the global heavyweights but even smaller countries . " working towards the same goal " the most recent campaign offensive involves a ten-day tour of south asia by german foreign minister joschka fischer .
stops include india , china , pakistan , bangladesh and sri lanka . fischer became the first european leader to visit the newly-elected congress government and the new indian prime minister manmohan singh on wednesday .
the two sides confirmed they would support each other in their attempts to get permanent un security council seats . in the run-up to the meeting , experts agreed the german bid would find acceptance in india .
not least because new delhi has made no secret of its own ambition to seek a spot in the powerful club . a further reason , said some , are the smooth ties the two countries enjoy . " there 's nothing negative in their relationship , no conflict of interest , so the two could really work together towards the same goal , " anuradha chenoy , international relations expert at new delhi 's jawaharlal nehru university told dw-world . indeed , the indo-german relationship , traditionally close , has grown stronger since german reunification and india 's economic reform process in the 1990s .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 14.07.2004 much ado about nothing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grasping for thin air and the title at the air guitar championship in berlin , contestants duke it out to see who 's best a stroking imaginary instruments .
the winner will represent germany at the world championships in finland . it 's standing room only tonight at the knorre in berlin .
about 200 people are sitting , standing or huddling body to body at the berlin culture center , with its bar-like atmosphere .
the crowd , hungry for scandalous behavior , is ready to see some sweating and passion at the first-ever national air guitar championship .
the winner will receive an air mattress and a flight to finland , where he or she will represent germany at the ninth-annual air guitar world championship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mark böhmer has winning on his mind tonight there are 14 air guitarists who have dared to make their way to the small stage in an effort to win over the audience and the judges .
" i 'm going to win , obviously , " says mark böhmer -lrb- photo -rrb- , 29 , who 's driven in from hanover to participate .
when he is n't strumming a make-believe guitar , böhmer normally plays the drums , but for the championships in berlin , he 's " playing " a double necked guitar with acoustic strings on one neck and electric strings on the other .
he 's been training for months for the big night : he 's been walking , he 's toned his biceps and he 's done finger exercises .
yet despite all that preparation , he says his performance tonight will mostly be spontaneous , " with the exception of two or three small things i 've put in my program .
instead i 'm going to just look and see what 's happening on stage and what the atmosphere is like . "
when asked if , like in the real world of rock and roll , drugs play an important part in his work , böhmer nods .
" a huge role , " he says , " but i ca n't tell you anything else about that .
but obviously you have to have a beer or two " before going on stage .
it 's an understatement that will be highlighted by events later in the evening .
fighting for world peace before the show , competition organizer friedericke van meer is being chased down by microphone brandishing journalists .
six months ago , the transsexual founded the german air guitar federation with a group of friends .
" i just randomly came across the world association 's web site and was really impressed with what i saw there , especially that air guitar is , in part , a service for world peace , " she explains .
" i was also very interested in the mix between seriousness and self-irony .
i 've never found that kind of mix anywhere else . "
an emcee clad in a velvet pin-striped and a pink-frilled shirt explains the rules and history of the air guitar to the audience , which is already growing impatient .
each contestant gets 60 seconds to persuade the audience .
" the decisive factors are the overall artistic impression , the visual presentation , technical ability , the song , everything .
you can , of course , influence the judges through your applause , " he explained .
the three-member jury , comprised of has-been german musicians , awards each contestant with between four and six points .
14 air guitarists give their all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this audience is hungry for scandalous behavior !
after a short performance by a real , e.g. live , band , it 's finally time for the competition .
" hell sinki , " is the first air guitarist to enter the stage .
he 's got a beer in his hand , which he slowly imbibes before starting his performance .
the man in his late 20s sporting a haircut not unlike members of the british band oasis , abuses his imaginary guitar to powerful rock ' n ' roll riffs , his fingers unrhythmically running over the imaginary strings .
he jumps into the air , then slams back down to the ground .
at the end of his performance , he falls off the stage to howls from the audience .
but the jury is stingier with its praise , giving him a 5.7 , 5.5 and a 5.4 .
more embarrassingly good performances follow .
" echodrive , " an older guy , is hopping around the stage chaotically , unaided by the pink floyd music he 's supposed to be accompanying .
with horn-rimmed glasses , an undershirt and red swimming trunks , he fiddles around for most of his performance with his fantasy amplifier which keeps making interference sounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : move over buddy holly , this is our new guitar hiro .
but there are also some highlights , like hiro , a young japanese guy who quickly becomes a crowd favorite .
dressed in a tie , pressed pants and designer glasses , his face is washed over in an ecstatic look as he performs .
then he turns his back to the audience and begins waggling his ass .
by the time he starts wriggling with his fake guitar on the stage floor , it appears he 's already clinched the title .
the stage is then covered in a hail storm of bras and tissues .
when the jury just gives him medium marks , booing fills the hall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i guess i should n't drink before the show next time . "
next up is mark böhmer , the cocky dude from hanover .
for the event , he 's brought along a roadie , who first tests out the guitar .
donning a wife-beater undershirt , böhmer launches into an air guitar version of " delay nuclear " by the hives .
he competently strums his instrument , rolls around on the floor and gets down on his knees .
it 's a powerful performance , but this crowd is not easily pleased .
" you 're an inbred , " yells one member of the audience .
the judges each give him a 5.7 - not bad , but still not enough .
" it did n't go all that well , " he says .
" i would have thought that the jury would have concentrated more on stylistic things or creativity .
but i had the feeling that the most important things to them were appearance and fun factor . "
but soon enough he 's laughing again .
" next time i know that i ca n't drink anything before the performance , otherwise i 'll forget how the song goes . "
the accidental champion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german air guitar champion ingo schulz : i 'm too sexy for my shirt !
one candidate first decided to join the competition when he got to the hall .
ingo schulz -lrb- photo -rrb- , a 33-year-old from berlin , says he did n't even know he was coming here tonight .
he says he did n't feel like going to a disco with techno or house music .
instead , the businessman decided to come here , but only as a spectator .
but then he thought , " why not ? "
he chose a song by ac / dc and grabbed his " guitar . "
with jeans and a checkered shirt he does a mean angus young impersonation , licking his instrument with his tongue and pulling at the strings .
it 's an exceptional performance - pure , honest and without any twaddle .

" when i play songs from ac / dc , " schulz explains , " i get the feeling that the 10 meters that separated me from angus young at his last berlin concert are a lot smaller .
i feel like the music is alive again , and not just for me .
if it pleases the audience , then it 's even better . "
he 's also got a pretty laid back attitude about representing germany at the world championships in finland next month .
" i 'm definitely going to do ac / dc again , " he says .

the announcement coincided with a renewed international debate to reform the un 's enforcement arm in maintaining international peace and security . with the security council 's five permanent veto-wielding members - france , england , america , china and russia - still representing the world of 1945 , there is broad agreement that an overhaul is overdue . while a revamp is being hotly debated within the un , germany is already drumming up support for its bid for a permanent seat .
with a two-thirds majority of the 191-member un general assembly required to pass any kind of reform resolution , germany is not just lobbying the global heavyweights but even smaller countries . " working towards the same goal " the most recent campaign offensive involves a ten-day tour of south asia by german foreign minister joschka fischer .
stops include india , china , pakistan , bangladesh and sri lanka . fischer became the first european leader to visit the newly-elected congress government and the new indian prime minister manmohan singh on wednesday .
the two sides confirmed they would support each other in their attempts to get permanent un security council seats . in the run-up to the meeting , experts agreed the german bid would find acceptance in india .
not least because new delhi has made no secret of its own ambition to seek a spot in the powerful club . a further reason , said some , are the smooth ties the two countries enjoy . " there 's nothing negative in their relationship , no conflict of interest , so the two could really work together towards the same goal , " anuradha chenoy , international relations expert at new delhi 's jawaharlal nehru university told dw-world . indeed , the indo-german relationship , traditionally close , has grown stronger since german reunification and india 's economic reform process in the 1990s .
trade and investment have picked up in recent years along with deepening cooperation in the fields of science and technology . last year , former german president johannes rau endorsed a permanent indian seat on the security council during a visit to india . a common stance on iraq bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shakti 3 , one of four nuclear test sites in the thar desert .
india conducted five nculear tests in may 1998 .
though india 's nuclear tests in 1998 -lrb- photo -rrb- , tensions with pakistan following the attack on the indian parliament in 2001 and , most recently , a flare-up of religious violence in the western state of gujarat in 2002 have cast a shadow on bilateral relations , experts said there has n't been any lasting damage . they instead pointed out that the two countries ' similar position on recent world events is an indication that the two could complement each other in their bid for permanent security council seats . " after the sept .
11 attacks , there was a shift in the foreign policies of many countries .
both india and germany refused to go along with the us , reflecting a common thinking , " said chenoy , adding that the recent change in the indian government would also boost chances of the two working in tandem .
" the hindu nationalists in the last government pursued a more militaristic , chauvinist foreign policy .
the congress is more moderate . " subrata mitra , head of the political science department at heidelberg 's south asia institute , stressed that india 's traditional role as leader of the non-aligned movement -lrb- an international organization of over 100 states which consider themselves not formally aligned with or against any major power bloc -rrb- would be strengthened if it got in with germany on the security council . " in its search for a new global role , india views germany , which has shown itself to be balanced and neutral , as an important western partner , " mitra said .
" a german-indian axis in the security council would provide an important and much-needed voice in a multi-polar world . " promising candidates while both nations have the backing of various countries for their bids , the position of the single-most powerful member of the security council - the us - is still unknown . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers in belet huen , somalia , on a united nations peacekeeping mission in 1993 .
still , analysts agreed that both countries stand a good chance of getting what they want .
germany is already the third-largest contributor to the un budget and the largest troop-contributor to peacekeeping missions from the balkans to the hindukush . though india has also been active in un peacekeeping missions , the reform debate focusing largely on the need for the security council to be more globally representative is expected to speak in its favor . " the outdated security council has to reflect the current world reality and include countries of the third world .
by that measure , india - the world 's largest democracy and second-most populous nation - is a leading candidate , " said un expert günther unser . what about pakistan ? some , however , warned that considering india to be a " natural choice " could prove dangerous for the stability of the south asian region - a further topic of discussion during fischer 's visit . hans maull , who holds the chair for foreign policy and international relations at the university of trier said pakistan , with whom india has thrice gone to war , was the key . " german foreign policy towards india should be positive , " he said .
" but its endorsement of the indian bid is not going to please pakistan .
if it 's angry that india gets in , it could endanger the security of the region , " maull said . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : summit endorses reforms to strengthen u.n. chancellor schröder on friday pushed for a permanent german seat on the u.n. security council at the eu-latin america summit , that urged the u.s. to drop its go-it-alone stance and stressed the need for u.n. reform .

it could be used to tell scientists exactly how drugs affect specific neurons involved in psychiatric disorders , say its creators .
dr alison barth and colleagues at carnegie mellon university hope this , in turn , could lead to new treatments .
their findings appear in the journal of neuroscience .
scientists have mapped general areas of the brain that perform certain tasks , such as memory , behaviour and perception .
up close however , they have not been able to pinpoint individual nerve cells , or neurons , according to dr barth , assistant professor of biological sciences at the university 's mellon college of science .
to try to overcome this limitation , dr barth experimented on mice .
she changed the genes of the mice so a fluorescent protein would light up whenever a particular nerve cell was activated .
in this way , researchers would be able to tell when a drug or a trigger from the environment was acting on a specific neuron by looking for the glow from the fluorescent protein .
using this technique , dr barth was able to identify the precise area of the mouse brain , down to the cellular level , involved in processing sensory information from a single whisker .
it does look interesting .
it 's the first time this particular technique has been done professor tony harmar , professor of molecular pharmacology at the university of edinburgh this is the first time that scientists have been able to show changes in the activity of nerve cells in response to a sensory trigger in living animals , she said .
" our transgenic mouse is a novel tool that can be used to visualise , in living brain tissue , a single neuron that has been activated in response to an animal 's experience , " said dr barth .
she has now patented the mouse and licensed it commercially .
she hopes that it will help scientists find new drugs for psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia .
new drugs dr barth said : " if you look at a condition like anxiety , for example , when you make a person anxious there are particular neurons that respond to that feeling but it 's not necessarily that all of the cells are responding in the same way .
" there may be some cells that are responding much more and the activity of those cells is much more important than the activity of others .
" what this tool does is it allows you to find the cells that are most altered by the state and then you can define the properties of these neurons and design drugs to target those specific cells , " she said .
professor tony harmar , professor of molecular pharmacology at the university of edinburgh , said : " it does look interesting .
" it 's the first time this particular technique has been done in animals as far as i know . "
this research could shed light on the links between their chemistry and function in the brain marjorie wallace sane chief executive he said it was beneficial to know what is going on in living animals because in previous studies the findings were based on postmortem examinations .
" this shows you which cells are doing something while they are alive and that potentially means you can work on the properties of those cells while they are living and that 's definitely important .
but he questioned whether it would be possible to look at cells deeper within the brain .
" the cells they looked at were right on the surface so you can easily see them without burrowing inside the brain , " he said .
marjorie wallace , mental health charity sane 's chief executive , said : " the trouble with drugs used in psychiatry is that we are working in the dark .
" this research could shed light on the links between their chemistry and function in the brain .
" only by understanding how treatments work will we be able to target medications to individuals and make the drugs of the future safer , more effective and with fewer unpleasant side effects . "

in this way , researchers would be able to tell when a drug or a trigger from the environment was acting on a specific neuron by looking for the glow from the fluorescent protein .
using this technique , dr barth was able to identify the precise area of the mouse brain , down to the cellular level , involved in processing sensory information from a single whisker .
it does look interesting .
it 's the first time this particular technique has been done professor tony harmar , professor of molecular pharmacology at the university of edinburgh this is the first time that scientists have been able to show changes in the activity of nerve cells in response to a sensory trigger in living animals , she said .
" our transgenic mouse is a novel tool that can be used to visualise , in living brain tissue , a single neuron that has been activated in response to an animal 's experience , " said dr barth .
she has now patented the mouse and licensed it commercially .
she hopes that it will help scientists find new drugs for psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia .
new drugs dr barth said : " if you look at a condition like anxiety , for example , when you make a person anxious there are particular neurons that respond to that feeling but it 's not necessarily that all of the cells are responding in the same way .
" there may be some cells that are responding much more and the activity of those cells is much more important than the activity of others .
" what this tool does is it allows you to find the cells that are most altered by the state and then you can define the properties of these neurons and design drugs to target those specific cells , " she said .
professor tony harmar , professor of molecular pharmacology at the university of edinburgh , said : " it does look interesting .
" it 's the first time this particular technique has been done in animals as far as i know . "
this research could shed light on the links between their chemistry and function in the brain marjorie wallace sane chief executive he said it was beneficial to know what is going on in living animals because in previous studies the findings were based on postmortem examinations .
" this shows you which cells are doing something while they are alive and that potentially means you can work on the properties of those cells while they are living and that 's definitely important .
but he questioned whether it would be possible to look at cells deeper within the brain .
" the cells they looked at were right on the surface so you can easily see them without burrowing inside the brain , " he said .
marjorie wallace , mental health charity sane 's chief executive , said : " the trouble with drugs used in psychiatry is that we are working in the dark .
" this research could shed light on the links between their chemistry and function in the brain .
" only by understanding how treatments work will we be able to target medications to individuals and make the drugs of the future safer , more effective and with fewer unpleasant side effects . "

bishop auckland general hospital , hexham general hospital and friarage hospital in northallerton have all stopped using the suspect equipment .
it follows a case in france which suggested the equipment could make some abnormalities difficult to detect .
health officials have stressed the recall is a precautionary measure .
the 2,224 patients involved had attended clinics at the hospitals because they had suspected breast cancer .
the chance of any pre-cancerous abnormalities in breasts being missed is extremely small professor rob wilson the recall does not involve women who have been screened as part of the national breast screening programme .
the equipment has been in use at bishop auckland since june 2002 , at hexham since 31 july 2003 and friarage hospital since 11 november 2003 .
women seen prior to these dates , or since 10 june this year are unaffected .
the french case showed the agfa embrace cr1a equipment could make certain abnormalities difficult to detect .
in most cases , this particular abnormality , called microcalcification , turns out to be harmless .
but in a small number of women , it can be an early sign of breast cancer .
doctors have stressed that the risk of cancer going undetected as a result of this problem is small .
professor rob wilson , of south tees hospitals nhs trust , said : " the chance of any pre-cancerous abnormalities in breasts being missed is extremely small - but we want to err on the side of caution for the patients concerned . "
robert aitken , of county durham and darlington acute hospitals nhs trust , added : " we understand that women may be anxious about this issue , which is why we will be offering them a further test as soon as possible . "
samia al qadhi , joint chief executive of the charity breast cancer care said : " we understand that that those women who are being recalled following the withdrawal of this equipment will be anxious and concerned .
" it is important for these women to remember that the risk of cancer not being detected as a result of the problem is small .
however , we would urge all of those who receive an invitation for a further mammogram to attend their appointment . "
patients who are concerned or who have changed their address since their last appointment can contact an nhs helpline on 0191 270 5050 for further advice .

conservation groups are likely to be outraged by a suggestion by welsh assembly members to kill large numbers of badgers to halt the spread of the disease .
bovine tuberculosis is a serious problem in some parts of wales , particularly in the south west .
so far , there is no scientific evidence that badgers are to blame for the spread anywhere in the uk .
but concerns among livestock-keepers are so great that the assembly 's countryside committee has been studying ways of controlling the disease - including culling wildlife .
the committee 's report , which will be discussed on wednesday , suggests testing all cattle for tb before they are moved .
it also recommends establishing research facilities in wales .
but it also moots the idea of culling certain species - including badgers , deer and other mammals in " hotspot " areas - but only if there is clear evidence they could be the source of the disease .
if the policy is successful , it could be applied across wales .
the suggestions could anger wildlife-lovers and those scientists who have stressed that no direct link between badgers and bovine tb has been proven .
only last week , an all-party committee of mps said a uk decision on culling badgers in the battle against bovine tb must await the outcome of further trials .
the commons environment , food and rural affairs committee said that if culling badgers was the government 's " plan a " , then its inquiry looked at measures which might make up a " plan b " response to the problem .
" the political reality is that culling badgers could only ever be a limited part of a policy to deal with the problem of bovine tb , " the committee 's report said .
michael jack who chairs the commons committee , told bbc radio 4 's farming today that its members had called on the government to move more quickly and put greater effort and resources into research into cattle vaccines .
meanwhile , badger groups have accused the government of burying a report which was published on the website of the rural affairs department , defra , website last friday , which they say shows that deer could pose a significant risk of spreading bovine tb .
the report by the central science laboratory was the culmination of a four-year study into the role that other mammals apart from badgers might play in the bovine tb story .
there are more than 1.5m deer in britain , compared with 300,000 badgers .
deer can carry bovine tb , and they are known to go on to farms and share cattle troughs .
bovine tb is endemic in four deer herds in the south and north-west of england .

conservation groups are likely to be outraged by a suggestion by welsh assembly members to kill large numbers of badgers to halt the spread of the disease .
bovine tuberculosis is a serious problem in some parts of wales , particularly in the south west .
so far , there is no scientific evidence that badgers are to blame for the spread anywhere in the uk .
but concerns among livestock-keepers are so great that the assembly 's countryside committee has been studying ways of controlling the disease - including culling wildlife .
the committee 's report , which will be discussed on wednesday , suggests testing all cattle for tb before they are moved .
it also recommends establishing research facilities in wales .
but it also moots the idea of culling certain species - including badgers , deer and other mammals in " hotspot " areas - but only if there is clear evidence they could be the source of the disease .
if the policy is successful , it could be applied across wales .
the suggestions could anger wildlife-lovers and those scientists who have stressed that no direct link between badgers and bovine tb has been proven .
only last week , an all-party committee of mps said a uk decision on culling badgers in the battle against bovine tb must await the outcome of further trials .
the commons environment , food and rural affairs committee said that if culling badgers was the government 's " plan a " , then its inquiry looked at measures which might make up a " plan b " response to the problem .
" the political reality is that culling badgers could only ever be a limited part of a policy to deal with the problem of bovine tb , " the committee 's report said .
michael jack who chairs the commons committee , told bbc radio 4 's farming today that its members had called on the government to move more quickly and put greater effort and resources into research into cattle vaccines .
meanwhile , badger groups have accused the government of burying a report which was published on the website of the rural affairs department , defra , website last friday , which they say shows that deer could pose a significant risk of spreading bovine tb .
the report by the central science laboratory was the culmination of a four-year study into the role that other mammals apart from badgers might play in the bovine tb story .
there are more than 1.5m deer in britain , compared with 300,000 badgers .

the line was built in 1847 as an extension to the stockton and darlington railway .
the first five-mile stretch of track is due to open to the public on 17 july .
as part of preparations for the opening , a steam engine is carrying invited passengers between stanhope and wolsingham on wednesday .
the weardale railway trust is confident everything will be ready for the weekend , although paving and tarmac work is not yet finished on the three new stations .
from sunday , the railway will run a summer service along the dale , four trains daily each way , until the end of october .
extra visitors steve raine , chairman of the weardale railway trust , said on wednesday ahead of the opening : " we set this deadline in october last year , we are going to make it .
" we hope the railway fits in with all the other attractions in the dale and also creates a way of getting from a to b. we also hope we can bring extra visitors in without increasing the traffic . "
it is the first stage of a five-year plan that will see an 18-mile heritage line running to bishop auckland , carrying 90,000 passengers a year .
the heritage lottery fund has given the project £ 900,000 .
the £ 5m scheme has already received backing from the european regional development fund to bring back to life the once busy rural route .

graham hewitt stands proudly in front of his wind machine the six-cylinder diesel engine guns into life , shattering the silence across graham hewitt 's orchard near stonebridge .
it is a wind machine he first saw in california seven years ago which he thought might just be able to protect his apple crop back home from frost .
as he travelled around the fruit farms of california , it became clear that most growers were relying on the 11 metre-tall galvanised towers and rotor blades for the air movement needed to prevent frost from forming .
" when we went out there , we were shocked to see the extensive use of these machines in orange groves and vineyards , " said graham .
the investment though was going to be substantial .
a wind machine would cost as much as £ 20,000 .
but with frost claiming most of his apple crops in three out of the past five years , graham was convinced that the californian farmers had the answer .
thanks to a rural development grant under the european-funded leader programme and technical assistance from the department of agriculture , he set about installing a wind machine in his most vulnerable orchard .
and barely had the 150-horsepower engine and five-metre blade been installed than the frost alarm sounded .
" on the night of 21 may we had quite a heavy frost in armagh and in this orchard we got down to almost minus two degrees , " said graham .
it was three o 'clock in the morning when graham fired up the engine , and as the frost glistened on the young fruit , the giant rotor began to turn .
the next few minutes would be critical .
in less than five minutes , the leaves would stiffen on the trees and the apples would crystalise and be ruined .
it was make or break for graham and his californian dream .
a layer of warmer air is drawn down to replace the cold air beneath the wind machine though was gathering pace .
soon the rotor was turning at more than 2,400rpm .
the tree tops began to sway in the generated breeze , and then the moment graham had been hoping for arrived - warm air wafting down through the lines of bramley trees .
it is a phenomenon which weather experts call an inversion .
it happens when the layer of warmer air is drawn down to replace the cold air beneath , explains donald campbell of the meterological office at aldergrove , near belfast .
" this machine is capable of drawing huge volumes of air down , " says donald .
" it 's bringing warmer air down which can be anything up to ten degrees higher than the ground air temperature . "
the wind machine helped to save the apple crop and on that fateful may morning , the wind machine earned its keep .
graham smiled as he recalled the temperature probes first stabilising and then beginning to rise .
the apple crop had been saved and all thanks to a machine developed thousands of miles away in the united states .
the fruit hangs heavy now on the apple trees and graham is looking forward to a bumper crop .
he says the wind machine will only run on a few frosty nights each year when the blossom and young fruit are most vulnerable but that ability to protect the apple crops may well mean that more armagh farmers will think about investing in the californian experience .

bbc news -pipe- have your say -pipe- aids : are we doing enough ?
bbc news / have your say graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- wednesday , 14 july , 2004 , 07:34 gmt 08:34 uk aids : are we doing enough ?
we discussed the global aids epidemic in our phone-in programme , talking point .
un secretary general kofi annan has attacked the us for failing to deliver enough funds to tackle aids worldwide .
in an exclusive interview with the bbc , he said the fight against terrorism was overshadowing the hiv / aids epidemic .
the americans have also been criticised for their policy of advocating sexual abstinence to prevent aids at the international aids conference in bangkok .
campaigners say the global epidemic can only be controlled if the use of condoms is promoted .
a record five million people were infected with hiv last year , according to the latest united nations report on the aids epidemic .
is enough being done to combat aids ?
is urging abstinence enough ?
have you been affected by aids ?
send us your comments and stories .
this debate is now closed .
thank you for your comments .
we can help slowing down the aids problem by educating everyone of its danger .
ignorance and selfishness do n't help to prevent this deadly disease .
mung , gilroy , ca , us kofi is a real joker .
15 billion is not enough from one country ?
what does the eu give ?
maybe all americans should just sign over their pay checks because corrupt governments ca n't educate their citizens nor do they care .
somehow it 's always america 's fault because the world is so dysfunctional .
i wish we would just get out of the screaming bottomless un .
andrea , cincinnati , usa i wonder what phenomena are at work in the world 's muslim-majority countries that have largely spared their populations from the ravages of aids ?
certainly afghanistan , iraq or mali suffer at least as badly as botswana , russia or thailand from the poor public health services , taboos on sex education , poverty , and lack of female empowerment cited by many here as the roots of this pandemic .
it would seem these societies might be doing something right , and they do n't seem to be bankrupting themselves doing it either .
glenn , washington dc , usa " we are doing too much for those whose aids infection stems from their own choice of lifestyles " david kriner , singapore i believe that we are doing too much for those whose aids infection stems from their own choice of lifestyles .
the resources could be better directed toward fatal diseases that are not due to choices in lifestyle .
david kriner , singapore i listen to the bbc world service while i am working and i 'm sick of hearing about condoms , aids , sex and hiv .
so what if the fight against terrorism is overshadowing the fight against aids ?
i have sympathy for those people dying of aids but there are millions of people dying of other diseases , and starving to death .
i do n't care about the sex lives of people in africa or thailand .
i just want to listen to the news in peace without every other word being sex or condoms !
elizabeth leighton , monterey , california " we must do everything we can to keep the risks people face to a minimum " adele , yorkshire abstinence is one method of preventing the spread of hiv in developing countries , just as avoiding fat and cholesterol is one method of preventing a heart attack in western society .
but the fact remains that , in both situations , natural forces will continue to drive many people to take risks .
that 's where education and promoting the use of condoms comes in - we must do everything we can to keep the risks people face to a minimum .
whether it 's a disease that mainly affects the poor or one that comes with wealth , we have a moral responsibility to ensure that all people have access to all available therapies .
adele , yorkshire the idea that abstinence can stop aids is not just unrealistic , but also incredibly crass in its own way .
it reduces the problem of aids to a moralistic one , portraying its sufferers as victims of their own intemperance and promiscuity .
the americans ' approach makes a mockery of people who contracted it through no fault of their own -lrb- blood transfusions , birth , etc -rrb- , as well as others ' efforts to help them .
is this really taking the aids problem seriously ? ?
lj , uk we fought polio and we prevailed .
it was not easy and did not happen overnight .
at one time polio was a scourge just as aids is today .
it will take time and money but we will prevail .
then we will take on the next big disease .
colin , milton , usa the abstinence v. condoms debate is ridiculous .
neither protects the one in three women in south africa who are raped , people paid for donating blood -lrb- using infected needles -rrb- in china , or young girls forced into prostitution in asia .
ruth , uk " enough talk more action " steve , chicago , usa although i support george bush , mr annan is right .
enough talk more action , the time is now !
let 's fund the un programs adequately .
steve , chicago , usa we have to be realistic .
when one ca n't change habits , one needs to educate .
education remains the best way to stop aids .
when we consider the amount of money invested into the war in iraq , my guess is that rich country can invest more in fighting aids .
i have not been affected by aids so far , but i do care for my future children i hope i 'll have someday .
education is the solutions to many problems in the world , and also for most people .
david cormier , tokyo , japan it 's all very well to teach abstinence , but when the majority of people contracting hiv are women , many of whom are forced to have unprotected sex .
the best way forward is to educate the men who are spreading the disease .
p , uk the us is right to say that abstinence is the best way to stop aids .
but it 's hardly realistic , is it ?
everybody knows aids is escalating in asia thanks largely to prostitutes , many of whom support their families in the country by their work .
how can these people be expected to abstain ?
their families depend on them !
everybody who moans about the promotion of condoms as indicative of a ' permissive society ' fail to see the problem with the sympathy and pragmatism that this world-wide epidemic demands .
what use are your sexual scruples in preventing the deaths of all these people who come from societies which are less privileged than yours ?
get real and support the efforts of those promoting condom use .
henry , london , uk " we live in an anything goes world " pat , sussex of course abstinence will prevent the spread of aids but who in this world is going to put it forward as a serious option .
we live in an " anything goes world " and self control has no meaning anymore so aids and more will go on , and we will spend millions on finding a cure , just making sure that people can indulge in every way possible .
pat , sussex knowing that any promiscuous behaviour , be it illicit sex or drug use , could bring upon an almost certain death ; yes , it should be enough to stop the illicit behaviour .
wendy , virginia , usa if condoms were so effective why do we have the aids epidemic we have now ?
the fact is before the missionaries were ran out they were teaching abstinence in africa .
they did not have the problem then that they do today .
joseph , kansas city , usa " the responsibility is on each person and everyone must be made aware of this " jane , foxfield , uk we do n't want to hear that we need to change our sexual behaviour in order to protect ourselves .
we want the government to protect us .
how exactly are they to do it ?
people must be sensible .
if they are not going to use condoms because they are too embarrassed to buy them , then they must refrain from risky behaviour .
the responsibility is on each person and everyone must be made aware of this .
jane , foxfield , uk what a load of tosh .
of course not having sex will mean that the virus is n't spread .
problem is that most people - the faithful and faithless alike - only give a degree of lip service to abstinence , because natural forces drive our sexuality that are quite un-natural to fight .
matt , chelmsford , uk this is a typical us policy , blind to the realities of this world .
abstinence is simply an unrealistic way of counteracting aids .
the reality is that people have sex and as such we should do all we can to prevent aids from spreading by promoting condoms .
we must also educate people as far as aids is concerned , and if religious groups really wish to , promote abstinence .
but these groups must realise that abstinence based on religious persuasion will not appeal to all , it probably wo n't even appeal to a majority of people living in places where the aids epidemic has erupted .
therefore , let us be rational and realistic about the whole matter and think of real solutions !
james k. , exeter / uk there is not one way to stop aids , except education .
abstinence should be part of the education program , as well as safe sex , etc .
condoms are not 100 percent safe either .
the more people know - the better they can decide to protect themselves .
dalo , coral gables , fl , usa " a ridiculous policy based upon the theological musings of elderly un-married men " jerry taylor , london , uk the preaching of abstinence has never been particularly effective .
the catholic church is certainly to blame ; for encouraging poor and ill-educated people to take its preaching seriously whilst in its european homeland of its richer and better educated adherents the vast majority cheerfully ignore it ; for spreading inaccurate information about condoms ; and for having a ridiculous policy based upon the theological musings of elderly un-married men .
jerry taylor , london , uk abstinence is not an option .
humans are sexual beings .
the debates about condom use are also part of a wider issue concerning other stis and family planning .
being faithful to one person is a very good strategy for minimising the spread of diseases but it is not an option for family planning if people admit that they enjoy sex and want to have it more often than they want to make children .
abstinence does n't work .
what 's wrong with sex ?
if we realise that sex is nothing shameful and stop treating the issue with this in mind and promote valuing sex as something good and nice that can be shared between two people in a responsible way then we will be getting somewhere in the fight against aids , stis and also unwanted pregnancies .
phill wilcox , manchester abstinence is the law written by god for the good of mankind -lrb- for our spiritual , emotional , and physical well being -rrb- , and for the preservation of his plan for faithfulness and fidelity in marriage -lrb- between one man and one woman -rrb- and the health of families and children .
abstinence is the only way to prevent aids .
susan tiffany , cleveland , ohio usa abstinence education is simply moronic religious bantering by the short-sighted idiots running our foreign policy .
eric garcia , denver , usa " condoms are not an option ; self control is the only way " maria , helsby how can anyone blame the catholic church for the current aids epidemic ?
the church 's teaching has always been clear , abstinence before marriage and sex only between married couples .
it has taken aids to show the truth of this argument .
condoms are not an option ; self control is the only way .
maria , helsby , england although abstinence is the most reliable way of stopping the spread of aids it is unrealistic to expect casual sex to stop in a world where sex and sexuality is used to sell everything from cars to films .
education in how to have sex safely is the only way to curb this disease .
vik , uk " it relies on people going against their natural instincts and needs " david hazel , fareham sexual abstinence would solve all of our problems , would n't it ?
it would ensure there were n't any more of us to have problems .
the trouble with this approach is that it suffers from the same problem as dieting to lose weight .
it relies on people going against their natural instincts and needs , with all the resulting frustration that perpetual dieters experience .
as with dieting , the result would be that nature will have its way in the end , under circumstances which are less well-controlled than they might have been .
another shot in the foot for the human race , i feel .
david hazel , fareham , uk my best friend is dying of aids .
a colleague recently lost her daughter .
my mother is nursing a sick neighbour .
as a south african , i have seen the ravages of aids on a personal level .
and you think , if only they had been careful .
if only they had abstained .
if only ... but the reality is that human beings are sexual creatures , full stop .
live with it .
deal with it .
it is the nature of things .
charl senekal , johannesburg the problem is not confined to one reason so needs multiple solutions ; sexual fidelity , poverty eradication , abstinence , supply of drugs , educating people and health facilities .
qismat ullah khan , peshawar , pakistan it is interesting that most people write from the detached perspective of the uninvolved .
i thought it would never affect me and well , now it has .
hiv is everyone 's problem , whatever your religious and moral beliefs .
sticking your head in the sand and taking the moral high ground are both equally futile .
what a pity people only realise that , like i did , when it 's too late .
py , london abstinence is not really natural for many people .
thus , the reality is that they will not do it .
which means they should act responsibly and use a condom when they do have sex .
no amount of legislation or bribery by politicians will change reality .
w morgan , hanoi , vietnam " abstinence will not work , and thus it will never be the cure against aids " timo , lausanne from a scientific point of view : it is the way of nature to keep our species alive by reproduction and evolution .
to reach this goal , nature will not care about marriage or faithfulness .
there 's nothing we can do about that , but using a condom makes things a lot more secure .
from a religious point of view : god made us all vulnerable to temptation .
most of the time we can resist , but sometimes we can not resist .
and for these times we can not resist , using a condom is the only means to stay healthy .
abstinence will not work , and thus it will never be the cure against aids .
timo , lausanne , switzerland the emphasis has to be always on self help : self-education and self-control .
no amount of pumping anti-viral drugs and even money which may end up in pockets unless properly channelled is likely to help .
most of all , it has to be on the acknowledged national agenda and priority where it has reached epidemic proportions .
saravan , uk the arguments presented here against the catholic church are specious .
yes , that church is opposed to contraception but it is even more strongly opposed to promiscuity .
anyone who does n't use contraception but is promiscuous is n't listening to the catholic church anyway .
the spread of aids in africa has more to do with poverty and tribal attitudes than catholic ideals .
annika lagerstrom , örebro , sweden before we have to choose between monogamy and abstinence , let 's remember the spread of hiv is n't confined to the sexually promiscuous .
enough men , women and children are dying from aids-related illness around the world to prove this .
we 're therefore increasingly at the mercy of the pharmaceutical giants and governments , who must act swiftly and benevolently before life expectancy is further reduced .
dan benham , london , uk " if so , the enemy we fight is much worse than hiv " ken , florida why is there such hostility to abstinence education ?
is it verboten in this day and age to use words such as morality , fidelity , monogamy , or abstinence ?
if so , the enemy we fight is much worse than hiv .
ken , florida , usa being the true christian , muslim or jew - abstinence when young and then loving relationships in marriage are crucial to fighting aids .
it is so simple that i can not understand why the un and others governments do not overwhelmingly support this attitude .
henryk karas , poland , sexual behaviour is hard to change and simply giving information will not change that behaviour .
many people know smoking cigarettes is dangerous but they still smoke !
sexual pleasure has been the cheapest and easiest method which all humans have used to survive in a dark and hopeless world .
until we have a world where humans feel loved , supported and safe , the aids epidemic will remain rampant .
in the short-term , however , the suffering from aids could be reduced if the pharmaceutical industry would become humane enough to reduce the cost of the " cocktail " of drugs for persons with the disease in the developing world .
debbie , kingston , jamaica i do n't think that the aids crisis is taken seriously enough .
in fiji the authorities are just beginning to sit up and listen after numbers of cases were reported and some of those infected started coming out and talking about it .
rosemary naivalurua , suva , fiji " it is time that they recognised the problem " tavi samoila , ottawa , canada one of the main obstacles to prevention is the opposition of the catholic church and other religious institutions to birth-control methods such as condoms .
in many underdeveloped countries , especially in rural areas , the organised religion institutions -lrb- churches , mosques , temples , etc -rrb- are the only way to convey a message to the majority of the population .
it is time that they recognised the problem , stop preaching against condoms , and become more involved in preaching the benefits of safe sex as well as a basic sex education to the population .
tavi samoila , ottawa , canada last week i spent a week in cambodia on a work experience trip .
one of the places we visited was an aids hospice run by nuns who work under the order set up by mother teresa .
infection rates in asia are increasing in my opinion because there is a lot of prostitution going on and there is very little education about stis and aids .
katriona , singapore , ex-british i just read a part of the report from dr piot who is the executive director of unaids and he does know what is he is talking about ... for many women in africa , the mantra of abc , abstinence , be faithful and condoms - which is regularly recited by outside agencies and especially the us is pretty irrelevant , he said .
the aids pandemic in africa is hitting women worst .
nearly 60 % of the victims are female , and they often do not have option of abstinence , fidelity or condom use .
many are subject to violent , non-consensual sex by men .
i wish that more people would read and get educated before passing judgement .
marsha , los angeles , usa " communities must change the way they deal with aids infected people " gail , south africa < having worked in a rural hospital in northern kwazulu-natal , i was able to see the effects of aids first hand .
dealing with aids is multi faceted - the governments have to change their approach -lrb- in the case of our government just admit that hiv and aids are connected -rrb- , communities must change the way they deal with aids infected people , individuals must accept that aids is real , yes in the majority of instances it is also connected to socio economic groups .
the younger generation are in denial - my own nieces and nephews think that it will not happen to them as they come from a good middle class background - although aids and stds are mentioned all the time and society is open .
possibly until each family has a member that is hiv positive attitudes may change .
there is no simple solution .
gail , south africa we are at the point where million of people are slowly dying and we blame these people for becoming affected or we blame their religion or customs .
how cruel can some be that when faced with human pain all he has to say is that you brought it to your self because ... -lrb- fill the blank -rrb- .
what the west has to face is that not only we are not a part of the solution but we are also a part of the problem .
we have to accept that sex vacation -lrb- a major contributor in aids on asia -rrb- is powered mostly by westerners .
panagiotis l , athens greece i 'm in banaglore , india at the moment , and though it is one of the most developed cities in the country it is almost impossible to buy a condom here .
they are not freely laid out on the shelves as they are in the uk and other western countries .
to buy a condom , you 'd have to search hard , and have to ask , but since there is such a huge taboo over the issues of sex here , not many people will ask .
it is their culture .
to impose a huge strategy of delivering condoms here and discussing the issues of safe sex would mean imposing elements of western culture upon them - a culture which many view as loose and immoral .
there is a desperate need for greater distribution of sex education around the world , but for it to work successfully by embracing the people , we have to always remember that they live in an almost entirely different culture to us and hold different values .
rebecca , london , uk anyone who has a friend or member of their family suffering from aids or have known someone who died from aids will know the pain and illness involved .
well said katherine , " we should be helping our fellow human beings " sitting in judgement , well , let he who is without sin cast the first stone !
mike harries , swansea , uk " if people stop behaving in an immoral manner , aids will stop . "
mike newton , singapore if people stop behaving in an immoral manner , aids will stop .
the spouse who infects the other spouse is guilty of murder and should be punished accordingly mike newton , singapore the un report links the increase in aids to the fact that the majority of women in africa and asia lose their virginity through non-consensual sex with an older man .
in short , these cultures are suffering because rape is the norm .
nk , uk i think aids is a global epidemic and not enough is being done to give treatments to ever infected person .
the who should insist the rich countries pay for haart for the third world , the governments should increase the taxes to the greedy drug producing companies .
it is very unfair that if you are born in the third world and develop aids funding is denied .
e collins , bolton if 40 % of the population of a european country were hiv positive , we 'd have found a cure by now .
paul , cardiff " the religious dogma and stereotyping is what is bogging the campaign down " james , uk the religious dogma and stereotyping is what is bogging the campaign down , aids can not be combated until these are removed from the equation , only then will programmes of education work to their full effectiveness .
james , uk the aids campaign is ridiculous and all about turning the issue of aids into a debate about racism .
there should be no taxpayers ' money spent on treatment drugs in developing countries unless there is more emphasis into prevention and education , which is much cheaper and far more efficient .
uganda has shown how to do it and cut the infection rate from over 30 % to just 6 % in a decade through education .
way to go .
m wallengren , copenhagen , denmark there is a cure for aids .
it 's called abstinence .
when the world stops its immoral lust for adulterous sex , and illicit drug abuse , we 'll have our cure .
until then i say take all the money earmarked for aids around the world and put it into a fund for ridding the world of something really insidious such as cancer .
mark , yakima , usa " how about we put people 's lives above profit and ideology ? "
katherine , london , uk teaching abstinence only - hmm , yes - that will help the women who are in thrall to their husbands who use prostitutes .
no doubt it will also help the children who are infected in the womb ?
here 's a thought - how about we make the drugs cheap and the education wide ranging ?
how about we put people 's lives above profit and ideology ?
how about we stop being patronising and assuming that we know best and just help out as fellow human beings because that is the right thing to do ?
katherine , london , uk i believe the aids crisis is not being taking seriously due to lack of education mainly in third world countries .
also , the superpowers of today are too pre-occupied with wars and destruction so the important issues are being blurred out .
ziad daher , al-khobar , saudi arabia if religious types go around preaching terrorism , they are dealt with severely .
if they preach against condoms , we do nothing .
at the end of the day , who are the greatest killers ?
jon e , france as long as there are ignorance , superstition and hypocrisy , people will get infected with aids .
in the developing world , education would go a long way to help the situation .
preaching , blaming the west etc will not help .
people must take responsibility for their actions .
no drug can cure aids .
the rich may be able to give food and medicines to the poor , but we ca n't cure them .
people have to protect themselves .
someone needs to stand up and speak the truth in the face of political and religious dogma and lies .
iain nicholson , uk african leaders have no time to combat aids , all they have time for is to protect their regimes from coups .
kathaab afandi , spain why is the who spending millions on testing for hiv in africa ?
the tests are expensive -lrb- and not always reliable -rrb- .
surely africa would be better served by having the money spent on education and on other areas that are much needed to combat the problem rather than tell us what we already know ?
nick manon , inverness , scotland looking for weapons of mass destruction ?
it 's hiv / aids .
yemi , ibadan , nigeria my god ! 40 % infection rates ?
we have to throw everything , absolutely all we can afford at educating these poor countries .
you ca n't just tell them to use a condom and get over it .
an understanding of viral infections and human disease at a very basic level is also required .
this is not a mercy mission .
first africa , now , apparently asia and central europe .
this is a threat to all of us !
i remember big campaigns in the 80s about aids and then nothing .
why ?
we 've had our warning , i reckon this could be it for mankind .
chas knight , duxford , uk " human suffering is big money " evan , uk / dubai the monopoly that several -lrb- american -rrb- drugs companies have on the treatment of aids means that progress will never be made until the american government gets out of bed with them .
drugs are making far too much money for these companies for the business-controlled government to instigate any real research which might make the old , expensive drugs obsolete .
human suffering is big money .
evan , uk / dubai i 'm not sure how it can be commented these countries do n't take it seriously .
they are human beings just as you and i and any human being would be affected by seeing people around them dying from this disease .
i spent a month in malawi last summer and things are being tried to help .
the new president has organised massive condom campaigns which were seen in all the major cities .
the rural areas are the problems .
there is a serious lack of communication links and medical facilities available in these areas , so there situation ca n't really be helped .
to say it 's not being taken seriously is something , i feel , us people in the rich , western , first world can not judge .
the lifestyles of these countries , needing many children for income , lack of basic healthcare and lack of education on the matter means that little can be done to help the people that get infected and the taboo of the subject does n't help much either sophie , uk the world had ignored the problem of aids for a long time .
it is never too late to take some drastic action in order to curb the spread of aids .
once upon a time people with leprosy were isolated and treated .
this same process could help the world in checking the spread of this dreaded disease .
isolate those that are infected .
first , this checks further spread .
and then treat them as a group .
the who could take this programme up .
i know people would shout of fundamental human rights .
but did n't those with leprosy have those rights ?
please save the world from total annihilation .
clement chukwudifu , abuja , nigeria " a person can be perfectly responsible with more than one partner " kaz , briton in nj , usa why concentrate on monogamy ?
as a monogamous person with polyamourous friends , i know that a person can be perfectly responsible with more than one partner - indeed , people who have consciously decided to be responsibly polyamourous tend to be better educated about safer sex and stds than many monogamous people .
kaz , briton in nj , usa it must be remembered that every culture is different and a microcosm unto itself .
the comments here reflect an excellent way of finding out exactly how to help people : to actually ask them how they and their communities feel about hiv - and what practical things they need done to stop them and their loved ones being at risk .
the availability of medicine for pregnant women is an excellent suggestion - as is treatment or support for those who have been raped or deliberately infected .
if we ca n't beat aids let 's at least help those who have it by asking them directly what they want or need , and getting it for them .
emma-joy , essex , uk there is no doubt that in the third world , ignorance is a major factor .
in the west , however , survey after survey seems to show that the safe -lrb- or , at least , safer -rrb- sex message is ignored by large numbers of people .
certainly , rates of other stds continue to climb , suggesting that people continue to indulge in risky sexual behaviour .
but people continue to smoke too , so why should we be surprised ?
jg , huddersfield uk poverty and illiteracy are the curse and main determinants for risk of hiv and aids .
fighting against poverty can reduce risk of hiv / aids .
the problem , fighting against hiv / aids , is also lack of political willingness in many asian countries .
barna and monir , karlstad , sweden " stop all the useless meetings and conferences " kondwani munthali , malawi aids does not need a commission , special agency or strategy .
we have looked at our pocket needs instead of the realistic ways of addressing this pandemic .
aids requires no strategy , but commitment to change southern african men 's perspectives , educate more women and create more opportunities for everyone .
it does not need a strong international conference , we always have many money spending binges in the name of the 25-million suffering .
men need to be taught one message - if you get aids you die , if you sleep with many women without protection you will catch it .
stop all the useless meetings and conferences .
kondwani munthali , cardiff / malawian let 's face it hiv / aids is here to stay .
the disease has now become inextricably linked with economic status .
the number of people living with hiv / aids exploded in india and china .
that alone is the indicator that illiteracy and abject poverty play an all too important part in the spread of hiv / aids .
it is obvious that more should be done to tackle the spread of hiv / aids but this must go hand in hand with eradicating extreme poverty and combating illiteracy .
issara , bangkok , thailand the aids problem does n't really exist in my country , not because there are no hiv / aids infected people in japan but simply because people ignore the issue by not paying enough attention to it and not discussing it publicly .
behind the sheer curtains , the number of hiv / aids infected population is surely increasing .
sakura , fukuoka , japan i believe that the biggest danger that may come of this is an intergenerational gap .
in fact a lot of african countries are having problems transferring their culture to the up and coming generations , who are slowly losing a part of their roots and heritage .
lucious costa , canada " getting a cure for aids is perhaps ten times better than five hundred billion dollars in aid " golit peter dada , abuja - nigeria why we still have aids ravaging the world 's most productive sector of the population today is because developed countries are not seriously affected .
otherwise , a cure would have been found since .
my earnest plea with the advanced countries is for them to intensify their search for a cure which must yield results in less than five years ; if not , by then , africa should be forgotten from the face of the earth in view of the colossal loss that would have emerged .
getting a cure for aids is perhaps ten times better than five hundred billion dollars in aid .
golit peter dada , abuja - nigeria in all african countries aids is not taken seriously .
the only hope which can reduce the number is to have big roll religious centres .
look in ethiopia the number is growing very fast .
mussa , eritrea having moved to the uk three years ago from south africa , i can not believe how ignorant people are here in the uk regarding aids .
it seems to be seen as predominantly a problem for the poor .
with global travel becoming more and more accessible the threat of aids spreading further is even greater .
the resent increase in new infections of other sexually transmitted diseases within the uk should be a warning .
according to some aids experts an increase in other sexually transmitted diseases is normally a precursor to an increase in hiv / aids infections .
steven , uk / south africa a friend worked for three years in botswana by the main highway linking south africa to the zimbabwe area , in that time three local villages were reduced by aids spread by truck drivers , from over 1,000 persons to less than three hundred .
a catastrophe in any language .
what lead to it - educational ignorance , government indifference , endemic poverty , religious bigotry .
can the disease be stopped - probably not in the lifetime of most of africans .
will the deaths go increasing - undoubtedly .
all the money in the world , all the drugs in the world , can not overcome the deficiencies of education and the effects of blinding poverty .
peter , germany " what we need is marital / sexual fidelity , not condoms ! "
chris , aarau , switzerland if at long last governments and the media would value truth more than political correctness - that is : stop preaching polygamy and clearly state the fact that hiv-infection is , as has always been the case , an entirely -lrb- 99.99 % -rrb- preventable disease , then we are talking about taking aids seriously .
what we need is marital / sexual fidelity , not condoms !
propagating the latter is a pathetic and dangerous attempt to cover up the basic problem !
chris , aarau , switzerland aids crisis ?
first .
we know that , worldwide , huge amounts of money are spent every day in weapons .
second .
we could join our voices and ask our governments to spend differently our money .
third -lrb- and last -rrb- .
we already know that our lifestyle is one of the main reasons of third world 's people living conditions .
aids crisis ?
or hypocrisies ?
gianluca agati , forlì , italy no terrorist attack has claimed 42 million lives ...
aids has , and the number still rises , and the reaction to this little piece of evidence has not changed much .
peter , kampala , uganda aids is not being taken seriously by the people on the ground here in africa .
many people do not wish to know their hiv status and that causes problems as they go on to infect others unknowingly .
also many here are in denial they still blame witchcraft for clearly hiv / aids related diseases .
many organisations spend money meant for aids affected people on seminars , workshops and other useless talk shops .
veap ndlovu , zimbabwe first , the catholic church must change its extremely harmful attitude to contraception and stop telling lies about condoms .
second , people in developing countries need education - not just about sex but in general too .
last but not least , when it comes to sexual behaviour , people everywhere need to develop sense of responsibility towards themselves and others .
mika piirainen , joensuu , finland i am a young englishmen working in the samara region of russia where i understand there are high rates of hiv infection .
yet , i have not seen any warnings , adverts or education campaigns .
russians are still very casual about sex and something needs to be done by the russian government who appear to be simply ignoring the problem .
gw , russia " 40 % of adults in a country are hiv positive ; how can anyone say the aids crisis is being taken seriously ? "
kpdodo , mauritius 40 % of adults in a country are hiv positive ; how can anyone say the aids crisis is being taken seriously ?
it takes information , from local leaders , irrespective of religious background , to inform the people who respect them as to how to protect themselves .
it takes a more humane approach to drug therapy to slow down the progression of the virus .
how many souls to a dollar of dividend in the large pharmaceutical companies ?
or most probably , per dollar in the pay packages of the top executives of these firms ?
kpdodo , mauritius there are two important factors which support hiv , illiteracy and lack of women rights and therefore little hope for the african countries to cope there hiv crisis stefan neifer , berlin , germany yes i am affected by the hiv because all those who are suffering are human being and i feel the agonies of all those people .
because people in asia are more resistant to new methods of evading sexually transmitted diseases .
moreover poverty deteriorates the situation as well .
awais qarni , lahore pakistan i have noticed that in the eastern europe where i live , the people do not give much importance to stds , rather , they concentrate only in avoiding pregnancy .
the use of contraceptive drugs is the issue in this area .
only few weeks ago after joining eu , i noticed on the streets of tallinn for the first time , advertisements about aids and that lasted for just two weeks .
right now everything is back to square one .
so also the other states i have visited in this region .
there should be much concerns about this because i see the neglect on the side of the government to properly educate people here .
opara victor , nigerian in estonia " governments and churches of all faiths need to put more efforts in the reform of mankind and sexuality " ahmad hmoud , amman no i do not think it is taken seriously .
it may be by some countries or even some people .
in general sexual behaviour and the sex industry together with pharmaceutical establishments can do more to clean up their act and put man before profit .
governments and churches of all faiths need to put more efforts in the reform of mankind and sexuality .
ahmad hmoud , amman , jordan if leaders are not serious about this epidemic , then i do n't see aids reducing in the world .
you actually see big people who are reckless with their lives and tell people to change when they do n't want to change in their behaviour .
practice what you preach .
tamika , blantyre , malawi remove the patents on aids medicines from american firms .
this would enable others to produce low-cost drugs that would be affordable to the african countries .
global science needs to be mobilised to tackle the aids crisis .
tom stambollouianq , thailand tom from thailand : if you do not honour drug companies ' patent rights , research into new drugs -lrb- not just for aids -rrb- will stop .
nobody loves the drug companies , but you can not expect them to carry out research for the love of science or out of altruism .
welcome to the real world .
andrew , london there needs to be more involvement by the government to create more awareness of the disease and preventative measures , including abstinence .
superstitions and false rumours about the disease and some of the measures to prevent it also need to be addressed - if you believe that condoms are actually a device from the west to handicap you in some way , would you use it ?
church leaders also need to take a stance , too many do n't talk about aids and make it seem shameful .
those with the disease should also not be cast aside by society , this is how the disease spreads so rapidly , everyone is ashamed to confront it and so keep quiet and carry on as before .
wambui , nairobi , kenya maybe instead of always teaching safe sex , as if there is such a thing , we should be presenting abstinence as an equally -lrb- or more -rrb- valid option .
in my high school when they teach us about sex , they present it in a way that assumes all kids are having sex and so , this is how you protect yourself .
would n't it be much healthier to wait till marriage ?
i do n't think that you have to have any religious views to agree that no sex is safe sex .
shannon , usa " even the mosques should teach about aids ! "
thomas barlue , accra the world population is now on the increase , going to about 6.3billion and more everyday .
those ngos and world health agencies have to adopt new methods of solving health related problem .
modern techniques and processes are needed to change these situations about health human health .
every resource used to combat aids in the past needs to be increased and more equipped as the aids virus is enforcing itself .
more awareness programs are needed across the world - even the churches and schools and even the mosques should teach about aids !
thomas barlue , accra , ghana i read recently that uganda had made great headway on this by strong messages from leadership regarding staying with one partner .
this seems simple , and makes sense .
unfortunately the west is in no position to advocate such a moral stance .
bob , usa public enlightenment and orientation remains the only way forward .
i hate it when people always point fingers to only africa , and sometimes asia alone .
it 's a world problem .
solomon , warri , nigeria is enough being done to combat aids ?
yep .
i did my part .
i do n't have unprotected sex .
i do n't share needles either and amazingly , i have n't contracted aids , nor have i spread it .
but i suppose i am simply naive to believe that others could also take responsibility for their own lives and do their little part to stop the spread of this disease .
so often we hear how each individual has to do his / her part to save the planet by driving hybrid cars or recycling yet somehow taking individual responsibility for one 's health for one 's own good and the good of mankind is excused .
stop risky behaviour and you 'll stop aids !
michael , pittsburgh , usa michael from pittsburgh , usa : how can people who can not afford or actually have condoms available for them to take care of themselves ?
yes , people in america can afford all those items for protected sex , but in 3rd world countries it is not possible .
adam mirani , erbil , iraq good for michael , pittsburgh , usa .
at least he 's not going to suffer .
god forbid he should be unlucky enough to find himself misinformed by his government , lied to by religious leaders and have all medication that could help him withheld .
this attitude is typical of the selfish west .
matt , amsterdam , netherlands -lrb- ex uk -rrb- michael from the us lives in a fairy-land being cosseted as a male in the richest place in the planet with every possible right afforded to him .
tell a poor woman in africa who has no ability to " abstain " due to regular rape or an infected husband , to take responsibility for herself .
for people who do n't have fundamental rights , taking responsibility is n't always possible .
get a grip on reality before preaching beyond the borders of your experience .
the us deceives everyone by claiming to donate $ 15b , then having religious conservatives tie it up legally with silly abstinence-only clauses , and drives to ensure the american drug companies continue to squeeze their fair share out of the dying and starving in countries with 1 % of the wealth of the us .
michael , i 'm glad you 're well .
i also hope you realise how lucky you are .
ken , pretoria , south africa to adam / matt : i think you 're missing michael 's point .
he 's advocating the simple principle of personal responsibility .
for you to assume there are societies that , without the help of government or religion , are unable to link sexual habits with the overwhelming death that surrounds them is sad , but you do n't need money to exercise autonomy .
to assume society is there to serve the individual is the short-sighted shame of leftism .
the individual need not , as matt suggests , relinquish their autonomy to the lies of government and religious institutions .
it 's probably worth recognizing that , failing improvements in personal responsibility , drugs effectively prolong life just long enough to enable transmission of drug-resistant strains of hiv .
how 's that for expensive ?
self control .
cheap and effective .
dustin mcminn , usa " a deep and clear knowledge of hiv / aids remains the primary principal heed " abiodun awonuga , sovenga if the huge funds spent on publication of junk and social life magazines could be diverted into massive awareness in local languages in every community in the world , using all existing information media , i think the aids scourge will be checked .
a deep and clear knowledge of hiv / aids remains the primary principal heed that should be at the finger tips of mankind .
abiodun awonuga , sovenga , south africa the vast majority of africans are roman catholic .
the trenchant attitude of this church , and the current pope , is an absolute disgrace .
a positive move here would do a lot in the mid-long term matt , sutton i remember the aids campaigns that ran in the uk in the 80s , including the memorable " do n't die of ignorance " message .
well , millions in africa and asia are dying of ignorance , propagated by governments , the catholic church , and local superstition .
the best thing the west can do is make a concerted effort to educate people as to the causes of this terrible condition .
john , england lack of sexual education is one part of the problem , and lack of drugs is another .
but i see a great danger in the behaviour of local governments and / or religious leaders .
rejecting the number of the victims , or state that condoms are putting our health to a greater level of danger is pure nonsense .
their talking is as dangerous as hiv / aids itself .
mary mccannon , budapest , hungary drugs are n't the answer .
they 're very dangerous and need constant monitoring by a doctor -lrb- not practical in much of the third world -rrb- .
a cocktail of drugs must be matched to each patient .
not taking the exact course of drugs breeds drug resistant strains of the virus .
aids is incurable ... the drugs ca n't make it go away .
the only way to halt the epidemic is to reduce the numbers actually contracting it .
that means monogamy and safe sex .
uganda has started doing this and it has the results to prove it works .
anything else , simply , is wrong .
peter , nottingham , uk a lot is being done to try and combat the disease , at least here in botswana , albeit the intensity of the campaign came rather too late in my opinion .
if asia is beginning to tread africa 's -lrb- botswana 's -rrb- path of sluggishness in combating the disease when it emerged , then infections would sky-rocket !
no country can be blamed for one hard hit by this disease , but when it was first discovered in botswana , late 80s , where were pundits from the so called developed world ?
sirang , gaberone , botswana " so many people are profiting from the aids crisis " anthony barnes , geneva so many people are profiting from the aids crisis , especially unaids , that unlike , say , polio , a vaccine will never be found !
the major diseases of africa , by the way are malaria , tuberculosis , and , oddly enough , blood pressure !
these kill over two million people a year !
anthony barnes , geneva , switzerland if aids is a problem in asia , then let their governments deal with it .
i 'm getting tired of these calls for the world to do something about problems that are the responsibility of sovereign countries .
james ready , uk -lrb- in us -rrb- one idea : if having sex with every tom , dick and harry is made to be viewed as a bad thing , then of course aids will decrease .
maria , london , england aids is not just transmitted by having sex .
abstaining or not from sex is not the answer to this cruel epidemic .
when you have witnessed the death of someone from aids - the pitiful wasting of a body - then it does n't matter how it was contracted .
jp , uk prescription drugs are a large part of the problem .
i just read about a study that was conducted to prove that a three-in-one generic anti-retroviral therapy was as effective as the brand names .
but in order to receive fda approval , the generic drugs must already have been shown to be chemically equivalent to the brand name .
in other words , massive amounts of time and money had to be spent proving something that was already known , just because the us government , guided by profit-driven prescription drug makers , felt it needed more proof that cheaper forms of therapy were effective .
all this means that more people are suffering and dying in the third world while people with money and power drag their feet for the sake of greater financial gain .
sarah dove , new york city , usa " gay witch hunt of the 80s led the heterosexuals to believe they were safe from infection " joseph , uk since the mid 80s when the gay plague first really hit the headlines , the number of homosexual diagnosis has steadily decreased whilst heterosexual diagnosis has steadily increased , until in 2002 , when the number of heterosexuals diagnosed with hiv was double that of homosexuals .
we need only look to media - and tabloids in particular for their gay witch hunt of the 80s - which led the heterosexuals to believe they were safe from infection .
it seems to me that hiv became the forgotten illness until now when an epidemic is forecast for asia , and numbers of new infections are going to rise around the world as a result .
here we go again , except this time , it 's even more deadly because strains being passed on today can be resistant to the combination therapies around because they were transmitted by those already taking combination therapies .
joseph , uk aids is getting worse in africa due largely to prostitution , rape and above all , unprotected sex by men who 'd rather die a slow , lingering death then wear a condom .
dan , uk it is a terrible thing to see so many lives destroyed , especially the children orphaned .
i guess it will be pretty difficult to stop for they lead very promiscuous lives and that compounds the problem rather seriously .
a sad situation without much apparent hope .
aymon de tigliettem , italy as far as the medical side goes and transmission via sexual activity , i think aids is being taken very seriously .
the word is spreading and information is readily available to anyone .
time and effort is being put into stopping the spread , but it all boils down to whether people are willing to listen and take heed .
you can only tell a person to use protection and be safe , but it is up to them whether they use it .
kaz , manchester , england just refrain from sex till you are married .
the fun that you have from all the reckless sex is far less than the pain of combating aids .
a little bit of self control and less desire and can be worth it in the long run .
jhimli , india aids crisis is not taken seriously especially in africa .
the united nations should do more , it 's obvious that they can do better than this .
bill okosun , abuja , nigeria if aids had spread in western countries like it has in africa and asia then you know that our governments would be doing more about it .
i think it 's cruel that we have not provided more help for this epidemic .
more sexual health programmes need to be set up so that people can actually protect themselves from it and also dispel some of the myths about aids as well .
cat , cambridge uk " i am from africa and have lost a lot of family members and friends from aids and it hurts " bridget ingram , canada infection rates are increasing in asia because of poverty levels that are high and people tend to turn to unsafe sex to get money .
the other reason is that the babies being born from infected parents are infected .
there is no program in place to screen all pregnant women for aids in order to save the unborn child and even if there was a program to screen all expecting women there is no medication .
i am from africa and have lost a lot of family members and friends from aids and it hurts .
the west can help by donating drugs to treat at least even just the pregnant women so that the innocent children born will be born healthy .
at least they will be given that 50 % chance of being born aids free .
bridget ingram , canada in the current era of globalised capitalism , all problems have an economic basis .
the aids crisis is no different : the problem is exacerbated by poverty , lack of resources , lack of education and , unfortunately , bad judgement .
and until the economic systems of the world change to allow cheap aids drugs , free aids education and a chance to climb out of poverty for more than half of the world 's citizens , then the aids crisis will only increase exponentially .
kyle d , london , uk for sure not much is being done to combat this unmerciful epidemic .
for heaven sake , let 's pay as much attention to combating aids as that we have paid to combating terrorism since the end result of both of these evils is merciless loss of life .
chishimba francis , rome , italy i think the people need to be educated more about hiv and aids .
when people in countries such as south africa believe that having sex with a virgin will cure them of hiv or aids , then something is seriously wrong .
this belief can only help in the spread of hiv / aids .
perhaps more reporting within these countries may help with the realisation that people need to take action to protect themselves from infection .

we discussed the global aids epidemic in our phone-in programme , talking point .
watch now click here to listen un secretary general kofi annan has attacked the us for failing to deliver enough funds to tackle aids worldwide .
in an exclusive interview with the bbc , he said the fight against terrorism was overshadowing the hiv / aids epidemic .
the americans have also been criticised for their policy of advocating sexual abstinence to prevent aids at the international aids conference in bangkok .
campaigners say the global epidemic can only be controlled if the use of condoms is promoted .
a record five million people were infected with hiv last year , according to the latest united nations report on the aids epidemic .
is enough being done to combat aids ?
is urging abstinence enough ?
have you been affected by aids ?
send us your comments and stories .
this debate is now closed .
thank you for your comments .
we can help slowing down the aids problem by educating everyone of its danger .
ignorance and selfishness do n't help to prevent this deadly disease .
mung , gilroy , ca , us kofi is a real joker .
15 billion is not enough from one country ?
what does the eu give ?
maybe all americans should just sign over their pay checks because corrupt governments ca n't educate their citizens nor do they care .
somehow it 's always america 's fault because the world is so dysfunctional .
i wish we would just get out of the screaming bottomless un .
andrea , cincinnati , usa i wonder what phenomena are at work in the world 's muslim-majority countries that have largely spared their populations from the ravages of aids ?
certainly afghanistan , iraq or mali suffer at least as badly as botswana , russia or thailand from the poor public health services , taboos on sex education , poverty , and lack of female empowerment cited by many here as the roots of this pandemic .
it would seem these societies might be doing something right , and they do n't seem to be bankrupting themselves doing it either .
glenn , washington dc , usa we are doing too much for those whose aids infection stems from their own choice of lifestyles david kriner , singapore i believe that we are doing too much for those whose aids infection stems from their own choice of lifestyles .
the resources could be better directed toward fatal diseases that are not due to choices in lifestyle .
david kriner , singapore i listen to the bbc world service while i am working and i 'm sick of hearing about condoms , aids , sex and hiv .
so what if the fight against terrorism is overshadowing the fight against aids ?
i have sympathy for those people dying of aids but there are millions of people dying of other diseases , and starving to death .
i do n't care about the sex lives of people in africa or thailand .
i just want to listen to the news in peace without every other word being sex or condoms !
elizabeth leighton , monterey , california we must do everything we can to keep the risks people face to a minimum adele , yorkshire abstinence is one method of preventing the spread of hiv in developing countries , just as avoiding fat and cholesterol is one method of preventing a heart attack in western society .
but the fact remains that , in both situations , natural forces will continue to drive many people to take risks .
that 's where education and promoting the use of condoms comes in - we must do everything we can to keep the risks people face to a minimum .
whether it 's a disease that mainly affects the poor or one that comes with wealth , we have a moral responsibility to ensure that all people have access to all available therapies .
adele , yorkshire the idea that abstinence can stop aids is not just unrealistic , but also incredibly crass in its own way .
it reduces the problem of aids to a moralistic one , portraying its sufferers as victims of their own intemperance and promiscuity .
the americans ' approach makes a mockery of people who contracted it through no fault of their own -lrb- blood transfusions , birth , etc -rrb- , as well as others ' efforts to help them .
is this really taking the aids problem seriously ? ?
lj , uk we fought polio and we prevailed .
it was not easy and did not happen overnight .
at one time polio was a scourge just as aids is today .
it will take time and money but we will prevail .
then we will take on the next big disease .
colin , milton , usa the abstinence v. condoms debate is ridiculous .
neither protects the one in three women in south africa who are raped , people paid for donating blood -lrb- using infected needles -rrb- in china , or young girls forced into prostitution in asia .
ruth , uk enough talk more action steve , chicago , usa although i support george bush , mr annan is right .
enough talk more action , the time is now !
let 's fund the un programs adequately .
steve , chicago , usa we have to be realistic .
when one ca n't change habits , one needs to educate .
education remains the best way to stop aids .
when we consider the amount of money invested into the war in iraq , my guess is that rich country can invest more in fighting aids .
i have not been affected by aids so far , but i do care for my future children i hope i 'll have someday .
education is the solutions to many problems in the world , and also for most people .
david cormier , tokyo , japan it 's all very well to teach abstinence , but when the majority of people contracting hiv are women , many of whom are forced to have unprotected sex .
the best way forward is to educate the men who are spreading the disease .
p , uk the us is right to say that abstinence is the best way to stop aids .
but it 's hardly realistic , is it ?
everybody knows aids is escalating in asia thanks largely to prostitutes , many of whom support their families in the country by their work .
how can these people be expected to abstain ?
their families depend on them !
everybody who moans about the promotion of condoms as indicative of a ' permissive society ' fail to see the problem with the sympathy and pragmatism that this world-wide epidemic demands .
what use are your sexual scruples in preventing the deaths of all these people who come from societies which are less privileged than yours ?
get real and support the efforts of those promoting condom use .
henry , london , uk we live in an anything goes world pat , sussex of course abstinence will prevent the spread of aids but who in this world is going to put it forward as a serious option .
we live in an " anything goes world " and self control has no meaning anymore so aids and more will go on , and we will spend millions on finding a cure , just making sure that people can indulge in every way possible .
pat , sussex knowing that any promiscuous behaviour , be it illicit sex or drug use , could bring upon an almost certain death ; yes , it should be enough to stop the illicit behaviour .
wendy , virginia , usa if condoms were so effective why do we have the aids epidemic we have now ?
the fact is before the missionaries were ran out they were teaching abstinence in africa .
they did not have the problem then that they do today .
joseph , kansas city , usa the responsibility is on each person and everyone must be made aware of this jane , foxfield , uk we do n't want to hear that we need to change our sexual behaviour in order to protect ourselves .
we want the government to protect us .
how exactly are they to do it ?
people must be sensible .
if they are not going to use condoms because they are too embarrassed to buy them , then they must refrain from risky behaviour .
the responsibility is on each person and everyone must be made aware of this .
jane , foxfield , uk what a load of tosh .
of course not having sex will mean that the virus is n't spread .
problem is that most people - the faithful and faithless alike - only give a degree of lip service to abstinence , because natural forces drive our sexuality that are quite un-natural to fight .
matt , chelmsford , uk this is a typical us policy , blind to the realities of this world .
abstinence is simply an unrealistic way of counteracting aids .
the reality is that people have sex and as such we should do all we can to prevent aids from spreading by promoting condoms .
we must also educate people as far as aids is concerned , and if religious groups really wish to , promote abstinence .
but these groups must realise that abstinence based on religious persuasion will not appeal to all , it probably wo n't even appeal to a majority of people living in places where the aids epidemic has erupted .
therefore , let us be rational and realistic about the whole matter and think of real solutions !
james k. , exeter / uk there is not one way to stop aids , except education .
abstinence should be part of the education program , as well as safe sex , etc .
condoms are not 100 percent safe either .
the more people know - the better they can decide to protect themselves .
dalo , coral gables , fl , usa a ridiculous policy based upon the theological musings of elderly un-married men jerry taylor , london , uk the preaching of abstinence has never been particularly effective .
the catholic church is certainly to blame ; for encouraging poor and ill-educated people to take its preaching seriously whilst in its european homeland of its richer and better educated adherents the vast majority cheerfully ignore it ; for spreading inaccurate information about condoms ; and for having a ridiculous policy based upon the theological musings of elderly un-married men .
jerry taylor , london , uk abstinence is not an option .
humans are sexual beings .
the debates about condom use are also part of a wider issue concerning other stis and family planning .
being faithful to one person is a very good strategy for minimising the spread of diseases but it is not an option for family planning if people admit that they enjoy sex and want to have it more often than they want to make children .
abstinence does n't work .
what 's wrong with sex ?
if we realise that sex is nothing shameful and stop treating the issue with this in mind and promote valuing sex as something good and nice that can be shared between two people in a responsible way then we will be getting somewhere in the fight against aids , stis and also unwanted pregnancies .
phill wilcox , manchester abstinence is the law written by god for the good of mankind -lrb- for our spiritual , emotional , and physical well being -rrb- , and for the preservation of his plan for faithfulness and fidelity in marriage -lrb- between one man and one woman -rrb- and the health of families and children .
abstinence is the only way to prevent aids .
susan tiffany , cleveland , ohio usa abstinence education is simply moronic religious bantering by the short-sighted idiots running our foreign policy .
eric garcia , denver , usa condoms are not an option ; self control is the only way maria , helsby how can anyone blame the catholic church for the current aids epidemic ?
the church 's teaching has always been clear , abstinence before marriage and sex only between married couples .
it has taken aids to show the truth of this argument .
condoms are not an option ; self control is the only way .
maria , helsby , england although abstinence is the most reliable way of stopping the spread of aids it is unrealistic to expect casual sex to stop in a world where sex and sexuality is used to sell everything from cars to films .
education in how to have sex safely is the only way to curb this disease .
vik , uk it relies on people going against their natural instincts and needs david hazel , fareham sexual abstinence would solve all of our problems , would n't it ?
it would ensure there were n't any more of us to have problems .
the trouble with this approach is that it suffers from the same problem as dieting to lose weight .
it relies on people going against their natural instincts and needs , with all the resulting frustration that perpetual dieters experience .
as with dieting , the result would be that nature will have its way in the end , under circumstances which are less well-controlled than they might have been .
another shot in the foot for the human race , i feel .
david hazel , fareham , uk my best friend is dying of aids .
a colleague recently lost her daughter .
my mother is nursing a sick neighbour .
as a south african , i have seen the ravages of aids on a personal level .
and you think , if only they had been careful .
if only they had abstained .
if only ... but the reality is that human beings are sexual creatures , full stop .
live with it .
deal with it .
it is the nature of things .
charl senekal , johannesburg the problem is not confined to one reason so needs multiple solutions ; sexual fidelity , poverty eradication , abstinence , supply of drugs , educating people and health facilities .
qismat ullah khan , peshawar , pakistan it is interesting that most people write from the detached perspective of the uninvolved .
i thought it would never affect me and well , now it has .
hiv is everyone 's problem , whatever your religious and moral beliefs .
sticking your head in the sand and taking the moral high ground are both equally futile .
what a pity people only realise that , like i did , when it 's too late .
py , london abstinence is not really natural for many people .
thus , the reality is that they will not do it .
which means they should act responsibly and use a condom when they do have sex .
no amount of legislation or bribery by politicians will change reality .
w morgan , hanoi , vietnam abstinence will not work , and thus it will never be the cure against aids timo , lausanne from a scientific point of view : it is the way of nature to keep our species alive by reproduction and evolution .
to reach this goal , nature will not care about marriage or faithfulness .
there 's nothing we can do about that , but using a condom makes things a lot more secure .
from a religious point of view : god made us all vulnerable to temptation .
most of the time we can resist , but sometimes we can not resist .
and for these times we can not resist , using a condom is the only means to stay healthy .
abstinence will not work , and thus it will never be the cure against aids .
timo , lausanne , switzerland the emphasis has to be always on self help : self-education and self-control .
no amount of pumping anti-viral drugs and even money which may end up in pockets unless properly channelled is likely to help .
most of all , it has to be on the acknowledged national agenda and priority where it has reached epidemic proportions .
saravan , uk the arguments presented here against the catholic church are specious .
yes , that church is opposed to contraception but it is even more strongly opposed to promiscuity .
anyone who does n't use contraception but is promiscuous is n't listening to the catholic church anyway .
the spread of aids in africa has more to do with poverty and tribal attitudes than catholic ideals .
annika lagerstrom , örebro , sweden before we have to choose between monogamy and abstinence , let 's remember the spread of hiv is n't confined to the sexually promiscuous .
enough men , women and children are dying from aids-related illness around the world to prove this .
we 're therefore increasingly at the mercy of the pharmaceutical giants and governments , who must act swiftly and benevolently before life expectancy is further reduced .
dan benham , london , uk if so , the enemy we fight is much worse than hiv ken , florida why is there such hostility to abstinence education ?
is it verboten in this day and age to use words such as morality , fidelity , monogamy , or abstinence ?
if so , the enemy we fight is much worse than hiv .
ken , florida , usa being the true christian , muslim or jew - abstinence when young and then loving relationships in marriage are crucial to fighting aids .
it is so simple that i can not understand why the un and others governments do not overwhelmingly support this attitude .
henryk karas , poland , sexual behaviour is hard to change and simply giving information will not change that behaviour .
many people know smoking cigarettes is dangerous but they still smoke !
sexual pleasure has been the cheapest and easiest method which all humans have used to survive in a dark and hopeless world .
until we have a world where humans feel loved , supported and safe , the aids epidemic will remain rampant .
in the short-term , however , the suffering from aids could be reduced if the pharmaceutical industry would become humane enough to reduce the cost of the " cocktail " of drugs for persons with the disease in the developing world .
debbie , kingston , jamaica i do n't think that the aids crisis is taken seriously enough .
in fiji the authorities are just beginning to sit up and listen after numbers of cases were reported and some of those infected started coming out and talking about it .
rosemary naivalurua , suva , fiji it is time that they recognised the problem tavi samoila , ottawa , canada one of the main obstacles to prevention is the opposition of the catholic church and other religious institutions to birth-control methods such as condoms .
in many underdeveloped countries , especially in rural areas , the organised religion institutions -lrb- churches , mosques , temples , etc -rrb- are the only way to convey a message to the majority of the population .
it is time that they recognised the problem , stop preaching against condoms , and become more involved in preaching the benefits of safe sex as well as a basic sex education to the population .
tavi samoila , ottawa , canada last week i spent a week in cambodia on a work experience trip .
one of the places we visited was an aids hospice run by nuns who work under the order set up by mother teresa .
infection rates in asia are increasing in my opinion because there is a lot of prostitution going on and there is very little education about stis and aids .
katriona , singapore , ex-british i just read a part of the report from dr piot who is the executive director of unaids and he does know what is he is talking about ... for many women in africa , the mantra of abc , abstinence , be faithful and condoms - which is regularly recited by outside agencies and especially the us is pretty irrelevant , he said .
the aids pandemic in africa is hitting women worst .
nearly 60 % of the victims are female , and they often do not have option of abstinence , fidelity or condom use .
many are subject to violent , non-consensual sex by men .
i wish that more people would read and get educated before passing judgement .
marsha , los angeles , usa communities must change the way they deal with aids infected people gail , south africa < having worked in a rural hospital in northern kwazulu-natal , i was able to see the effects of aids first hand .
dealing with aids is multi faceted - the governments have to change their approach -lrb- in the case of our government just admit that hiv and aids are connected -rrb- , communities must change the way they deal with aids infected people , individuals must accept that aids is real , yes in the majority of instances it is also connected to socio economic groups .
the younger generation are in denial - my own nieces and nephews think that it will not happen to them as they come from a good middle class background - although aids and stds are mentioned all the time and society is open .
possibly until each family has a member that is hiv positive attitudes may change .
there is no simple solution .
gail , south africa we are at the point where million of people are slowly dying and we blame these people for becoming affected or we blame their religion or customs .
how cruel can some be that when faced with human pain all he has to say is that you brought it to your self because ... -lrb- fill the blank -rrb- .
what the west has to face is that not only we are not a part of the solution but we are also a part of the problem .
we have to accept that sex vacation -lrb- a major contributor in aids on asia -rrb- is powered mostly by westerners .
panagiotis l , athens greece i 'm in banaglore , india at the moment , and though it is one of the most developed cities in the country it is almost impossible to buy a condom here .
they are not freely laid out on the shelves as they are in the uk and other western countries .
to buy a condom , you 'd have to search hard , and have to ask , but since there is such a huge taboo over the issues of sex here , not many people will ask .
it is their culture .
to impose a huge strategy of delivering condoms here and discussing the issues of safe sex would mean imposing elements of western culture upon them - a culture which many view as loose and immoral .
there is a desperate need for greater distribution of sex education around the world , but for it to work successfully by embracing the people , we have to always remember that they live in an almost entirely different culture to us and hold different values .
rebecca , london , uk anyone who has a friend or member of their family suffering from aids or have known someone who died from aids will know the pain and illness involved .
well said katherine , " we should be helping our fellow human beings " sitting in judgement , well , let he who is without sin cast the first stone !
mike harries , swansea , uk if people stop behaving in an immoral manner , aids will stop .
mike newton , singapore if people stop behaving in an immoral manner , aids will stop .
the spouse who infects the other spouse is guilty of murder and should be punished accordingly mike newton , singapore the un report links the increase in aids to the fact that the majority of women in africa and asia lose their virginity through non-consensual sex with an older man .
in short , these cultures are suffering because rape is the norm .
nk , uk i think aids is a global epidemic and not enough is being done to give treatments to ever infected person .
the who should insist the rich countries pay for haart for the third world , the governments should increase the taxes to the greedy drug producing companies .
it is very unfair that if you are born in the third world and develop aids funding is denied .
e collins , bolton if 40 % of the population of a european country were hiv positive , we 'd have found a cure by now .
paul , cardiff the religious dogma and stereotyping is what is bogging the campaign down james , uk the religious dogma and stereotyping is what is bogging the campaign down , aids can not be combated until these are removed from the equation , only then will programmes of education work to their full effectiveness .
james , uk the aids campaign is ridiculous and all about turning the issue of aids into a debate about racism .
there should be no taxpayers ' money spent on treatment drugs in developing countries unless there is more emphasis into prevention and education , which is much cheaper and far more efficient .
uganda has shown how to do it and cut the infection rate from over 30 % to just 6 % in a decade through education .
way to go .
m wallengren , copenhagen , denmark there is a cure for aids .
it 's called abstinence .
when the world stops its immoral lust for adulterous sex , and illicit drug abuse , we 'll have our cure .
until then i say take all the money earmarked for aids around the world and put it into a fund for ridding the world of something really insidious such as cancer .
mark , yakima , usa how about we put people 's lives above profit and ideology ?
katherine , london , uk teaching abstinence only - hmm , yes - that will help the women who are in thrall to their husbands who use prostitutes .
no doubt it will also help the children who are infected in the womb ?
here 's a thought - how about we make the drugs cheap and the education wide ranging ?
how about we put people 's lives above profit and ideology ?
how about we stop being patronising and assuming that we know best and just help out as fellow human beings because that is the right thing to do ?
katherine , london , uk i believe the aids crisis is not being taking seriously due to lack of education mainly in third world countries .
also , the superpowers of today are too pre-occupied with wars and destruction so the important issues are being blurred out .
ziad daher , al-khobar , saudi arabia if religious types go around preaching terrorism , they are dealt with severely .
if they preach against condoms , we do nothing .
at the end of the day , who are the greatest killers ?
jon e , france as long as there are ignorance , superstition and hypocrisy , people will get infected with aids .
in the developing world , education would go a long way to help the situation .
preaching , blaming the west etc will not help .
people must take responsibility for their actions .
no drug can cure aids .
the rich may be able to give food and medicines to the poor , but we ca n't cure them .
people have to protect themselves .
someone needs to stand up and speak the truth in the face of political and religious dogma and lies .
iain nicholson , uk african leaders have no time to combat aids , all they have time for is to protect their regimes from coups .
kathaab afandi , spain why is the who spending millions on testing for hiv in africa ?
the tests are expensive -lrb- and not always reliable -rrb- .
surely africa would be better served by having the money spent on education and on other areas that are much needed to combat the problem rather than tell us what we already know ?
nick manon , inverness , scotland looking for weapons of mass destruction ?
it 's hiv / aids .
yemi , ibadan , nigeria my god ! 40 % infection rates ?
we have to throw everything , absolutely all we can afford at educating these poor countries .
you ca n't just tell them to use a condom and get over it .
an understanding of viral infections and human disease at a very basic level is also required .
this is not a mercy mission .
first africa , now , apparently asia and central europe .
this is a threat to all of us !
i remember big campaigns in the 80s about aids and then nothing .
why ?
we 've had our warning , i reckon this could be it for mankind .
chas knight , duxford , uk human suffering is big money evan , uk / dubai the monopoly that several -lrb- american -rrb- drugs companies have on the treatment of aids means that progress will never be made until the american government gets out of bed with them .
drugs are making far too much money for these companies for the business-controlled government to instigate any real research which might make the old , expensive drugs obsolete .
human suffering is big money .
evan , uk / dubai i 'm not sure how it can be commented these countries do n't take it seriously .
they are human beings just as you and i and any human being would be affected by seeing people around them dying from this disease .
i spent a month in malawi last summer and things are being tried to help .
the new president has organised massive condom campaigns which were seen in all the major cities .
the rural areas are the problems .
there is a serious lack of communication links and medical facilities available in these areas , so there situation ca n't really be helped .
to say it 's not being taken seriously is something , i feel , us people in the rich , western , first world can not judge .
the lifestyles of these countries , needing many children for income , lack of basic healthcare and lack of education on the matter means that little can be done to help the people that get infected and the taboo of the subject does n't help much either sophie , uk the world had ignored the problem of aids for a long time .
it is never too late to take some drastic action in order to curb the spread of aids .
once upon a time people with leprosy were isolated and treated .
this same process could help the world in checking the spread of this dreaded disease .
isolate those that are infected .
first , this checks further spread .
and then treat them as a group .
the who could take this programme up .
i know people would shout of fundamental human rights .
but did n't those with leprosy have those rights ?
please save the world from total annihilation .
clement chukwudifu , abuja , nigeria a person can be perfectly responsible with more than one partner kaz , briton in nj , usa why concentrate on monogamy ?
as a monogamous person with polyamourous friends , i know that a person can be perfectly responsible with more than one partner - indeed , people who have consciously decided to be responsibly polyamourous tend to be better educated about safer sex and stds than many monogamous people .
kaz , briton in nj , usa it must be remembered that every culture is different and a microcosm unto itself .
the comments here reflect an excellent way of finding out exactly how to help people : to actually ask them how they and their communities feel about hiv - and what practical things they need done to stop them and their loved ones being at risk .
the availability of medicine for pregnant women is an excellent suggestion - as is treatment or support for those who have been raped or deliberately infected .
if we ca n't beat aids let 's at least help those who have it by asking them directly what they want or need , and getting it for them .
emma-joy , essex , uk there is no doubt that in the third world , ignorance is a major factor .
in the west , however , survey after survey seems to show that the safe -lrb- or , at least , safer -rrb- sex message is ignored by large numbers of people .
certainly , rates of other stds continue to climb , suggesting that people continue to indulge in risky sexual behaviour .
but people continue to smoke too , so why should we be surprised ?
jg , huddersfield uk poverty and illiteracy are the curse and main determinants for risk of hiv and aids .
fighting against poverty can reduce risk of hiv / aids .
the problem , fighting against hiv / aids , is also lack of political willingness in many asian countries .
barna and monir , karlstad , sweden stop all the useless meetings and conferences kondwani munthali , malawi aids does not need a commission , special agency or strategy .
we have looked at our pocket needs instead of the realistic ways of addressing this pandemic .
aids requires no strategy , but commitment to change southern african men 's perspectives , educate more women and create more opportunities for everyone .
it does not need a strong international conference , we always have many money spending binges in the name of the 25-million suffering .
men need to be taught one message - if you get aids you die , if you sleep with many women without protection you will catch it .
stop all the useless meetings and conferences .
kondwani munthali , cardiff / malawian let 's face it hiv / aids is here to stay .
the disease has now become inextricably linked with economic status .
the number of people living with hiv / aids exploded in india and china .
that alone is the indicator that illiteracy and abject poverty play an all too important part in the spread of hiv / aids .
it is obvious that more should be done to tackle the spread of hiv / aids but this must go hand in hand with eradicating extreme poverty and combating illiteracy .
issara , bangkok , thailand the aids problem does n't really exist in my country , not because there are no hiv / aids infected people in japan but simply because people ignore the issue by not paying enough attention to it and not discussing it publicly .
behind the sheer curtains , the number of hiv / aids infected population is surely increasing .
sakura , fukuoka , japan i believe that the biggest danger that may come of this is an intergenerational gap .
in fact a lot of african countries are having problems transferring their culture to the up and coming generations , who are slowly losing a part of their roots and heritage .
lucious costa , canada getting a cure for aids is perhaps ten times better than five hundred billion dollars in aid golit peter dada , abuja - nigeria why we still have aids ravaging the world 's most productive sector of the population today is because developed countries are not seriously affected .
otherwise , a cure would have been found since .
my earnest plea with the advanced countries is for them to intensify their search for a cure which must yield results in less than five years ; if not , by then , africa should be forgotten from the face of the earth in view of the colossal loss that would have emerged .
getting a cure for aids is perhaps ten times better than five hundred billion dollars in aid .
golit peter dada , abuja - nigeria in all african countries aids is not taken seriously .
the only hope which can reduce the number is to have big roll religious centres .
look in ethiopia the number is growing very fast .
mussa , eritrea having moved to the uk three years ago from south africa , i can not believe how ignorant people are here in the uk regarding aids .
it seems to be seen as predominantly a problem for the poor .
with global travel becoming more and more accessible the threat of aids spreading further is even greater .
the resent increase in new infections of other sexually transmitted diseases within the uk should be a warning .
according to some aids experts an increase in other sexually transmitted diseases is normally a precursor to an increase in hiv / aids infections .
steven , uk / south africa a friend worked for three years in botswana by the main highway linking south africa to the zimbabwe area , in that time three local villages were reduced by aids spread by truck drivers , from over 1,000 persons to less than three hundred .
a catastrophe in any language .
what lead to it - educational ignorance , government indifference , endemic poverty , religious bigotry .
can the disease be stopped - probably not in the lifetime of most of africans .
will the deaths go increasing - undoubtedly .
all the money in the world , all the drugs in the world , can not overcome the deficiencies of education and the effects of blinding poverty .
peter , germany what we need is marital / sexual fidelity , not condoms !
chris , aarau , switzerland if at long last governments and the media would value truth more than political correctness - that is : stop preaching polygamy and clearly state the fact that hiv-infection is , as has always been the case , an entirely -lrb- 99.99 % -rrb- preventable disease , then we are talking about taking aids seriously .
what we need is marital / sexual fidelity , not condoms !
propagating the latter is a pathetic and dangerous attempt to cover up the basic problem !
chris , aarau , switzerland aids crisis ?
first .
we know that , worldwide , huge amounts of money are spent every day in weapons .
second .
we could join our voices and ask our governments to spend differently our money .
third -lrb- and last -rrb- .
we already know that our lifestyle is one of the main reasons of third world 's people living conditions .
aids crisis ?
or hypocrisies ?
gianluca agati , forlì , italy no terrorist attack has claimed 42 million lives ...
aids has , and the number still rises , and the reaction to this little piece of evidence has not changed much .
peter , kampala , uganda aids is not being taken seriously by the people on the ground here in africa .
many people do not wish to know their hiv status and that causes problems as they go on to infect others unknowingly .
also many here are in denial they still blame witchcraft for clearly hiv / aids related diseases .
many organisations spend money meant for aids affected people on seminars , workshops and other useless talk shops .
veap ndlovu , zimbabwe first , the catholic church must change its extremely harmful attitude to contraception and stop telling lies about condoms .
second , people in developing countries need education - not just about sex but in general too .
last but not least , when it comes to sexual behaviour , people everywhere need to develop sense of responsibility towards themselves and others .
mika piirainen , joensuu , finland i am a young englishmen working in the samara region of russia where i understand there are high rates of hiv infection .
yet , i have not seen any warnings , adverts or education campaigns .
russians are still very casual about sex and something needs to be done by the russian government who appear to be simply ignoring the problem .
gw , russia 40 % of adults in a country are hiv positive ; how can anyone say the aids crisis is being taken seriously ?
kpdodo , mauritius 40 % of adults in a country are hiv positive ; how can anyone say the aids crisis is being taken seriously ?
it takes information , from local leaders , irrespective of religious background , to inform the people who respect them as to how to protect themselves .
it takes a more humane approach to drug therapy to slow down the progression of the virus .
how many souls to a dollar of dividend in the large pharmaceutical companies ?
or most probably , per dollar in the pay packages of the top executives of these firms ?
kpdodo , mauritius there are two important factors which support hiv , illiteracy and lack of women rights and therefore little hope for the african countries to cope there hiv crisis stefan neifer , berlin , germany yes i am affected by the hiv because all those who are suffering are human being and i feel the agonies of all those people .
because people in asia are more resistant to new methods of evading sexually transmitted diseases .
moreover poverty deteriorates the situation as well .
awais qarni , lahore pakistan i have noticed that in the eastern europe where i live , the people do not give much importance to stds , rather , they concentrate only in avoiding pregnancy .
the use of contraceptive drugs is the issue in this area .
only few weeks ago after joining eu , i noticed on the streets of tallinn for the first time , advertisements about aids and that lasted for just two weeks .
right now everything is back to square one .
so also the other states i have visited in this region .
there should be much concerns about this because i see the neglect on the side of the government to properly educate people here .
opara victor , nigerian in estonia governments and churches of all faiths need to put more efforts in the reform of mankind and sexuality ahmad hmoud , amman no i do not think it is taken seriously .
it may be by some countries or even some people .
in general sexual behaviour and the sex industry together with pharmaceutical establishments can do more to clean up their act and put man before profit .
governments and churches of all faiths need to put more efforts in the reform of mankind and sexuality .
ahmad hmoud , amman , jordan if leaders are not serious about this epidemic , then i do n't see aids reducing in the world .
you actually see big people who are reckless with their lives and tell people to change when they do n't want to change in their behaviour .
practice what you preach .
tamika , blantyre , malawi remove the patents on aids medicines from american firms .
this would enable others to produce low-cost drugs that would be affordable to the african countries .
global science needs to be mobilised to tackle the aids crisis .
tom stambollouianq , thailand tom from thailand : if you do not honour drug companies ' patent rights , research into new drugs -lrb- not just for aids -rrb- will stop .
nobody loves the drug companies , but you can not expect them to carry out research for the love of science or out of altruism .
welcome to the real world .
andrew , london there needs to be more involvement by the government to create more awareness of the disease and preventative measures , including abstinence .
superstitions and false rumours about the disease and some of the measures to prevent it also need to be addressed - if you believe that condoms are actually a device from the west to handicap you in some way , would you use it ?
church leaders also need to take a stance , too many do n't talk about aids and make it seem shameful .
those with the disease should also not be cast aside by society , this is how the disease spreads so rapidly , everyone is ashamed to confront it and so keep quiet and carry on as before .
wambui , nairobi , kenya maybe instead of always teaching safe sex , as if there is such a thing , we should be presenting abstinence as an equally -lrb- or more -rrb- valid option .
in my high school when they teach us about sex , they present it in a way that assumes all kids are having sex and so , this is how you protect yourself .
would n't it be much healthier to wait till marriage ?
i do n't think that you have to have any religious views to agree that no sex is safe sex .
shannon , usa even the mosques should teach about aids !
thomas barlue , accra the world population is now on the increase , going to about 6.3billion and more everyday .
those ngos and world health agencies have to adopt new methods of solving health related problem .
modern techniques and processes are needed to change these situations about health human health .
every resource used to combat aids in the past needs to be increased and more equipped as the aids virus is enforcing itself .
more awareness programs are needed across the world - even the churches and schools and even the mosques should teach about aids !
thomas barlue , accra , ghana i read recently that uganda had made great headway on this by strong messages from leadership regarding staying with one partner .
this seems simple , and makes sense .
unfortunately the west is in no position to advocate such a moral stance .
bob , usa public enlightenment and orientation remains the only way forward .
i hate it when people always point fingers to only africa , and sometimes asia alone .
it 's a world problem .
solomon , warri , nigeria is enough being done to combat aids ?
yep .
i did my part .
i do n't have unprotected sex .
i do n't share needles either and amazingly , i have n't contracted aids , nor have i spread it .
but i suppose i am simply naive to believe that others could also take responsibility for their own lives and do their little part to stop the spread of this disease .
so often we hear how each individual has to do his / her part to save the planet by driving hybrid cars or recycling yet somehow taking individual responsibility for one 's health for one 's own good and the good of mankind is excused .
stop risky behaviour and you 'll stop aids !
michael , pittsburgh , usa michael from pittsburgh , usa : how can people who can not afford or actually have condoms available for them to take care of themselves ?
yes , people in america can afford all those items for protected sex , but in 3rd world countries it is not possible .
adam mirani , erbil , iraq good for michael , pittsburgh , usa .
at least he 's not going to suffer .
god forbid he should be unlucky enough to find himself misinformed by his government , lied to by religious leaders and have all medication that could help him withheld .
this attitude is typical of the selfish west .
matt , amsterdam , netherlands -lrb- ex uk -rrb- michael from the us lives in a fairy-land being cosseted as a male in the richest place in the planet with every possible right afforded to him .
tell a poor woman in africa who has no ability to " abstain " due to regular rape or an infected husband , to take responsibility for herself .
for people who do n't have fundamental rights , taking responsibility is n't always possible .
get a grip on reality before preaching beyond the borders of your experience .
the us deceives everyone by claiming to donate $ 15b , then having religious conservatives tie it up legally with silly abstinence-only clauses , and drives to ensure the american drug companies continue to squeeze their fair share out of the dying and starving in countries with 1 % of the wealth of the us .
michael , i 'm glad you 're well .
i also hope you realise how lucky you are .
ken , pretoria , south africa to adam / matt : i think you 're missing michael 's point .
he 's advocating the simple principle of personal responsibility .
for you to assume there are societies that , without the help of government or religion , are unable to link sexual habits with the overwhelming death that surrounds them is sad , but you do n't need money to exercise autonomy .
to assume society is there to serve the individual is the short-sighted shame of leftism .
the individual need not , as matt suggests , relinquish their autonomy to the lies of government and religious institutions .
it 's probably worth recognizing that , failing improvements in personal responsibility , drugs effectively prolong life just long enough to enable transmission of drug-resistant strains of hiv .
how 's that for expensive ?
self control .
cheap and effective .
dustin mcminn , usa a deep and clear knowledge of hiv / aids remains the primary principal heed abiodun awonuga , sovenga if the huge funds spent on publication of junk and social life magazines could be diverted into massive awareness in local languages in every community in the world , using all existing information media , i think the aids scourge will be checked .
a deep and clear knowledge of hiv / aids remains the primary principal heed that should be at the finger tips of mankind .
abiodun awonuga , sovenga , south africa the vast majority of africans are roman catholic .
the trenchant attitude of this church , and the current pope , is an absolute disgrace .
a positive move here would do a lot in the mid-long term matt , sutton i remember the aids campaigns that ran in the uk in the 80s , including the memorable " do n't die of ignorance " message .
well , millions in africa and asia are dying of ignorance , propagated by governments , the catholic church , and local superstition .
the best thing the west can do is make a concerted effort to educate people as to the causes of this terrible condition .
john , england lack of sexual education is one part of the problem , and lack of drugs is another .
but i see a great danger in the behaviour of local governments and / or religious leaders .
rejecting the number of the victims , or state that condoms are putting our health to a greater level of danger is pure nonsense .
their talking is as dangerous as hiv / aids itself .
mary mccannon , budapest , hungary drugs are n't the answer .
they 're very dangerous and need constant monitoring by a doctor -lrb- not practical in much of the third world -rrb- .
a cocktail of drugs must be matched to each patient .
not taking the exact course of drugs breeds drug resistant strains of the virus .
aids is incurable ... the drugs ca n't make it go away .
the only way to halt the epidemic is to reduce the numbers actually contracting it .
that means monogamy and safe sex .
uganda has started doing this and it has the results to prove it works .
anything else , simply , is wrong .
peter , nottingham , uk a lot is being done to try and combat the disease , at least here in botswana , albeit the intensity of the campaign came rather too late in my opinion .
if asia is beginning to tread africa 's -lrb- botswana 's -rrb- path of sluggishness in combating the disease when it emerged , then infections would sky-rocket !
no country can be blamed for one hard hit by this disease , but when it was first discovered in botswana , late 80s , where were pundits from the so called developed world ?
sirang , gaberone , botswana so many people are profiting from the aids crisis anthony barnes , geneva so many people are profiting from the aids crisis , especially unaids , that unlike , say , polio , a vaccine will never be found !
the major diseases of africa , by the way are malaria , tuberculosis , and , oddly enough , blood pressure !
these kill over two million people a year !
anthony barnes , geneva , switzerland if aids is a problem in asia , then let their governments deal with it .
i 'm getting tired of these calls for the world to do something about problems that are the responsibility of sovereign countries .
james ready , uk -lrb- in us -rrb- one idea : if having sex with every tom , dick and harry is made to be viewed as a bad thing , then of course aids will decrease .
maria , london , england aids is not just transmitted by having sex .
abstaining or not from sex is not the answer to this cruel epidemic .
when you have witnessed the death of someone from aids - the pitiful wasting of a body - then it does n't matter how it was contracted .
jp , uk prescription drugs are a large part of the problem .
i just read about a study that was conducted to prove that a three-in-one generic anti-retroviral therapy was as effective as the brand names .
but in order to receive fda approval , the generic drugs must already have been shown to be chemically equivalent to the brand name .
in other words , massive amounts of time and money had to be spent proving something that was already known , just because the us government , guided by profit-driven prescription drug makers , felt it needed more proof that cheaper forms of therapy were effective .
all this means that more people are suffering and dying in the third world while people with money and power drag their feet for the sake of greater financial gain .
sarah dove , new york city , usa gay witch hunt of the 80s led the heterosexuals to believe they were safe from infection joseph , uk since the mid 80s when the gay plague first really hit the headlines , the number of homosexual diagnosis has steadily decreased whilst heterosexual diagnosis has steadily increased , until in 2002 , when the number of heterosexuals diagnosed with hiv was double that of homosexuals .
we need only look to media - and tabloids in particular for their gay witch hunt of the 80s - which led the heterosexuals to believe they were safe from infection .
it seems to me that hiv became the forgotten illness until now when an epidemic is forecast for asia , and numbers of new infections are going to rise around the world as a result .
here we go again , except this time , it 's even more deadly because strains being passed on today can be resistant to the combination therapies around because they were transmitted by those already taking combination therapies .
joseph , uk aids is getting worse in africa due largely to prostitution , rape and above all , unprotected sex by men who 'd rather die a slow , lingering death then wear a condom .
dan , uk it is a terrible thing to see so many lives destroyed , especially the children orphaned .
i guess it will be pretty difficult to stop for they lead very promiscuous lives and that compounds the problem rather seriously .
a sad situation without much apparent hope .
aymon de tigliettem , italy as far as the medical side goes and transmission via sexual activity , i think aids is being taken very seriously .
the word is spreading and information is readily available to anyone .
time and effort is being put into stopping the spread , but it all boils down to whether people are willing to listen and take heed .
you can only tell a person to use protection and be safe , but it is up to them whether they use it .
kaz , manchester , england just refrain from sex till you are married .
the fun that you have from all the reckless sex is far less than the pain of combating aids .
a little bit of self control and less desire and can be worth it in the long run .
jhimli , india aids crisis is not taken seriously especially in africa .
the united nations should do more , it 's obvious that they can do better than this .
bill okosun , abuja , nigeria if aids had spread in western countries like it has in africa and asia then you know that our governments would be doing more about it .
i think it 's cruel that we have not provided more help for this epidemic .
more sexual health programmes need to be set up so that people can actually protect themselves from it and also dispel some of the myths about aids as well .
cat , cambridge uk i am from africa and have lost a lot of family members and friends from aids and it hurts bridget ingram , canada infection rates are increasing in asia because of poverty levels that are high and people tend to turn to unsafe sex to get money .
the other reason is that the babies being born from infected parents are infected .
there is no program in place to screen all pregnant women for aids in order to save the unborn child and even if there was a program to screen all expecting women there is no medication .
i am from africa and have lost a lot of family members and friends from aids and it hurts .
the west can help by donating drugs to treat at least even just the pregnant women so that the innocent children born will be born healthy .
at least they will be given that 50 % chance of being born aids free .
bridget ingram , canada in the current era of globalised capitalism , all problems have an economic basis .
the aids crisis is no different : the problem is exacerbated by poverty , lack of resources , lack of education and , unfortunately , bad judgement .
and until the economic systems of the world change to allow cheap aids drugs , free aids education and a chance to climb out of poverty for more than half of the world 's citizens , then the aids crisis will only increase exponentially .
kyle d , london , uk for sure not much is being done to combat this unmerciful epidemic .
for heaven sake , let 's pay as much attention to combating aids as that we have paid to combating terrorism since the end result of both of these evils is merciless loss of life .
chishimba francis , rome , italy i think the people need to be educated more about hiv and aids .
when people in countries such as south africa believe that having sex with a virgin will cure them of hiv or aids , then something is seriously wrong .
this belief can only help in the spread of hiv / aids .
perhaps more reporting within these countries may help with the realisation that people need to take action to protect themselves from infection .
