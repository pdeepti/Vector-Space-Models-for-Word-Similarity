it 's long been a forbidden word for health-conscious drinkers , playing a very distant second to wine .
but a brewery in the eastern german state of brandenburg is hoping to change that with a new beer that claims to provide a fountain of youth for its drinkers . and that could bring a sigh of relief for suds lovers with a mind for their body .
klosterbrauerei neuzelle in the small town of neuzelle on the german-polish border will this week unveil a new " anti-aging beer " that combines tasty malt with some wellness world favorites , including the wonder algae spirulina .
the brewery ’ s ceo , helmut fritsche , plans to introduce the new brew at this week ’ s green week food industry fair in berlin and hopes to place it on store shelves by march .
" when people drink beer , why shouldn ’ t they be able to drink a healthy beer , " fritsche recently told the märkische oderzeitung newspaper .
a bottle a day keeps cancer away ?
the brew ’ s main ingredients are thermal brine water from the nearby health resort bad saarow , as well as spirulina , an algae , and flavonoide , a plant extract commonly used in anti-wrinkle creams .
flavonoides are also known to protect against arteriosclerosis , high blood pressure and cancer .
spirulina , with more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bottle keeps cancer away ? than 100 nutrients including beta carotene , chlorophyll , vitamin b12 , has been described as one of the healthiest foods .
meanwhile , brine water aids in digestion and maintaining metabolism and healthy blood pressure as well as helping the body rid itself of heavy metals and toxins like quicksilver , lead , arsenic , amalgam or even chalk build-up .
but it is still beer , and too much of it could undo the fountain of youth effect and , worse , bring on a nasty hangover .
fritsche warns that moderation is essential when drinking his " anti-aging " beer .
after all , each bottle does contain 4.8 percent alcohol .
trouble in wellness land the drink 's alcohol level is n't the only problem fritsche faces in convincing potential beer buyers .
because the sudsy mix doesn ’ t jibe with the german purity law of 1516 , the company won ’ t be able to sell it as beer in this country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hops , malt , yeast and water are the only beer ingredients allowed under germany 's purity law .
the purity law , first created to protect the reputation and quality of the german beer market , is one of the world ’ s oldest food regulations .
the law holds that beverages labeled " beer " may only contain hops , malt , yeast and water .
" i ’ ve applied for a special permit to be able to call ‘ anti-aging beer ’ a beer , " fritsche told the paper .
if his application is rejected , he is threatening to take his case to court – even as far as germany ’ s highest court if he has to .
fritsche has a colorful history of challenging germany ’ s beer purity laws .
he is currently battling in an administrative court in frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- over whether or not he should be given the right to apply the beer label to a dark beer his klosterbrauerei brews with sugar – a taboo ingredient under the ancient purity law .
fritsche , whose brewery also offers a cherry-flavored beer , has argued that his concoction should be exempted as a regional specialty .
but what about fritsche ’ s anti-aging elixir ?
the malty tasting drink contains none of the chemicals the purity law seeks to keep out of the bottle .
and , he believes , good health and naturalness should be given deference over a regulation written back in the middle ages . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's favorite beverage : beer from flensburg in the north to munich in the south , beer is germany ’ s favorite drink .

but getting rid of mandatory military service would also mean that the alternative , community service , would suffer as a result .
hospitals , senior citizen homes and youth centers would be understaffed , and many projects which rely on the 90,000 civil draftees for inexpensive labor would shut down .

she also floated the idea of introducing a voluntary service for both men and women , which would last between three months and two years .

klosterbrauerei neuzelle in the small town of neuzelle on the german-polish border will this week unveil a new " anti-aging beer " that combines tasty malt with some wellness world favorites , including the wonder algae spirulina .
the brewery ’ s ceo , helmut fritsche , plans to introduce the new brew at this week ’ s green week food industry fair in berlin and hopes to place it on store shelves by march .
" when people drink beer , why shouldn ’ t they be able to drink a healthy beer , " fritsche recently told the märkische oderzeitung newspaper .

the brew ’ s main ingredients are thermal brine water from the nearby health resort bad saarow , as well as spirulina , an algae , and flavonoide , a plant extract commonly used in anti-wrinkle creams .

spirulina , with more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bottle keeps cancer away ? than 100 nutrients including beta carotene , chlorophyll , vitamin b12 , has been described as one of the healthiest foods .

military bases will be closed and troops will be cut back in an effort to save € 26 billion .
but the future of the country 's compulsory military conscription remains uncertain . german defense minister peter struck said tuesday that he will shut about 100 military bases and cut troop numbers in an effort to slash € 26 billion in military spending plans and make the armed forces more professional .
" tasks such as conflict prevention and crisis management , " struck said , " require fundamentally different armed forces .
they must be rapidly available and robust enough to carry out international missions together with our partners . “ struck made the announcement at a press conference , at which he also said that forces would be cut by about 35,000 troops in the coming years .
an additional 10,000 civilian posts are also on the cutting board .
the cuts would bring the number of troops down from today 's 285,000 to about 250,000 .
the army would then be divided into so-called intervention , stabilization and support troops .
in the future , 35,000 troops would be prepared for international missions , 70,000 for peace missions like those currently being undertaken in the balkans and afghanistan .
an additional 137,500 troops would be designated for support and 10,000 others could be flexibly deployed where needed by the bundeswehr 's general inspecter .
the union representing germany 's bundeswehr soldiers offered mixed reviews for the plan on tuesday .
" although we are not very enthusiastic about the spending cuts , " bernard gertz was quoted by deutsche welle , " we support the reforms in these times of increasingly stringent budget constraints .
it is quite acceptable to concentrate on the bundeswehr 's future tasks and abolish structures and equipment which are now obsolete . “ eurofighter contracts wo n't be canceled despite the cutbacks , struck said germany would not cancel its order for 180 eurofighter aircraft to be built by defense contractors including eads , britain ’ s bae systems and italy ’ s alenia .
the future of the draft , however , remains in question .
struck said he remains committed to the draft .
but that could change , depending on the outcome of the 2006 elections .
“ the draft will run out , so will the community service , ” said angelika beer , the co-head of the green party , in an interview with ard public television .
around 90,000 young germans are registered yearly for community service as an alternative to mandatory military service .
beer , whose party is part of the federal coaltion government with the social democrats , said she would like the draft to be phased out over the next three or four years .
hospitals depend on young workforce about 80 percent of those choosing community service end up working in hospitals or senior citizens ’ homes , doing essential work such as driving ambulances , caring for the disabled and elderly and delivering meals .
charitable organizations fear there would be severe consequences for the german healthcare system if this workforce were to disappear .
“ we ’ ll have to consider if the services these young people are doing can be totally abolished , ” joachim kendelbacher , from the workers ’ welfare organization , told deutsche welle . “ if these services are cut this definitely means a loss in quality . ”
all armed forces to be trimmed struck said all divisions of the armed forces - including naval , air and ground troops - will have to shoulder their share of the cuts .
his plan drew immediate criticism from conservative opposition leaders .
christian democrat defense issues spokesman christian schmidt said in interviews with german television that the basis for deciding on the military structure can not be “ how much we have in the bank . ”
rather , he said , it should be “ what we want to secure . ” dw staff with reporting by uwe hessler -lrb- so -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundeswehr cuts could hurt german defense industry defense minister peter struck 's announcement that some € 26 billion will be cut from the bundeswehr 's spending plans will hit the german arms industry hard .

but getting rid of mandatory military service would also mean that the alternative , community service , would suffer as a result .
hospitals , senior citizen homes and youth centers would be understaffed , and many projects which rely on the 90,000 civil draftees for inexpensive labor would shut down .
already a reduction of the length of community service from 10 to nine months , as suggested by the government , would place a strain on the social system .
in a report released on thursday , family affairs minister renate schmidt referred to the potential crisis facing the country and called for allowing draftees to extend their civil service on a voluntary basis .
she also floated the idea of introducing a voluntary service for both men and women , which would last between three months and two years .
such a service - a first for germany - would include projects in the traditional social areas as well as in child care , environmental protection and immigration .
a mandatory service year as a replacement for conscription was , however , rejected , as the german constitution strictly prohibits this . dw-world.de germany set to abolish the draft young german men could soon be free of compulsory military service .

continuing its crackdown on nicotine addiction , the european union may seek a europe-wide ban on smoking in bars and restaurants . a top european official said the eu commission is considering a ban on smoking in bars and restaurants . “ it ’ s a question of whether or not we want to institute smoke free workplaces and that would include jobs in bars and restaurants , ” david byrne , the eu commissioner for health and consumer protection , told germany ’ s die welt newspaper on thursday . the brussels-based commission is currently considering whether to mandate the smoking ban europe-wide , or give each state the freedom to decide whether , and to what extent , to ban smoking in public . photos of disease bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large written warnings on cigarette packs have been mandatory üin the eu since last october .
currently in its effort to reduce smoking in the eu , the commission is compiling a databank with photographs of smoking-related illnesses aimed at frightening potential smokers away from tobacco .
eu countries could then mandate the use of these photos in addition to the written warning labels that have been required on european cigarette packages since the end of january . the member states would then decide if they want to use the photos , ” byrne told the newspaper .
the eu has accused germany of taking too soft a stance on smoking in public .
commissioner byrne has criticized the government for taking an " easygoing " stance to smoking , considering that an estimated 100,000 germans die of smoking-related diseases every year .
moreover , the eu commission , which launched an anti-smoking campaign last year called " feel free to say no , " has accused berlin of trying to block a comprehensive world-wide anti-smoking initiative by the world health organization , which is already supported by over 190 countries .
in the past years , germany has also come out strongly against an eu initiative to ban cigarette advertising across europe .
germans keep on smoking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : next to spain and greece , germany has the highest rate of smokers in europe .
statistics collected by the federal health ministry also show that while smoking is on the decline in the rest of europe , germany ’ s number of smokers has remained relatively constant .
even more alarming , the starting age for first-time smokers is dropping .
as of 2003 , every third ninth grader smoked .
across the rest of europe , however , enjoying a cigarette is becoming increasingly difficult as governments consider implementing anti-smoking legislation .
in the netherlands , a strict series of smoking laws went into effect on jan .
1 , 2004 , making it virtually impossible for workers to take cigarette breaks .
under the law , smoking is banned in areas such as stairs , hallways , conference rooms , cafeterias and toilets .
sweden has already passed a tough anti-smoking law that will go into effect in 2005 , and ireland is also on the verge of passing a ban similar to the one in the netherlands .
great britain is deliberating a crackdown on smoking in public spaces , but after a heated round of debate from the country ’ s pub owners , the government has decided to postpone any decision until later in 2004 . dw staff -lrb- ja -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a law to help kick the habit in the netherlands , smokers will get some added encouragement to kick the habit with strict new anti-smoking laws .

it 's long been a forbidden word for health-conscious drinkers , playing a very distant second to wine .
but a brewery in the eastern german state of brandenburg is hoping to change that with a new beer that claims to provide a fountain of youth for its drinkers . and that could bring a sigh of relief for suds lovers with a mind for their body .
klosterbrauerei neuzelle in the small town of neuzelle on the german-polish border will this week unveil a new " anti-aging beer " that combines tasty malt with some wellness world favorites , including the wonder algae spirulina .
the brewery ’ s ceo , helmut fritsche , plans to introduce the new brew at this week ’ s green week food industry fair in berlin and hopes to place it on store shelves by march .
" when people drink beer , why shouldn ’ t they be able to drink a healthy beer , " fritsche recently told the märkische oderzeitung newspaper .
a bottle a day keeps cancer away ?
the brew ’ s main ingredients are thermal brine water from the nearby health resort bad saarow , as well as spirulina , an algae , and flavonoide , a plant extract commonly used in anti-wrinkle creams .
flavonoides are also known to protect against arteriosclerosis , high blood pressure and cancer .
spirulina , with more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bottle keeps cancer away ? than 100 nutrients including beta carotene , chlorophyll , vitamin b12 , has been described as one of the healthiest foods .
meanwhile , brine water aids in digestion and maintaining metabolism and healthy blood pressure as well as helping the body rid itself of heavy metals and toxins like quicksilver , lead , arsenic , amalgam or even chalk build-up .
but it is still beer , and too much of it could undo the fountain of youth effect and , worse , bring on a nasty hangover .
fritsche warns that moderation is essential when drinking his " anti-aging " beer .
after all , each bottle does contain 4.8 percent alcohol .
trouble in wellness land the drink 's alcohol level is n't the only problem fritsche faces in convincing potential beer buyers .
because the sudsy mix doesn ’ t jibe with the german purity law of 1516 , the company won ’ t be able to sell it as beer in this country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hops , malt , yeast and water are the only beer ingredients allowed under germany 's purity law .
the purity law , first created to protect the reputation and quality of the german beer market , is one of the world ’ s oldest food regulations .
the law holds that beverages labeled " beer " may only contain hops , malt , yeast and water .
" i ’ ve applied for a special permit to be able to call ‘ anti-aging beer ’ a beer , " fritsche told the paper .
if his application is rejected , he is threatening to take his case to court – even as far as germany ’ s highest court if he has to .
fritsche has a colorful history of challenging germany ’ s beer purity laws .
he is currently battling in an administrative court in frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- over whether or not he should be given the right to apply the beer label to a dark beer his klosterbrauerei brews with sugar – a taboo ingredient under the ancient purity law .
fritsche , whose brewery also offers a cherry-flavored beer , has argued that his concoction should be exempted as a regional specialty .
but what about fritsche ’ s anti-aging elixir ?
the malty tasting drink contains none of the chemicals the purity law seeks to keep out of the bottle .

continuing its crackdown on nicotine addiction , the european union may seek a europe-wide ban on smoking in bars and restaurants . a top european official said the eu commission is considering a ban on smoking in bars and restaurants . “ it ’ s a question of whether or not we want to institute smoke free workplaces and that would include jobs in bars and restaurants , ” david byrne , the eu commissioner for health and consumer protection , told germany ’ s die welt newspaper on thursday . the brussels-based commission is currently considering whether to mandate the smoking ban europe-wide , or give each state the freedom to decide whether , and to what extent , to ban smoking in public . photos of disease bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large written warnings on cigarette packs have been mandatory üin the eu since last october .
currently in its effort to reduce smoking in the eu , the commission is compiling a databank with photographs of smoking-related illnesses aimed at frightening potential smokers away from tobacco .
eu countries could then mandate the use of these photos in addition to the written warning labels that have been required on european cigarette packages since the end of january . the member states would then decide if they want to use the photos , ” byrne told the newspaper .
the eu has accused germany of taking too soft a stance on smoking in public .
commissioner byrne has criticized the government for taking an " easygoing " stance to smoking , considering that an estimated 100,000 germans die of smoking-related diseases every year .
moreover , the eu commission , which launched an anti-smoking campaign last year called " feel free to say no , " has accused berlin of trying to block a comprehensive world-wide anti-smoking initiative by the world health organization , which is already supported by over 190 countries .

continuing its crackdown on nicotine addiction , the european union may seek a europe-wide ban on smoking in bars and restaurants . a top european official said the eu commission is considering a ban on smoking in bars and restaurants . “ it ’ s a question of whether or not we want to institute smoke free workplaces and that would include jobs in bars and restaurants , ” david byrne , the eu commissioner for health and consumer protection , told germany ’ s die welt newspaper on thursday . the brussels-based commission is currently considering whether to mandate the smoking ban europe-wide , or give each state the freedom to decide whether , and to what extent , to ban smoking in public . photos of disease bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large written warnings on cigarette packs have been mandatory üin the eu since last october .
currently in its effort to reduce smoking in the eu , the commission is compiling a databank with photographs of smoking-related illnesses aimed at frightening potential smokers away from tobacco .
eu countries could then mandate the use of these photos in addition to the written warning labels that have been required on european cigarette packages since the end of january . the member states would then decide if they want to use the photos , ” byrne told the newspaper .
the eu has accused germany of taking too soft a stance on smoking in public .
commissioner byrne has criticized the government for taking an " easygoing " stance to smoking , considering that an estimated 100,000 germans die of smoking-related diseases every year .
moreover , the eu commission , which launched an anti-smoking campaign last year called " feel free to say no , " has accused berlin of trying to block a comprehensive world-wide anti-smoking initiative by the world health organization , which is already supported by over 190 countries .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.01.2004 germany announces military cuts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister peter struck wants to make the armed forces more professional .
military bases will be closed and troops will be cut back in an effort to save € 26 billion .
but the future of the country 's compulsory military conscription remains uncertain . german defense minister peter struck said tuesday that he will shut about 100 military bases and cut troop numbers in an effort to slash € 26 billion in military spending plans and make the armed forces more professional .
" tasks such as conflict prevention and crisis management , " struck said , " require fundamentally different armed forces .
they must be rapidly available and robust enough to carry out international missions together with our partners . “ struck made the announcement at a press conference , at which he also said that forces would be cut by about 35,000 troops in the coming years .
an additional 10,000 civilian posts are also on the cutting board .
the cuts would bring the number of troops down from today 's 285,000 to about 250,000 .
the army would then be divided into so-called intervention , stabilization and support troops .
in the future , 35,000 troops would be prepared for international missions , 70,000 for peace missions like those currently being undertaken in the balkans and afghanistan .
an additional 137,500 troops would be designated for support and 10,000 others could be flexibly deployed where needed by the bundeswehr 's general inspecter .
the union representing germany 's bundeswehr soldiers offered mixed reviews for the plan on tuesday .
" although we are not very enthusiastic about the spending cuts , " bernard gertz was quoted by deutsche welle , " we support the reforms in these times of increasingly stringent budget constraints .
it is quite acceptable to concentrate on the bundeswehr 's future tasks and abolish structures and equipment which are now obsolete . “ eurofighter contracts wo n't be canceled despite the cutbacks , struck said germany would not cancel its order for 180 eurofighter aircraft to be built by defense contractors including eads , britain ’ s bae systems and italy ’ s alenia .
the future of the draft , however , remains in question .
struck said he remains committed to the draft .
but that could change , depending on the outcome of the 2006 elections .
“ the draft will run out , so will the community service , ” said angelika beer , the co-head of the green party , in an interview with ard public television .
around 90,000 young germans are registered yearly for community service as an alternative to mandatory military service .
beer , whose party is part of the federal coaltion government with the social democrats , said she would like the draft to be phased out over the next three or four years .
hospitals depend on young workforce about 80 percent of those choosing community service end up working in hospitals or senior citizens ’ homes , doing essential work such as driving ambulances , caring for the disabled and elderly and delivering meals .
charitable organizations fear there would be severe consequences for the german healthcare system if this workforce were to disappear .
“ we ’ ll have to consider if the services these young people are doing can be totally abolished , ” joachim kendelbacher , from the workers ’ welfare organization , told deutsche welle . “ if these services are cut this definitely means a loss in quality . ”
all armed forces to be trimmed struck said all divisions of the armed forces - including naval , air and ground troops - will have to shoulder their share of the cuts .
his plan drew immediate criticism from conservative opposition leaders .
christian democrat defense issues spokesman christian schmidt said in interviews with german television that the basis for deciding on the military structure can not be “ how much we have in the bank . ”
rather , he said , it should be “ what we want to secure . ” dw staff with reporting by uwe hessler -lrb- so -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundeswehr cuts could hurt german defense industry defense minister peter struck 's announcement that some € 26 billion will be cut from the bundeswehr 's spending plans will hit the german arms industry hard .

military bases will be closed and troops will be cut back in an effort to save € 26 billion .
but the future of the country 's compulsory military conscription remains uncertain . german defense minister peter struck said tuesday that he will shut about 100 military bases and cut troop numbers in an effort to slash € 26 billion in military spending plans and make the armed forces more professional .
" tasks such as conflict prevention and crisis management , " struck said , " require fundamentally different armed forces .
they must be rapidly available and robust enough to carry out international missions together with our partners . “ struck made the announcement at a press conference , at which he also said that forces would be cut by about 35,000 troops in the coming years .
an additional 10,000 civilian posts are also on the cutting board .
the cuts would bring the number of troops down from today 's 285,000 to about 250,000 .
the army would then be divided into so-called intervention , stabilization and support troops .
in the future , 35,000 troops would be prepared for international missions , 70,000 for peace missions like those currently being undertaken in the balkans and afghanistan .
an additional 137,500 troops would be designated for support and 10,000 others could be flexibly deployed where needed by the bundeswehr 's general inspecter .
the union representing germany 's bundeswehr soldiers offered mixed reviews for the plan on tuesday .
" although we are not very enthusiastic about the spending cuts , " bernard gertz was quoted by deutsche welle , " we support the reforms in these times of increasingly stringent budget constraints .
it is quite acceptable to concentrate on the bundeswehr 's future tasks and abolish structures and equipment which are now obsolete . “ eurofighter contracts wo n't be canceled despite the cutbacks , struck said germany would not cancel its order for 180 eurofighter aircraft to be built by defense contractors including eads , britain ’ s bae systems and italy ’ s alenia .
the future of the draft , however , remains in question .
struck said he remains committed to the draft .
but that could change , depending on the outcome of the 2006 elections .
“ the draft will run out , so will the community service , ” said angelika beer , the co-head of the green party , in an interview with ard public television .
around 90,000 young germans are registered yearly for community service as an alternative to mandatory military service .
beer , whose party is part of the federal coaltion government with the social democrats , said she would like the draft to be phased out over the next three or four years .
hospitals depend on young workforce about 80 percent of those choosing community service end up working in hospitals or senior citizens ’ homes , doing essential work such as driving ambulances , caring for the disabled and elderly and delivering meals .
charitable organizations fear there would be severe consequences for the german healthcare system if this workforce were to disappear .

germans are no longer aware of the fact that they once financed the autobahns , it said .
now the government , relying on taxpayers ’ contributions , will decide on the highways ’ further use with the greatest of ease , according to the daily .
neues deutschland in berlin asked : have you heard anything about “ super minister ” wolfgang clement lately ?
he is supposed to boost the economy and ensure more jobs are created , the paper noted .
but instead he has given some thought to transport and to whether the state-run autobahns should be privatized .
not unexpectedly , the daily continued , the motorists ’ lobby protested and clement immediately sought to appease , saying he had merely wanted to set people thinking .
he ‘ s achieved nothing , it said , but at least everyone ’ s talking about him again . the stuttgarter zeitung pointed out that transport minister manfred stolpe – suspecting what reactions clement ’ s proposal would trigger – immediately sought to play it down , saying there would not be a motorway toll for cars .
the paper cynically remarked that the transport minister ’ s word is absolutely credible – after all he ’ s been consoling the public for months because germany still hasn ’ t managed to introduce the scheduled autobahn toll for trucks . other german papers continue to comment on the ruling by italy ’ s constitutional court that the immunity law blocking prime minister silvio berlusconi ’ s bribery trial is unconstitutional .
the mannheimer morgen wrote that even a berlusconi is not above the law .
will he have to go to prison for corruption ?
for the time being , it continued , the judges have only taught the “ cavaliere ” a lesson , but it is doubtful whether the government chief will draw the right conclusions .
for berlusconi is immune to criticism , the daily said , and moves on the political stage as if he were suffering from paranoia .

military bases will be closed and troops will be cut back in an effort to save € 26 billion .
but the future of the country 's compulsory military conscription remains uncertain . german defense minister peter struck said tuesday that he will shut about 100 military bases and cut troop numbers in an effort to slash € 26 billion in military spending plans and make the armed forces more professional .
" tasks such as conflict prevention and crisis management , " struck said , " require fundamentally different armed forces .
they must be rapidly available and robust enough to carry out international missions together with our partners . “ struck made the announcement at a press conference , at which he also said that forces would be cut by about 35,000 troops in the coming years .
an additional 10,000 civilian posts are also on the cutting board .
the cuts would bring the number of troops down from today 's 285,000 to about 250,000 .
the army would then be divided into so-called intervention , stabilization and support troops .
in the future , 35,000 troops would be prepared for international missions , 70,000 for peace missions like those currently being undertaken in the balkans and afghanistan .
an additional 137,500 troops would be designated for support and 10,000 others could be flexibly deployed where needed by the bundeswehr 's general inspecter .
the union representing germany 's bundeswehr soldiers offered mixed reviews for the plan on tuesday .
" although we are not very enthusiastic about the spending cuts , " bernard gertz was quoted by deutsche welle , " we support the reforms in these times of increasingly stringent budget constraints .
it is quite acceptable to concentrate on the bundeswehr 's future tasks and abolish structures and equipment which are now obsolete . “ eurofighter contracts wo n't be canceled despite the cutbacks , struck said germany would not cancel its order for 180 eurofighter aircraft to be built by defense contractors including eads , britain ’ s bae systems and italy ’ s alenia .
the future of the draft , however , remains in question .
struck said he remains committed to the draft .

military bases will be closed and troops will be cut back in an effort to save € 26 billion .
but the future of the country 's compulsory military conscription remains uncertain . german defense minister peter struck said tuesday that he will shut about 100 military bases and cut troop numbers in an effort to slash € 26 billion in military spending plans and make the armed forces more professional .
" tasks such as conflict prevention and crisis management , " struck said , " require fundamentally different armed forces .
they must be rapidly available and robust enough to carry out international missions together with our partners . “ struck made the announcement at a press conference , at which he also said that forces would be cut by about 35,000 troops in the coming years .
an additional 10,000 civilian posts are also on the cutting board .
the cuts would bring the number of troops down from today 's 285,000 to about 250,000 .
the army would then be divided into so-called intervention , stabilization and support troops .
in the future , 35,000 troops would be prepared for international missions , 70,000 for peace missions like those currently being undertaken in the balkans and afghanistan .
an additional 137,500 troops would be designated for support and 10,000 others could be flexibly deployed where needed by the bundeswehr 's general inspecter .
the union representing germany 's bundeswehr soldiers offered mixed reviews for the plan on tuesday .
" although we are not very enthusiastic about the spending cuts , " bernard gertz was quoted by deutsche welle , " we support the reforms in these times of increasingly stringent budget constraints .
it is quite acceptable to concentrate on the bundeswehr 's future tasks and abolish structures and equipment which are now obsolete . “ eurofighter contracts wo n't be canceled despite the cutbacks , struck said germany would not cancel its order for 180 eurofighter aircraft to be built by defense contractors including eads , britain ’ s bae systems and italy ’ s alenia .
the future of the draft , however , remains in question .
struck said he remains committed to the draft .
but that could change , depending on the outcome of the 2006 elections .
“ the draft will run out , so will the community service , ” said angelika beer , the co-head of the green party , in an interview with ard public television .
around 90,000 young germans are registered yearly for community service as an alternative to mandatory military service .
beer , whose party is part of the federal coaltion government with the social democrats , said she would like the draft to be phased out over the next three or four years .
hospitals depend on young workforce about 80 percent of those choosing community service end up working in hospitals or senior citizens ’ homes , doing essential work such as driving ambulances , caring for the disabled and elderly and delivering meals .
charitable organizations fear there would be severe consequences for the german healthcare system if this workforce were to disappear .
“ we ’ ll have to consider if the services these young people are doing can be totally abolished , ” joachim kendelbacher , from the workers ’ welfare organization , told deutsche welle . “ if these services are cut this definitely means a loss in quality . ”

continuing its crackdown on nicotine addiction , the european union may seek a europe-wide ban on smoking in bars and restaurants . a top european official said the eu commission is considering a ban on smoking in bars and restaurants . “ it ’ s a question of whether or not we want to institute smoke free workplaces and that would include jobs in bars and restaurants , ” david byrne , the eu commissioner for health and consumer protection , told germany ’ s die welt newspaper on thursday . the brussels-based commission is currently considering whether to mandate the smoking ban europe-wide , or give each state the freedom to decide whether , and to what extent , to ban smoking in public . photos of disease bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large written warnings on cigarette packs have been mandatory üin the eu since last october .
currently in its effort to reduce smoking in the eu , the commission is compiling a databank with photographs of smoking-related illnesses aimed at frightening potential smokers away from tobacco .
eu countries could then mandate the use of these photos in addition to the written warning labels that have been required on european cigarette packages since the end of january . the member states would then decide if they want to use the photos , ” byrne told the newspaper .
the eu has accused germany of taking too soft a stance on smoking in public .
commissioner byrne has criticized the government for taking an " easygoing " stance to smoking , considering that an estimated 100,000 germans die of smoking-related diseases every year .
moreover , the eu commission , which launched an anti-smoking campaign last year called " feel free to say no , " has accused berlin of trying to block a comprehensive world-wide anti-smoking initiative by the world health organization , which is already supported by over 190 countries .
in the past years , germany has also come out strongly against an eu initiative to ban cigarette advertising across europe .
germans keep on smoking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : next to spain and greece , germany has the highest rate of smokers in europe .
statistics collected by the federal health ministry also show that while smoking is on the decline in the rest of europe , germany ’ s number of smokers has remained relatively constant .
even more alarming , the starting age for first-time smokers is dropping .
as of 2003 , every third ninth grader smoked .
across the rest of europe , however , enjoying a cigarette is becoming increasingly difficult as governments consider implementing anti-smoking legislation .
in the netherlands , a strict series of smoking laws went into effect on jan .
1 , 2004 , making it virtually impossible for workers to take cigarette breaks .
under the law , smoking is banned in areas such as stairs , hallways , conference rooms , cafeterias and toilets .
sweden has already passed a tough anti-smoking law that will go into effect in 2005 , and ireland is also on the verge of passing a ban similar to the one in the netherlands .
great britain is deliberating a crackdown on smoking in public spaces , but after a heated round of debate from the country ’ s pub owners , the government has decided to postpone any decision until later in 2004 . dw staff -lrb- ja -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a law to help kick the habit in the netherlands , smokers will get some added encouragement to kick the habit with strict new anti-smoking laws .

continuing its crackdown on nicotine addiction , the european union may seek a europe-wide ban on smoking in bars and restaurants . a top european official said the eu commission is considering a ban on smoking in bars and restaurants . “ it ’ s a question of whether or not we want to institute smoke free workplaces and that would include jobs in bars and restaurants , ” david byrne , the eu commissioner for health and consumer protection , told germany ’ s die welt newspaper on thursday . the brussels-based commission is currently considering whether to mandate the smoking ban europe-wide , or give each state the freedom to decide whether , and to what extent , to ban smoking in public . photos of disease bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large written warnings on cigarette packs have been mandatory üin the eu since last october .
currently in its effort to reduce smoking in the eu , the commission is compiling a databank with photographs of smoking-related illnesses aimed at frightening potential smokers away from tobacco .
eu countries could then mandate the use of these photos in addition to the written warning labels that have been required on european cigarette packages since the end of january . the member states would then decide if they want to use the photos , ” byrne told the newspaper .
the eu has accused germany of taking too soft a stance on smoking in public .
commissioner byrne has criticized the government for taking an " easygoing " stance to smoking , considering that an estimated 100,000 germans die of smoking-related diseases every year .

under the law , smoking is banned in areas such as stairs , hallways , conference rooms , cafeterias and toilets .
sweden has already passed a tough anti-smoking law that will go into effect in 2005 , and ireland is also on the verge of passing a ban similar to the one in the netherlands .

continuing its crackdown on nicotine addiction , the european union may seek a europe-wide ban on smoking in bars and restaurants . a top european official said the eu commission is considering a ban on smoking in bars and restaurants . “ it ’ s a question of whether or not we want to institute smoke free workplaces and that would include jobs in bars and restaurants , ” david byrne , the eu commissioner for health and consumer protection , told germany ’ s die welt newspaper on thursday . the brussels-based commission is currently considering whether to mandate the smoking ban europe-wide , or give each state the freedom to decide whether , and to what extent , to ban smoking in public . photos of disease bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large written warnings on cigarette packs have been mandatory üin the eu since last october .
currently in its effort to reduce smoking in the eu , the commission is compiling a databank with photographs of smoking-related illnesses aimed at frightening potential smokers away from tobacco .
eu countries could then mandate the use of these photos in addition to the written warning labels that have been required on european cigarette packages since the end of january . the member states would then decide if they want to use the photos , ” byrne told the newspaper .
the eu has accused germany of taking too soft a stance on smoking in public .
commissioner byrne has criticized the government for taking an " easygoing " stance to smoking , considering that an estimated 100,000 germans die of smoking-related diseases every year .
moreover , the eu commission , which launched an anti-smoking campaign last year called " feel free to say no , " has accused berlin of trying to block a comprehensive world-wide anti-smoking initiative by the world health organization , which is already supported by over 190 countries .

across the rest of europe , however , enjoying a cigarette is becoming increasingly difficult as governments consider implementing anti-smoking legislation .
in the netherlands , a strict series of smoking laws went into effect on jan .

under the law , smoking is banned in areas such as stairs , hallways , conference rooms , cafeterias and toilets .

to the opposition conservatives in germany ’ s lower chamber of parliament , the bundestag , graffiti is nothing less than a crime that needs a tough punishment .
every year sprayers destroy some 200 to 250 million euros worth of property .
it is estimated that in berlin alone 3,000 to 4,000 sprayers are active , many of whom are also involved in organized crime and drugs .
a joint proposal put forth on thursday by the christian democrat union , the christian social union and the free democrats calls for imposing tougher penalties than the fines and three years imprisonment currently on the books .
but the social democrats and greens argue that changing the law is simply " symbolic politics " and does nothing to change reality , which is that nationwide only about 30 percent of sprayers are actually apprehended .
" it is not the punishment that deters sprayers , but rather the risk of being caught , " said spd politician michael hartmann , who wants to see more effort put into catching the violators . more briefs 15.01.2004 -pipe- germany considers introducing volunteer service 14.01.2004 -pipe- amnesty accuses german police of excessive force 14.01.2004 -pipe- transport minister opposes highway privatization 14.01.2004 -pipe- german and polish foreign ministers meet to mend fences 14.01.2004 -pipe- luftwaffe to retire 500 war planes 13.01.2004 -pipe- world cup 2006 to open in munich 13.01.2004 -pipe- minister rethinks moving federal police 13.01.2004 -pipe- civil servants to work longer radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

"
he also hinted that , whilst france and germany could provide leadership for a union of 15 , they would need more power to lead an enlarged eu , which the uk could provide .
london 's move to form a more concrete ' big three ' at the heart of the eu may concern smaller eu states and some future member states because of worries that the union will become a ' directorate ' led by the uk , france and germany .
many in france and germany may also question whether the uk is ready for such a leadership role given , amongst other things , its reluctance to join the euro .
but straw 's statement comes after several signs that the three powerful eu states are working more closely together .
london backed paris and berlin over the euro rules row and broadly followed the franco-german line during the failed negotiations on the new eu constitution .
in another sign of growing co-operation , chirac , schröder and blair - the leaders of france , germany and britain respectively - will meet next month to discuss ways of thrashing out the constitution and other eu matters .

the economics minister 's comments on privatizing the autobahn has drawn a raft of criticism from politicians and experts with most unanimous that germans wo n't want to pay money to speed on their beloved freeway system . no one knows better than the economics minister how much money needs to be saved in order to right germany 's sinking economy . but wolfgang clement 's comments to an interviewer that a privatization of germany 's autobahn , already the case in france and italy , might help put the country back in the black has sparked criticism . " the autobahn in germany is already paid by taxpayers , " says maximillian maurer , of germany 's car drivers ' association adac .
" the government ca n't privatize what already belongs to the taxpayers . " no toll roads above all , driver 's associations and the country 's transportation minister fear privatization of germany 's storied motorway might mean drivers have to begin paying tolls .
critics say that would lead to a re-direction of traffic to smaller streets and roads that pass through towns , causing traffic problems and chaos for residents .
others say setting up a toll system would be too complicated and would scare away companies . construction companies greeted clement 's comments , saying that the taxpayer-financed autobahn was a thing of the past . " we think of it as a worthy option , " heiko stiepelmann , of the association of the german construction industry told the business daily handelsblatt .
" given the budget and debt situation , germany can no longer afford a taxpayer-financed autobahn . " politicians , even in clement 's own social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , have called his comments rash and " shot from the hip . " " there have been no thoughts about a privatization of the autobahn or a toll , " transportation minister manfred stolpe spelled out for reporters in berlin . more than 1 billion spent each year so far , clement 's thoughts have n't gone beyond the drafting table , and he 's kept quiet since his comments in wednesday 's edition of the berliner zeitung . that means the federal government will continue to shovel out the approximately 1.2 billion euros needed annually to maintain the 12,000 kilometer -lrb- 7,400 mile -rrb- -long autobahn network .
any one who 's driven the highways in the former east - or even in heavily traveled sections of the west - knows that 's not enough .
new roads cost extra . france privatized its national freeway system in the 1950s , when it was only 80-km long .
today , the system is 10,000 kilometers bigger and the government has continued a toll system that was supposed to be phased out after some time . up to 90 percent of italy 's freeway system is in private hands , though promised improvement and extensions to the freeways have so far not taken place . dw staff -lrb- atz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press review : private autobahns ?

the economics minister 's comments on privatizing the autobahn has drawn a raft of criticism from politicians and experts with most unanimous that germans wo n't want to pay money to speed on their beloved freeway system . no one knows better than the economics minister how much money needs to be saved in order to right germany 's sinking economy . but wolfgang clement 's comments to an interviewer that a privatization of germany 's autobahn , already the case in france and italy , might help put the country back in the black has sparked criticism . " the autobahn in germany is already paid by taxpayers , " says maximillian maurer , of germany 's car drivers ' association adac .
" the government ca n't privatize what already belongs to the taxpayers . " no toll roads above all , driver 's associations and the country 's transportation minister fear privatization of germany 's storied motorway might mean drivers have to begin paying tolls .
critics say that would lead to a re-direction of traffic to smaller streets and roads that pass through towns , causing traffic problems and chaos for residents .

"
he also hinted that , whilst france and germany could provide leadership for a union of 15 , they would need more power to lead an enlarged eu , which the uk could provide .
london 's move to form a more concrete ' big three ' at the heart of the eu may concern smaller eu states and some future member states because of worries that the union will become a ' directorate ' led by the uk , france and germany .
many in france and germany may also question whether the uk is ready for such a leadership role given , amongst other things , its reluctance to join the euro .
but straw 's statement comes after several signs that the three powerful eu states are working more closely together .
london backed paris and berlin over the euro rules row and broadly followed the franco-german line during the failed negotiations on the new eu constitution .
in another sign of growing co-operation , chirac , schröder and blair - the leaders of france , germany and britain respectively - will meet next month to discuss ways of thrashing out the constitution and other eu matters .
-lrb- euobserver.com -rrb- dw-world.de berlin summit scores high for attempt at compromise despite remaining differences over the transfer of power and the role of the un in the reconstruction of iraq , the meeting between the leaders of germany , france and britain marked a step in the direction of compromise .

but he will also call for the continuation and implementation of these reforms .
turkey is hoping to get a date at the end of this year to start accession negotiations with the eu .
but it still needs to do more to implement its human rights reforms as well as laws guaranteeing freedom of expression , religious liberty and the independence of the judiciary .
its reform process in the next months will be crucial .
in october , the commission will issue a report reviewing turkey 's membership performance .
based on this , eu leaders will decide in december whether to start membership negotiations with ankara .
a decision on that issue will at that point have to be taken with 25 member states - cyprus being among them .
the divided mediterranean island poses a huge problem to turkey 's eu membership prospects .
although the commission publicly insists that having a reunited island is not a prerequisite for turkish eu membership , it would nevertheless be extremely difficult , politically , to have a militarily occupied territory within the european union .
however , the turkish daily news reports prodi as saying the chances were not strong for a settlement to be reached before the island joins the eu in may .

but he will also call for the continuation and implementation of these reforms .
turkey is hoping to get a date at the end of this year to start accession negotiations with the eu .
but it still needs to do more to implement its human rights reforms as well as laws guaranteeing freedom of expression , religious liberty and the independence of the judiciary .
its reform process in the next months will be crucial .
in october , the commission will issue a report reviewing turkey 's membership performance .
based on this , eu leaders will decide in december whether to start membership negotiations with ankara .
a decision on that issue will at that point have to be taken with 25 member states - cyprus being among them .
the divided mediterranean island poses a huge problem to turkey 's eu membership prospects .
although the commission publicly insists that having a reunited island is not a prerequisite for turkish eu membership , it would nevertheless be extremely difficult , politically , to have a militarily occupied territory within the european union .

the economics minister 's comments on privatizing the autobahn has drawn a raft of criticism from politicians and experts with most unanimous that germans wo n't want to pay money to speed on their beloved freeway system . no one knows better than the economics minister how much money needs to be saved in order to right germany 's sinking economy . but wolfgang clement 's comments to an interviewer that a privatization of germany 's autobahn , already the case in france and italy , might help put the country back in the black has sparked criticism . " the autobahn in germany is already paid by taxpayers , " says maximillian maurer , of germany 's car drivers ' association adac .
" the government ca n't privatize what already belongs to the taxpayers . " no toll roads above all , driver 's associations and the country 's transportation minister fear privatization of germany 's storied motorway might mean drivers have to begin paying tolls .
critics say that would lead to a re-direction of traffic to smaller streets and roads that pass through towns , causing traffic problems and chaos for residents .
others say setting up a toll system would be too complicated and would scare away companies . construction companies greeted clement 's comments , saying that the taxpayer-financed autobahn was a thing of the past . " we think of it as a worthy option , " heiko stiepelmann , of the association of the german construction industry told the business daily handelsblatt .
" given the budget and debt situation , germany can no longer afford a taxpayer-financed autobahn . " politicians , even in clement 's own social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , have called his comments rash and " shot from the hip . " " there have been no thoughts about a privatization of the autobahn or a toll , " transportation minister manfred stolpe spelled out for reporters in berlin . more than 1 billion spent each year so far , clement 's thoughts have n't gone beyond the drafting table , and he 's kept quiet since his comments in wednesday 's edition of the berliner zeitung . that means the federal government will continue to shovel out the approximately 1.2 billion euros needed annually to maintain the 12,000 kilometer -lrb- 7,400 mile -rrb- -long autobahn network .

" we think of it as a worthy option , " heiko stiepelmann , of the association of the german construction industry told the business daily handelsblatt .
" given the budget and debt situation , germany can no longer afford a taxpayer-financed autobahn . " politicians , even in clement 's own social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , have called his comments rash and " shot from the hip . " " there have been no thoughts about a privatization of the autobahn or a toll , " transportation minister manfred stolpe spelled out for reporters in berlin . more than 1 billion spent each year so far , clement 's thoughts have n't gone beyond the drafting table , and he 's kept quiet since his comments in wednesday 's edition of the berliner zeitung . that means the federal government will continue to shovel out the approximately 1.2 billion euros needed annually to maintain the 12,000 kilometer -lrb- 7,400 mile -rrb- -long autobahn network .
any one who 's driven the highways in the former east - or even in heavily traveled sections of the west - knows that 's not enough .
new roads cost extra . france privatized its national freeway system in the 1950s , when it was only 80-km long .
today , the system is 10,000 kilometers bigger and the government has continued a toll system that was supposed to be phased out after some time . up to 90 percent of italy 's freeway system is in private hands , though promised improvement and extensions to the freeways have so far not taken place . dw staff -lrb- atz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press review : private autobahns ?

it 's long been a forbidden word for health-conscious drinkers , playing a very distant second to wine .
but a brewery in the eastern german state of brandenburg is hoping to change that with a new beer that claims to provide a fountain of youth for its drinkers . and that could bring a sigh of relief for suds lovers with a mind for their body .
klosterbrauerei neuzelle in the small town of neuzelle on the german-polish border will this week unveil a new " anti-aging beer " that combines tasty malt with some wellness world favorites , including the wonder algae spirulina .
the brewery ’ s ceo , helmut fritsche , plans to introduce the new brew at this week ’ s green week food industry fair in berlin and hopes to place it on store shelves by march .
" when people drink beer , why shouldn ’ t they be able to drink a healthy beer , " fritsche recently told the märkische oderzeitung newspaper .
a bottle a day keeps cancer away ?
the brew ’ s main ingredients are thermal brine water from the nearby health resort bad saarow , as well as spirulina , an algae , and flavonoide , a plant extract commonly used in anti-wrinkle creams .
flavonoides are also known to protect against arteriosclerosis , high blood pressure and cancer .
spirulina , with more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bottle keeps cancer away ? than 100 nutrients including beta carotene , chlorophyll , vitamin b12 , has been described as one of the healthiest foods .
meanwhile , brine water aids in digestion and maintaining metabolism and healthy blood pressure as well as helping the body rid itself of heavy metals and toxins like quicksilver , lead , arsenic , amalgam or even chalk build-up .
but it is still beer , and too much of it could undo the fountain of youth effect and , worse , bring on a nasty hangover .
fritsche warns that moderation is essential when drinking his " anti-aging " beer .
after all , each bottle does contain 4.8 percent alcohol .
trouble in wellness land the drink 's alcohol level is n't the only problem fritsche faces in convincing potential beer buyers .
because the sudsy mix doesn ’ t jibe with the german purity law of 1516 , the company won ’ t be able to sell it as beer in this country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hops , malt , yeast and water are the only beer ingredients allowed under germany 's purity law .
the purity law , first created to protect the reputation and quality of the german beer market , is one of the world ’ s oldest food regulations .
the law holds that beverages labeled " beer " may only contain hops , malt , yeast and water .
" i ’ ve applied for a special permit to be able to call ‘ anti-aging beer ’ a beer , " fritsche told the paper .
if his application is rejected , he is threatening to take his case to court – even as far as germany ’ s highest court if he has to .
fritsche has a colorful history of challenging germany ’ s beer purity laws .
he is currently battling in an administrative court in frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- over whether or not he should be given the right to apply the beer label to a dark beer his klosterbrauerei brews with sugar – a taboo ingredient under the ancient purity law .
fritsche , whose brewery also offers a cherry-flavored beer , has argued that his concoction should be exempted as a regional specialty .
but what about fritsche ’ s anti-aging elixir ?
the malty tasting drink contains none of the chemicals the purity law seeks to keep out of the bottle .

spirulina , with more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bottle keeps cancer away ? than 100 nutrients including beta carotene , chlorophyll , vitamin b12 , has been described as one of the healthiest foods .
meanwhile , brine water aids in digestion and maintaining metabolism and healthy blood pressure as well as helping the body rid itself of heavy metals and toxins like quicksilver , lead , arsenic , amalgam or even chalk build-up .
but it is still beer , and too much of it could undo the fountain of youth effect and , worse , bring on a nasty hangover .
fritsche warns that moderation is essential when drinking his " anti-aging " beer .
after all , each bottle does contain 4.8 percent alcohol .
trouble in wellness land the drink 's alcohol level is n't the only problem fritsche faces in convincing potential beer buyers .
because the sudsy mix doesn ’ t jibe with the german purity law of 1516 , the company won ’ t be able to sell it as beer in this country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hops , malt , yeast and water are the only beer ingredients allowed under germany 's purity law .
the purity law , first created to protect the reputation and quality of the german beer market , is one of the world ’ s oldest food regulations .
the law holds that beverages labeled " beer " may only contain hops , malt , yeast and water .
" i ’ ve applied for a special permit to be able to call ‘ anti-aging beer ’ a beer , " fritsche told the paper .
if his application is rejected , he is threatening to take his case to court – even as far as germany ’ s highest court if he has to .
fritsche has a colorful history of challenging germany ’ s beer purity laws .
he is currently battling in an administrative court in frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- over whether or not he should be given the right to apply the beer label to a dark beer his klosterbrauerei brews with sugar – a taboo ingredient under the ancient purity law .
fritsche , whose brewery also offers a cherry-flavored beer , has argued that his concoction should be exempted as a regional specialty .
but what about fritsche ’ s anti-aging elixir ?
the malty tasting drink contains none of the chemicals the purity law seeks to keep out of the bottle .
and , he believes , good health and naturalness should be given deference over a regulation written back in the middle ages . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's favorite beverage : beer from flensburg in the north to munich in the south , beer is germany ’ s favorite drink .

the eu ’ s chief executive said turkey must continue implementing political and legal reforms if it hopes to be admitted into the european bloc , said romano prodi . as the first eu commission president to visit turkey in 40 years , prodi was set up for a historic showing even before he arrived .
but once the head of the eu 's executive wing began to speak about ankara ’ s chances for gaining admittance in the soon-to-be 25-member bloc , he sounded repetitive .
" my main message is to continue along the path of reforms because impressive progress has been achieved .
the country is now closer to the union , " prodi told a news conference after talks with prime minister recep tayyip erdogan .
in the past two years , turkey has carried out sweeping reforms as it tries to meet brussels standards for accession .
it abolished the death penalty and granted greater cultural rights to kurds , even though they are not recognized as an official minority .
ankara also claims it has cleaned up its poor human rights record , especially the notorious treatment of its political dissidents , although international human rights watchdogs frequently question the claim .
eyes set on brussels turkey has been eyeing entry in the eu for some time and has turned up its lobbying a notch since the union approved membership for 10 eastern european and mediterranean countries .
it now hopes eu leaders will agree to open the long-awaited membership talks when they meet to discuss expansion in december 2004 .
a definite agreement would have been a welcome gesture and have given prodi ’ s visit the historic dimension many turks hoped to see .
but the commission chief declined to set a specific date for commencing the talks .
turkey has been an eu candidate since 1999 , but it is the only country among 13 not to have begun accession talks with brussels .
ankara argues that it has fulfilled all the political criteria and has earned the right to open the membership talks by the end of the year .
in october , the commission must prepare a report for eu leaders on whether turkey meets the standards of democracy and market economy laid down for potential candidates .
at that time , prodi said the commission would at that time take a " look at the question of implementation of legislation on the ground . "
back in november the commission noted " significant progress " had been made , but cited several areas where more still needs to be done , including strengthening the independence of the judiciary and carrying out human rights reforms .

the greek , southern part of the divided island will join the union in may 2004 .
the northern part of cyprus , recognized as an independent republic only by turkey itself , has not been approved .
brussels says the turkish cypriots living in the north will be denied entry in the union if a settlement is not struck in time .
a solution to cyprus " is not a precondition , " prodi said , " but this will be a big help . "
up to now turkey has rejected any link between the cyprus question and its own eu membership , but foreign minister abdullah gul admitted in a newspaper interview on thursday that failure to resolve the dispute could prove costly .
" we are running late for a solution .
our hand is weakening .
we can not get rid of a problem by postponing it .

the eu ’ s chief executive said turkey must continue implementing political and legal reforms if it hopes to be admitted into the european bloc , said romano prodi . as the first eu commission president to visit turkey in 40 years , prodi was set up for a historic showing even before he arrived .
but once the head of the eu 's executive wing began to speak about ankara ’ s chances for gaining admittance in the soon-to-be 25-member bloc , he sounded repetitive .
" my main message is to continue along the path of reforms because impressive progress has been achieved .
the country is now closer to the union , " prodi told a news conference after talks with prime minister recep tayyip erdogan .
in the past two years , turkey has carried out sweeping reforms as it tries to meet brussels standards for accession .
it abolished the death penalty and granted greater cultural rights to kurds , even though they are not recognized as an official minority .
ankara also claims it has cleaned up its poor human rights record , especially the notorious treatment of its political dissidents , although international human rights watchdogs frequently question the claim .
eyes set on brussels turkey has been eyeing entry in the eu for some time and has turned up its lobbying a notch since the union approved membership for 10 eastern european and mediterranean countries .
it now hopes eu leaders will agree to open the long-awaited membership talks when they meet to discuss expansion in december 2004 .
a definite agreement would have been a welcome gesture and have given prodi ’ s visit the historic dimension many turks hoped to see .
but the commission chief declined to set a specific date for commencing the talks .
turkey has been an eu candidate since 1999 , but it is the only country among 13 not to have begun accession talks with brussels .
ankara argues that it has fulfilled all the political criteria and has earned the right to open the membership talks by the end of the year .
in october , the commission must prepare a report for eu leaders on whether turkey meets the standards of democracy and market economy laid down for potential candidates .
at that time , prodi said the commission would at that time take a " look at the question of implementation of legislation on the ground . "
back in november the commission noted " significant progress " had been made , but cited several areas where more still needs to be done , including strengthening the independence of the judiciary and carrying out human rights reforms .

the eu ’ s chief executive said turkey must continue implementing political and legal reforms if it hopes to be admitted into the european bloc , said romano prodi . as the first eu commission president to visit turkey in 40 years , prodi was set up for a historic showing even before he arrived .
but once the head of the eu 's executive wing began to speak about ankara ’ s chances for gaining admittance in the soon-to-be 25-member bloc , he sounded repetitive .
" my main message is to continue along the path of reforms because impressive progress has been achieved .
the country is now closer to the union , " prodi told a news conference after talks with prime minister recep tayyip erdogan .
in the past two years , turkey has carried out sweeping reforms as it tries to meet brussels standards for accession .
it abolished the death penalty and granted greater cultural rights to kurds , even though they are not recognized as an official minority .
ankara also claims it has cleaned up its poor human rights record , especially the notorious treatment of its political dissidents , although international human rights watchdogs frequently question the claim .
eyes set on brussels turkey has been eyeing entry in the eu for some time and has turned up its lobbying a notch since the union approved membership for 10 eastern european and mediterranean countries .
it now hopes eu leaders will agree to open the long-awaited membership talks when they meet to discuss expansion in december 2004 .
a definite agreement would have been a welcome gesture and have given prodi ’ s visit the historic dimension many turks hoped to see .
but the commission chief declined to set a specific date for commencing the talks .
turkey has been an eu candidate since 1999 , but it is the only country among 13 not to have begun accession talks with brussels .
ankara argues that it has fulfilled all the political criteria and has earned the right to open the membership talks by the end of the year .
in october , the commission must prepare a report for eu leaders on whether turkey meets the standards of democracy and market economy laid down for potential candidates .
at that time , prodi said the commission would at that time take a " look at the question of implementation of legislation on the ground . "
back in november the commission noted " significant progress " had been made , but cited several areas where more still needs to be done , including strengthening the independence of the judiciary and carrying out human rights reforms .

14 .
thousands of turkish cypriots , rallied in northern cyprus to call for the reunification of the divided island .
cyprus integral to eu membership although technically not a condition for starting membership talks , the commission has made it clear that finding a solution to cyprus is integral to aiding turkey ’ s bid for the eu .
the greek , southern part of the divided island will join the union in may 2004 .
the northern part of cyprus , recognized as an independent republic only by turkey itself , has not been approved .
brussels says the turkish cypriots living in the north will be denied entry in the union if a settlement is not struck in time .
a solution to cyprus " is not a precondition , " prodi said , " but this will be a big help . "
up to now turkey has rejected any link between the cyprus question and its own eu membership , but foreign minister abdullah gul admitted in a newspaper interview on thursday that failure to resolve the dispute could prove costly .
" we are running late for a solution .
our hand is weakening .
we can not get rid of a problem by postponing it .
this is where we are at in cyprus , " he said in comments published by the liberal radikal daily .

the economics minister 's comments on privatizing the autobahn has drawn a raft of criticism from politicians and experts with most unanimous that germans wo n't want to pay money to speed on their beloved freeway system . no one knows better than the economics minister how much money needs to be saved in order to right germany 's sinking economy . but wolfgang clement 's comments to an interviewer that a privatization of germany 's autobahn , already the case in france and italy , might help put the country back in the black has sparked criticism . " the autobahn in germany is already paid by taxpayers , " says maximillian maurer , of germany 's car drivers ' association adac .
" the government ca n't privatize what already belongs to the taxpayers . " no toll roads above all , driver 's associations and the country 's transportation minister fear privatization of germany 's storied motorway might mean drivers have to begin paying tolls .
critics say that would lead to a re-direction of traffic to smaller streets and roads that pass through towns , causing traffic problems and chaos for residents .
others say setting up a toll system would be too complicated and would scare away companies . construction companies greeted clement 's comments , saying that the taxpayer-financed autobahn was a thing of the past . " we think of it as a worthy option , " heiko stiepelmann , of the association of the german construction industry told the business daily handelsblatt .
" given the budget and debt situation , germany can no longer afford a taxpayer-financed autobahn . " politicians , even in clement 's own social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , have called his comments rash and " shot from the hip . " " there have been no thoughts about a privatization of the autobahn or a toll , " transportation minister manfred stolpe spelled out for reporters in berlin . more than 1 billion spent each year so far , clement 's thoughts have n't gone beyond the drafting table , and he 's kept quiet since his comments in wednesday 's edition of the berliner zeitung . that means the federal government will continue to shovel out the approximately 1.2 billion euros needed annually to maintain the 12,000 kilometer -lrb- 7,400 mile -rrb- -long autobahn network .
any one who 's driven the highways in the former east - or even in heavily traveled sections of the west - knows that 's not enough .
new roads cost extra . france privatized its national freeway system in the 1950s , when it was only 80-km long .
today , the system is 10,000 kilometers bigger and the government has continued a toll system that was supposed to be phased out after some time . up to 90 percent of italy 's freeway system is in private hands , though promised improvement and extensions to the freeways have so far not taken place . dw staff -lrb- atz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press review : private autobahns ?

germans are no longer aware of the fact that they once financed the autobahns , it said .

neues deutschland in berlin asked : have you heard anything about “ super minister ” wolfgang clement lately ?
he is supposed to boost the economy and ensure more jobs are created , the paper noted .

the paper cynically remarked that the transport minister ’ s word is absolutely credible – after all he ’ s been consoling the public for months because germany still hasn ’ t managed to introduce the scheduled autobahn toll for trucks . other german papers continue to comment on the ruling by italy ’ s constitutional court that the immunity law blocking prime minister silvio berlusconi ’ s bribery trial is unconstitutional .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.01.2004 german press review : private autobahns ? many of germany ’ s papers on thursday commented on the proposal by german economics minister wolfgang clement to privatize the country ’ s autobahns . the nürnberger zeitung wondered how the message will be received by car drivers : the german taxpayer is starting to look paralyzed in view of the demands that are raining down on him and will no doubt accept yet another piece of bad news , the paper wrote .
germans are no longer aware of the fact that they once financed the autobahns , it said .
now the government , relying on taxpayers ’ contributions , will decide on the highways ’ further use with the greatest of ease , according to the daily .
neues deutschland in berlin asked : have you heard anything about “ super minister ” wolfgang clement lately ?
he is supposed to boost the economy and ensure more jobs are created , the paper noted .
but instead he has given some thought to transport and to whether the state-run autobahns should be privatized .
not unexpectedly , the daily continued , the motorists ’ lobby protested and clement immediately sought to appease , saying he had merely wanted to set people thinking .
he ‘ s achieved nothing , it said , but at least everyone ’ s talking about him again . the stuttgarter zeitung pointed out that transport minister manfred stolpe – suspecting what reactions clement ’ s proposal would trigger – immediately sought to play it down , saying there would not be a motorway toll for cars .
the paper cynically remarked that the transport minister ’ s word is absolutely credible – after all he ’ s been consoling the public for months because germany still hasn ’ t managed to introduce the scheduled autobahn toll for trucks . other german papers continue to comment on the ruling by italy ’ s constitutional court that the immunity law blocking prime minister silvio berlusconi ’ s bribery trial is unconstitutional .

commissioner byrne has criticized the government for taking an " easygoing " stance to smoking , considering that an estimated 100,000 germans die of smoking-related diseases every year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.01.2004 -pipe- 13:00 utc germany considers introducing volunteer service earlier this week berlin ’ s red-green coalition government announced it would seriously consider abolishing the draft .
but getting rid of mandatory military service would also mean that the alternative , community service , would suffer as a result .
hospitals , senior citizen homes and youth centers would be understaffed , and many projects which rely on the 90,000 civil draftees for inexpensive labor would shut down .
already a reduction of the length of community service from 10 to nine months , as suggested by the government , would place a strain on the social system .
in a report released on thursday , family affairs minister renate schmidt referred to the potential crisis facing the country and called for allowing draftees to extend their civil service on a voluntary basis .
she also floated the idea of introducing a voluntary service for both men and women , which would last between three months and two years .
such a service - a first for germany - would include projects in the traditional social areas as well as in child care , environmental protection and immigration .
a mandatory service year as a replacement for conscription was , however , rejected , as the german constitution strictly prohibits this . dw-world.de germany set to abolish the draft young german men could soon be free of compulsory military service .

to the opposition conservatives in germany ’ s lower chamber of parliament , the bundestag , graffiti is nothing less than a crime that needs a tough punishment .
every year sprayers destroy some 200 to 250 million euros worth of property .
it is estimated that in berlin alone 3,000 to 4,000 sprayers are active , many of whom are also involved in organized crime and drugs .
a joint proposal put forth on thursday by the christian democrat union , the christian social union and the free democrats calls for imposing tougher penalties than the fines and three years imprisonment currently on the books .
but the social democrats and greens argue that changing the law is simply " symbolic politics " and does nothing to change reality , which is that nationwide only about 30 percent of sprayers are actually apprehended .
" it is not the punishment that deters sprayers , but rather the risk of being caught , " said spd politician michael hartmann , who wants to see more effort put into catching the violators . more briefs 15.01.2004 -pipe- germany considers introducing volunteer service 14.01.2004 -pipe- amnesty accuses german police of excessive force 14.01.2004 -pipe- transport minister opposes highway privatization 14.01.2004 -pipe- german and polish foreign ministers meet to mend fences 14.01.2004 -pipe- luftwaffe to retire 500 war planes 13.01.2004 -pipe- world cup 2006 to open in munich 13.01.2004 -pipe- minister rethinks moving federal police 13.01.2004 -pipe- civil servants to work longer 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the eu ’ s chief executive said turkey must continue implementing political and legal reforms if it hopes to be admitted into the european bloc , said romano prodi . as the first eu commission president to visit turkey in 40 years , prodi was set up for a historic showing even before he arrived .
but once the head of the eu 's executive wing began to speak about ankara ’ s chances for gaining admittance in the soon-to-be 25-member bloc , he sounded repetitive .
" my main message is to continue along the path of reforms because impressive progress has been achieved .
the country is now closer to the union , " prodi told a news conference after talks with prime minister recep tayyip erdogan .
in the past two years , turkey has carried out sweeping reforms as it tries to meet brussels standards for accession .
it abolished the death penalty and granted greater cultural rights to kurds , even though they are not recognized as an official minority .
ankara also claims it has cleaned up its poor human rights record , especially the notorious treatment of its political dissidents , although international human rights watchdogs frequently question the claim .
eyes set on brussels turkey has been eyeing entry in the eu for some time and has turned up its lobbying a notch since the union approved membership for 10 eastern european and mediterranean countries .
it now hopes eu leaders will agree to open the long-awaited membership talks when they meet to discuss expansion in december 2004 .
a definite agreement would have been a welcome gesture and have given prodi ’ s visit the historic dimension many turks hoped to see .
but the commission chief declined to set a specific date for commencing the talks .
turkey has been an eu candidate since 1999 , but it is the only country among 13 not to have begun accession talks with brussels .
ankara argues that it has fulfilled all the political criteria and has earned the right to open the membership talks by the end of the year .
in october , the commission must prepare a report for eu leaders on whether turkey meets the standards of democracy and market economy laid down for potential candidates .
at that time , prodi said the commission would at that time take a " look at the question of implementation of legislation on the ground . "
back in november the commission noted " significant progress " had been made , but cited several areas where more still needs to be done , including strengthening the independence of the judiciary and carrying out human rights reforms .

the eu ’ s chief executive said turkey must continue implementing political and legal reforms if it hopes to be admitted into the european bloc , said romano prodi . as the first eu commission president to visit turkey in 40 years , prodi was set up for a historic showing even before he arrived .
but once the head of the eu 's executive wing began to speak about ankara ’ s chances for gaining admittance in the soon-to-be 25-member bloc , he sounded repetitive .
" my main message is to continue along the path of reforms because impressive progress has been achieved .
the country is now closer to the union , " prodi told a news conference after talks with prime minister recep tayyip erdogan .
in the past two years , turkey has carried out sweeping reforms as it tries to meet brussels standards for accession .
it abolished the death penalty and granted greater cultural rights to kurds , even though they are not recognized as an official minority .
ankara also claims it has cleaned up its poor human rights record , especially the notorious treatment of its political dissidents , although international human rights watchdogs frequently question the claim .
eyes set on brussels turkey has been eyeing entry in the eu for some time and has turned up its lobbying a notch since the union approved membership for 10 eastern european and mediterranean countries .
it now hopes eu leaders will agree to open the long-awaited membership talks when they meet to discuss expansion in december 2004 .
a definite agreement would have been a welcome gesture and have given prodi ’ s visit the historic dimension many turks hoped to see .
but the commission chief declined to set a specific date for commencing the talks .
turkey has been an eu candidate since 1999 , but it is the only country among 13 not to have begun accession talks with brussels .
ankara argues that it has fulfilled all the political criteria and has earned the right to open the membership talks by the end of the year .
in october , the commission must prepare a report for eu leaders on whether turkey meets the standards of democracy and market economy laid down for potential candidates .
at that time , prodi said the commission would at that time take a " look at the question of implementation of legislation on the ground . "
back in november the commission noted " significant progress " had been made , but cited several areas where more still needs to be done , including strengthening the independence of the judiciary and carrying out human rights reforms .

it 's long been a forbidden word for health-conscious drinkers , playing a very distant second to wine .
but a brewery in the eastern german state of brandenburg is hoping to change that with a new beer that claims to provide a fountain of youth for its drinkers . and that could bring a sigh of relief for suds lovers with a mind for their body .
klosterbrauerei neuzelle in the small town of neuzelle on the german-polish border will this week unveil a new " anti-aging beer " that combines tasty malt with some wellness world favorites , including the wonder algae spirulina .
the brewery ’ s ceo , helmut fritsche , plans to introduce the new brew at this week ’ s green week food industry fair in berlin and hopes to place it on store shelves by march .
" when people drink beer , why shouldn ’ t they be able to drink a healthy beer , " fritsche recently told the märkische oderzeitung newspaper .
a bottle a day keeps cancer away ?
the brew ’ s main ingredients are thermal brine water from the nearby health resort bad saarow , as well as spirulina , an algae , and flavonoide , a plant extract commonly used in anti-wrinkle creams .
flavonoides are also known to protect against arteriosclerosis , high blood pressure and cancer .
spirulina , with more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bottle keeps cancer away ? than 100 nutrients including beta carotene , chlorophyll , vitamin b12 , has been described as one of the healthiest foods .
meanwhile , brine water aids in digestion and maintaining metabolism and healthy blood pressure as well as helping the body rid itself of heavy metals and toxins like quicksilver , lead , arsenic , amalgam or even chalk build-up .
but it is still beer , and too much of it could undo the fountain of youth effect and , worse , bring on a nasty hangover .
fritsche warns that moderation is essential when drinking his " anti-aging " beer .
after all , each bottle does contain 4.8 percent alcohol .
trouble in wellness land the drink 's alcohol level is n't the only problem fritsche faces in convincing potential beer buyers .
because the sudsy mix doesn ’ t jibe with the german purity law of 1516 , the company won ’ t be able to sell it as beer in this country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hops , malt , yeast and water are the only beer ingredients allowed under germany 's purity law .
the purity law , first created to protect the reputation and quality of the german beer market , is one of the world ’ s oldest food regulations .
the law holds that beverages labeled " beer " may only contain hops , malt , yeast and water .
" i ’ ve applied for a special permit to be able to call ‘ anti-aging beer ’ a beer , " fritsche told the paper .
if his application is rejected , he is threatening to take his case to court – even as far as germany ’ s highest court if he has to .
fritsche has a colorful history of challenging germany ’ s beer purity laws .
he is currently battling in an administrative court in frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- over whether or not he should be given the right to apply the beer label to a dark beer his klosterbrauerei brews with sugar – a taboo ingredient under the ancient purity law .
fritsche , whose brewery also offers a cherry-flavored beer , has argued that his concoction should be exempted as a regional specialty .
but what about fritsche ’ s anti-aging elixir ?
the malty tasting drink contains none of the chemicals the purity law seeks to keep out of the bottle .
and , he believes , good health and naturalness should be given deference over a regulation written back in the middle ages . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's favorite beverage : beer from flensburg in the north to munich in the south , beer is germany ’ s favorite drink .

it 's long been a forbidden word for health-conscious drinkers , playing a very distant second to wine .
but a brewery in the eastern german state of brandenburg is hoping to change that with a new beer that claims to provide a fountain of youth for its drinkers . and that could bring a sigh of relief for suds lovers with a mind for their body .
klosterbrauerei neuzelle in the small town of neuzelle on the german-polish border will this week unveil a new " anti-aging beer " that combines tasty malt with some wellness world favorites , including the wonder algae spirulina .
the brewery ’ s ceo , helmut fritsche , plans to introduce the new brew at this week ’ s green week food industry fair in berlin and hopes to place it on store shelves by march .
" when people drink beer , why shouldn ’ t they be able to drink a healthy beer , " fritsche recently told the märkische oderzeitung newspaper .
a bottle a day keeps cancer away ?
the brew ’ s main ingredients are thermal brine water from the nearby health resort bad saarow , as well as spirulina , an algae , and flavonoide , a plant extract commonly used in anti-wrinkle creams .
flavonoides are also known to protect against arteriosclerosis , high blood pressure and cancer .
spirulina , with more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bottle keeps cancer away ? than 100 nutrients including beta carotene , chlorophyll , vitamin b12 , has been described as one of the healthiest foods .
meanwhile , brine water aids in digestion and maintaining metabolism and healthy blood pressure as well as helping the body rid itself of heavy metals and toxins like quicksilver , lead , arsenic , amalgam or even chalk build-up .

because the sudsy mix doesn ’ t jibe with the german purity law of 1516 , the company won ’ t be able to sell it as beer in this country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hops , malt , yeast and water are the only beer ingredients allowed under germany 's purity law .
the purity law , first created to protect the reputation and quality of the german beer market , is one of the world ’ s oldest food regulations .
the law holds that beverages labeled " beer " may only contain hops , malt , yeast and water .
" i ’ ve applied for a special permit to be able to call ‘ anti-aging beer ’ a beer , " fritsche told the paper .
if his application is rejected , he is threatening to take his case to court – even as far as germany ’ s highest court if he has to .
fritsche has a colorful history of challenging germany ’ s beer purity laws .
he is currently battling in an administrative court in frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- over whether or not he should be given the right to apply the beer label to a dark beer his klosterbrauerei brews with sugar – a taboo ingredient under the ancient purity law .
fritsche , whose brewery also offers a cherry-flavored beer , has argued that his concoction should be exempted as a regional specialty .
but what about fritsche ’ s anti-aging elixir ?
the malty tasting drink contains none of the chemicals the purity law seeks to keep out of the bottle .
and , he believes , good health and naturalness should be given deference over a regulation written back in the middle ages . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's favorite beverage : beer from flensburg in the north to munich in the south , beer is germany ’ s favorite drink .

not unexpectedly , the daily continued , the motorists ’ lobby protested and clement immediately sought to appease , saying he had merely wanted to set people thinking .

the paper cynically remarked that the transport minister ’ s word is absolutely credible – after all he ’ s been consoling the public for months because germany still hasn ’ t managed to introduce the scheduled autobahn toll for trucks . other german papers continue to comment on the ruling by italy ’ s constitutional court that the immunity law blocking prime minister silvio berlusconi ’ s bribery trial is unconstitutional .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.01.2004 eu commissioner urges turkey to push forward on reforms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey and the eu - soon to be under one flag ?
the eu ’ s chief executive said turkey must continue implementing political and legal reforms if it hopes to be admitted into the european bloc , said romano prodi . as the first eu commission president to visit turkey in 40 years , prodi was set up for a historic showing even before he arrived .
but once the head of the eu 's executive wing began to speak about ankara ’ s chances for gaining admittance in the soon-to-be 25-member bloc , he sounded repetitive .
" my main message is to continue along the path of reforms because impressive progress has been achieved .
the country is now closer to the union , " prodi told a news conference after talks with prime minister recep tayyip erdogan .
in the past two years , turkey has carried out sweeping reforms as it tries to meet brussels standards for accession .
it abolished the death penalty and granted greater cultural rights to kurds , even though they are not recognized as an official minority .
ankara also claims it has cleaned up its poor human rights record , especially the notorious treatment of its political dissidents , although international human rights watchdogs frequently question the claim .
eyes set on brussels turkey has been eyeing entry in the eu for some time and has turned up its lobbying a notch since the union approved membership for 10 eastern european and mediterranean countries .
it now hopes eu leaders will agree to open the long-awaited membership talks when they meet to discuss expansion in december 2004 .
a definite agreement would have been a welcome gesture and have given prodi ’ s visit the historic dimension many turks hoped to see .
but the commission chief declined to set a specific date for commencing the talks .
turkey has been an eu candidate since 1999 , but it is the only country among 13 not to have begun accession talks with brussels .
ankara argues that it has fulfilled all the political criteria and has earned the right to open the membership talks by the end of the year .
in october , the commission must prepare a report for eu leaders on whether turkey meets the standards of democracy and market economy laid down for potential candidates .
at that time , prodi said the commission would at that time take a " look at the question of implementation of legislation on the ground . "
back in november the commission noted " significant progress " had been made , but cited several areas where more still needs to be done , including strengthening the independence of the judiciary and carrying out human rights reforms .

the eu ’ s chief executive said turkey must continue implementing political and legal reforms if it hopes to be admitted into the european bloc , said romano prodi . as the first eu commission president to visit turkey in 40 years , prodi was set up for a historic showing even before he arrived .
but once the head of the eu 's executive wing began to speak about ankara ’ s chances for gaining admittance in the soon-to-be 25-member bloc , he sounded repetitive .
" my main message is to continue along the path of reforms because impressive progress has been achieved .
the country is now closer to the union , " prodi told a news conference after talks with prime minister recep tayyip erdogan .
in the past two years , turkey has carried out sweeping reforms as it tries to meet brussels standards for accession .
it abolished the death penalty and granted greater cultural rights to kurds , even though they are not recognized as an official minority .
ankara also claims it has cleaned up its poor human rights record , especially the notorious treatment of its political dissidents , although international human rights watchdogs frequently question the claim .
eyes set on brussels turkey has been eyeing entry in the eu for some time and has turned up its lobbying a notch since the union approved membership for 10 eastern european and mediterranean countries .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.01.2004 eu commissioner urges turkey to push forward on reforms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey and the eu - soon to be under one flag ?
the eu ’ s chief executive said turkey must continue implementing political and legal reforms if it hopes to be admitted into the european bloc , said romano prodi . as the first eu commission president to visit turkey in 40 years , prodi was set up for a historic showing even before he arrived .
but once the head of the eu 's executive wing began to speak about ankara ’ s chances for gaining admittance in the soon-to-be 25-member bloc , he sounded repetitive .
" my main message is to continue along the path of reforms because impressive progress has been achieved .
the country is now closer to the union , " prodi told a news conference after talks with prime minister recep tayyip erdogan .
in the past two years , turkey has carried out sweeping reforms as it tries to meet brussels standards for accession .
it abolished the death penalty and granted greater cultural rights to kurds , even though they are not recognized as an official minority .
ankara also claims it has cleaned up its poor human rights record , especially the notorious treatment of its political dissidents , although international human rights watchdogs frequently question the claim .
eyes set on brussels turkey has been eyeing entry in the eu for some time and has turned up its lobbying a notch since the union approved membership for 10 eastern european and mediterranean countries .
it now hopes eu leaders will agree to open the long-awaited membership talks when they meet to discuss expansion in december 2004 .
a definite agreement would have been a welcome gesture and have given prodi ’ s visit the historic dimension many turks hoped to see .
but the commission chief declined to set a specific date for commencing the talks .
turkey has been an eu candidate since 1999 , but it is the only country among 13 not to have begun accession talks with brussels .
ankara argues that it has fulfilled all the political criteria and has earned the right to open the membership talks by the end of the year .
in october , the commission must prepare a report for eu leaders on whether turkey meets the standards of democracy and market economy laid down for potential candidates .
at that time , prodi said the commission would at that time take a " look at the question of implementation of legislation on the ground . "
back in november the commission noted " significant progress " had been made , but cited several areas where more still needs to be done , including strengthening the independence of the judiciary and carrying out human rights reforms .

14 .
thousands of turkish cypriots , rallied in northern cyprus to call for the reunification of the divided island .
cyprus integral to eu membership although technically not a condition for starting membership talks , the commission has made it clear that finding a solution to cyprus is integral to aiding turkey ’ s bid for the eu .
the greek , southern part of the divided island will join the union in may 2004 .
the northern part of cyprus , recognized as an independent republic only by turkey itself , has not been approved .
brussels says the turkish cypriots living in the north will be denied entry in the union if a settlement is not struck in time .
a solution to cyprus " is not a precondition , " prodi said , " but this will be a big help . "
up to now turkey has rejected any link between the cyprus question and its own eu membership , but foreign minister abdullah gul admitted in a newspaper interview on thursday that failure to resolve the dispute could prove costly .
" we are running late for a solution .
our hand is weakening .
we can not get rid of a problem by postponing it .
this is where we are at in cyprus , " he said in comments published by the liberal radikal daily .

the economics minister 's comments on privatizing the autobahn has drawn a raft of criticism from politicians and experts with most unanimous that germans wo n't want to pay money to speed on their beloved freeway system . no one knows better than the economics minister how much money needs to be saved in order to right germany 's sinking economy . but wolfgang clement 's comments to an interviewer that a privatization of germany 's autobahn , already the case in france and italy , might help put the country back in the black has sparked criticism . " the autobahn in germany is already paid by taxpayers , " says maximillian maurer , of germany 's car drivers ' association adac .
" the government ca n't privatize what already belongs to the taxpayers . " no toll roads above all , driver 's associations and the country 's transportation minister fear privatization of germany 's storied motorway might mean drivers have to begin paying tolls .
critics say that would lead to a re-direction of traffic to smaller streets and roads that pass through towns , causing traffic problems and chaos for residents .
others say setting up a toll system would be too complicated and would scare away companies . construction companies greeted clement 's comments , saying that the taxpayer-financed autobahn was a thing of the past . " we think of it as a worthy option , " heiko stiepelmann , of the association of the german construction industry told the business daily handelsblatt .
" given the budget and debt situation , germany can no longer afford a taxpayer-financed autobahn . " politicians , even in clement 's own social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , have called his comments rash and " shot from the hip . " " there have been no thoughts about a privatization of the autobahn or a toll , " transportation minister manfred stolpe spelled out for reporters in berlin . more than 1 billion spent each year so far , clement 's thoughts have n't gone beyond the drafting table , and he 's kept quiet since his comments in wednesday 's edition of the berliner zeitung . that means the federal government will continue to shovel out the approximately 1.2 billion euros needed annually to maintain the 12,000 kilometer -lrb- 7,400 mile -rrb- -long autobahn network .

germans are no longer aware of the fact that they once financed the autobahns , it said .
now the government , relying on taxpayers ’ contributions , will decide on the highways ’ further use with the greatest of ease , according to the daily .
neues deutschland in berlin asked : have you heard anything about “ super minister ” wolfgang clement lately ?
he is supposed to boost the economy and ensure more jobs are created , the paper noted .
but instead he has given some thought to transport and to whether the state-run autobahns should be privatized .
not unexpectedly , the daily continued , the motorists ’ lobby protested and clement immediately sought to appease , saying he had merely wanted to set people thinking .
he ‘ s achieved nothing , it said , but at least everyone ’ s talking about him again . the stuttgarter zeitung pointed out that transport minister manfred stolpe – suspecting what reactions clement ’ s proposal would trigger – immediately sought to play it down , saying there would not be a motorway toll for cars .
the paper cynically remarked that the transport minister ’ s word is absolutely credible – after all he ’ s been consoling the public for months because germany still hasn ’ t managed to introduce the scheduled autobahn toll for trucks . other german papers continue to comment on the ruling by italy ’ s constitutional court that the immunity law blocking prime minister silvio berlusconi ’ s bribery trial is unconstitutional .
the mannheimer morgen wrote that even a berlusconi is not above the law .
will he have to go to prison for corruption ?
for the time being , it continued , the judges have only taught the “ cavaliere ” a lesson , but it is doubtful whether the government chief will draw the right conclusions .
for berlusconi is immune to criticism , the daily said , and moves on the political stage as if he were suffering from paranoia .
because he thinks he is surrounded by traitors and has lost any sense of reality , he is suppressing the simple fact that he has caused the crisis in the country because of his dubious business dealings and his attempts to cover them up . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

military bases will be closed and troops will be cut back in an effort to save € 26 billion .
but the future of the country 's compulsory military conscription remains uncertain . german defense minister peter struck said tuesday that he will shut about 100 military bases and cut troop numbers in an effort to slash € 26 billion in military spending plans and make the armed forces more professional .
" tasks such as conflict prevention and crisis management , " struck said , " require fundamentally different armed forces .
they must be rapidly available and robust enough to carry out international missions together with our partners . “ struck made the announcement at a press conference , at which he also said that forces would be cut by about 35,000 troops in the coming years .
an additional 10,000 civilian posts are also on the cutting board .
the cuts would bring the number of troops down from today 's 285,000 to about 250,000 .
the army would then be divided into so-called intervention , stabilization and support troops .
in the future , 35,000 troops would be prepared for international missions , 70,000 for peace missions like those currently being undertaken in the balkans and afghanistan .
an additional 137,500 troops would be designated for support and 10,000 others could be flexibly deployed where needed by the bundeswehr 's general inspecter .
the union representing germany 's bundeswehr soldiers offered mixed reviews for the plan on tuesday .
" although we are not very enthusiastic about the spending cuts , " bernard gertz was quoted by deutsche welle , " we support the reforms in these times of increasingly stringent budget constraints .
it is quite acceptable to concentrate on the bundeswehr 's future tasks and abolish structures and equipment which are now obsolete . “ eurofighter contracts wo n't be canceled despite the cutbacks , struck said germany would not cancel its order for 180 eurofighter aircraft to be built by defense contractors including eads , britain ’ s bae systems and italy ’ s alenia .
the future of the draft , however , remains in question .
struck said he remains committed to the draft .
but that could change , depending on the outcome of the 2006 elections .
“ the draft will run out , so will the community service , ” said angelika beer , the co-head of the green party , in an interview with ard public television .
around 90,000 young germans are registered yearly for community service as an alternative to mandatory military service .
beer , whose party is part of the federal coaltion government with the social democrats , said she would like the draft to be phased out over the next three or four years .
hospitals depend on young workforce about 80 percent of those choosing community service end up working in hospitals or senior citizens ’ homes , doing essential work such as driving ambulances , caring for the disabled and elderly and delivering meals .
charitable organizations fear there would be severe consequences for the german healthcare system if this workforce were to disappear .
“ we ’ ll have to consider if the services these young people are doing can be totally abolished , ” joachim kendelbacher , from the workers ’ welfare organization , told deutsche welle . “ if these services are cut this definitely means a loss in quality . ”
all armed forces to be trimmed struck said all divisions of the armed forces - including naval , air and ground troops - will have to shoulder their share of the cuts .
his plan drew immediate criticism from conservative opposition leaders .
christian democrat defense issues spokesman christian schmidt said in interviews with german television that the basis for deciding on the military structure can not be “ how much we have in the bank . ”

military bases will be closed and troops will be cut back in an effort to save € 26 billion .
but the future of the country 's compulsory military conscription remains uncertain . german defense minister peter struck said tuesday that he will shut about 100 military bases and cut troop numbers in an effort to slash € 26 billion in military spending plans and make the armed forces more professional .
" tasks such as conflict prevention and crisis management , " struck said , " require fundamentally different armed forces .
they must be rapidly available and robust enough to carry out international missions together with our partners . “ struck made the announcement at a press conference , at which he also said that forces would be cut by about 35,000 troops in the coming years .
an additional 10,000 civilian posts are also on the cutting board .
the cuts would bring the number of troops down from today 's 285,000 to about 250,000 .
the army would then be divided into so-called intervention , stabilization and support troops .
in the future , 35,000 troops would be prepared for international missions , 70,000 for peace missions like those currently being undertaken in the balkans and afghanistan .
an additional 137,500 troops would be designated for support and 10,000 others could be flexibly deployed where needed by the bundeswehr 's general inspecter .
the union representing germany 's bundeswehr soldiers offered mixed reviews for the plan on tuesday .
" although we are not very enthusiastic about the spending cuts , " bernard gertz was quoted by deutsche welle , " we support the reforms in these times of increasingly stringent budget constraints .
it is quite acceptable to concentrate on the bundeswehr 's future tasks and abolish structures and equipment which are now obsolete . “ eurofighter contracts wo n't be canceled despite the cutbacks , struck said germany would not cancel its order for 180 eurofighter aircraft to be built by defense contractors including eads , britain ’ s bae systems and italy ’ s alenia .
the future of the draft , however , remains in question .
struck said he remains committed to the draft .
but that could change , depending on the outcome of the 2006 elections .
“ the draft will run out , so will the community service , ” said angelika beer , the co-head of the green party , in an interview with ard public television .
around 90,000 young germans are registered yearly for community service as an alternative to mandatory military service .
beer , whose party is part of the federal coaltion government with the social democrats , said she would like the draft to be phased out over the next three or four years .
hospitals depend on young workforce about 80 percent of those choosing community service end up working in hospitals or senior citizens ’ homes , doing essential work such as driving ambulances , caring for the disabled and elderly and delivering meals .
charitable organizations fear there would be severe consequences for the german healthcare system if this workforce were to disappear .
“ we ’ ll have to consider if the services these young people are doing can be totally abolished , ” joachim kendelbacher , from the workers ’ welfare organization , told deutsche welle . “ if these services are cut this definitely means a loss in quality . ”
all armed forces to be trimmed struck said all divisions of the armed forces - including naval , air and ground troops - will have to shoulder their share of the cuts .
his plan drew immediate criticism from conservative opposition leaders .
christian democrat defense issues spokesman christian schmidt said in interviews with german television that the basis for deciding on the military structure can not be “ how much we have in the bank . ”
rather , he said , it should be “ what we want to secure . ” dw staff with reporting by uwe hessler -lrb- so -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundeswehr cuts could hurt german defense industry defense minister peter struck 's announcement that some € 26 billion will be cut from the bundeswehr 's spending plans will hit the german arms industry hard .

but getting rid of mandatory military service would also mean that the alternative , community service , would suffer as a result .
hospitals , senior citizen homes and youth centers would be understaffed , and many projects which rely on the 90,000 civil draftees for inexpensive labor would shut down .
already a reduction of the length of community service from 10 to nine months , as suggested by the government , would place a strain on the social system .
in a report released on thursday , family affairs minister renate schmidt referred to the potential crisis facing the country and called for allowing draftees to extend their civil service on a voluntary basis .
she also floated the idea of introducing a voluntary service for both men and women , which would last between three months and two years .
such a service - a first for germany - would include projects in the traditional social areas as well as in child care , environmental protection and immigration .
a mandatory service year as a replacement for conscription was , however , rejected , as the german constitution strictly prohibits this . dw-world.de germany set to abolish the draft young german men could soon be free of compulsory military service .

the eu ’ s chief executive said turkey must continue implementing political and legal reforms if it hopes to be admitted into the european bloc , said romano prodi . as the first eu commission president to visit turkey in 40 years , prodi was set up for a historic showing even before he arrived .
but once the head of the eu 's executive wing began to speak about ankara ’ s chances for gaining admittance in the soon-to-be 25-member bloc , he sounded repetitive .
" my main message is to continue along the path of reforms because impressive progress has been achieved .
the country is now closer to the union , " prodi told a news conference after talks with prime minister recep tayyip erdogan .
in the past two years , turkey has carried out sweeping reforms as it tries to meet brussels standards for accession .
it abolished the death penalty and granted greater cultural rights to kurds , even though they are not recognized as an official minority .
ankara also claims it has cleaned up its poor human rights record , especially the notorious treatment of its political dissidents , although international human rights watchdogs frequently question the claim .
eyes set on brussels turkey has been eyeing entry in the eu for some time and has turned up its lobbying a notch since the union approved membership for 10 eastern european and mediterranean countries .
it now hopes eu leaders will agree to open the long-awaited membership talks when they meet to discuss expansion in december 2004 .
a definite agreement would have been a welcome gesture and have given prodi ’ s visit the historic dimension many turks hoped to see .
but the commission chief declined to set a specific date for commencing the talks .
turkey has been an eu candidate since 1999 , but it is the only country among 13 not to have begun accession talks with brussels .
ankara argues that it has fulfilled all the political criteria and has earned the right to open the membership talks by the end of the year .
in october , the commission must prepare a report for eu leaders on whether turkey meets the standards of democracy and market economy laid down for potential candidates .
at that time , prodi said the commission would at that time take a " look at the question of implementation of legislation on the ground . "
back in november the commission noted " significant progress " had been made , but cited several areas where more still needs to be done , including strengthening the independence of the judiciary and carrying out human rights reforms .

the eu ’ s chief executive said turkey must continue implementing political and legal reforms if it hopes to be admitted into the european bloc , said romano prodi . as the first eu commission president to visit turkey in 40 years , prodi was set up for a historic showing even before he arrived .
but once the head of the eu 's executive wing began to speak about ankara ’ s chances for gaining admittance in the soon-to-be 25-member bloc , he sounded repetitive .
" my main message is to continue along the path of reforms because impressive progress has been achieved .
the country is now closer to the union , " prodi told a news conference after talks with prime minister recep tayyip erdogan .
in the past two years , turkey has carried out sweeping reforms as it tries to meet brussels standards for accession .
it abolished the death penalty and granted greater cultural rights to kurds , even though they are not recognized as an official minority .
ankara also claims it has cleaned up its poor human rights record , especially the notorious treatment of its political dissidents , although international human rights watchdogs frequently question the claim .

military bases will be closed and troops will be cut back in an effort to save € 26 billion .
but the future of the country 's compulsory military conscription remains uncertain . german defense minister peter struck said tuesday that he will shut about 100 military bases and cut troop numbers in an effort to slash € 26 billion in military spending plans and make the armed forces more professional .
" tasks such as conflict prevention and crisis management , " struck said , " require fundamentally different armed forces .
they must be rapidly available and robust enough to carry out international missions together with our partners . “ struck made the announcement at a press conference , at which he also said that forces would be cut by about 35,000 troops in the coming years .
an additional 10,000 civilian posts are also on the cutting board .
the cuts would bring the number of troops down from today 's 285,000 to about 250,000 .
the army would then be divided into so-called intervention , stabilization and support troops .
in the future , 35,000 troops would be prepared for international missions , 70,000 for peace missions like those currently being undertaken in the balkans and afghanistan .
an additional 137,500 troops would be designated for support and 10,000 others could be flexibly deployed where needed by the bundeswehr 's general inspecter .
the union representing germany 's bundeswehr soldiers offered mixed reviews for the plan on tuesday .
" although we are not very enthusiastic about the spending cuts , " bernard gertz was quoted by deutsche welle , " we support the reforms in these times of increasingly stringent budget constraints .
it is quite acceptable to concentrate on the bundeswehr 's future tasks and abolish structures and equipment which are now obsolete . “ eurofighter contracts wo n't be canceled despite the cutbacks , struck said germany would not cancel its order for 180 eurofighter aircraft to be built by defense contractors including eads , britain ’ s bae systems and italy ’ s alenia .
the future of the draft , however , remains in question .
struck said he remains committed to the draft .
but that could change , depending on the outcome of the 2006 elections .
“ the draft will run out , so will the community service , ” said angelika beer , the co-head of the green party , in an interview with ard public television .
around 90,000 young germans are registered yearly for community service as an alternative to mandatory military service .
beer , whose party is part of the federal coaltion government with the social democrats , said she would like the draft to be phased out over the next three or four years .
hospitals depend on young workforce about 80 percent of those choosing community service end up working in hospitals or senior citizens ’ homes , doing essential work such as driving ambulances , caring for the disabled and elderly and delivering meals .
charitable organizations fear there would be severe consequences for the german healthcare system if this workforce were to disappear .
“ we ’ ll have to consider if the services these young people are doing can be totally abolished , ” joachim kendelbacher , from the workers ’ welfare organization , told deutsche welle . “ if these services are cut this definitely means a loss in quality . ”
all armed forces to be trimmed struck said all divisions of the armed forces - including naval , air and ground troops - will have to shoulder their share of the cuts .
his plan drew immediate criticism from conservative opposition leaders .
christian democrat defense issues spokesman christian schmidt said in interviews with german television that the basis for deciding on the military structure can not be “ how much we have in the bank . ”
rather , he said , it should be “ what we want to secure . ” dw staff with reporting by uwe hessler -lrb- so -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundeswehr cuts could hurt german defense industry defense minister peter struck 's announcement that some € 26 billion will be cut from the bundeswehr 's spending plans will hit the german arms industry hard .

14 , 2004 -rrb- germany set to abolish the draft young german men could soon be free of compulsory military service .
but abolishing the draft may pose a serious problem for the social system , which depends on those men that opt for the alternative - community service .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.01.2004 -pipe- 13:00 utc germany considers introducing volunteer service earlier this week berlin ’ s red-green coalition government announced it would seriously consider abolishing the draft .
but getting rid of mandatory military service would also mean that the alternative , community service , would suffer as a result .
hospitals , senior citizen homes and youth centers would be understaffed , and many projects which rely on the 90,000 civil draftees for inexpensive labor would shut down .
already a reduction of the length of community service from 10 to nine months , as suggested by the government , would place a strain on the social system .
in a report released on thursday , family affairs minister renate schmidt referred to the potential crisis facing the country and called for allowing draftees to extend their civil service on a voluntary basis .

the economics minister 's comments on privatizing the autobahn has drawn a raft of criticism from politicians and experts with most unanimous that germans wo n't want to pay money to speed on their beloved freeway system . no one knows better than the economics minister how much money needs to be saved in order to right germany 's sinking economy . but wolfgang clement 's comments to an interviewer that a privatization of germany 's autobahn , already the case in france and italy , might help put the country back in the black has sparked criticism . " the autobahn in germany is already paid by taxpayers , " says maximillian maurer , of germany 's car drivers ' association adac .
" the government ca n't privatize what already belongs to the taxpayers . " no toll roads above all , driver 's associations and the country 's transportation minister fear privatization of germany 's storied motorway might mean drivers have to begin paying tolls .
critics say that would lead to a re-direction of traffic to smaller streets and roads that pass through towns , causing traffic problems and chaos for residents .
others say setting up a toll system would be too complicated and would scare away companies . construction companies greeted clement 's comments , saying that the taxpayer-financed autobahn was a thing of the past . " we think of it as a worthy option , " heiko stiepelmann , of the association of the german construction industry told the business daily handelsblatt .
" given the budget and debt situation , germany can no longer afford a taxpayer-financed autobahn . " politicians , even in clement 's own social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , have called his comments rash and " shot from the hip . " " there have been no thoughts about a privatization of the autobahn or a toll , " transportation minister manfred stolpe spelled out for reporters in berlin . more than 1 billion spent each year so far , clement 's thoughts have n't gone beyond the drafting table , and he 's kept quiet since his comments in wednesday 's edition of the berliner zeitung . that means the federal government will continue to shovel out the approximately 1.2 billion euros needed annually to maintain the 12,000 kilometer -lrb- 7,400 mile -rrb- -long autobahn network .
any one who 's driven the highways in the former east - or even in heavily traveled sections of the west - knows that 's not enough .
new roads cost extra . france privatized its national freeway system in the 1950s , when it was only 80-km long .
today , the system is 10,000 kilometers bigger and the government has continued a toll system that was supposed to be phased out after some time . up to 90 percent of italy 's freeway system is in private hands , though promised improvement and extensions to the freeways have so far not taken place . dw staff -lrb- atz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press review : private autobahns ?

military bases will be closed and troops will be cut back in an effort to save € 26 billion .
but the future of the country 's compulsory military conscription remains uncertain . german defense minister peter struck said tuesday that he will shut about 100 military bases and cut troop numbers in an effort to slash € 26 billion in military spending plans and make the armed forces more professional .
" tasks such as conflict prevention and crisis management , " struck said , " require fundamentally different armed forces .
they must be rapidly available and robust enough to carry out international missions together with our partners . “ struck made the announcement at a press conference , at which he also said that forces would be cut by about 35,000 troops in the coming years .
an additional 10,000 civilian posts are also on the cutting board .
the cuts would bring the number of troops down from today 's 285,000 to about 250,000 .
the army would then be divided into so-called intervention , stabilization and support troops .
in the future , 35,000 troops would be prepared for international missions , 70,000 for peace missions like those currently being undertaken in the balkans and afghanistan .
an additional 137,500 troops would be designated for support and 10,000 others could be flexibly deployed where needed by the bundeswehr 's general inspecter .
the union representing germany 's bundeswehr soldiers offered mixed reviews for the plan on tuesday .
" although we are not very enthusiastic about the spending cuts , " bernard gertz was quoted by deutsche welle , " we support the reforms in these times of increasingly stringent budget constraints .
it is quite acceptable to concentrate on the bundeswehr 's future tasks and abolish structures and equipment which are now obsolete . “ eurofighter contracts wo n't be canceled despite the cutbacks , struck said germany would not cancel its order for 180 eurofighter aircraft to be built by defense contractors including eads , britain ’ s bae systems and italy ’ s alenia .
the future of the draft , however , remains in question .
struck said he remains committed to the draft .
but that could change , depending on the outcome of the 2006 elections .
“ the draft will run out , so will the community service , ” said angelika beer , the co-head of the green party , in an interview with ard public television .
around 90,000 young germans are registered yearly for community service as an alternative to mandatory military service .
beer , whose party is part of the federal coaltion government with the social democrats , said she would like the draft to be phased out over the next three or four years .
hospitals depend on young workforce about 80 percent of those choosing community service end up working in hospitals or senior citizens ’ homes , doing essential work such as driving ambulances , caring for the disabled and elderly and delivering meals .
charitable organizations fear there would be severe consequences for the german healthcare system if this workforce were to disappear .
“ we ’ ll have to consider if the services these young people are doing can be totally abolished , ” joachim kendelbacher , from the workers ’ welfare organization , told deutsche welle . “ if these services are cut this definitely means a loss in quality . ”
all armed forces to be trimmed struck said all divisions of the armed forces - including naval , air and ground troops - will have to shoulder their share of the cuts .
his plan drew immediate criticism from conservative opposition leaders .
christian democrat defense issues spokesman christian schmidt said in interviews with german television that the basis for deciding on the military structure can not be “ how much we have in the bank . ”
rather , he said , it should be “ what we want to secure . ” dw staff with reporting by uwe hessler -lrb- so -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundeswehr cuts could hurt german defense industry defense minister peter struck 's announcement that some € 26 billion will be cut from the bundeswehr 's spending plans will hit the german arms industry hard .

continuing its crackdown on nicotine addiction , the european union may seek a europe-wide ban on smoking in bars and restaurants . a top european official said the eu commission is considering a ban on smoking in bars and restaurants . “ it ’ s a question of whether or not we want to institute smoke free workplaces and that would include jobs in bars and restaurants , ” david byrne , the eu commissioner for health and consumer protection , told germany ’ s die welt newspaper on thursday . the brussels-based commission is currently considering whether to mandate the smoking ban europe-wide , or give each state the freedom to decide whether , and to what extent , to ban smoking in public . photos of disease bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large written warnings on cigarette packs have been mandatory üin the eu since last october .
currently in its effort to reduce smoking in the eu , the commission is compiling a databank with photographs of smoking-related illnesses aimed at frightening potential smokers away from tobacco .
eu countries could then mandate the use of these photos in addition to the written warning labels that have been required on european cigarette packages since the end of january . the member states would then decide if they want to use the photos , ” byrne told the newspaper .
the eu has accused germany of taking too soft a stance on smoking in public .
commissioner byrne has criticized the government for taking an " easygoing " stance to smoking , considering that an estimated 100,000 germans die of smoking-related diseases every year .
moreover , the eu commission , which launched an anti-smoking campaign last year called " feel free to say no , " has accused berlin of trying to block a comprehensive world-wide anti-smoking initiative by the world health organization , which is already supported by over 190 countries .
in the past years , germany has also come out strongly against an eu initiative to ban cigarette advertising across europe .
germans keep on smoking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : next to spain and greece , germany has the highest rate of smokers in europe .
statistics collected by the federal health ministry also show that while smoking is on the decline in the rest of europe , germany ’ s number of smokers has remained relatively constant .
even more alarming , the starting age for first-time smokers is dropping .
as of 2003 , every third ninth grader smoked .
across the rest of europe , however , enjoying a cigarette is becoming increasingly difficult as governments consider implementing anti-smoking legislation .
in the netherlands , a strict series of smoking laws went into effect on jan .
1 , 2004 , making it virtually impossible for workers to take cigarette breaks .
under the law , smoking is banned in areas such as stairs , hallways , conference rooms , cafeterias and toilets .
sweden has already passed a tough anti-smoking law that will go into effect in 2005 , and ireland is also on the verge of passing a ban similar to the one in the netherlands .
great britain is deliberating a crackdown on smoking in public spaces , but after a heated round of debate from the country ’ s pub owners , the government has decided to postpone any decision until later in 2004 . dw staff -lrb- ja -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a law to help kick the habit in the netherlands , smokers will get some added encouragement to kick the habit with strict new anti-smoking laws .

military bases will be closed and troops will be cut back in an effort to save € 26 billion .
but the future of the country 's compulsory military conscription remains uncertain . german defense minister peter struck said tuesday that he will shut about 100 military bases and cut troop numbers in an effort to slash € 26 billion in military spending plans and make the armed forces more professional .
" tasks such as conflict prevention and crisis management , " struck said , " require fundamentally different armed forces .
they must be rapidly available and robust enough to carry out international missions together with our partners . “ struck made the announcement at a press conference , at which he also said that forces would be cut by about 35,000 troops in the coming years .
an additional 10,000 civilian posts are also on the cutting board .
the cuts would bring the number of troops down from today 's 285,000 to about 250,000 .
the army would then be divided into so-called intervention , stabilization and support troops .
in the future , 35,000 troops would be prepared for international missions , 70,000 for peace missions like those currently being undertaken in the balkans and afghanistan .
an additional 137,500 troops would be designated for support and 10,000 others could be flexibly deployed where needed by the bundeswehr 's general inspecter .
the union representing germany 's bundeswehr soldiers offered mixed reviews for the plan on tuesday .
" although we are not very enthusiastic about the spending cuts , " bernard gertz was quoted by deutsche welle , " we support the reforms in these times of increasingly stringent budget constraints .
it is quite acceptable to concentrate on the bundeswehr 's future tasks and abolish structures and equipment which are now obsolete . “ eurofighter contracts wo n't be canceled despite the cutbacks , struck said germany would not cancel its order for 180 eurofighter aircraft to be built by defense contractors including eads , britain ’ s bae systems and italy ’ s alenia .
the future of the draft , however , remains in question .
struck said he remains committed to the draft .
but that could change , depending on the outcome of the 2006 elections .
“ the draft will run out , so will the community service , ” said angelika beer , the co-head of the green party , in an interview with ard public television .
around 90,000 young germans are registered yearly for community service as an alternative to mandatory military service .
beer , whose party is part of the federal coaltion government with the social democrats , said she would like the draft to be phased out over the next three or four years .
hospitals depend on young workforce about 80 percent of those choosing community service end up working in hospitals or senior citizens ’ homes , doing essential work such as driving ambulances , caring for the disabled and elderly and delivering meals .
charitable organizations fear there would be severe consequences for the german healthcare system if this workforce were to disappear .
“ we ’ ll have to consider if the services these young people are doing can be totally abolished , ” joachim kendelbacher , from the workers ’ welfare organization , told deutsche welle . “ if these services are cut this definitely means a loss in quality . ”
all armed forces to be trimmed struck said all divisions of the armed forces - including naval , air and ground troops - will have to shoulder their share of the cuts .
his plan drew immediate criticism from conservative opposition leaders .
christian democrat defense issues spokesman christian schmidt said in interviews with german television that the basis for deciding on the military structure can not be “ how much we have in the bank . ”
rather , he said , it should be “ what we want to secure . ” dw staff with reporting by uwe hessler -lrb- so -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundeswehr cuts could hurt german defense industry defense minister peter struck 's announcement that some € 26 billion will be cut from the bundeswehr 's spending plans will hit the german arms industry hard .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.01.2004 germany announces military cuts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister peter struck wants to make the armed forces more professional .
military bases will be closed and troops will be cut back in an effort to save € 26 billion .
but the future of the country 's compulsory military conscription remains uncertain . german defense minister peter struck said tuesday that he will shut about 100 military bases and cut troop numbers in an effort to slash € 26 billion in military spending plans and make the armed forces more professional .
" tasks such as conflict prevention and crisis management , " struck said , " require fundamentally different armed forces .
they must be rapidly available and robust enough to carry out international missions together with our partners . “ struck made the announcement at a press conference , at which he also said that forces would be cut by about 35,000 troops in the coming years .
an additional 10,000 civilian posts are also on the cutting board .
the cuts would bring the number of troops down from today 's 285,000 to about 250,000 .
the army would then be divided into so-called intervention , stabilization and support troops .
in the future , 35,000 troops would be prepared for international missions , 70,000 for peace missions like those currently being undertaken in the balkans and afghanistan .
an additional 137,500 troops would be designated for support and 10,000 others could be flexibly deployed where needed by the bundeswehr 's general inspecter .
the union representing germany 's bundeswehr soldiers offered mixed reviews for the plan on tuesday .
" although we are not very enthusiastic about the spending cuts , " bernard gertz was quoted by deutsche welle , " we support the reforms in these times of increasingly stringent budget constraints .
it is quite acceptable to concentrate on the bundeswehr 's future tasks and abolish structures and equipment which are now obsolete . “ eurofighter contracts wo n't be canceled despite the cutbacks , struck said germany would not cancel its order for 180 eurofighter aircraft to be built by defense contractors including eads , britain ’ s bae systems and italy ’ s alenia .
the future of the draft , however , remains in question .
struck said he remains committed to the draft .
but that could change , depending on the outcome of the 2006 elections .
“ the draft will run out , so will the community service , ” said angelika beer , the co-head of the green party , in an interview with ard public television .
around 90,000 young germans are registered yearly for community service as an alternative to mandatory military service .
beer , whose party is part of the federal coaltion government with the social democrats , said she would like the draft to be phased out over the next three or four years .
hospitals depend on young workforce about 80 percent of those choosing community service end up working in hospitals or senior citizens ’ homes , doing essential work such as driving ambulances , caring for the disabled and elderly and delivering meals .
charitable organizations fear there would be severe consequences for the german healthcare system if this workforce were to disappear .
“ we ’ ll have to consider if the services these young people are doing can be totally abolished , ” joachim kendelbacher , from the workers ’ welfare organization , told deutsche welle . “ if these services are cut this definitely means a loss in quality . ”
all armed forces to be trimmed struck said all divisions of the armed forces - including naval , air and ground troops - will have to shoulder their share of the cuts .
his plan drew immediate criticism from conservative opposition leaders .
christian democrat defense issues spokesman christian schmidt said in interviews with german television that the basis for deciding on the military structure can not be “ how much we have in the bank . ”
rather , he said , it should be “ what we want to secure . ” dw staff with reporting by uwe hessler -lrb- so -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundeswehr cuts could hurt german defense industry defense minister peter struck 's announcement that some € 26 billion will be cut from the bundeswehr 's spending plans will hit the german arms industry hard .

14 , 2004 -rrb- germany set to abolish the draft young german men could soon be free of compulsory military service .
but abolishing the draft may pose a serious problem for the social system , which depends on those men that opt for the alternative - community service .

it 's long been a forbidden word for health-conscious drinkers , playing a very distant second to wine .
but a brewery in the eastern german state of brandenburg is hoping to change that with a new beer that claims to provide a fountain of youth for its drinkers . and that could bring a sigh of relief for suds lovers with a mind for their body .
klosterbrauerei neuzelle in the small town of neuzelle on the german-polish border will this week unveil a new " anti-aging beer " that combines tasty malt with some wellness world favorites , including the wonder algae spirulina .
the brewery ’ s ceo , helmut fritsche , plans to introduce the new brew at this week ’ s green week food industry fair in berlin and hopes to place it on store shelves by march .
" when people drink beer , why shouldn ’ t they be able to drink a healthy beer , " fritsche recently told the märkische oderzeitung newspaper .
a bottle a day keeps cancer away ?
the brew ’ s main ingredients are thermal brine water from the nearby health resort bad saarow , as well as spirulina , an algae , and flavonoide , a plant extract commonly used in anti-wrinkle creams .
flavonoides are also known to protect against arteriosclerosis , high blood pressure and cancer .
spirulina , with more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bottle keeps cancer away ? than 100 nutrients including beta carotene , chlorophyll , vitamin b12 , has been described as one of the healthiest foods .
meanwhile , brine water aids in digestion and maintaining metabolism and healthy blood pressure as well as helping the body rid itself of heavy metals and toxins like quicksilver , lead , arsenic , amalgam or even chalk build-up .
but it is still beer , and too much of it could undo the fountain of youth effect and , worse , bring on a nasty hangover .
fritsche warns that moderation is essential when drinking his " anti-aging " beer .
after all , each bottle does contain 4.8 percent alcohol .
trouble in wellness land the drink 's alcohol level is n't the only problem fritsche faces in convincing potential beer buyers .
because the sudsy mix doesn ’ t jibe with the german purity law of 1516 , the company won ’ t be able to sell it as beer in this country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hops , malt , yeast and water are the only beer ingredients allowed under germany 's purity law .
the purity law , first created to protect the reputation and quality of the german beer market , is one of the world ’ s oldest food regulations .
the law holds that beverages labeled " beer " may only contain hops , malt , yeast and water .
" i ’ ve applied for a special permit to be able to call ‘ anti-aging beer ’ a beer , " fritsche told the paper .
if his application is rejected , he is threatening to take his case to court – even as far as germany ’ s highest court if he has to .
fritsche has a colorful history of challenging germany ’ s beer purity laws .
he is currently battling in an administrative court in frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- over whether or not he should be given the right to apply the beer label to a dark beer his klosterbrauerei brews with sugar – a taboo ingredient under the ancient purity law .
fritsche , whose brewery also offers a cherry-flavored beer , has argued that his concoction should be exempted as a regional specialty .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.01.2004 eu commissioner urges turkey to push forward on reforms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey and the eu - soon to be under one flag ?
the eu ’ s chief executive said turkey must continue implementing political and legal reforms if it hopes to be admitted into the european bloc , said romano prodi . as the first eu commission president to visit turkey in 40 years , prodi was set up for a historic showing even before he arrived .
but once the head of the eu 's executive wing began to speak about ankara ’ s chances for gaining admittance in the soon-to-be 25-member bloc , he sounded repetitive .
" my main message is to continue along the path of reforms because impressive progress has been achieved .
the country is now closer to the union , " prodi told a news conference after talks with prime minister recep tayyip erdogan .
in the past two years , turkey has carried out sweeping reforms as it tries to meet brussels standards for accession .
it abolished the death penalty and granted greater cultural rights to kurds , even though they are not recognized as an official minority .
ankara also claims it has cleaned up its poor human rights record , especially the notorious treatment of its political dissidents , although international human rights watchdogs frequently question the claim .
eyes set on brussels turkey has been eyeing entry in the eu for some time and has turned up its lobbying a notch since the union approved membership for 10 eastern european and mediterranean countries .
it now hopes eu leaders will agree to open the long-awaited membership talks when they meet to discuss expansion in december 2004 .
a definite agreement would have been a welcome gesture and have given prodi ’ s visit the historic dimension many turks hoped to see .
but the commission chief declined to set a specific date for commencing the talks .
turkey has been an eu candidate since 1999 , but it is the only country among 13 not to have begun accession talks with brussels .
ankara argues that it has fulfilled all the political criteria and has earned the right to open the membership talks by the end of the year .
in october , the commission must prepare a report for eu leaders on whether turkey meets the standards of democracy and market economy laid down for potential candidates .
at that time , prodi said the commission would at that time take a " look at the question of implementation of legislation on the ground . "
back in november the commission noted " significant progress " had been made , but cited several areas where more still needs to be done , including strengthening the independence of the judiciary and carrying out human rights reforms .

14 .
thousands of turkish cypriots , rallied in northern cyprus to call for the reunification of the divided island .
cyprus integral to eu membership although technically not a condition for starting membership talks , the commission has made it clear that finding a solution to cyprus is integral to aiding turkey ’ s bid for the eu .
the greek , southern part of the divided island will join the union in may 2004 .
the northern part of cyprus , recognized as an independent republic only by turkey itself , has not been approved .
brussels says the turkish cypriots living in the north will be denied entry in the union if a settlement is not struck in time .
a solution to cyprus " is not a precondition , " prodi said , " but this will be a big help . "
up to now turkey has rejected any link between the cyprus question and its own eu membership , but foreign minister abdullah gul admitted in a newspaper interview on thursday that failure to resolve the dispute could prove costly .
" we are running late for a solution .
our hand is weakening .
we can not get rid of a problem by postponing it .
this is where we are at in cyprus , " he said in comments published by the liberal radikal daily .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.01.2004 german press review : private autobahns ? many of germany ’ s papers on thursday commented on the proposal by german economics minister wolfgang clement to privatize the country ’ s autobahns . the nürnberger zeitung wondered how the message will be received by car drivers : the german taxpayer is starting to look paralyzed in view of the demands that are raining down on him and will no doubt accept yet another piece of bad news , the paper wrote .
germans are no longer aware of the fact that they once financed the autobahns , it said .
now the government , relying on taxpayers ’ contributions , will decide on the highways ’ further use with the greatest of ease , according to the daily .
neues deutschland in berlin asked : have you heard anything about “ super minister ” wolfgang clement lately ?
he is supposed to boost the economy and ensure more jobs are created , the paper noted .
but instead he has given some thought to transport and to whether the state-run autobahns should be privatized .
not unexpectedly , the daily continued , the motorists ’ lobby protested and clement immediately sought to appease , saying he had merely wanted to set people thinking .
he ‘ s achieved nothing , it said , but at least everyone ’ s talking about him again . the stuttgarter zeitung pointed out that transport minister manfred stolpe – suspecting what reactions clement ’ s proposal would trigger – immediately sought to play it down , saying there would not be a motorway toll for cars .
the paper cynically remarked that the transport minister ’ s word is absolutely credible – after all he ’ s been consoling the public for months because germany still hasn ’ t managed to introduce the scheduled autobahn toll for trucks . other german papers continue to comment on the ruling by italy ’ s constitutional court that the immunity law blocking prime minister silvio berlusconi ’ s bribery trial is unconstitutional .

the economics minister 's comments on privatizing the autobahn has drawn a raft of criticism from politicians and experts with most unanimous that germans wo n't want to pay money to speed on their beloved freeway system . no one knows better than the economics minister how much money needs to be saved in order to right germany 's sinking economy . but wolfgang clement 's comments to an interviewer that a privatization of germany 's autobahn , already the case in france and italy , might help put the country back in the black has sparked criticism . " the autobahn in germany is already paid by taxpayers , " says maximillian maurer , of germany 's car drivers ' association adac .
" the government ca n't privatize what already belongs to the taxpayers . " no toll roads above all , driver 's associations and the country 's transportation minister fear privatization of germany 's storied motorway might mean drivers have to begin paying tolls .
critics say that would lead to a re-direction of traffic to smaller streets and roads that pass through towns , causing traffic problems and chaos for residents .
others say setting up a toll system would be too complicated and would scare away companies . construction companies greeted clement 's comments , saying that the taxpayer-financed autobahn was a thing of the past . " we think of it as a worthy option , " heiko stiepelmann , of the association of the german construction industry told the business daily handelsblatt .
" given the budget and debt situation , germany can no longer afford a taxpayer-financed autobahn . " politicians , even in clement 's own social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , have called his comments rash and " shot from the hip . " " there have been no thoughts about a privatization of the autobahn or a toll , " transportation minister manfred stolpe spelled out for reporters in berlin . more than 1 billion spent each year so far , clement 's thoughts have n't gone beyond the drafting table , and he 's kept quiet since his comments in wednesday 's edition of the berliner zeitung . that means the federal government will continue to shovel out the approximately 1.2 billion euros needed annually to maintain the 12,000 kilometer -lrb- 7,400 mile -rrb- -long autobahn network .
any one who 's driven the highways in the former east - or even in heavily traveled sections of the west - knows that 's not enough .
new roads cost extra . france privatized its national freeway system in the 1950s , when it was only 80-km long .
today , the system is 10,000 kilometers bigger and the government has continued a toll system that was supposed to be phased out after some time . up to 90 percent of italy 's freeway system is in private hands , though promised improvement and extensions to the freeways have so far not taken place . dw staff -lrb- atz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press review : private autobahns ?

continuing its crackdown on nicotine addiction , the european union may seek a europe-wide ban on smoking in bars and restaurants . a top european official said the eu commission is considering a ban on smoking in bars and restaurants . “ it ’ s a question of whether or not we want to institute smoke free workplaces and that would include jobs in bars and restaurants , ” david byrne , the eu commissioner for health and consumer protection , told germany ’ s die welt newspaper on thursday . the brussels-based commission is currently considering whether to mandate the smoking ban europe-wide , or give each state the freedom to decide whether , and to what extent , to ban smoking in public . photos of disease bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large written warnings on cigarette packs have been mandatory üin the eu since last october .
currently in its effort to reduce smoking in the eu , the commission is compiling a databank with photographs of smoking-related illnesses aimed at frightening potential smokers away from tobacco .
eu countries could then mandate the use of these photos in addition to the written warning labels that have been required on european cigarette packages since the end of january . the member states would then decide if they want to use the photos , ” byrne told the newspaper .
the eu has accused germany of taking too soft a stance on smoking in public .
commissioner byrne has criticized the government for taking an " easygoing " stance to smoking , considering that an estimated 100,000 germans die of smoking-related diseases every year .
moreover , the eu commission , which launched an anti-smoking campaign last year called " feel free to say no , " has accused berlin of trying to block a comprehensive world-wide anti-smoking initiative by the world health organization , which is already supported by over 190 countries .
in the past years , germany has also come out strongly against an eu initiative to ban cigarette advertising across europe .
germans keep on smoking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : next to spain and greece , germany has the highest rate of smokers in europe .
statistics collected by the federal health ministry also show that while smoking is on the decline in the rest of europe , germany ’ s number of smokers has remained relatively constant .
even more alarming , the starting age for first-time smokers is dropping .
as of 2003 , every third ninth grader smoked .
across the rest of europe , however , enjoying a cigarette is becoming increasingly difficult as governments consider implementing anti-smoking legislation .
in the netherlands , a strict series of smoking laws went into effect on jan .
1 , 2004 , making it virtually impossible for workers to take cigarette breaks .
under the law , smoking is banned in areas such as stairs , hallways , conference rooms , cafeterias and toilets .
sweden has already passed a tough anti-smoking law that will go into effect in 2005 , and ireland is also on the verge of passing a ban similar to the one in the netherlands .
great britain is deliberating a crackdown on smoking in public spaces , but after a heated round of debate from the country ’ s pub owners , the government has decided to postpone any decision until later in 2004 . dw staff -lrb- ja -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a law to help kick the habit in the netherlands , smokers will get some added encouragement to kick the habit with strict new anti-smoking laws .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.01.2004 eu commissioner urges turkey to push forward on reforms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey and the eu - soon to be under one flag ?
the eu ’ s chief executive said turkey must continue implementing political and legal reforms if it hopes to be admitted into the european bloc , said romano prodi . as the first eu commission president to visit turkey in 40 years , prodi was set up for a historic showing even before he arrived .
but once the head of the eu 's executive wing began to speak about ankara ’ s chances for gaining admittance in the soon-to-be 25-member bloc , he sounded repetitive .
" my main message is to continue along the path of reforms because impressive progress has been achieved .
the country is now closer to the union , " prodi told a news conference after talks with prime minister recep tayyip erdogan .
in the past two years , turkey has carried out sweeping reforms as it tries to meet brussels standards for accession .
it abolished the death penalty and granted greater cultural rights to kurds , even though they are not recognized as an official minority .
ankara also claims it has cleaned up its poor human rights record , especially the notorious treatment of its political dissidents , although international human rights watchdogs frequently question the claim .
eyes set on brussels turkey has been eyeing entry in the eu for some time and has turned up its lobbying a notch since the union approved membership for 10 eastern european and mediterranean countries .
it now hopes eu leaders will agree to open the long-awaited membership talks when they meet to discuss expansion in december 2004 .
a definite agreement would have been a welcome gesture and have given prodi ’ s visit the historic dimension many turks hoped to see .
but the commission chief declined to set a specific date for commencing the talks .
turkey has been an eu candidate since 1999 , but it is the only country among 13 not to have begun accession talks with brussels .
ankara argues that it has fulfilled all the political criteria and has earned the right to open the membership talks by the end of the year .
in october , the commission must prepare a report for eu leaders on whether turkey meets the standards of democracy and market economy laid down for potential candidates .
at that time , prodi said the commission would at that time take a " look at the question of implementation of legislation on the ground . "
back in november the commission noted " significant progress " had been made , but cited several areas where more still needs to be done , including strengthening the independence of the judiciary and carrying out human rights reforms .

14 .
thousands of turkish cypriots , rallied in northern cyprus to call for the reunification of the divided island .
cyprus integral to eu membership although technically not a condition for starting membership talks , the commission has made it clear that finding a solution to cyprus is integral to aiding turkey ’ s bid for the eu .
the greek , southern part of the divided island will join the union in may 2004 .
the northern part of cyprus , recognized as an independent republic only by turkey itself , has not been approved .
brussels says the turkish cypriots living in the north will be denied entry in the union if a settlement is not struck in time .
a solution to cyprus " is not a precondition , " prodi said , " but this will be a big help . "
up to now turkey has rejected any link between the cyprus question and its own eu membership , but foreign minister abdullah gul admitted in a newspaper interview on thursday that failure to resolve the dispute could prove costly .
" we are running late for a solution .
our hand is weakening .
we can not get rid of a problem by postponing it .
this is where we are at in cyprus , " he said in comments published by the liberal radikal daily .

but getting rid of mandatory military service would also mean that the alternative , community service , would suffer as a result .
hospitals , senior citizen homes and youth centers would be understaffed , and many projects which rely on the 90,000 civil draftees for inexpensive labor would shut down .
already a reduction of the length of community service from 10 to nine months , as suggested by the government , would place a strain on the social system .
in a report released on thursday , family affairs minister renate schmidt referred to the potential crisis facing the country and called for allowing draftees to extend their civil service on a voluntary basis .
she also floated the idea of introducing a voluntary service for both men and women , which would last between three months and two years .
such a service - a first for germany - would include projects in the traditional social areas as well as in child care , environmental protection and immigration .
a mandatory service year as a replacement for conscription was , however , rejected , as the german constitution strictly prohibits this . dw-world.de germany set to abolish the draft young german men could soon be free of compulsory military service .

continuing its crackdown on nicotine addiction , the european union may seek a europe-wide ban on smoking in bars and restaurants . a top european official said the eu commission is considering a ban on smoking in bars and restaurants . “ it ’ s a question of whether or not we want to institute smoke free workplaces and that would include jobs in bars and restaurants , ” david byrne , the eu commissioner for health and consumer protection , told germany ’ s die welt newspaper on thursday . the brussels-based commission is currently considering whether to mandate the smoking ban europe-wide , or give each state the freedom to decide whether , and to what extent , to ban smoking in public . photos of disease bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large written warnings on cigarette packs have been mandatory üin the eu since last october .
currently in its effort to reduce smoking in the eu , the commission is compiling a databank with photographs of smoking-related illnesses aimed at frightening potential smokers away from tobacco .
eu countries could then mandate the use of these photos in addition to the written warning labels that have been required on european cigarette packages since the end of january . the member states would then decide if they want to use the photos , ” byrne told the newspaper .
the eu has accused germany of taking too soft a stance on smoking in public .
commissioner byrne has criticized the government for taking an " easygoing " stance to smoking , considering that an estimated 100,000 germans die of smoking-related diseases every year .
moreover , the eu commission , which launched an anti-smoking campaign last year called " feel free to say no , " has accused berlin of trying to block a comprehensive world-wide anti-smoking initiative by the world health organization , which is already supported by over 190 countries .
in the past years , germany has also come out strongly against an eu initiative to ban cigarette advertising across europe .
germans keep on smoking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : next to spain and greece , germany has the highest rate of smokers in europe .
statistics collected by the federal health ministry also show that while smoking is on the decline in the rest of europe , germany ’ s number of smokers has remained relatively constant .
even more alarming , the starting age for first-time smokers is dropping .
as of 2003 , every third ninth grader smoked .
across the rest of europe , however , enjoying a cigarette is becoming increasingly difficult as governments consider implementing anti-smoking legislation .
in the netherlands , a strict series of smoking laws went into effect on jan .
1 , 2004 , making it virtually impossible for workers to take cigarette breaks .
under the law , smoking is banned in areas such as stairs , hallways , conference rooms , cafeterias and toilets .
sweden has already passed a tough anti-smoking law that will go into effect in 2005 , and ireland is also on the verge of passing a ban similar to the one in the netherlands .
great britain is deliberating a crackdown on smoking in public spaces , but after a heated round of debate from the country ’ s pub owners , the government has decided to postpone any decision until later in 2004 . dw staff -lrb- ja -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a law to help kick the habit in the netherlands , smokers will get some added encouragement to kick the habit with strict new anti-smoking laws .

the economics minister 's comments on privatizing the autobahn has drawn a raft of criticism from politicians and experts with most unanimous that germans wo n't want to pay money to speed on their beloved freeway system . no one knows better than the economics minister how much money needs to be saved in order to right germany 's sinking economy . but wolfgang clement 's comments to an interviewer that a privatization of germany 's autobahn , already the case in france and italy , might help put the country back in the black has sparked criticism . " the autobahn in germany is already paid by taxpayers , " says maximillian maurer , of germany 's car drivers ' association adac .
" the government ca n't privatize what already belongs to the taxpayers . " no toll roads above all , driver 's associations and the country 's transportation minister fear privatization of germany 's storied motorway might mean drivers have to begin paying tolls .
critics say that would lead to a re-direction of traffic to smaller streets and roads that pass through towns , causing traffic problems and chaos for residents .
others say setting up a toll system would be too complicated and would scare away companies . construction companies greeted clement 's comments , saying that the taxpayer-financed autobahn was a thing of the past . " we think of it as a worthy option , " heiko stiepelmann , of the association of the german construction industry told the business daily handelsblatt .
" given the budget and debt situation , germany can no longer afford a taxpayer-financed autobahn . " politicians , even in clement 's own social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , have called his comments rash and " shot from the hip . " " there have been no thoughts about a privatization of the autobahn or a toll , " transportation minister manfred stolpe spelled out for reporters in berlin . more than 1 billion spent each year so far , clement 's thoughts have n't gone beyond the drafting table , and he 's kept quiet since his comments in wednesday 's edition of the berliner zeitung . that means the federal government will continue to shovel out the approximately 1.2 billion euros needed annually to maintain the 12,000 kilometer -lrb- 7,400 mile -rrb- -long autobahn network .
any one who 's driven the highways in the former east - or even in heavily traveled sections of the west - knows that 's not enough .
new roads cost extra . france privatized its national freeway system in the 1950s , when it was only 80-km long .
today , the system is 10,000 kilometers bigger and the government has continued a toll system that was supposed to be phased out after some time . up to 90 percent of italy 's freeway system is in private hands , though promised improvement and extensions to the freeways have so far not taken place . dw staff -lrb- atz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press review : private autobahns ?

already a reduction of the length of community service from 10 to nine months , as suggested by the government , would place a strain on the social system .
in a report released on thursday , family affairs minister renate schmidt referred to the potential crisis facing the country and called for allowing draftees to extend their civil service on a voluntary basis .
she also floated the idea of introducing a voluntary service for both men and women , which would last between three months and two years .
such a service - a first for germany - would include projects in the traditional social areas as well as in child care , environmental protection and immigration .
a mandatory service year as a replacement for conscription was , however , rejected , as the german constitution strictly prohibits this . dw-world.de germany set to abolish the draft young german men could soon be free of compulsory military service .
but abolishing the draft may pose a serious problem for the social system , which depends on those men that opt for the alternative - community service -lrb- jan , 12 , 2004 -rrb- more briefs 14.01.2004 -pipe- amnesty accuses german police of excessive force 14.01.2004 -pipe- transport minister opposes highway privatization 14.01.2004 -pipe- german and polish foreign ministers meet to mend fences 14.01.2004 -pipe- luftwaffe to retire 500 war planes 13.01.2004 -pipe- world cup 2006 to open in munich 13.01.2004 -pipe- minister rethinks moving federal police 13.01.2004 -pipe- civil servants to work longer 12.01.2004 -pipe- no more ‘ made in germany ’ labels ? 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the economics minister 's comments on privatizing the autobahn has drawn a raft of criticism from politicians and experts with most unanimous that germans wo n't want to pay money to speed on their beloved freeway system . no one knows better than the economics minister how much money needs to be saved in order to right germany 's sinking economy . but wolfgang clement 's comments to an interviewer that a privatization of germany 's autobahn , already the case in france and italy , might help put the country back in the black has sparked criticism . " the autobahn in germany is already paid by taxpayers , " says maximillian maurer , of germany 's car drivers ' association adac .
" the government ca n't privatize what already belongs to the taxpayers . " no toll roads above all , driver 's associations and the country 's transportation minister fear privatization of germany 's storied motorway might mean drivers have to begin paying tolls .
critics say that would lead to a re-direction of traffic to smaller streets and roads that pass through towns , causing traffic problems and chaos for residents .
others say setting up a toll system would be too complicated and would scare away companies . construction companies greeted clement 's comments , saying that the taxpayer-financed autobahn was a thing of the past . " we think of it as a worthy option , " heiko stiepelmann , of the association of the german construction industry told the business daily handelsblatt .
" given the budget and debt situation , germany can no longer afford a taxpayer-financed autobahn . " politicians , even in clement 's own social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , have called his comments rash and " shot from the hip . " " there have been no thoughts about a privatization of the autobahn or a toll , " transportation minister manfred stolpe spelled out for reporters in berlin . more than 1 billion spent each year so far , clement 's thoughts have n't gone beyond the drafting table , and he 's kept quiet since his comments in wednesday 's edition of the berliner zeitung . that means the federal government will continue to shovel out the approximately 1.2 billion euros needed annually to maintain the 12,000 kilometer -lrb- 7,400 mile -rrb- -long autobahn network .
any one who 's driven the highways in the former east - or even in heavily traveled sections of the west - knows that 's not enough .
new roads cost extra . france privatized its national freeway system in the 1950s , when it was only 80-km long .
today , the system is 10,000 kilometers bigger and the government has continued a toll system that was supposed to be phased out after some time . up to 90 percent of italy 's freeway system is in private hands , though promised improvement and extensions to the freeways have so far not taken place . dw staff -lrb- atz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press review : private autobahns ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 15.01.2004 brewery unveils ‘ anti-aging ’ beer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bottoms up for good health mixing malt with ingredients best-known by day spa and health food store-goers , a small brewery in eastern germany is seeking to create a healthy new reputation for the country ’ s traditional drink . beer is generally a drink associated with expanding bellies and a turbo-charged aging process .
it 's long been a forbidden word for health-conscious drinkers , playing a very distant second to wine .
but a brewery in the eastern german state of brandenburg is hoping to change that with a new beer that claims to provide a fountain of youth for its drinkers . and that could bring a sigh of relief for suds lovers with a mind for their body .
klosterbrauerei neuzelle in the small town of neuzelle on the german-polish border will this week unveil a new " anti-aging beer " that combines tasty malt with some wellness world favorites , including the wonder algae spirulina .
the brewery ’ s ceo , helmut fritsche , plans to introduce the new brew at this week ’ s green week food industry fair in berlin and hopes to place it on store shelves by march .
" when people drink beer , why shouldn ’ t they be able to drink a healthy beer , " fritsche recently told the märkische oderzeitung newspaper .
a bottle a day keeps cancer away ?
the brew ’ s main ingredients are thermal brine water from the nearby health resort bad saarow , as well as spirulina , an algae , and flavonoide , a plant extract commonly used in anti-wrinkle creams .
flavonoides are also known to protect against arteriosclerosis , high blood pressure and cancer .
spirulina , with more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bottle keeps cancer away ? than 100 nutrients including beta carotene , chlorophyll , vitamin b12 , has been described as one of the healthiest foods .
meanwhile , brine water aids in digestion and maintaining metabolism and healthy blood pressure as well as helping the body rid itself of heavy metals and toxins like quicksilver , lead , arsenic , amalgam or even chalk build-up .
but it is still beer , and too much of it could undo the fountain of youth effect and , worse , bring on a nasty hangover .
fritsche warns that moderation is essential when drinking his " anti-aging " beer .
after all , each bottle does contain 4.8 percent alcohol .
trouble in wellness land the drink 's alcohol level is n't the only problem fritsche faces in convincing potential beer buyers .
because the sudsy mix doesn ’ t jibe with the german purity law of 1516 , the company won ’ t be able to sell it as beer in this country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hops , malt , yeast and water are the only beer ingredients allowed under germany 's purity law .
the purity law , first created to protect the reputation and quality of the german beer market , is one of the world ’ s oldest food regulations .
the law holds that beverages labeled " beer " may only contain hops , malt , yeast and water .
" i ’ ve applied for a special permit to be able to call ‘ anti-aging beer ’ a beer , " fritsche told the paper .
if his application is rejected , he is threatening to take his case to court – even as far as germany ’ s highest court if he has to .
fritsche has a colorful history of challenging germany ’ s beer purity laws .
he is currently battling in an administrative court in frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- over whether or not he should be given the right to apply the beer label to a dark beer his klosterbrauerei brews with sugar – a taboo ingredient under the ancient purity law .
fritsche , whose brewery also offers a cherry-flavored beer , has argued that his concoction should be exempted as a regional specialty .
but what about fritsche ’ s anti-aging elixir ?
the malty tasting drink contains none of the chemicals the purity law seeks to keep out of the bottle .
and , he believes , good health and naturalness should be given deference over a regulation written back in the middle ages . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's favorite beverage : beer from flensburg in the north to munich in the south , beer is germany ’ s favorite drink .

to the opposition conservatives in germany ’ s lower chamber of parliament , the bundestag , graffiti is nothing less than a crime that needs a tough punishment .
every year sprayers destroy some 200 to 250 million euros worth of property .
it is estimated that in berlin alone 3,000 to 4,000 sprayers are active , many of whom are also involved in organized crime and drugs .
a joint proposal put forth on thursday by the christian democrat union , the christian social union and the free democrats calls for imposing tougher penalties than the fines and three years imprisonment currently on the books .
but the social democrats and greens argue that changing the law is simply " symbolic politics " and does nothing to change reality , which is that nationwide only about 30 percent of sprayers are actually apprehended .
" it is not the punishment that deters sprayers , but rather the risk of being caught , " said spd politician michael hartmann , who wants to see more effort put into catching the violators . more briefs 15.01.2004 -pipe- germany considers introducing volunteer service 14.01.2004 -pipe- amnesty accuses german police of excessive force 14.01.2004 -pipe- transport minister opposes highway privatization 14.01.2004 -pipe- german and polish foreign ministers meet to mend fences 14.01.2004 -pipe- luftwaffe to retire 500 war planes 13.01.2004 -pipe- world cup 2006 to open in munich 13.01.2004 -pipe- minister rethinks moving federal police 13.01.2004 -pipe- civil servants to work longer 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the economics minister 's comments on privatizing the autobahn has drawn a raft of criticism from politicians and experts with most unanimous that germans wo n't want to pay money to speed on their beloved freeway system . no one knows better than the economics minister how much money needs to be saved in order to right germany 's sinking economy . but wolfgang clement 's comments to an interviewer that a privatization of germany 's autobahn , already the case in france and italy , might help put the country back in the black has sparked criticism .

" the government ca n't privatize what already belongs to the taxpayers . " no toll roads above all , driver 's associations and the country 's transportation minister fear privatization of germany 's storied motorway might mean drivers have to begin paying tolls .
critics say that would lead to a re-direction of traffic to smaller streets and roads that pass through towns , causing traffic problems and chaos for residents .
others say setting up a toll system would be too complicated and would scare away companies . construction companies greeted clement 's comments , saying that the taxpayer-financed autobahn was a thing of the past . " we think of it as a worthy option , " heiko stiepelmann , of the association of the german construction industry told the business daily handelsblatt .

the eu ’ s chief executive said turkey must continue implementing political and legal reforms if it hopes to be admitted into the european bloc , said romano prodi . as the first eu commission president to visit turkey in 40 years , prodi was set up for a historic showing even before he arrived .
but once the head of the eu 's executive wing began to speak about ankara ’ s chances for gaining admittance in the soon-to-be 25-member bloc , he sounded repetitive .
" my main message is to continue along the path of reforms because impressive progress has been achieved .
the country is now closer to the union , " prodi told a news conference after talks with prime minister recep tayyip erdogan .
in the past two years , turkey has carried out sweeping reforms as it tries to meet brussels standards for accession .
it abolished the death penalty and granted greater cultural rights to kurds , even though they are not recognized as an official minority .
ankara also claims it has cleaned up its poor human rights record , especially the notorious treatment of its political dissidents , although international human rights watchdogs frequently question the claim .
eyes set on brussels turkey has been eyeing entry in the eu for some time and has turned up its lobbying a notch since the union approved membership for 10 eastern european and mediterranean countries .
it now hopes eu leaders will agree to open the long-awaited membership talks when they meet to discuss expansion in december 2004 .
a definite agreement would have been a welcome gesture and have given prodi ’ s visit the historic dimension many turks hoped to see .
but the commission chief declined to set a specific date for commencing the talks .
turkey has been an eu candidate since 1999 , but it is the only country among 13 not to have begun accession talks with brussels .
ankara argues that it has fulfilled all the political criteria and has earned the right to open the membership talks by the end of the year .
in october , the commission must prepare a report for eu leaders on whether turkey meets the standards of democracy and market economy laid down for potential candidates .
at that time , prodi said the commission would at that time take a " look at the question of implementation of legislation on the ground . "
back in november the commission noted " significant progress " had been made , but cited several areas where more still needs to be done , including strengthening the independence of the judiciary and carrying out human rights reforms .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 15.01.2004 brewery unveils ‘ anti-aging ’ beer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bottoms up for good health mixing malt with ingredients best-known by day spa and health food store-goers , a small brewery in eastern germany is seeking to create a healthy new reputation for the country ’ s traditional drink . beer is generally a drink associated with expanding bellies and a turbo-charged aging process .
it 's long been a forbidden word for health-conscious drinkers , playing a very distant second to wine .
but a brewery in the eastern german state of brandenburg is hoping to change that with a new beer that claims to provide a fountain of youth for its drinkers . and that could bring a sigh of relief for suds lovers with a mind for their body .
klosterbrauerei neuzelle in the small town of neuzelle on the german-polish border will this week unveil a new " anti-aging beer " that combines tasty malt with some wellness world favorites , including the wonder algae spirulina .
the brewery ’ s ceo , helmut fritsche , plans to introduce the new brew at this week ’ s green week food industry fair in berlin and hopes to place it on store shelves by march .
" when people drink beer , why shouldn ’ t they be able to drink a healthy beer , " fritsche recently told the märkische oderzeitung newspaper .
a bottle a day keeps cancer away ?
the brew ’ s main ingredients are thermal brine water from the nearby health resort bad saarow , as well as spirulina , an algae , and flavonoide , a plant extract commonly used in anti-wrinkle creams .
flavonoides are also known to protect against arteriosclerosis , high blood pressure and cancer .
spirulina , with more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bottle keeps cancer away ? than 100 nutrients including beta carotene , chlorophyll , vitamin b12 , has been described as one of the healthiest foods .
meanwhile , brine water aids in digestion and maintaining metabolism and healthy blood pressure as well as helping the body rid itself of heavy metals and toxins like quicksilver , lead , arsenic , amalgam or even chalk build-up .
but it is still beer , and too much of it could undo the fountain of youth effect and , worse , bring on a nasty hangover .
fritsche warns that moderation is essential when drinking his " anti-aging " beer .
after all , each bottle does contain 4.8 percent alcohol .
trouble in wellness land the drink 's alcohol level is n't the only problem fritsche faces in convincing potential beer buyers .
because the sudsy mix doesn ’ t jibe with the german purity law of 1516 , the company won ’ t be able to sell it as beer in this country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hops , malt , yeast and water are the only beer ingredients allowed under germany 's purity law .
the purity law , first created to protect the reputation and quality of the german beer market , is one of the world ’ s oldest food regulations .
the law holds that beverages labeled " beer " may only contain hops , malt , yeast and water .
" i ’ ve applied for a special permit to be able to call ‘ anti-aging beer ’ a beer , " fritsche told the paper .
if his application is rejected , he is threatening to take his case to court – even as far as germany ’ s highest court if he has to .
fritsche has a colorful history of challenging germany ’ s beer purity laws .
he is currently battling in an administrative court in frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- over whether or not he should be given the right to apply the beer label to a dark beer his klosterbrauerei brews with sugar – a taboo ingredient under the ancient purity law .
fritsche , whose brewery also offers a cherry-flavored beer , has argued that his concoction should be exempted as a regional specialty .
but what about fritsche ’ s anti-aging elixir ?
the malty tasting drink contains none of the chemicals the purity law seeks to keep out of the bottle .
and , he believes , good health and naturalness should be given deference over a regulation written back in the middle ages . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's favorite beverage : beer from flensburg in the north to munich in the south , beer is germany ’ s favorite drink .

continuing its crackdown on nicotine addiction , the european union may seek a europe-wide ban on smoking in bars and restaurants . a top european official said the eu commission is considering a ban on smoking in bars and restaurants . “ it ’ s a question of whether or not we want to institute smoke free workplaces and that would include jobs in bars and restaurants , ” david byrne , the eu commissioner for health and consumer protection , told germany ’ s die welt newspaper on thursday . the brussels-based commission is currently considering whether to mandate the smoking ban europe-wide , or give each state the freedom to decide whether , and to what extent , to ban smoking in public . photos of disease bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large written warnings on cigarette packs have been mandatory üin the eu since last october .
currently in its effort to reduce smoking in the eu , the commission is compiling a databank with photographs of smoking-related illnesses aimed at frightening potential smokers away from tobacco .
eu countries could then mandate the use of these photos in addition to the written warning labels that have been required on european cigarette packages since the end of january . the member states would then decide if they want to use the photos , ” byrne told the newspaper .
the eu has accused germany of taking too soft a stance on smoking in public .
commissioner byrne has criticized the government for taking an " easygoing " stance to smoking , considering that an estimated 100,000 germans die of smoking-related diseases every year .
moreover , the eu commission , which launched an anti-smoking campaign last year called " feel free to say no , " has accused berlin of trying to block a comprehensive world-wide anti-smoking initiative by the world health organization , which is already supported by over 190 countries .
in the past years , germany has also come out strongly against an eu initiative to ban cigarette advertising across europe .
germans keep on smoking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : next to spain and greece , germany has the highest rate of smokers in europe .
statistics collected by the federal health ministry also show that while smoking is on the decline in the rest of europe , germany ’ s number of smokers has remained relatively constant .
even more alarming , the starting age for first-time smokers is dropping .
as of 2003 , every third ninth grader smoked .
across the rest of europe , however , enjoying a cigarette is becoming increasingly difficult as governments consider implementing anti-smoking legislation .
in the netherlands , a strict series of smoking laws went into effect on jan .
1 , 2004 , making it virtually impossible for workers to take cigarette breaks .
under the law , smoking is banned in areas such as stairs , hallways , conference rooms , cafeterias and toilets .
sweden has already passed a tough anti-smoking law that will go into effect in 2005 , and ireland is also on the verge of passing a ban similar to the one in the netherlands .
great britain is deliberating a crackdown on smoking in public spaces , but after a heated round of debate from the country ’ s pub owners , the government has decided to postpone any decision until later in 2004 . dw staff -lrb- ja -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a law to help kick the habit in the netherlands , smokers will get some added encouragement to kick the habit with strict new anti-smoking laws .

the eu ’ s chief executive said turkey must continue implementing political and legal reforms if it hopes to be admitted into the european bloc , said romano prodi . as the first eu commission president to visit turkey in 40 years , prodi was set up for a historic showing even before he arrived .
but once the head of the eu 's executive wing began to speak about ankara ’ s chances for gaining admittance in the soon-to-be 25-member bloc , he sounded repetitive .
" my main message is to continue along the path of reforms because impressive progress has been achieved .
the country is now closer to the union , " prodi told a news conference after talks with prime minister recep tayyip erdogan .
in the past two years , turkey has carried out sweeping reforms as it tries to meet brussels standards for accession .
it abolished the death penalty and granted greater cultural rights to kurds , even though they are not recognized as an official minority .
ankara also claims it has cleaned up its poor human rights record , especially the notorious treatment of its political dissidents , although international human rights watchdogs frequently question the claim .
eyes set on brussels turkey has been eyeing entry in the eu for some time and has turned up its lobbying a notch since the union approved membership for 10 eastern european and mediterranean countries .
it now hopes eu leaders will agree to open the long-awaited membership talks when they meet to discuss expansion in december 2004 .
a definite agreement would have been a welcome gesture and have given prodi ’ s visit the historic dimension many turks hoped to see .
but the commission chief declined to set a specific date for commencing the talks .
turkey has been an eu candidate since 1999 , but it is the only country among 13 not to have begun accession talks with brussels .
ankara argues that it has fulfilled all the political criteria and has earned the right to open the membership talks by the end of the year .
in october , the commission must prepare a report for eu leaders on whether turkey meets the standards of democracy and market economy laid down for potential candidates .
at that time , prodi said the commission would at that time take a " look at the question of implementation of legislation on the ground . "
back in november the commission noted " significant progress " had been made , but cited several areas where more still needs to be done , including strengthening the independence of the judiciary and carrying out human rights reforms .

thousands of turkish cypriots , rallied in northern cyprus to call for the reunification of the divided island .
cyprus integral to eu membership although technically not a condition for starting membership talks , the commission has made it clear that finding a solution to cyprus is integral to aiding turkey ’ s bid for the eu .
the greek , southern part of the divided island will join the union in may 2004 .
the northern part of cyprus , recognized as an independent republic only by turkey itself , has not been approved .
brussels says the turkish cypriots living in the north will be denied entry in the union if a settlement is not struck in time .
a solution to cyprus " is not a precondition , " prodi said , " but this will be a big help . "
up to now turkey has rejected any link between the cyprus question and its own eu membership , but foreign minister abdullah gul admitted in a newspaper interview on thursday that failure to resolve the dispute could prove costly .
" we are running late for a solution .
our hand is weakening .
we can not get rid of a problem by postponing it .
this is where we are at in cyprus , " he said in comments published by the liberal radikal daily .

ankara also claims it has cleaned up its poor human rights record , especially the notorious treatment of its political dissidents , although international human rights watchdogs frequently question the claim .
eyes set on brussels turkey has been eyeing entry in the eu for some time and has turned up its lobbying a notch since the union approved membership for 10 eastern european and mediterranean countries .
it now hopes eu leaders will agree to open the long-awaited membership talks when they meet to discuss expansion in december 2004 .
a definite agreement would have been a welcome gesture and have given prodi ’ s visit the historic dimension many turks hoped to see .
but the commission chief declined to set a specific date for commencing the talks .
turkey has been an eu candidate since 1999 , but it is the only country among 13 not to have begun accession talks with brussels .
ankara argues that it has fulfilled all the political criteria and has earned the right to open the membership talks by the end of the year .
in october , the commission must prepare a report for eu leaders on whether turkey meets the standards of democracy and market economy laid down for potential candidates .
at that time , prodi said the commission would at that time take a " look at the question of implementation of legislation on the ground . "
back in november the commission noted " significant progress " had been made , but cited several areas where more still needs to be done , including strengthening the independence of the judiciary and carrying out human rights reforms .

continuing its crackdown on nicotine addiction , the european union may seek a europe-wide ban on smoking in bars and restaurants . a top european official said the eu commission is considering a ban on smoking in bars and restaurants . “ it ’ s a question of whether or not we want to institute smoke free workplaces and that would include jobs in bars and restaurants , ” david byrne , the eu commissioner for health and consumer protection , told germany ’ s die welt newspaper on thursday . the brussels-based commission is currently considering whether to mandate the smoking ban europe-wide , or give each state the freedom to decide whether , and to what extent , to ban smoking in public . photos of disease bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large written warnings on cigarette packs have been mandatory üin the eu since last october .
currently in its effort to reduce smoking in the eu , the commission is compiling a databank with photographs of smoking-related illnesses aimed at frightening potential smokers away from tobacco .
eu countries could then mandate the use of these photos in addition to the written warning labels that have been required on european cigarette packages since the end of january . the member states would then decide if they want to use the photos , ” byrne told the newspaper .
the eu has accused germany of taking too soft a stance on smoking in public .
commissioner byrne has criticized the government for taking an " easygoing " stance to smoking , considering that an estimated 100,000 germans die of smoking-related diseases every year .
moreover , the eu commission , which launched an anti-smoking campaign last year called " feel free to say no , " has accused berlin of trying to block a comprehensive world-wide anti-smoking initiative by the world health organization , which is already supported by over 190 countries .
in the past years , germany has also come out strongly against an eu initiative to ban cigarette advertising across europe .
germans keep on smoking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : next to spain and greece , germany has the highest rate of smokers in europe .
statistics collected by the federal health ministry also show that while smoking is on the decline in the rest of europe , germany ’ s number of smokers has remained relatively constant .
even more alarming , the starting age for first-time smokers is dropping .
as of 2003 , every third ninth grader smoked .
across the rest of europe , however , enjoying a cigarette is becoming increasingly difficult as governments consider implementing anti-smoking legislation .
in the netherlands , a strict series of smoking laws went into effect on jan .
1 , 2004 , making it virtually impossible for workers to take cigarette breaks .
under the law , smoking is banned in areas such as stairs , hallways , conference rooms , cafeterias and toilets .
sweden has already passed a tough anti-smoking law that will go into effect in 2005 , and ireland is also on the verge of passing a ban similar to the one in the netherlands .
great britain is deliberating a crackdown on smoking in public spaces , but after a heated round of debate from the country ’ s pub owners , the government has decided to postpone any decision until later in 2004 . dw staff -lrb- ja -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a law to help kick the habit in the netherlands , smokers will get some added encouragement to kick the habit with strict new anti-smoking laws .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.01.2004 german press review : private autobahns ? many of germany ’ s papers on thursday commented on the proposal by german economics minister wolfgang clement to privatize the country ’ s autobahns . the nürnberger zeitung wondered how the message will be received by car drivers : the german taxpayer is starting to look paralyzed in view of the demands that are raining down on him and will no doubt accept yet another piece of bad news , the paper wrote .
germans are no longer aware of the fact that they once financed the autobahns , it said .
now the government , relying on taxpayers ’ contributions , will decide on the highways ’ further use with the greatest of ease , according to the daily .
neues deutschland in berlin asked : have you heard anything about “ super minister ” wolfgang clement lately ?
he is supposed to boost the economy and ensure more jobs are created , the paper noted .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.01.2004 -pipe- 13:00 utc germany considers introducing volunteer service earlier this week berlin ’ s red-green coalition government announced it would seriously consider abolishing the draft .
but getting rid of mandatory military service would also mean that the alternative , community service , would suffer as a result .
hospitals , senior citizen homes and youth centers would be understaffed , and many projects which rely on the 90,000 civil draftees for inexpensive labor would shut down .
already a reduction of the length of community service from 10 to nine months , as suggested by the government , would place a strain on the social system .
in a report released on thursday , family affairs minister renate schmidt referred to the potential crisis facing the country and called for allowing draftees to extend their civil service on a voluntary basis .
she also floated the idea of introducing a voluntary service for both men and women , which would last between three months and two years .
such a service - a first for germany - would include projects in the traditional social areas as well as in child care , environmental protection and immigration .
a mandatory service year as a replacement for conscription was , however , rejected , as the german constitution strictly prohibits this . dw-world.de germany set to abolish the draft young german men could soon be free of compulsory military service .
but abolishing the draft may pose a serious problem for the social system , which depends on those men that opt for the alternative - community service -lrb- jan , 12 , 2004 -rrb- more briefs 14.01.2004 -pipe- amnesty accuses german police of excessive force 14.01.2004 -pipe- transport minister opposes highway privatization 14.01.2004 -pipe- german and polish foreign ministers meet to mend fences 14.01.2004 -pipe- luftwaffe to retire 500 war planes 13.01.2004 -pipe- world cup 2006 to open in munich 13.01.2004 -pipe- minister rethinks moving federal police 13.01.2004 -pipe- civil servants to work longer 12.01.2004 -pipe- no more ‘ made in germany ’ labels ? 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

to the opposition conservatives in germany ’ s lower chamber of parliament , the bundestag , graffiti is nothing less than a crime that needs a tough punishment .

it is estimated that in berlin alone 3,000 to 4,000 sprayers are active , many of whom are also involved in organized crime and drugs .

but the social democrats and greens argue that changing the law is simply " symbolic politics " and does nothing to change reality , which is that nationwide only about 30 percent of sprayers are actually apprehended .

the economics minister 's comments on privatizing the autobahn has drawn a raft of criticism from politicians and experts with most unanimous that germans wo n't want to pay money to speed on their beloved freeway system . no one knows better than the economics minister how much money needs to be saved in order to right germany 's sinking economy . but wolfgang clement 's comments to an interviewer that a privatization of germany 's autobahn , already the case in france and italy , might help put the country back in the black has sparked criticism . " the autobahn in germany is already paid by taxpayers , " says maximillian maurer , of germany 's car drivers ' association adac .
" the government ca n't privatize what already belongs to the taxpayers . " no toll roads above all , driver 's associations and the country 's transportation minister fear privatization of germany 's storied motorway might mean drivers have to begin paying tolls .
critics say that would lead to a re-direction of traffic to smaller streets and roads that pass through towns , causing traffic problems and chaos for residents .
others say setting up a toll system would be too complicated and would scare away companies . construction companies greeted clement 's comments , saying that the taxpayer-financed autobahn was a thing of the past . " we think of it as a worthy option , " heiko stiepelmann , of the association of the german construction industry told the business daily handelsblatt .
" given the budget and debt situation , germany can no longer afford a taxpayer-financed autobahn . " politicians , even in clement 's own social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , have called his comments rash and " shot from the hip . " " there have been no thoughts about a privatization of the autobahn or a toll , " transportation minister manfred stolpe spelled out for reporters in berlin . more than 1 billion spent each year so far , clement 's thoughts have n't gone beyond the drafting table , and he 's kept quiet since his comments in wednesday 's edition of the berliner zeitung . that means the federal government will continue to shovel out the approximately 1.2 billion euros needed annually to maintain the 12,000 kilometer -lrb- 7,400 mile -rrb- -long autobahn network .

it 's long been a forbidden word for health-conscious drinkers , playing a very distant second to wine .
but a brewery in the eastern german state of brandenburg is hoping to change that with a new beer that claims to provide a fountain of youth for its drinkers . and that could bring a sigh of relief for suds lovers with a mind for their body .
klosterbrauerei neuzelle in the small town of neuzelle on the german-polish border will this week unveil a new " anti-aging beer " that combines tasty malt with some wellness world favorites , including the wonder algae spirulina .
the brewery ’ s ceo , helmut fritsche , plans to introduce the new brew at this week ’ s green week food industry fair in berlin and hopes to place it on store shelves by march .
" when people drink beer , why shouldn ’ t they be able to drink a healthy beer , " fritsche recently told the märkische oderzeitung newspaper .
a bottle a day keeps cancer away ?
the brew ’ s main ingredients are thermal brine water from the nearby health resort bad saarow , as well as spirulina , an algae , and flavonoide , a plant extract commonly used in anti-wrinkle creams .
flavonoides are also known to protect against arteriosclerosis , high blood pressure and cancer .
spirulina , with more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bottle keeps cancer away ? than 100 nutrients including beta carotene , chlorophyll , vitamin b12 , has been described as one of the healthiest foods .
meanwhile , brine water aids in digestion and maintaining metabolism and healthy blood pressure as well as helping the body rid itself of heavy metals and toxins like quicksilver , lead , arsenic , amalgam or even chalk build-up .
but it is still beer , and too much of it could undo the fountain of youth effect and , worse , bring on a nasty hangover .
fritsche warns that moderation is essential when drinking his " anti-aging " beer .
after all , each bottle does contain 4.8 percent alcohol .
trouble in wellness land the drink 's alcohol level is n't the only problem fritsche faces in convincing potential beer buyers .
because the sudsy mix doesn ’ t jibe with the german purity law of 1516 , the company won ’ t be able to sell it as beer in this country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hops , malt , yeast and water are the only beer ingredients allowed under germany 's purity law .
the purity law , first created to protect the reputation and quality of the german beer market , is one of the world ’ s oldest food regulations .
the law holds that beverages labeled " beer " may only contain hops , malt , yeast and water .
" i ’ ve applied for a special permit to be able to call ‘ anti-aging beer ’ a beer , " fritsche told the paper .
if his application is rejected , he is threatening to take his case to court – even as far as germany ’ s highest court if he has to .
fritsche has a colorful history of challenging germany ’ s beer purity laws .
he is currently battling in an administrative court in frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- over whether or not he should be given the right to apply the beer label to a dark beer his klosterbrauerei brews with sugar – a taboo ingredient under the ancient purity law .
fritsche , whose brewery also offers a cherry-flavored beer , has argued that his concoction should be exempted as a regional specialty .
but what about fritsche ’ s anti-aging elixir ?
the malty tasting drink contains none of the chemicals the purity law seeks to keep out of the bottle .
and , he believes , good health and naturalness should be given deference over a regulation written back in the middle ages . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's favorite beverage : beer from flensburg in the north to munich in the south , beer is germany ’ s favorite drink .

it 's long been a forbidden word for health-conscious drinkers , playing a very distant second to wine .
but a brewery in the eastern german state of brandenburg is hoping to change that with a new beer that claims to provide a fountain of youth for its drinkers . and that could bring a sigh of relief for suds lovers with a mind for their body .
klosterbrauerei neuzelle in the small town of neuzelle on the german-polish border will this week unveil a new " anti-aging beer " that combines tasty malt with some wellness world favorites , including the wonder algae spirulina .
the brewery ’ s ceo , helmut fritsche , plans to introduce the new brew at this week ’ s green week food industry fair in berlin and hopes to place it on store shelves by march .
" when people drink beer , why shouldn ’ t they be able to drink a healthy beer , " fritsche recently told the märkische oderzeitung newspaper .
a bottle a day keeps cancer away ?
the brew ’ s main ingredients are thermal brine water from the nearby health resort bad saarow , as well as spirulina , an algae , and flavonoide , a plant extract commonly used in anti-wrinkle creams .
flavonoides are also known to protect against arteriosclerosis , high blood pressure and cancer .
spirulina , with more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bottle keeps cancer away ? than 100 nutrients including beta carotene , chlorophyll , vitamin b12 , has been described as one of the healthiest foods .
meanwhile , brine water aids in digestion and maintaining metabolism and healthy blood pressure as well as helping the body rid itself of heavy metals and toxins like quicksilver , lead , arsenic , amalgam or even chalk build-up .
but it is still beer , and too much of it could undo the fountain of youth effect and , worse , bring on a nasty hangover .
fritsche warns that moderation is essential when drinking his " anti-aging " beer .
after all , each bottle does contain 4.8 percent alcohol .
trouble in wellness land the drink 's alcohol level is n't the only problem fritsche faces in convincing potential beer buyers .
because the sudsy mix doesn ’ t jibe with the german purity law of 1516 , the company won ’ t be able to sell it as beer in this country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hops , malt , yeast and water are the only beer ingredients allowed under germany 's purity law .
the purity law , first created to protect the reputation and quality of the german beer market , is one of the world ’ s oldest food regulations .
the law holds that beverages labeled " beer " may only contain hops , malt , yeast and water .
" i ’ ve applied for a special permit to be able to call ‘ anti-aging beer ’ a beer , " fritsche told the paper .
if his application is rejected , he is threatening to take his case to court – even as far as germany ’ s highest court if he has to .
fritsche has a colorful history of challenging germany ’ s beer purity laws .
he is currently battling in an administrative court in frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- over whether or not he should be given the right to apply the beer label to a dark beer his klosterbrauerei brews with sugar – a taboo ingredient under the ancient purity law .
fritsche , whose brewery also offers a cherry-flavored beer , has argued that his concoction should be exempted as a regional specialty .

military bases will be closed and troops will be cut back in an effort to save € 26 billion .
but the future of the country 's compulsory military conscription remains uncertain . german defense minister peter struck said tuesday that he will shut about 100 military bases and cut troop numbers in an effort to slash € 26 billion in military spending plans and make the armed forces more professional .
" tasks such as conflict prevention and crisis management , " struck said , " require fundamentally different armed forces .
they must be rapidly available and robust enough to carry out international missions together with our partners . “ struck made the announcement at a press conference , at which he also said that forces would be cut by about 35,000 troops in the coming years .
an additional 10,000 civilian posts are also on the cutting board .
the cuts would bring the number of troops down from today 's 285,000 to about 250,000 .
the army would then be divided into so-called intervention , stabilization and support troops .
in the future , 35,000 troops would be prepared for international missions , 70,000 for peace missions like those currently being undertaken in the balkans and afghanistan .
an additional 137,500 troops would be designated for support and 10,000 others could be flexibly deployed where needed by the bundeswehr 's general inspecter .
the union representing germany 's bundeswehr soldiers offered mixed reviews for the plan on tuesday .
" although we are not very enthusiastic about the spending cuts , " bernard gertz was quoted by deutsche welle , " we support the reforms in these times of increasingly stringent budget constraints .
it is quite acceptable to concentrate on the bundeswehr 's future tasks and abolish structures and equipment which are now obsolete . “ eurofighter contracts wo n't be canceled despite the cutbacks , struck said germany would not cancel its order for 180 eurofighter aircraft to be built by defense contractors including eads , britain ’ s bae systems and italy ’ s alenia .
the future of the draft , however , remains in question .
struck said he remains committed to the draft .
but that could change , depending on the outcome of the 2006 elections .
“ the draft will run out , so will the community service , ” said angelika beer , the co-head of the green party , in an interview with ard public television .
around 90,000 young germans are registered yearly for community service as an alternative to mandatory military service .
beer , whose party is part of the federal coaltion government with the social democrats , said she would like the draft to be phased out over the next three or four years .
hospitals depend on young workforce about 80 percent of those choosing community service end up working in hospitals or senior citizens ’ homes , doing essential work such as driving ambulances , caring for the disabled and elderly and delivering meals .
charitable organizations fear there would be severe consequences for the german healthcare system if this workforce were to disappear .
“ we ’ ll have to consider if the services these young people are doing can be totally abolished , ” joachim kendelbacher , from the workers ’ welfare organization , told deutsche welle . “ if these services are cut this definitely means a loss in quality . ”
all armed forces to be trimmed struck said all divisions of the armed forces - including naval , air and ground troops - will have to shoulder their share of the cuts .
his plan drew immediate criticism from conservative opposition leaders .
christian democrat defense issues spokesman christian schmidt said in interviews with german television that the basis for deciding on the military structure can not be “ how much we have in the bank . ”
rather , he said , it should be “ what we want to secure . ” dw staff with reporting by uwe hessler -lrb- so -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundeswehr cuts could hurt german defense industry defense minister peter struck 's announcement that some € 26 billion will be cut from the bundeswehr 's spending plans will hit the german arms industry hard .

14 , 2004 -rrb- germany set to abolish the draft young german men could soon be free of compulsory military service .
but abolishing the draft may pose a serious problem for the social system , which depends on those men that opt for the alternative - community service .

the eu ’ s chief executive said turkey must continue implementing political and legal reforms if it hopes to be admitted into the european bloc , said romano prodi . as the first eu commission president to visit turkey in 40 years , prodi was set up for a historic showing even before he arrived .
but once the head of the eu 's executive wing began to speak about ankara ’ s chances for gaining admittance in the soon-to-be 25-member bloc , he sounded repetitive .
" my main message is to continue along the path of reforms because impressive progress has been achieved .
the country is now closer to the union , " prodi told a news conference after talks with prime minister recep tayyip erdogan .
in the past two years , turkey has carried out sweeping reforms as it tries to meet brussels standards for accession .
it abolished the death penalty and granted greater cultural rights to kurds , even though they are not recognized as an official minority .
ankara also claims it has cleaned up its poor human rights record , especially the notorious treatment of its political dissidents , although international human rights watchdogs frequently question the claim .
eyes set on brussels turkey has been eyeing entry in the eu for some time and has turned up its lobbying a notch since the union approved membership for 10 eastern european and mediterranean countries .
it now hopes eu leaders will agree to open the long-awaited membership talks when they meet to discuss expansion in december 2004 .
a definite agreement would have been a welcome gesture and have given prodi ’ s visit the historic dimension many turks hoped to see .
but the commission chief declined to set a specific date for commencing the talks .
turkey has been an eu candidate since 1999 , but it is the only country among 13 not to have begun accession talks with brussels .
ankara argues that it has fulfilled all the political criteria and has earned the right to open the membership talks by the end of the year .
in october , the commission must prepare a report for eu leaders on whether turkey meets the standards of democracy and market economy laid down for potential candidates .
at that time , prodi said the commission would at that time take a " look at the question of implementation of legislation on the ground . "
back in november the commission noted " significant progress " had been made , but cited several areas where more still needs to be done , including strengthening the independence of the judiciary and carrying out human rights reforms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish cypriots wave eu flags during a demonstration in the turkish part of nicosia , cyprus , jan .
14 .
thousands of turkish cypriots , rallied in northern cyprus to call for the reunification of the divided island .
cyprus integral to eu membership although technically not a condition for starting membership talks , the commission has made it clear that finding a solution to cyprus is integral to aiding turkey ’ s bid for the eu .
the greek , southern part of the divided island will join the union in may 2004 .
the northern part of cyprus , recognized as an independent republic only by turkey itself , has not been approved .
brussels says the turkish cypriots living in the north will be denied entry in the union if a settlement is not struck in time .
a solution to cyprus " is not a precondition , " prodi said , " but this will be a big help . "
up to now turkey has rejected any link between the cyprus question and its own eu membership , but foreign minister abdullah gul admitted in a newspaper interview on thursday that failure to resolve the dispute could prove costly .
" we are running late for a solution .
our hand is weakening .
we can not get rid of a problem by postponing it .
this is where we are at in cyprus , " he said in comments published by the liberal radikal daily .

the eu ’ s chief executive said turkey must continue implementing political and legal reforms if it hopes to be admitted into the european bloc , said romano prodi . as the first eu commission president to visit turkey in 40 years , prodi was set up for a historic showing even before he arrived .
but once the head of the eu 's executive wing began to speak about ankara ’ s chances for gaining admittance in the soon-to-be 25-member bloc , he sounded repetitive .
" my main message is to continue along the path of reforms because impressive progress has been achieved .
the country is now closer to the union , " prodi told a news conference after talks with prime minister recep tayyip erdogan .
in the past two years , turkey has carried out sweeping reforms as it tries to meet brussels standards for accession .
it abolished the death penalty and granted greater cultural rights to kurds , even though they are not recognized as an official minority .
ankara also claims it has cleaned up its poor human rights record , especially the notorious treatment of its political dissidents , although international human rights watchdogs frequently question the claim .
eyes set on brussels turkey has been eyeing entry in the eu for some time and has turned up its lobbying a notch since the union approved membership for 10 eastern european and mediterranean countries .
it now hopes eu leaders will agree to open the long-awaited membership talks when they meet to discuss expansion in december 2004 .
a definite agreement would have been a welcome gesture and have given prodi ’ s visit the historic dimension many turks hoped to see .
but the commission chief declined to set a specific date for commencing the talks .
turkey has been an eu candidate since 1999 , but it is the only country among 13 not to have begun accession talks with brussels .
ankara argues that it has fulfilled all the political criteria and has earned the right to open the membership talks by the end of the year .
in october , the commission must prepare a report for eu leaders on whether turkey meets the standards of democracy and market economy laid down for potential candidates .
at that time , prodi said the commission would at that time take a " look at the question of implementation of legislation on the ground . "
back in november the commission noted " significant progress " had been made , but cited several areas where more still needs to be done , including strengthening the independence of the judiciary and carrying out human rights reforms .

the greek , southern part of the divided island will join the union in may 2004 .
the northern part of cyprus , recognized as an independent republic only by turkey itself , has not been approved .
brussels says the turkish cypriots living in the north will be denied entry in the union if a settlement is not struck in time .

continuing its crackdown on nicotine addiction , the european union may seek a europe-wide ban on smoking in bars and restaurants . a top european official said the eu commission is considering a ban on smoking in bars and restaurants . “ it ’ s a question of whether or not we want to institute smoke free workplaces and that would include jobs in bars and restaurants , ” david byrne , the eu commissioner for health and consumer protection , told germany ’ s die welt newspaper on thursday . the brussels-based commission is currently considering whether to mandate the smoking ban europe-wide , or give each state the freedom to decide whether , and to what extent , to ban smoking in public . photos of disease bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large written warnings on cigarette packs have been mandatory üin the eu since last october .
currently in its effort to reduce smoking in the eu , the commission is compiling a databank with photographs of smoking-related illnesses aimed at frightening potential smokers away from tobacco .
eu countries could then mandate the use of these photos in addition to the written warning labels that have been required on european cigarette packages since the end of january . the member states would then decide if they want to use the photos , ” byrne told the newspaper .
the eu has accused germany of taking too soft a stance on smoking in public .
commissioner byrne has criticized the government for taking an " easygoing " stance to smoking , considering that an estimated 100,000 germans die of smoking-related diseases every year .
moreover , the eu commission , which launched an anti-smoking campaign last year called " feel free to say no , " has accused berlin of trying to block a comprehensive world-wide anti-smoking initiative by the world health organization , which is already supported by over 190 countries .
in the past years , germany has also come out strongly against an eu initiative to ban cigarette advertising across europe .
germans keep on smoking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : next to spain and greece , germany has the highest rate of smokers in europe .
statistics collected by the federal health ministry also show that while smoking is on the decline in the rest of europe , germany ’ s number of smokers has remained relatively constant .
even more alarming , the starting age for first-time smokers is dropping .
as of 2003 , every third ninth grader smoked .
across the rest of europe , however , enjoying a cigarette is becoming increasingly difficult as governments consider implementing anti-smoking legislation .
in the netherlands , a strict series of smoking laws went into effect on jan .
1 , 2004 , making it virtually impossible for workers to take cigarette breaks .
under the law , smoking is banned in areas such as stairs , hallways , conference rooms , cafeterias and toilets .
sweden has already passed a tough anti-smoking law that will go into effect in 2005 , and ireland is also on the verge of passing a ban similar to the one in the netherlands .
great britain is deliberating a crackdown on smoking in public spaces , but after a heated round of debate from the country ’ s pub owners , the government has decided to postpone any decision until later in 2004 . dw staff -lrb- ja -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a law to help kick the habit in the netherlands , smokers will get some added encouragement to kick the habit with strict new anti-smoking laws .

it 's long been a forbidden word for health-conscious drinkers , playing a very distant second to wine .
but a brewery in the eastern german state of brandenburg is hoping to change that with a new beer that claims to provide a fountain of youth for its drinkers . and that could bring a sigh of relief for suds lovers with a mind for their body .
klosterbrauerei neuzelle in the small town of neuzelle on the german-polish border will this week unveil a new " anti-aging beer " that combines tasty malt with some wellness world favorites , including the wonder algae spirulina .
the brewery ’ s ceo , helmut fritsche , plans to introduce the new brew at this week ’ s green week food industry fair in berlin and hopes to place it on store shelves by march .
" when people drink beer , why shouldn ’ t they be able to drink a healthy beer , " fritsche recently told the märkische oderzeitung newspaper .
a bottle a day keeps cancer away ?
the brew ’ s main ingredients are thermal brine water from the nearby health resort bad saarow , as well as spirulina , an algae , and flavonoide , a plant extract commonly used in anti-wrinkle creams .
flavonoides are also known to protect against arteriosclerosis , high blood pressure and cancer .
spirulina , with more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bottle keeps cancer away ? than 100 nutrients including beta carotene , chlorophyll , vitamin b12 , has been described as one of the healthiest foods .
meanwhile , brine water aids in digestion and maintaining metabolism and healthy blood pressure as well as helping the body rid itself of heavy metals and toxins like quicksilver , lead , arsenic , amalgam or even chalk build-up .
but it is still beer , and too much of it could undo the fountain of youth effect and , worse , bring on a nasty hangover .
fritsche warns that moderation is essential when drinking his " anti-aging " beer .
after all , each bottle does contain 4.8 percent alcohol .
trouble in wellness land the drink 's alcohol level is n't the only problem fritsche faces in convincing potential beer buyers .
because the sudsy mix doesn ’ t jibe with the german purity law of 1516 , the company won ’ t be able to sell it as beer in this country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hops , malt , yeast and water are the only beer ingredients allowed under germany 's purity law .
the purity law , first created to protect the reputation and quality of the german beer market , is one of the world ’ s oldest food regulations .
the law holds that beverages labeled " beer " may only contain hops , malt , yeast and water .
" i ’ ve applied for a special permit to be able to call ‘ anti-aging beer ’ a beer , " fritsche told the paper .
if his application is rejected , he is threatening to take his case to court – even as far as germany ’ s highest court if he has to .
fritsche has a colorful history of challenging germany ’ s beer purity laws .
he is currently battling in an administrative court in frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- over whether or not he should be given the right to apply the beer label to a dark beer his klosterbrauerei brews with sugar – a taboo ingredient under the ancient purity law .
fritsche , whose brewery also offers a cherry-flavored beer , has argued that his concoction should be exempted as a regional specialty .
but what about fritsche ’ s anti-aging elixir ?
the malty tasting drink contains none of the chemicals the purity law seeks to keep out of the bottle .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 15.01.2004 brewery unveils ‘ anti-aging ’ beer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bottoms up for good health mixing malt with ingredients best-known by day spa and health food store-goers , a small brewery in eastern germany is seeking to create a healthy new reputation for the country ’ s traditional drink . beer is generally a drink associated with expanding bellies and a turbo-charged aging process .
it 's long been a forbidden word for health-conscious drinkers , playing a very distant second to wine .
but a brewery in the eastern german state of brandenburg is hoping to change that with a new beer that claims to provide a fountain of youth for its drinkers . and that could bring a sigh of relief for suds lovers with a mind for their body .
klosterbrauerei neuzelle in the small town of neuzelle on the german-polish border will this week unveil a new " anti-aging beer " that combines tasty malt with some wellness world favorites , including the wonder algae spirulina .
the brewery ’ s ceo , helmut fritsche , plans to introduce the new brew at this week ’ s green week food industry fair in berlin and hopes to place it on store shelves by march .
" when people drink beer , why shouldn ’ t they be able to drink a healthy beer , " fritsche recently told the märkische oderzeitung newspaper .
a bottle a day keeps cancer away ?
the brew ’ s main ingredients are thermal brine water from the nearby health resort bad saarow , as well as spirulina , an algae , and flavonoide , a plant extract commonly used in anti-wrinkle creams .
flavonoides are also known to protect against arteriosclerosis , high blood pressure and cancer .
spirulina , with more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bottle keeps cancer away ? than 100 nutrients including beta carotene , chlorophyll , vitamin b12 , has been described as one of the healthiest foods .
meanwhile , brine water aids in digestion and maintaining metabolism and healthy blood pressure as well as helping the body rid itself of heavy metals and toxins like quicksilver , lead , arsenic , amalgam or even chalk build-up .
but it is still beer , and too much of it could undo the fountain of youth effect and , worse , bring on a nasty hangover .
fritsche warns that moderation is essential when drinking his " anti-aging " beer .
after all , each bottle does contain 4.8 percent alcohol .
trouble in wellness land the drink 's alcohol level is n't the only problem fritsche faces in convincing potential beer buyers .
because the sudsy mix doesn ’ t jibe with the german purity law of 1516 , the company won ’ t be able to sell it as beer in this country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hops , malt , yeast and water are the only beer ingredients allowed under germany 's purity law .
the purity law , first created to protect the reputation and quality of the german beer market , is one of the world ’ s oldest food regulations .
the law holds that beverages labeled " beer " may only contain hops , malt , yeast and water .
" i ’ ve applied for a special permit to be able to call ‘ anti-aging beer ’ a beer , " fritsche told the paper .
if his application is rejected , he is threatening to take his case to court – even as far as germany ’ s highest court if he has to .
fritsche has a colorful history of challenging germany ’ s beer purity laws .
he is currently battling in an administrative court in frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- over whether or not he should be given the right to apply the beer label to a dark beer his klosterbrauerei brews with sugar – a taboo ingredient under the ancient purity law .
fritsche , whose brewery also offers a cherry-flavored beer , has argued that his concoction should be exempted as a regional specialty .
but what about fritsche ’ s anti-aging elixir ?
the malty tasting drink contains none of the chemicals the purity law seeks to keep out of the bottle .
and , he believes , good health and naturalness should be given deference over a regulation written back in the middle ages . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's favorite beverage : beer from flensburg in the north to munich in the south , beer is germany ’ s favorite drink .

but getting rid of mandatory military service would also mean that the alternative , community service , would suffer as a result .
hospitals , senior citizen homes and youth centers would be understaffed , and many projects which rely on the 90,000 civil draftees for inexpensive labor would shut down .
already a reduction of the length of community service from 10 to nine months , as suggested by the government , would place a strain on the social system .
in a report released on thursday , family affairs minister renate schmidt referred to the potential crisis facing the country and called for allowing draftees to extend their civil service on a voluntary basis .
she also floated the idea of introducing a voluntary service for both men and women , which would last between three months and two years .
such a service - a first for germany - would include projects in the traditional social areas as well as in child care , environmental protection and immigration .
a mandatory service year as a replacement for conscription was , however , rejected , as the german constitution strictly prohibits this . dw-world.de germany set to abolish the draft young german men could soon be free of compulsory military service .

military bases will be closed and troops will be cut back in an effort to save € 26 billion .
but the future of the country 's compulsory military conscription remains uncertain . german defense minister peter struck said tuesday that he will shut about 100 military bases and cut troop numbers in an effort to slash € 26 billion in military spending plans and make the armed forces more professional .
" tasks such as conflict prevention and crisis management , " struck said , " require fundamentally different armed forces .
they must be rapidly available and robust enough to carry out international missions together with our partners . “ struck made the announcement at a press conference , at which he also said that forces would be cut by about 35,000 troops in the coming years .
an additional 10,000 civilian posts are also on the cutting board .
the cuts would bring the number of troops down from today 's 285,000 to about 250,000 .
the army would then be divided into so-called intervention , stabilization and support troops .
in the future , 35,000 troops would be prepared for international missions , 70,000 for peace missions like those currently being undertaken in the balkans and afghanistan .
an additional 137,500 troops would be designated for support and 10,000 others could be flexibly deployed where needed by the bundeswehr 's general inspecter .
the union representing germany 's bundeswehr soldiers offered mixed reviews for the plan on tuesday .
" although we are not very enthusiastic about the spending cuts , " bernard gertz was quoted by deutsche welle , " we support the reforms in these times of increasingly stringent budget constraints .
it is quite acceptable to concentrate on the bundeswehr 's future tasks and abolish structures and equipment which are now obsolete . “ eurofighter contracts wo n't be canceled despite the cutbacks , struck said germany would not cancel its order for 180 eurofighter aircraft to be built by defense contractors including eads , britain ’ s bae systems and italy ’ s alenia .
the future of the draft , however , remains in question .
struck said he remains committed to the draft .
but that could change , depending on the outcome of the 2006 elections .
“ the draft will run out , so will the community service , ” said angelika beer , the co-head of the green party , in an interview with ard public television .
around 90,000 young germans are registered yearly for community service as an alternative to mandatory military service .
beer , whose party is part of the federal coaltion government with the social democrats , said she would like the draft to be phased out over the next three or four years .
hospitals depend on young workforce about 80 percent of those choosing community service end up working in hospitals or senior citizens ’ homes , doing essential work such as driving ambulances , caring for the disabled and elderly and delivering meals .
charitable organizations fear there would be severe consequences for the german healthcare system if this workforce were to disappear .
“ we ’ ll have to consider if the services these young people are doing can be totally abolished , ” joachim kendelbacher , from the workers ’ welfare organization , told deutsche welle . “ if these services are cut this definitely means a loss in quality . ”
all armed forces to be trimmed struck said all divisions of the armed forces - including naval , air and ground troops - will have to shoulder their share of the cuts .
his plan drew immediate criticism from conservative opposition leaders .
christian democrat defense issues spokesman christian schmidt said in interviews with german television that the basis for deciding on the military structure can not be “ how much we have in the bank . ”

struck said he remains committed to the draft .
but that could change , depending on the outcome of the 2006 elections .
“ the draft will run out , so will the community service , ” said angelika beer , the co-head of the green party , in an interview with ard public television .
around 90,000 young germans are registered yearly for community service as an alternative to mandatory military service .
beer , whose party is part of the federal coaltion government with the social democrats , said she would like the draft to be phased out over the next three or four years .
hospitals depend on young workforce about 80 percent of those choosing community service end up working in hospitals or senior citizens ’ homes , doing essential work such as driving ambulances , caring for the disabled and elderly and delivering meals .
charitable organizations fear there would be severe consequences for the german healthcare system if this workforce were to disappear .
“ we ’ ll have to consider if the services these young people are doing can be totally abolished , ” joachim kendelbacher , from the workers ’ welfare organization , told deutsche welle . “ if these services are cut this definitely means a loss in quality . ”
all armed forces to be trimmed struck said all divisions of the armed forces - including naval , air and ground troops - will have to shoulder their share of the cuts .
his plan drew immediate criticism from conservative opposition leaders .
christian democrat defense issues spokesman christian schmidt said in interviews with german television that the basis for deciding on the military structure can not be “ how much we have in the bank . ”
rather , he said , it should be “ what we want to secure . ” dw staff with reporting by uwe hessler -lrb- so -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundeswehr cuts could hurt german defense industry defense minister peter struck 's announcement that some € 26 billion will be cut from the bundeswehr 's spending plans will hit the german arms industry hard .

14 , 2004 -rrb- germany set to abolish the draft young german men could soon be free of compulsory military service .
but abolishing the draft may pose a serious problem for the social system , which depends on those men that opt for the alternative - community service .

germans are no longer aware of the fact that they once financed the autobahns , it said .
now the government , relying on taxpayers ’ contributions , will decide on the highways ’ further use with the greatest of ease , according to the daily .
neues deutschland in berlin asked : have you heard anything about “ super minister ” wolfgang clement lately ?
he is supposed to boost the economy and ensure more jobs are created , the paper noted .
but instead he has given some thought to transport and to whether the state-run autobahns should be privatized .
not unexpectedly , the daily continued , the motorists ’ lobby protested and clement immediately sought to appease , saying he had merely wanted to set people thinking .
he ‘ s achieved nothing , it said , but at least everyone ’ s talking about him again . the stuttgarter zeitung pointed out that transport minister manfred stolpe – suspecting what reactions clement ’ s proposal would trigger – immediately sought to play it down , saying there would not be a motorway toll for cars .
the paper cynically remarked that the transport minister ’ s word is absolutely credible – after all he ’ s been consoling the public for months because germany still hasn ’ t managed to introduce the scheduled autobahn toll for trucks . other german papers continue to comment on the ruling by italy ’ s constitutional court that the immunity law blocking prime minister silvio berlusconi ’ s bribery trial is unconstitutional .
the mannheimer morgen wrote that even a berlusconi is not above the law .
will he have to go to prison for corruption ?
for the time being , it continued , the judges have only taught the “ cavaliere ” a lesson , but it is doubtful whether the government chief will draw the right conclusions .
for berlusconi is immune to criticism , the daily said , and moves on the political stage as if he were suffering from paranoia .
because he thinks he is surrounded by traitors and has lost any sense of reality , he is suppressing the simple fact that he has caused the crisis in the country because of his dubious business dealings and his attempts to cover them up . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.01.2004 germany announces military cuts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister peter struck wants to make the armed forces more professional .
military bases will be closed and troops will be cut back in an effort to save € 26 billion .
but the future of the country 's compulsory military conscription remains uncertain . german defense minister peter struck said tuesday that he will shut about 100 military bases and cut troop numbers in an effort to slash € 26 billion in military spending plans and make the armed forces more professional .
" tasks such as conflict prevention and crisis management , " struck said , " require fundamentally different armed forces .
they must be rapidly available and robust enough to carry out international missions together with our partners . “ struck made the announcement at a press conference , at which he also said that forces would be cut by about 35,000 troops in the coming years .
an additional 10,000 civilian posts are also on the cutting board .
the cuts would bring the number of troops down from today 's 285,000 to about 250,000 .
the army would then be divided into so-called intervention , stabilization and support troops .
in the future , 35,000 troops would be prepared for international missions , 70,000 for peace missions like those currently being undertaken in the balkans and afghanistan .
an additional 137,500 troops would be designated for support and 10,000 others could be flexibly deployed where needed by the bundeswehr 's general inspecter .
the union representing germany 's bundeswehr soldiers offered mixed reviews for the plan on tuesday .
" although we are not very enthusiastic about the spending cuts , " bernard gertz was quoted by deutsche welle , " we support the reforms in these times of increasingly stringent budget constraints .
it is quite acceptable to concentrate on the bundeswehr 's future tasks and abolish structures and equipment which are now obsolete . “ eurofighter contracts wo n't be canceled despite the cutbacks , struck said germany would not cancel its order for 180 eurofighter aircraft to be built by defense contractors including eads , britain ’ s bae systems and italy ’ s alenia .
the future of the draft , however , remains in question .
struck said he remains committed to the draft .
but that could change , depending on the outcome of the 2006 elections .
“ the draft will run out , so will the community service , ” said angelika beer , the co-head of the green party , in an interview with ard public television .
around 90,000 young germans are registered yearly for community service as an alternative to mandatory military service .
beer , whose party is part of the federal coaltion government with the social democrats , said she would like the draft to be phased out over the next three or four years .
hospitals depend on young workforce about 80 percent of those choosing community service end up working in hospitals or senior citizens ’ homes , doing essential work such as driving ambulances , caring for the disabled and elderly and delivering meals .
charitable organizations fear there would be severe consequences for the german healthcare system if this workforce were to disappear .
“ we ’ ll have to consider if the services these young people are doing can be totally abolished , ” joachim kendelbacher , from the workers ’ welfare organization , told deutsche welle . “ if these services are cut this definitely means a loss in quality . ”
all armed forces to be trimmed struck said all divisions of the armed forces - including naval , air and ground troops - will have to shoulder their share of the cuts .
his plan drew immediate criticism from conservative opposition leaders .
christian democrat defense issues spokesman christian schmidt said in interviews with german television that the basis for deciding on the military structure can not be “ how much we have in the bank . ”
rather , he said , it should be “ what we want to secure . ” dw staff with reporting by uwe hessler -lrb- so -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundeswehr cuts could hurt german defense industry defense minister peter struck 's announcement that some € 26 billion will be cut from the bundeswehr 's spending plans will hit the german arms industry hard .

but abolishing the draft may pose a serious problem for the social system , which depends on those men that opt for the alternative - community service .

military bases will be closed and troops will be cut back in an effort to save € 26 billion .
but the future of the country 's compulsory military conscription remains uncertain . german defense minister peter struck said tuesday that he will shut about 100 military bases and cut troop numbers in an effort to slash € 26 billion in military spending plans and make the armed forces more professional .
" tasks such as conflict prevention and crisis management , " struck said , " require fundamentally different armed forces .
they must be rapidly available and robust enough to carry out international missions together with our partners . “ struck made the announcement at a press conference , at which he also said that forces would be cut by about 35,000 troops in the coming years .
an additional 10,000 civilian posts are also on the cutting board .
the cuts would bring the number of troops down from today 's 285,000 to about 250,000 .
the army would then be divided into so-called intervention , stabilization and support troops .
in the future , 35,000 troops would be prepared for international missions , 70,000 for peace missions like those currently being undertaken in the balkans and afghanistan .
an additional 137,500 troops would be designated for support and 10,000 others could be flexibly deployed where needed by the bundeswehr 's general inspecter .
the union representing germany 's bundeswehr soldiers offered mixed reviews for the plan on tuesday .
" although we are not very enthusiastic about the spending cuts , " bernard gertz was quoted by deutsche welle , " we support the reforms in these times of increasingly stringent budget constraints .
it is quite acceptable to concentrate on the bundeswehr 's future tasks and abolish structures and equipment which are now obsolete . “ eurofighter contracts wo n't be canceled despite the cutbacks , struck said germany would not cancel its order for 180 eurofighter aircraft to be built by defense contractors including eads , britain ’ s bae systems and italy ’ s alenia .
the future of the draft , however , remains in question .
struck said he remains committed to the draft .
but that could change , depending on the outcome of the 2006 elections .
“ the draft will run out , so will the community service , ” said angelika beer , the co-head of the green party , in an interview with ard public television .
around 90,000 young germans are registered yearly for community service as an alternative to mandatory military service .
beer , whose party is part of the federal coaltion government with the social democrats , said she would like the draft to be phased out over the next three or four years .
hospitals depend on young workforce about 80 percent of those choosing community service end up working in hospitals or senior citizens ’ homes , doing essential work such as driving ambulances , caring for the disabled and elderly and delivering meals .
charitable organizations fear there would be severe consequences for the german healthcare system if this workforce were to disappear .
“ we ’ ll have to consider if the services these young people are doing can be totally abolished , ” joachim kendelbacher , from the workers ’ welfare organization , told deutsche welle . “ if these services are cut this definitely means a loss in quality . ”
all armed forces to be trimmed struck said all divisions of the armed forces - including naval , air and ground troops - will have to shoulder their share of the cuts .
his plan drew immediate criticism from conservative opposition leaders .
christian democrat defense issues spokesman christian schmidt said in interviews with german television that the basis for deciding on the military structure can not be “ how much we have in the bank . ”

military bases will be closed and troops will be cut back in an effort to save € 26 billion .
but the future of the country 's compulsory military conscription remains uncertain . german defense minister peter struck said tuesday that he will shut about 100 military bases and cut troop numbers in an effort to slash € 26 billion in military spending plans and make the armed forces more professional .
" tasks such as conflict prevention and crisis management , " struck said , " require fundamentally different armed forces .
they must be rapidly available and robust enough to carry out international missions together with our partners . “ struck made the announcement at a press conference , at which he also said that forces would be cut by about 35,000 troops in the coming years .
an additional 10,000 civilian posts are also on the cutting board .
the cuts would bring the number of troops down from today 's 285,000 to about 250,000 .
the army would then be divided into so-called intervention , stabilization and support troops .
in the future , 35,000 troops would be prepared for international missions , 70,000 for peace missions like those currently being undertaken in the balkans and afghanistan .
an additional 137,500 troops would be designated for support and 10,000 others could be flexibly deployed where needed by the bundeswehr 's general inspecter .
the union representing germany 's bundeswehr soldiers offered mixed reviews for the plan on tuesday .
" although we are not very enthusiastic about the spending cuts , " bernard gertz was quoted by deutsche welle , " we support the reforms in these times of increasingly stringent budget constraints .
it is quite acceptable to concentrate on the bundeswehr 's future tasks and abolish structures and equipment which are now obsolete . “ eurofighter contracts wo n't be canceled despite the cutbacks , struck said germany would not cancel its order for 180 eurofighter aircraft to be built by defense contractors including eads , britain ’ s bae systems and italy ’ s alenia .
the future of the draft , however , remains in question .
struck said he remains committed to the draft .
but that could change , depending on the outcome of the 2006 elections .
“ the draft will run out , so will the community service , ” said angelika beer , the co-head of the green party , in an interview with ard public television .
around 90,000 young germans are registered yearly for community service as an alternative to mandatory military service .
beer , whose party is part of the federal coaltion government with the social democrats , said she would like the draft to be phased out over the next three or four years .
hospitals depend on young workforce about 80 percent of those choosing community service end up working in hospitals or senior citizens ’ homes , doing essential work such as driving ambulances , caring for the disabled and elderly and delivering meals .
charitable organizations fear there would be severe consequences for the german healthcare system if this workforce were to disappear .
“ we ’ ll have to consider if the services these young people are doing can be totally abolished , ” joachim kendelbacher , from the workers ’ welfare organization , told deutsche welle . “ if these services are cut this definitely means a loss in quality . ”
all armed forces to be trimmed struck said all divisions of the armed forces - including naval , air and ground troops - will have to shoulder their share of the cuts .
his plan drew immediate criticism from conservative opposition leaders .
christian democrat defense issues spokesman christian schmidt said in interviews with german television that the basis for deciding on the military structure can not be “ how much we have in the bank . ”
rather , he said , it should be “ what we want to secure . ” dw staff with reporting by uwe hessler -lrb- so -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundeswehr cuts could hurt german defense industry defense minister peter struck 's announcement that some € 26 billion will be cut from the bundeswehr 's spending plans will hit the german arms industry hard .

her death has not brought about the dramatic changes people feared to the stallholder , she is just another customer .
" it was like any day .
she was so often here you do n't think about it " , he later said .
anna lindh takes the 11.50 train into stockholm .
four hours and 15 minutes later , she is lying fatally injured with stab wounds on the floor of a stockholm department store .
she had no bodyguard that day .
nor did she in the days and weeks leading up to the attack , when she had been campaigning for sweden to join the single european currency .
more often than not , people could walk up to her after she had been speaking in some town square , and launch into a euro debate face to face .
this country has lost its innocence , an innocence we for too long have sought to maintain political commentator barbro hedvall to people in sweden this was not extraordinary .
such access to their elected leaders was more or less taken for granted .
it was not at all surprising that they called the stabbing of anna lindh an attack on sweden 's open society .
commentators warned against giving in to those behind such violent attacks by giving up that open society , and driving a wedge between the people and the politicians .
this week , 25-year-old mijailo mijailovic went on trial for the murder of anna lindh , having confessed stabbing her .
changes just four months after the attack , there are some obvious changes in sweden 's prized open society .
the new foreign minister , laila freivalds , does not commute alone by train to work .
one can assume she is also watched by bodyguards much of the time , although her ministry is reluctant to give out that kind of information .
all government ministers now have the option to be driven to work .
mijailovic told police that jesus had told him to kill ms lindh many politicians , however , say they do not want that kind of protection .
they say sweden 's open society is not defined by chauffeured ministerial cars .
barbro hedvall , a political commentator on the swedish daily dagens nyheter , agrees .
" an open society has more to do with the role of the press , people 's right to know what the authorities are up to and so on .
this has not changed , " she says .
" what i think has happened is that this country has lost its innocence , an innocence we for too long have sought to maintain . "
because it now appears this murder has been solved , i do not think the consequences for swedish society will be as great - while palme is still a trauma social scientist stigbjorn ljunggren that innocence was of course severely tested , if not lost already , back in 1986 , when the then prime minister olof palme was shot dead coming out of a stockholm cinema with his wife .
a man was charged and found guilty of his murder , but later released on appeal .
the crime remains unsolved .
stigbjorn ljunggren , a social scientist at the uppsala university , thinks solving anna lindh 's murder will be of huge importance .
" it is true that sweden has lost its naivity , we see that terrible things happen also in this country , " mr ljunggren says .
" but because it now appears this murder has been solved , i do not think the consequences for swedish society will be as great - while palme is still a trauma . "
random violence anna lindh 's death might not have changed the swedish people 's access to their politicians in a dramatic fashion , even though they are now less likely to end up sitting next to a government minister on the train to work .
but several other , seemingly random violent attacks in the past few years have led many to question what is happening to the traditionally peaceful swedish society .
perhaps the most disturbing of those attacks happened on the same day anna lindh died , when a six year-old girl was stabbed to death at her nursery in a small swedish village .
barbro hedvall at dagens nyheter hopes the trial of mijailo mijailovic will provide some answers as to why sweden has become a society where such violence has become almost commonplace .
" whenever such an attack happens , it is perceived to be abnormal , a one-off .
sadly it is not , " she says .
" we live in a violent society .
anna lindh 's murder was not a political plot like what happened in serbia when zoran djindjic was killed .
that , in a sense , would have been easier to explain . "

nor did she in the days and weeks leading up to the attack , when she had been campaigning for sweden to join the single european currency .
more often than not , people could walk up to her after she had been speaking in some town square , and launch into a euro debate face to face .
this country has lost its innocence , an innocence we for too long have sought to maintain political commentator barbro hedvall to people in sweden this was not extraordinary .
such access to their elected leaders was more or less taken for granted .
it was not at all surprising that they called the stabbing of anna lindh an attack on sweden 's open society .
commentators warned against giving in to those behind such violent attacks by giving up that open society , and driving a wedge between the people and the politicians .
this week , 25-year-old mijailo mijailovic went on trial for the murder of anna lindh , having confessed stabbing her .
changes just four months after the attack , there are some obvious changes in sweden 's prized open society .
the new foreign minister , laila freivalds , does not commute alone by train to work .
one can assume she is also watched by bodyguards much of the time , although her ministry is reluctant to give out that kind of information .
all government ministers now have the option to be driven to work .
mijailovic told police that jesus had told him to kill ms lindh many politicians , however , say they do not want that kind of protection .
they say sweden 's open society is not defined by chauffeured ministerial cars .
barbro hedvall , a political commentator on the swedish daily dagens nyheter , agrees .
" an open society has more to do with the role of the press , people 's right to know what the authorities are up to and so on .
this has not changed , " she says .
" what i think has happened is that this country has lost its innocence , an innocence we for too long have sought to maintain . "
because it now appears this murder has been solved , i do not think the consequences for swedish society will be as great - while palme is still a trauma social scientist stigbjorn ljunggren that innocence was of course severely tested , if not lost already , back in 1986 , when the then prime minister olof palme was shot dead coming out of a stockholm cinema with his wife .
a man was charged and found guilty of his murder , but later released on appeal .
the crime remains unsolved .
stigbjorn ljunggren , a social scientist at the uppsala university , thinks solving anna lindh 's murder will be of huge importance .
" it is true that sweden has lost its naivity , we see that terrible things happen also in this country , " mr ljunggren says .
" but because it now appears this murder has been solved , i do not think the consequences for swedish society will be as great - while palme is still a trauma . "
random violence anna lindh 's death might not have changed the swedish people 's access to their politicians in a dramatic fashion , even though they are now less likely to end up sitting next to a government minister on the train to work .
but several other , seemingly random violent attacks in the past few years have led many to question what is happening to the traditionally peaceful swedish society .
perhaps the most disturbing of those attacks happened on the same day anna lindh died , when a six year-old girl was stabbed to death at her nursery in a small swedish village .
barbro hedvall at dagens nyheter hopes the trial of mijailo mijailovic will provide some answers as to why sweden has become a society where such violence has become almost commonplace .
" whenever such an attack happens , it is perceived to be abnormal , a one-off .
sadly it is not , " she says .
" we live in a violent society .
anna lindh 's murder was not a political plot like what happened in serbia when zoran djindjic was killed .
that , in a sense , would have been easier to explain . "

but glasgow has the poorest collection levels , notching up its lowest rate since local government reorganisation in 1996 , while orkney had the highest .
scotland 's biggest city is also owed the most in unpaid council taxes , with £ 128m currently outstanding .
the figures came in a report by the accounts commission .
improved performance across scotland , councils collected more than 91 % of the council tax due last year - £ 1.38bn from a total £ 1.5bn.
collection levels improved in 29 of scotland 's 32 councils , with only dumfries and galloway , moray , and the scottish borders failing to improve on their previous year 's collection levels .
but there were huge differences between councils - glasgow had the lowest collection rate , at 83.7 % , while orkney had the highest , at 97.7 % .
since local government reorganisation in 1996 , councils have collected 93.7 % of the money due them , said audit scotland , which prepared the report for the accounts commission .
but the study revealed more than £ 550m is still outstanding . "
councils have performed better this year than ever before by collecting a higher proportion of the council tax due " accounts commission the report said the five councils that reported the lowest collection levels for the period from 1996 to last year - east ayrshire -lrb- 90.5 % -rrb- , glasgow -lrb- 84.4 % -rrb- , inverclyde -lrb- 91.3 % -rrb- , north ayrshire -lrb- 91.9 % -rrb- and west dunbartonshire -lrb- 87.8 % -rrb- - were also the councils with the lowest annual collection levels .
" glasgow -lrb- £ 128m outstanding -rrb- and west dunbartonshire -lrb- almost £ 20m outstanding -rrb- collected the lowest percentages of council tax due since 1996 , " said the report .
but alastair macnish , chairman of the accounts commission , praised the overall improvement .
" councils have performed better this year than ever before by collecting a higher proportion of the council tax due , " he said .
" the year-on-year improvement by most councils is very encouraging .
however the outstanding debt from previous years is still very significant .
" we urge councils to do as much as they can to collect council tax in the year that it is due , because the longer debts are outstanding , the harder they are to collect . "
' kick in the teeth ' the report also found councils are becoming quicker at processing benefit claims as well as paying their invoices on time .
the authorities have also kept staff sickness levels to an average 12 days sick leave a year , the same as in previous years .
finance minister andy kerr welcomed the report as " encouraging " .
" these statistics are welcome - improved levels of council tax collection in particular , " said mr kerr .
but the conservatives accused the minister of complacency .
tory local government spokesman brian monteith said council tax had increased by nearly 50 % since labour took office , and the outstanding £ 500m represented " a kick in the teeth " .
he added : " not only have people had to put up with massive rises in tax despite receiving no noticeable improvement in the services they pay for , but it is now clear that they continue having to pay through the nose because their council seems unable to collect tax properly . "

" we urge councils to do as much as they can to collect council tax in the year that it is due , because the longer debts are outstanding , the harder they are to collect . "
' kick in the teeth ' the report also found councils are becoming quicker at processing benefit claims as well as paying their invoices on time .

tory local government spokesman brian monteith said council tax had increased by nearly 50 % since labour took office , and the outstanding £ 500m represented " a kick in the teeth " .
he added : " not only have people had to put up with massive rises in tax despite receiving no noticeable improvement in the services they pay for , but it is now clear that they continue having to pay through the nose because their council seems unable to collect tax properly . "

the request came from military auditors , pentagon officials speaking on condition of anonymity have told the reuters and afp news agencies .
halliburton has said it has not been told of any new inquiry and denied any wrongdoing over the fuel oil sales .
halliburton had looked to be in the clear after an earlier inquiry .
' suspected irregularities ' the row focuses on a contract for halliburton subsidiary kellogg brown & root -lrb- kbr -rrb- to supply the us military in iraq .
" the defense contract audit agency -lrb- dcaa -rrb- was doing a routine audit when it discovered an irregularity relating to restore iraqi oil fuel purchases and they made the referral to the defense department 's inspector general , " reuters quoted a us defence official as saying .
the referral was made on 13 january because of " suspected irregularities " with oil supplies to iraq , according to us defence officials quoted by the agence france presse news agency .
the pentagon 's inspector general may have been asked to step in because the dcaa 's powers are limited to audits and do not extend to investigations , according to a pentagon official quoted in the wall street journal .
if confirmed , the pentagon 's investigation would be a setback for halliburton .
a report in the wall street journal last week said kbr had been cleared of wrongdoing by the commander of the us army corps of engineers .
criticism ' unfair ' a us defense department draft audit last year found evidence that kbr may have overcharged us taxpayers by $ 61m for oil imports from kuwait .
halliburton has reiterated that it delivered fuel to iraq " at the best value " and cleared its purchases with the us military in advance .
" it is important to understand that the referral is a method of further studying the issue and not a condemnation of kbr processes , " the firm said .
the pentagon ended the contract with kbr last month and announced it was setting up special energy unit to ensure competitive tendering for military fuel contracts .
the row has embarrassed the white house as vice president dick cheney was formerly halliburton 's chief executive .

the request came from military auditors , pentagon officials speaking on condition of anonymity have told the reuters and afp news agencies .
halliburton has said it has not been told of any new inquiry and denied any wrongdoing over the fuel oil sales .
halliburton had looked to be in the clear after an earlier inquiry .
' suspected irregularities ' the row focuses on a contract for halliburton subsidiary kellogg brown & root -lrb- kbr -rrb- to supply the us military in iraq .
" the defense contract audit agency -lrb- dcaa -rrb- was doing a routine audit when it discovered an irregularity relating to restore iraqi oil fuel purchases and they made the referral to the defense department 's inspector general , " reuters quoted a us defence official as saying .
the referral was made on 13 january because of " suspected irregularities " with oil supplies to iraq , according to us defence officials quoted by the agence france presse news agency .
the pentagon 's inspector general may have been asked to step in because the dcaa 's powers are limited to audits and do not extend to investigations , according to a pentagon official quoted in the wall street journal .
if confirmed , the pentagon 's investigation would be a setback for halliburton .
a report in the wall street journal last week said kbr had been cleared of wrongdoing by the commander of the us army corps of engineers .
criticism ' unfair ' a us defense department draft audit last year found evidence that kbr may have overcharged us taxpayers by $ 61m for oil imports from kuwait .
halliburton has reiterated that it delivered fuel to iraq " at the best value " and cleared its purchases with the us military in advance .
" it is important to understand that the referral is a method of further studying the issue and not a condemnation of kbr processes , " the firm said .
the pentagon ended the contract with kbr last month and announced it was setting up special energy unit to ensure competitive tendering for military fuel contracts .
the row has embarrassed the white house as vice president dick cheney was formerly halliburton 's chief executive .

the new wave of community beat managers has been funded by a rise in council tax .
holyhead , colwyn bay , prestatyn and llandudno are believed to be among the places which will be given the extra officers , who aim to provide a regular familiar face on the streets .
meanwhile , north wales police is also launching a campaign to recruit more welsh speakers to redress a shortage of bilingual officers .
the decision to bring in the latest batch of community beat officers , who have proved popular in many areas , is in direct response to public demands for more bobbies on the beat .
new officers in western area holyhead llangefni aberffraw and bodffordd bangor city centre maesgeirchen , bangor caernarfon town centre bontnewydd and waunfawr barmouth bala when increases in the police section of the council tax were announced last year , chief constable richard brunstrom said the extra money would be used to fund 50 community officers .
north wales police say these officers allow them to go to the heart of communities and listen to the issues affecting local people .
the force 's western division announced on thursday that it would have nine new community beat managers , bringing the total in its area to 44 .
there will also be five new school liaison officers in the western area by the beginning of may .
chief constable richard brunstrom wants more welsh speaking officers mr brunstrom has also opened the force 's welsh language recruitment initiative , chaired by rhodri williams , of the welsh language board .
around 25 % of north wales police 's officers speak welsh , and the one-day awareness campaign is designed to help raise this figure .
mr brunstrom said he is forced to recruit from england because welsh-speaking communities are losing their young people due to a lack of jobs .
last year mr brunstrom achieved a grade a pass in his welsh language a-level exam , while his assistant chief constable clive wolfendale got a b grade .

the new wave of community beat managers has been funded by a rise in council tax .
holyhead , colwyn bay , prestatyn and llandudno are believed to be among the places which will be given the extra officers , who aim to provide a regular familiar face on the streets .
meanwhile , north wales police is also launching a campaign to recruit more welsh speakers to redress a shortage of bilingual officers .
the decision to bring in the latest batch of community beat officers , who have proved popular in many areas , is in direct response to public demands for more bobbies on the beat .
new officers in western area holyhead llangefni aberffraw and bodffordd bangor city centre maesgeirchen , bangor caernarfon town centre bontnewydd and waunfawr barmouth bala when increases in the police section of the council tax were announced last year , chief constable richard brunstrom said the extra money would be used to fund 50 community officers .
north wales police say these officers allow them to go to the heart of communities and listen to the issues affecting local people .
the force 's western division announced on thursday that it would have nine new community beat managers , bringing the total in its area to 44 .
there will also be five new school liaison officers in the western area by the beginning of may .
chief constable richard brunstrom wants more welsh speaking officers mr brunstrom has also opened the force 's welsh language recruitment initiative , chaired by rhodri williams , of the welsh language board .
around 25 % of north wales police 's officers speak welsh , and the one-day awareness campaign is designed to help raise this figure .
mr brunstrom said he is forced to recruit from england because welsh-speaking communities are losing their young people due to a lack of jobs .
last year mr brunstrom achieved a grade a pass in his welsh language a-level exam , while his assistant chief constable clive wolfendale got a b grade .
the language event is being held in llandudno 's aberconwy conference centre .
each of the force 's three divisions will then launch their own language initiatives .

animal numbers are down 43 % visitors were already staying away due to fears of terror attacks , poor infrastructure and bad land management .
nowhere on earth is there such an abundance and variety of wildlife as there is in the maasai mara .
for years the animals and the maasai have lived in harmony with their surroundings , but in the dispersal areas on the outskirts of the reserve , competition for land is increasing .
in the last 10 years , poaching , population growth and overgrazing have led to a 43 % fall in the amount of wildlife found in the buffer zones .
conservationists say changes are needed , but it is going to take a fundamental shift in the thinking of the local people .
land revolution cows are the most important animal in the maasai culture - they depend on them for everything .
their milk and blood are used for food , their hide is used for mattresses and their dung is used to plaster the walls of their huts .
the maasai will have different areas for cattle and wildlife but there are too many cows in too many areas of the maasai mara and they are tipping the balance of a very delicate ecosystem .
conscious of the impact this is having on tourist figures in their area , the maasai people of lemek-koyiaki are planning a new way forward .
their land , which spans 149,000 hectares , is owned and managed by over 500 maasai families .
in recent months , they have all signed up to new land management scheme which will revolutionise the way the area is run .
park fees daniel muli , a junior elder who collected the signatures , says it is the start of a more professional management scheme they hope will make the difference .
" it wo n't be easy to give up our livestock , " he said .
we can not stay behind as the rest of kenya is moving forward jackson ole looseyia maasai leader " cows are our tradition and we wo n't give them up .
but we have decided we need to make changes .
we have agreed to divide the land for the future benefit of the area .
" we will have a livestock zone and a wildlife and tourism zone and the two will be run separately ...
tourism is our future .
it is a vital source of income . "
every three months , each maasai family in mr muli 's province gets an equal share of the park fees collected .
they know that without the changes they have signed up to their money will slowly dwindle .
cultural power ron beaton , who has managed a lodge on the outskirts of the reserve since 1986 , says tourism figures are a third of what they were eight years ago .
mr beaton believes that eventually the maasai will go one step further than the land management scheme they have agreed and privatise the management of their land entirely .
wild animals can be a danger to cattle " i think privatisation will come to the group ranches in the dispersal areas , " he said .
" we have seen it work in the reserve in the last two years .
but it is not something that can be done overnight .
you are dealing with an old generation that basically do n't understand tourism and they still wield a lot of power under the cultural system .
" but the younger generation understand that good management and good economics is going to benefit them . "
renaissance the maasai look enviously towards the mara conservancy - an area of the reserve privatised two years ago .
here park fees , that were previously siphoned into the wrong hands , are being re-invested in the infrastructure of the park .
wildlife are one of kenya 's main tourist attractions the head of the non profit consortium that runs the conservancy , brian heath , has a great deal to be proud of .
" the fundamental changes since we took over have been the improvements to the infrastructure .
the roads and the security and the rangers are now paid and better organised .
" we have seen a dramatic reduction in poaching .
we have caught over 250 poachers over the last year and that has made a difference to animal numbers , " he said .
according to mr heath , " the reason this works is that the council are prepared to reinvest in their resources .
they put back 36 % of the gate revenue that is collected into managing the park which does n't happen anywhere else in the mara . "
but if privatisation is to work here , it has to have the support of the maasai leaders and it must be run by maasai people .
too often they have been exploited and forgotten - to the detriment of both the land and the wildlife .
young leaders like jackson ole looseyia say it will only happen if future generations are given the opportunity to go to school - instead of being sent to look after the cattle - and are allowed to take control .
" we can not stay behind as the rest of kenya is moving forward .
we need our young men to be running our districts .
we need children to be better educated , we need politicians , we need forward thinking chiefs who can make changes .
" and most importantly we need parents to understand the benefits of education and what it can mean to our future here .
there is a move in that direction - but a lot of people here still depend on their cows and their sons to guard them . "
around the campfires in the maasai villages one senses a renaissance is indeed under way .
it needs to happen quickly though - not only for the future survival of the wildlife but also the tourism industry on which the maasai depend .

animal numbers are down 43 % visitors were already staying away due to fears of terror attacks , poor infrastructure and bad land management .
nowhere on earth is there such an abundance and variety of wildlife as there is in the maasai mara .
for years the animals and the maasai have lived in harmony with their surroundings , but in the dispersal areas on the outskirts of the reserve , competition for land is increasing .
in the last 10 years , poaching , population growth and overgrazing have led to a 43 % fall in the amount of wildlife found in the buffer zones .
conservationists say changes are needed , but it is going to take a fundamental shift in the thinking of the local people .
land revolution cows are the most important animal in the maasai culture - they depend on them for everything .
their milk and blood are used for food , their hide is used for mattresses and their dung is used to plaster the walls of their huts .
the maasai will have different areas for cattle and wildlife but there are too many cows in too many areas of the maasai mara and they are tipping the balance of a very delicate ecosystem .
conscious of the impact this is having on tourist figures in their area , the maasai people of lemek-koyiaki are planning a new way forward .
their land , which spans 149,000 hectares , is owned and managed by over 500 maasai families .
in recent months , they have all signed up to new land management scheme which will revolutionise the way the area is run .
park fees daniel muli , a junior elder who collected the signatures , says it is the start of a more professional management scheme they hope will make the difference .
" it wo n't be easy to give up our livestock , " he said .
we can not stay behind as the rest of kenya is moving forward jackson ole looseyia maasai leader " cows are our tradition and we wo n't give them up .
but we have decided we need to make changes .
we have agreed to divide the land for the future benefit of the area .
" we will have a livestock zone and a wildlife and tourism zone and the two will be run separately ...
tourism is our future .
it is a vital source of income . "
every three months , each maasai family in mr muli 's province gets an equal share of the park fees collected .
they know that without the changes they have signed up to their money will slowly dwindle .
cultural power ron beaton , who has managed a lodge on the outskirts of the reserve since 1986 , says tourism figures are a third of what they were eight years ago .
mr beaton believes that eventually the maasai will go one step further than the land management scheme they have agreed and privatise the management of their land entirely .
wild animals can be a danger to cattle " i think privatisation will come to the group ranches in the dispersal areas , " he said .
" we have seen it work in the reserve in the last two years .
but it is not something that can be done overnight .
you are dealing with an old generation that basically do n't understand tourism and they still wield a lot of power under the cultural system .
" but the younger generation understand that good management and good economics is going to benefit them . "
renaissance the maasai look enviously towards the mara conservancy - an area of the reserve privatised two years ago .
here park fees , that were previously siphoned into the wrong hands , are being re-invested in the infrastructure of the park .
wildlife are one of kenya 's main tourist attractions the head of the non profit consortium that runs the conservancy , brian heath , has a great deal to be proud of .
" the fundamental changes since we took over have been the improvements to the infrastructure .
the roads and the security and the rangers are now paid and better organised .
" we have seen a dramatic reduction in poaching .
we have caught over 250 poachers over the last year and that has made a difference to animal numbers , " he said .
according to mr heath , " the reason this works is that the council are prepared to reinvest in their resources .
they put back 36 % of the gate revenue that is collected into managing the park which does n't happen anywhere else in the mara . "
but if privatisation is to work here , it has to have the support of the maasai leaders and it must be run by maasai people .
too often they have been exploited and forgotten - to the detriment of both the land and the wildlife .
young leaders like jackson ole looseyia say it will only happen if future generations are given the opportunity to go to school - instead of being sent to look after the cattle - and are allowed to take control .
" we can not stay behind as the rest of kenya is moving forward .
we need our young men to be running our districts .
we need children to be better educated , we need politicians , we need forward thinking chiefs who can make changes .
" and most importantly we need parents to understand the benefits of education and what it can mean to our future here .
