slovenia has long been hailed as the most promising of the new eu members .
but not everyone has benefited from the nation 's progress : a small ethnic minority known as izbrisani has been simply erased from the books . independent from yugoslavia since 1991 , slovenia inherited a good infrastructure and trade connections , not to mention a fair amount of tourism and modern factories .
today , slovenians enjoy the highest living standards among the former communist countries that entered the european union in may . but in this tiny country of two million people , a small minority has been left out of this rising tide of prosperity .
in fact , they have been left out of just about everything .
they are known as the izbrisani , or " the erased people , " because they were removed from the administrative registers after slovenia declared its independence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : main square in the slovenian capital ljubljana slovenia was practically left untouched by the violent ethnic conflict that tore up yugoslavia in the 1990s .
it has always tried to distance itself from the negative image of the balkans , portraying itself as a modern western nation which respects human rights .
but the tragic fate of the izbrisani suggests slovenia also has its dark chapters and that balkan chauvinism in slovenia is perhaps not as far fetched as many slovenes would like to think . " we are living dead " jemail shatani , 38-year old gypsy , or roma , is originally from kosovo , but settled in slovenia 20 years ago .
he married sanja , also from kosovo , and found a permanent job in slovenia ’ s second largest town maribor working for the city ’ s waste management and water supplies . but in 1992 , shatani ’ s life took a tragic turn .
he discovered , by chance , that he no longer officially existed .
having failed to apply for slovenian citizenship after the country became independent , the authorities had wiped his name from the registers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : map of slovenia " the collapse of yugoslavia and the administrative chaos here in slovenia have put us in a situation where we have died , but are still alive , " shatani said .
" we are living dead .
our fate is worse than that of cats and dogs .
we don ’ t have any identity .
my wife , my kids and myself are stateless .
we are not citizens of any country in this world . "
shatani tried to get new papers in kosovo , but he and his wife were not listed in the state registers there either .
he also sought legal help and then pursued the matter through the courts – without any immediate success . today , 13 years later , he has managed to get his permanent slovenian residency back , but not full citizenship , nor his work permit or passports for his family .
jemail ’ s wife , sanja , hasn ’ t seen her mother and her brother for 15 years now .
her four kids always ask her : " why don ’ t we have a grandmother ? "
it ’ s awful , she said in tears .
without passports you can not go anywhere . no future in slovenia in slovenia , there is no future for his family , shatani said .
if they ever get passports , they will immediately leave the country .
anywhere would be better than slovenia , he added . the " erasure " of shatani and his family is not an isolated case .
when slovenia declared independence , 130,000 or so non-slovene residents were given six months to apply for citizenship .
most completed the necessary paperwork and became slovenian citizens .
but at least 18,000 did not register .
many were not well informed and didn ’ t know about the new legislation .
others were afraid of political persecution : after all , ethnic wars were raging in neighboring bosnia and croatia , and nobody knew what the future would hold . even for those who did want slovenian citizenship , it was difficult , if not impossible to get the necessary papers because of these ongoing conflicts .
was it reasonable to expect a bosnian muslim to risk death by returning to his serb-occupied home – just to pick up a birth certificate ?
the bureaucratic demands of the slovene authorities were at odds with the realities of wartime yugoslavia . erased in 1992 even so , on feb .
26 , 1992 , those 18,000 people were simply erased from registers .
many of the erased people didn ’ t find out about their illegal status till months , even years , later . the ministry of the interior was responsible for the erasure .
today , alenka mesojedic is the head of the citizenship and naturalization section at the ministry .
she ’ s cautious – and defensive – when confronted with this allegation . “ yes .
no .
no .
it ’ s not correct .
they all remained in the register , but they were not entitled on the rights as the slovenian citizens , " she said . " no one was erased physically , but legally they were not entitled on the rights which were related to the citizens . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : piran fishing village many of these people had lived in slovenia for 10 , 20 , sometimes even 30 years .
from one day to the next they lost everything : their social security , their health care , their driving license , their passport – basically , their identity . matevz krivic is a former constitutional judge and now a legal representative for some of the erased people . “ people lost jobs , people lost pensions , people lost medical care , some of them died , " he said . serious allegations some were deported and at least seven people are known to have committed suicide .
however neva predan of helsinki monitor in slovenia , a human rights organization that has been fighting for the rights of the erased for the past 10 years , goes further . “ it is genocide , " he said .
" it is a very efficient administrative tool of ethnic cleansing and this is a speciality of slovenian authorities and it shows a genocide mind . ” twice – in 1999 and in 2003 - slovenia ’ s highest court has ordered the government to restore the rights of the erased .
but little action seems to have been taken .
the government works on a case-by-case basis , and progress is painfully slow . erwan fouere , the eu ambassador to slovenia , said he remains optimistic that the issue will eventually be resolved .
but did brussels even raise the issue of the erased during slovenia ’ s eu accession talks ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovenian and italian workers tear down a border fence between the two countries .
" it never featured in the actual negotiations , but of course in the reports there was always a reference to issues such as the erased , " he said .
" i think this highlighted that we were aware of the problem and we felt it was important that the legal limbo had to be addressed as speedy as possibly . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 27.11.2004 slovenia 's " erased people " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not their country anymore ?
slovenia has long been hailed as the most promising of the new eu members .
but not everyone has benefited from the nation 's progress : a small ethnic minority known as izbrisani has been simply erased from the books . independent from yugoslavia since 1991 , slovenia inherited a good infrastructure and trade connections , not to mention a fair amount of tourism and modern factories .
today , slovenians enjoy the highest living standards among the former communist countries that entered the european union in may . but in this tiny country of two million people , a small minority has been left out of this rising tide of prosperity .
in fact , they have been left out of just about everything .
they are known as the izbrisani , or " the erased people , " because they were removed from the administrative registers after slovenia declared its independence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : main square in the slovenian capital ljubljana slovenia was practically left untouched by the violent ethnic conflict that tore up yugoslavia in the 1990s .
it has always tried to distance itself from the negative image of the balkans , portraying itself as a modern western nation which respects human rights .
but the tragic fate of the izbrisani suggests slovenia also has its dark chapters and that balkan chauvinism in slovenia is perhaps not as far fetched as many slovenes would like to think . " we are living dead " jemail shatani , 38-year old gypsy , or roma , is originally from kosovo , but settled in slovenia 20 years ago .
he married sanja , also from kosovo , and found a permanent job in slovenia ’ s second largest town maribor working for the city ’ s waste management and water supplies . but in 1992 , shatani ’ s life took a tragic turn .
he discovered , by chance , that he no longer officially existed .
having failed to apply for slovenian citizenship after the country became independent , the authorities had wiped his name from the registers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : map of slovenia " the collapse of yugoslavia and the administrative chaos here in slovenia have put us in a situation where we have died , but are still alive , " shatani said .
" we are living dead .
our fate is worse than that of cats and dogs .
we don ’ t have any identity .
my wife , my kids and myself are stateless .
we are not citizens of any country in this world . "
shatani tried to get new papers in kosovo , but he and his wife were not listed in the state registers there either .
he also sought legal help and then pursued the matter through the courts – without any immediate success . today , 13 years later , he has managed to get his permanent slovenian residency back , but not full citizenship , nor his work permit or passports for his family .
jemail ’ s wife , sanja , hasn ’ t seen her mother and her brother for 15 years now .
her four kids always ask her : " why don ’ t we have a grandmother ? "
it ’ s awful , she said in tears .
without passports you can not go anywhere . no future in slovenia in slovenia , there is no future for his family , shatani said .
if they ever get passports , they will immediately leave the country .
anywhere would be better than slovenia , he added . the " erasure " of shatani and his family is not an isolated case .
when slovenia declared independence , 130,000 or so non-slovene residents were given six months to apply for citizenship .
most completed the necessary paperwork and became slovenian citizens .
but at least 18,000 did not register .
many were not well informed and didn ’ t know about the new legislation .
others were afraid of political persecution : after all , ethnic wars were raging in neighboring bosnia and croatia , and nobody knew what the future would hold . even for those who did want slovenian citizenship , it was difficult , if not impossible to get the necessary papers because of these ongoing conflicts .
was it reasonable to expect a bosnian muslim to risk death by returning to his serb-occupied home – just to pick up a birth certificate ?
the bureaucratic demands of the slovene authorities were at odds with the realities of wartime yugoslavia . erased in 1992 even so , on feb .
26 , 1992 , those 18,000 people were simply erased from registers .
many of the erased people didn ’ t find out about their illegal status till months , even years , later . the ministry of the interior was responsible for the erasure .
today , alenka mesojedic is the head of the citizenship and naturalization section at the ministry .
she ’ s cautious – and defensive – when confronted with this allegation . “ yes .
no .
no .
it ’ s not correct .
they all remained in the register , but they were not entitled on the rights as the slovenian citizens , " she said . " no one was erased physically , but legally they were not entitled on the rights which were related to the citizens . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : piran fishing village many of these people had lived in slovenia for 10 , 20 , sometimes even 30 years .
from one day to the next they lost everything : their social security , their health care , their driving license , their passport – basically , their identity . matevz krivic is a former constitutional judge and now a legal representative for some of the erased people . “ people lost jobs , people lost pensions , people lost medical care , some of them died , " he said . serious allegations some were deported and at least seven people are known to have committed suicide .
however neva predan of helsinki monitor in slovenia , a human rights organization that has been fighting for the rights of the erased for the past 10 years , goes further . “ it is genocide , " he said .
" it is a very efficient administrative tool of ethnic cleansing and this is a speciality of slovenian authorities and it shows a genocide mind . ” twice – in 1999 and in 2003 - slovenia ’ s highest court has ordered the government to restore the rights of the erased .
but little action seems to have been taken .
the government works on a case-by-case basis , and progress is painfully slow . erwan fouere , the eu ambassador to slovenia , said he remains optimistic that the issue will eventually be resolved .
but did brussels even raise the issue of the erased during slovenia ’ s eu accession talks ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovenian and italian workers tear down a border fence between the two countries .
" it never featured in the actual negotiations , but of course in the reports there was always a reference to issues such as the erased , " he said .
" i think this highlighted that we were aware of the problem and we felt it was important that the legal limbo had to be addressed as speedy as possibly . "

slovenia has long been hailed as the most promising of the new eu members .
but not everyone has benefited from the nation 's progress : a small ethnic minority known as izbrisani has been simply erased from the books . independent from yugoslavia since 1991 , slovenia inherited a good infrastructure and trade connections , not to mention a fair amount of tourism and modern factories .
today , slovenians enjoy the highest living standards among the former communist countries that entered the european union in may . but in this tiny country of two million people , a small minority has been left out of this rising tide of prosperity .
in fact , they have been left out of just about everything .
they are known as the izbrisani , or " the erased people , " because they were removed from the administrative registers after slovenia declared its independence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : main square in the slovenian capital ljubljana slovenia was practically left untouched by the violent ethnic conflict that tore up yugoslavia in the 1990s .
it has always tried to distance itself from the negative image of the balkans , portraying itself as a modern western nation which respects human rights .
but the tragic fate of the izbrisani suggests slovenia also has its dark chapters and that balkan chauvinism in slovenia is perhaps not as far fetched as many slovenes would like to think . " we are living dead " jemail shatani , 38-year old gypsy , or roma , is originally from kosovo , but settled in slovenia 20 years ago .
he married sanja , also from kosovo , and found a permanent job in slovenia ’ s second largest town maribor working for the city ’ s waste management and water supplies . but in 1992 , shatani ’ s life took a tragic turn .
he discovered , by chance , that he no longer officially existed .
having failed to apply for slovenian citizenship after the country became independent , the authorities had wiped his name from the registers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : map of slovenia " the collapse of yugoslavia and the administrative chaos here in slovenia have put us in a situation where we have died , but are still alive , " shatani said .
" we are living dead .
our fate is worse than that of cats and dogs .
we don ’ t have any identity .
my wife , my kids and myself are stateless .
we are not citizens of any country in this world . "
shatani tried to get new papers in kosovo , but he and his wife were not listed in the state registers there either .
he also sought legal help and then pursued the matter through the courts – without any immediate success . today , 13 years later , he has managed to get his permanent slovenian residency back , but not full citizenship , nor his work permit or passports for his family .
jemail ’ s wife , sanja , hasn ’ t seen her mother and her brother for 15 years now .
her four kids always ask her : " why don ’ t we have a grandmother ? "
it ’ s awful , she said in tears .
without passports you can not go anywhere . no future in slovenia in slovenia , there is no future for his family , shatani said .
if they ever get passports , they will immediately leave the country .
anywhere would be better than slovenia , he added . the " erasure " of shatani and his family is not an isolated case .
when slovenia declared independence , 130,000 or so non-slovene residents were given six months to apply for citizenship .
most completed the necessary paperwork and became slovenian citizens .
but at least 18,000 did not register .
many were not well informed and didn ’ t know about the new legislation .
others were afraid of political persecution : after all , ethnic wars were raging in neighboring bosnia and croatia , and nobody knew what the future would hold . even for those who did want slovenian citizenship , it was difficult , if not impossible to get the necessary papers because of these ongoing conflicts .
was it reasonable to expect a bosnian muslim to risk death by returning to his serb-occupied home – just to pick up a birth certificate ?
the bureaucratic demands of the slovene authorities were at odds with the realities of wartime yugoslavia . erased in 1992 even so , on feb .
26 , 1992 , those 18,000 people were simply erased from registers .
many of the erased people didn ’ t find out about their illegal status till months , even years , later . the ministry of the interior was responsible for the erasure .
today , alenka mesojedic is the head of the citizenship and naturalization section at the ministry .
she ’ s cautious – and defensive – when confronted with this allegation . “ yes .
no .
no .
it ’ s not correct .
they all remained in the register , but they were not entitled on the rights as the slovenian citizens , " she said . " no one was erased physically , but legally they were not entitled on the rights which were related to the citizens . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : piran fishing village many of these people had lived in slovenia for 10 , 20 , sometimes even 30 years .
from one day to the next they lost everything : their social security , their health care , their driving license , their passport – basically , their identity . matevz krivic is a former constitutional judge and now a legal representative for some of the erased people . “ people lost jobs , people lost pensions , people lost medical care , some of them died , " he said . serious allegations some were deported and at least seven people are known to have committed suicide .
however neva predan of helsinki monitor in slovenia , a human rights organization that has been fighting for the rights of the erased for the past 10 years , goes further . “ it is genocide , " he said .
" it is a very efficient administrative tool of ethnic cleansing and this is a speciality of slovenian authorities and it shows a genocide mind . ” twice – in 1999 and in 2003 - slovenia ’ s highest court has ordered the government to restore the rights of the erased .
but little action seems to have been taken .
the government works on a case-by-case basis , and progress is painfully slow . erwan fouere , the eu ambassador to slovenia , said he remains optimistic that the issue will eventually be resolved .
but did brussels even raise the issue of the erased during slovenia ’ s eu accession talks ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovenian and italian workers tear down a border fence between the two countries .

slovenia has long been hailed as the most promising of the new eu members .
but not everyone has benefited from the nation 's progress : a small ethnic minority known as izbrisani has been simply erased from the books . independent from yugoslavia since 1991 , slovenia inherited a good infrastructure and trade connections , not to mention a fair amount of tourism and modern factories .
today , slovenians enjoy the highest living standards among the former communist countries that entered the european union in may . but in this tiny country of two million people , a small minority has been left out of this rising tide of prosperity .
in fact , they have been left out of just about everything .
they are known as the izbrisani , or " the erased people , " because they were removed from the administrative registers after slovenia declared its independence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : main square in the slovenian capital ljubljana slovenia was practically left untouched by the violent ethnic conflict that tore up yugoslavia in the 1990s .
it has always tried to distance itself from the negative image of the balkans , portraying itself as a modern western nation which respects human rights .
but the tragic fate of the izbrisani suggests slovenia also has its dark chapters and that balkan chauvinism in slovenia is perhaps not as far fetched as many slovenes would like to think . " we are living dead " jemail shatani , 38-year old gypsy , or roma , is originally from kosovo , but settled in slovenia 20 years ago .
he married sanja , also from kosovo , and found a permanent job in slovenia ’ s second largest town maribor working for the city ’ s waste management and water supplies . but in 1992 , shatani ’ s life took a tragic turn .
he discovered , by chance , that he no longer officially existed .
having failed to apply for slovenian citizenship after the country became independent , the authorities had wiped his name from the registers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : map of slovenia " the collapse of yugoslavia and the administrative chaos here in slovenia have put us in a situation where we have died , but are still alive , " shatani said .
" we are living dead .
our fate is worse than that of cats and dogs .
we don ’ t have any identity .
my wife , my kids and myself are stateless .
we are not citizens of any country in this world . "
shatani tried to get new papers in kosovo , but he and his wife were not listed in the state registers there either .
he also sought legal help and then pursued the matter through the courts – without any immediate success . today , 13 years later , he has managed to get his permanent slovenian residency back , but not full citizenship , nor his work permit or passports for his family .
jemail ’ s wife , sanja , hasn ’ t seen her mother and her brother for 15 years now .
her four kids always ask her : " why don ’ t we have a grandmother ? "
it ’ s awful , she said in tears .
without passports you can not go anywhere . no future in slovenia in slovenia , there is no future for his family , shatani said .
if they ever get passports , they will immediately leave the country .
anywhere would be better than slovenia , he added . the " erasure " of shatani and his family is not an isolated case .
when slovenia declared independence , 130,000 or so non-slovene residents were given six months to apply for citizenship .
most completed the necessary paperwork and became slovenian citizens .
but at least 18,000 did not register .
many were not well informed and didn ’ t know about the new legislation .
others were afraid of political persecution : after all , ethnic wars were raging in neighboring bosnia and croatia , and nobody knew what the future would hold . even for those who did want slovenian citizenship , it was difficult , if not impossible to get the necessary papers because of these ongoing conflicts .
was it reasonable to expect a bosnian muslim to risk death by returning to his serb-occupied home – just to pick up a birth certificate ?
the bureaucratic demands of the slovene authorities were at odds with the realities of wartime yugoslavia . erased in 1992 even so , on feb .
26 , 1992 , those 18,000 people were simply erased from registers .
many of the erased people didn ’ t find out about their illegal status till months , even years , later . the ministry of the interior was responsible for the erasure .
today , alenka mesojedic is the head of the citizenship and naturalization section at the ministry .
she ’ s cautious – and defensive – when confronted with this allegation . “ yes .
no .
no .
it ’ s not correct .
they all remained in the register , but they were not entitled on the rights as the slovenian citizens , " she said . " no one was erased physically , but legally they were not entitled on the rights which were related to the citizens . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : piran fishing village many of these people had lived in slovenia for 10 , 20 , sometimes even 30 years .
from one day to the next they lost everything : their social security , their health care , their driving license , their passport – basically , their identity . matevz krivic is a former constitutional judge and now a legal representative for some of the erased people . “ people lost jobs , people lost pensions , people lost medical care , some of them died , " he said . serious allegations some were deported and at least seven people are known to have committed suicide .

slovenia has long been hailed as the most promising of the new eu members .
but not everyone has benefited from the nation 's progress : a small ethnic minority known as izbrisani has been simply erased from the books . independent from yugoslavia since 1991 , slovenia inherited a good infrastructure and trade connections , not to mention a fair amount of tourism and modern factories .
today , slovenians enjoy the highest living standards among the former communist countries that entered the european union in may . but in this tiny country of two million people , a small minority has been left out of this rising tide of prosperity .
in fact , they have been left out of just about everything .
they are known as the izbrisani , or " the erased people , " because they were removed from the administrative registers after slovenia declared its independence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : main square in the slovenian capital ljubljana slovenia was practically left untouched by the violent ethnic conflict that tore up yugoslavia in the 1990s .
it has always tried to distance itself from the negative image of the balkans , portraying itself as a modern western nation which respects human rights .
but the tragic fate of the izbrisani suggests slovenia also has its dark chapters and that balkan chauvinism in slovenia is perhaps not as far fetched as many slovenes would like to think . " we are living dead " jemail shatani , 38-year old gypsy , or roma , is originally from kosovo , but settled in slovenia 20 years ago .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 27.11.2004 slovenia 's " erased people " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not their country anymore ?
slovenia has long been hailed as the most promising of the new eu members .
but not everyone has benefited from the nation 's progress : a small ethnic minority known as izbrisani has been simply erased from the books . independent from yugoslavia since 1991 , slovenia inherited a good infrastructure and trade connections , not to mention a fair amount of tourism and modern factories .
today , slovenians enjoy the highest living standards among the former communist countries that entered the european union in may . but in this tiny country of two million people , a small minority has been left out of this rising tide of prosperity .
in fact , they have been left out of just about everything .
they are known as the izbrisani , or " the erased people , " because they were removed from the administrative registers after slovenia declared its independence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : main square in the slovenian capital ljubljana slovenia was practically left untouched by the violent ethnic conflict that tore up yugoslavia in the 1990s .
it has always tried to distance itself from the negative image of the balkans , portraying itself as a modern western nation which respects human rights .
but the tragic fate of the izbrisani suggests slovenia also has its dark chapters and that balkan chauvinism in slovenia is perhaps not as far fetched as many slovenes would like to think . " we are living dead " jemail shatani , 38-year old gypsy , or roma , is originally from kosovo , but settled in slovenia 20 years ago .
he married sanja , also from kosovo , and found a permanent job in slovenia ’ s second largest town maribor working for the city ’ s waste management and water supplies . but in 1992 , shatani ’ s life took a tragic turn .
he discovered , by chance , that he no longer officially existed .
having failed to apply for slovenian citizenship after the country became independent , the authorities had wiped his name from the registers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : map of slovenia " the collapse of yugoslavia and the administrative chaos here in slovenia have put us in a situation where we have died , but are still alive , " shatani said .
" we are living dead .
our fate is worse than that of cats and dogs .
we don ’ t have any identity .
my wife , my kids and myself are stateless .
we are not citizens of any country in this world . "
shatani tried to get new papers in kosovo , but he and his wife were not listed in the state registers there either .
he also sought legal help and then pursued the matter through the courts – without any immediate success . today , 13 years later , he has managed to get his permanent slovenian residency back , but not full citizenship , nor his work permit or passports for his family .
jemail ’ s wife , sanja , hasn ’ t seen her mother and her brother for 15 years now .
her four kids always ask her : " why don ’ t we have a grandmother ? "
it ’ s awful , she said in tears .
without passports you can not go anywhere . no future in slovenia in slovenia , there is no future for his family , shatani said .
if they ever get passports , they will immediately leave the country .
anywhere would be better than slovenia , he added . the " erasure " of shatani and his family is not an isolated case .
when slovenia declared independence , 130,000 or so non-slovene residents were given six months to apply for citizenship .
most completed the necessary paperwork and became slovenian citizens .
but at least 18,000 did not register .
many were not well informed and didn ’ t know about the new legislation .
others were afraid of political persecution : after all , ethnic wars were raging in neighboring bosnia and croatia , and nobody knew what the future would hold . even for those who did want slovenian citizenship , it was difficult , if not impossible to get the necessary papers because of these ongoing conflicts .
was it reasonable to expect a bosnian muslim to risk death by returning to his serb-occupied home – just to pick up a birth certificate ?
the bureaucratic demands of the slovene authorities were at odds with the realities of wartime yugoslavia . erased in 1992 even so , on feb .
26 , 1992 , those 18,000 people were simply erased from registers .
many of the erased people didn ’ t find out about their illegal status till months , even years , later . the ministry of the interior was responsible for the erasure .
today , alenka mesojedic is the head of the citizenship and naturalization section at the ministry .
she ’ s cautious – and defensive – when confronted with this allegation . “ yes .
no .
no .
it ’ s not correct .
they all remained in the register , but they were not entitled on the rights as the slovenian citizens , " she said . " no one was erased physically , but legally they were not entitled on the rights which were related to the citizens . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : piran fishing village many of these people had lived in slovenia for 10 , 20 , sometimes even 30 years .
from one day to the next they lost everything : their social security , their health care , their driving license , their passport – basically , their identity . matevz krivic is a former constitutional judge and now a legal representative for some of the erased people . “ people lost jobs , people lost pensions , people lost medical care , some of them died , " he said . serious allegations some were deported and at least seven people are known to have committed suicide .
however neva predan of helsinki monitor in slovenia , a human rights organization that has been fighting for the rights of the erased for the past 10 years , goes further . “ it is genocide , " he said .
" it is a very efficient administrative tool of ethnic cleansing and this is a speciality of slovenian authorities and it shows a genocide mind . ” twice – in 1999 and in 2003 - slovenia ’ s highest court has ordered the government to restore the rights of the erased .
but little action seems to have been taken .
the government works on a case-by-case basis , and progress is painfully slow . erwan fouere , the eu ambassador to slovenia , said he remains optimistic that the issue will eventually be resolved .

slovenia has long been hailed as the most promising of the new eu members .
but not everyone has benefited from the nation 's progress : a small ethnic minority known as izbrisani has been simply erased from the books . independent from yugoslavia since 1991 , slovenia inherited a good infrastructure and trade connections , not to mention a fair amount of tourism and modern factories .
today , slovenians enjoy the highest living standards among the former communist countries that entered the european union in may . but in this tiny country of two million people , a small minority has been left out of this rising tide of prosperity .
in fact , they have been left out of just about everything .
they are known as the izbrisani , or " the erased people , " because they were removed from the administrative registers after slovenia declared its independence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : main square in the slovenian capital ljubljana slovenia was practically left untouched by the violent ethnic conflict that tore up yugoslavia in the 1990s .
it has always tried to distance itself from the negative image of the balkans , portraying itself as a modern western nation which respects human rights .
but the tragic fate of the izbrisani suggests slovenia also has its dark chapters and that balkan chauvinism in slovenia is perhaps not as far fetched as many slovenes would like to think . " we are living dead " jemail shatani , 38-year old gypsy , or roma , is originally from kosovo , but settled in slovenia 20 years ago .
he married sanja , also from kosovo , and found a permanent job in slovenia ’ s second largest town maribor working for the city ’ s waste management and water supplies . but in 1992 , shatani ’ s life took a tragic turn .
he discovered , by chance , that he no longer officially existed .
having failed to apply for slovenian citizenship after the country became independent , the authorities had wiped his name from the registers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : map of slovenia " the collapse of yugoslavia and the administrative chaos here in slovenia have put us in a situation where we have died , but are still alive , " shatani said .
" we are living dead .
our fate is worse than that of cats and dogs .
we don ’ t have any identity .
my wife , my kids and myself are stateless .
we are not citizens of any country in this world . "
shatani tried to get new papers in kosovo , but he and his wife were not listed in the state registers there either .
he also sought legal help and then pursued the matter through the courts – without any immediate success . today , 13 years later , he has managed to get his permanent slovenian residency back , but not full citizenship , nor his work permit or passports for his family .
jemail ’ s wife , sanja , hasn ’ t seen her mother and her brother for 15 years now .
her four kids always ask her : " why don ’ t we have a grandmother ? "
it ’ s awful , she said in tears .
without passports you can not go anywhere . no future in slovenia in slovenia , there is no future for his family , shatani said .
if they ever get passports , they will immediately leave the country .
anywhere would be better than slovenia , he added . the " erasure " of shatani and his family is not an isolated case .
when slovenia declared independence , 130,000 or so non-slovene residents were given six months to apply for citizenship .
most completed the necessary paperwork and became slovenian citizens .
but at least 18,000 did not register .
many were not well informed and didn ’ t know about the new legislation .
others were afraid of political persecution : after all , ethnic wars were raging in neighboring bosnia and croatia , and nobody knew what the future would hold . even for those who did want slovenian citizenship , it was difficult , if not impossible to get the necessary papers because of these ongoing conflicts .
was it reasonable to expect a bosnian muslim to risk death by returning to his serb-occupied home – just to pick up a birth certificate ?
the bureaucratic demands of the slovene authorities were at odds with the realities of wartime yugoslavia . erased in 1992 even so , on feb .
26 , 1992 , those 18,000 people were simply erased from registers .
many of the erased people didn ’ t find out about their illegal status till months , even years , later . the ministry of the interior was responsible for the erasure .
today , alenka mesojedic is the head of the citizenship and naturalization section at the ministry .
she ’ s cautious – and defensive – when confronted with this allegation . “ yes .
no .
no .
it ’ s not correct .
they all remained in the register , but they were not entitled on the rights as the slovenian citizens , " she said . " no one was erased physically , but legally they were not entitled on the rights which were related to the citizens . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : piran fishing village many of these people had lived in slovenia for 10 , 20 , sometimes even 30 years .
from one day to the next they lost everything : their social security , their health care , their driving license , their passport – basically , their identity . matevz krivic is a former constitutional judge and now a legal representative for some of the erased people . “ people lost jobs , people lost pensions , people lost medical care , some of them died , " he said . serious allegations some were deported and at least seven people are known to have committed suicide .
however neva predan of helsinki monitor in slovenia , a human rights organization that has been fighting for the rights of the erased for the past 10 years , goes further . “ it is genocide , " he said .
" it is a very efficient administrative tool of ethnic cleansing and this is a speciality of slovenian authorities and it shows a genocide mind . ” twice – in 1999 and in 2003 - slovenia ’ s highest court has ordered the government to restore the rights of the erased .
but little action seems to have been taken .
the government works on a case-by-case basis , and progress is painfully slow . erwan fouere , the eu ambassador to slovenia , said he remains optimistic that the issue will eventually be resolved .

slovenia has long been hailed as the most promising of the new eu members .
but not everyone has benefited from the nation 's progress : a small ethnic minority known as izbrisani has been simply erased from the books . independent from yugoslavia since 1991 , slovenia inherited a good infrastructure and trade connections , not to mention a fair amount of tourism and modern factories .
today , slovenians enjoy the highest living standards among the former communist countries that entered the european union in may . but in this tiny country of two million people , a small minority has been left out of this rising tide of prosperity .
in fact , they have been left out of just about everything .
they are known as the izbrisani , or " the erased people , " because they were removed from the administrative registers after slovenia declared its independence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : main square in the slovenian capital ljubljana slovenia was practically left untouched by the violent ethnic conflict that tore up yugoslavia in the 1990s .
it has always tried to distance itself from the negative image of the balkans , portraying itself as a modern western nation which respects human rights .
but the tragic fate of the izbrisani suggests slovenia also has its dark chapters and that balkan chauvinism in slovenia is perhaps not as far fetched as many slovenes would like to think . " we are living dead " jemail shatani , 38-year old gypsy , or roma , is originally from kosovo , but settled in slovenia 20 years ago .
he married sanja , also from kosovo , and found a permanent job in slovenia ’ s second largest town maribor working for the city ’ s waste management and water supplies . but in 1992 , shatani ’ s life took a tragic turn .
he discovered , by chance , that he no longer officially existed .
having failed to apply for slovenian citizenship after the country became independent , the authorities had wiped his name from the registers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : map of slovenia " the collapse of yugoslavia and the administrative chaos here in slovenia have put us in a situation where we have died , but are still alive , " shatani said .
" we are living dead .
our fate is worse than that of cats and dogs .
we don ’ t have any identity .
my wife , my kids and myself are stateless .
we are not citizens of any country in this world . "
shatani tried to get new papers in kosovo , but he and his wife were not listed in the state registers there either .
he also sought legal help and then pursued the matter through the courts – without any immediate success . today , 13 years later , he has managed to get his permanent slovenian residency back , but not full citizenship , nor his work permit or passports for his family .
jemail ’ s wife , sanja , hasn ’ t seen her mother and her brother for 15 years now .
her four kids always ask her : " why don ’ t we have a grandmother ? "
it ’ s awful , she said in tears .
without passports you can not go anywhere . no future in slovenia in slovenia , there is no future for his family , shatani said .
if they ever get passports , they will immediately leave the country .
anywhere would be better than slovenia , he added . the " erasure " of shatani and his family is not an isolated case .
when slovenia declared independence , 130,000 or so non-slovene residents were given six months to apply for citizenship .
most completed the necessary paperwork and became slovenian citizens .
but at least 18,000 did not register .
many were not well informed and didn ’ t know about the new legislation .
others were afraid of political persecution : after all , ethnic wars were raging in neighboring bosnia and croatia , and nobody knew what the future would hold . even for those who did want slovenian citizenship , it was difficult , if not impossible to get the necessary papers because of these ongoing conflicts .
was it reasonable to expect a bosnian muslim to risk death by returning to his serb-occupied home – just to pick up a birth certificate ?

26 , 1992 , those 18,000 people were simply erased from registers .
many of the erased people didn ’ t find out about their illegal status till months , even years , later . the ministry of the interior was responsible for the erasure .
today , alenka mesojedic is the head of the citizenship and naturalization section at the ministry .
she ’ s cautious – and defensive – when confronted with this allegation . “ yes .
no .
no .
it ’ s not correct .

slovenia has long been hailed as the most promising of the new eu members .
but not everyone has benefited from the nation 's progress : a small ethnic minority known as izbrisani has been simply erased from the books . independent from yugoslavia since 1991 , slovenia inherited a good infrastructure and trade connections , not to mention a fair amount of tourism and modern factories .
today , slovenians enjoy the highest living standards among the former communist countries that entered the european union in may . but in this tiny country of two million people , a small minority has been left out of this rising tide of prosperity .
in fact , they have been left out of just about everything .
they are known as the izbrisani , or " the erased people , " because they were removed from the administrative registers after slovenia declared its independence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : main square in the slovenian capital ljubljana slovenia was practically left untouched by the violent ethnic conflict that tore up yugoslavia in the 1990s .
it has always tried to distance itself from the negative image of the balkans , portraying itself as a modern western nation which respects human rights .
but the tragic fate of the izbrisani suggests slovenia also has its dark chapters and that balkan chauvinism in slovenia is perhaps not as far fetched as many slovenes would like to think . " we are living dead " jemail shatani , 38-year old gypsy , or roma , is originally from kosovo , but settled in slovenia 20 years ago .

shatani tried to get new papers in kosovo , but he and his wife were not listed in the state registers there either .
he also sought legal help and then pursued the matter through the courts – without any immediate success . today , 13 years later , he has managed to get his permanent slovenian residency back , but not full citizenship , nor his work permit or passports for his family .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 27.11.2004 slovenia 's " erased people " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not their country anymore ?
slovenia has long been hailed as the most promising of the new eu members .
but not everyone has benefited from the nation 's progress : a small ethnic minority known as izbrisani has been simply erased from the books . independent from yugoslavia since 1991 , slovenia inherited a good infrastructure and trade connections , not to mention a fair amount of tourism and modern factories .
today , slovenians enjoy the highest living standards among the former communist countries that entered the european union in may . but in this tiny country of two million people , a small minority has been left out of this rising tide of prosperity .
in fact , they have been left out of just about everything .
they are known as the izbrisani , or " the erased people , " because they were removed from the administrative registers after slovenia declared its independence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : main square in the slovenian capital ljubljana slovenia was practically left untouched by the violent ethnic conflict that tore up yugoslavia in the 1990s .
it has always tried to distance itself from the negative image of the balkans , portraying itself as a modern western nation which respects human rights .
but the tragic fate of the izbrisani suggests slovenia also has its dark chapters and that balkan chauvinism in slovenia is perhaps not as far fetched as many slovenes would like to think . " we are living dead " jemail shatani , 38-year old gypsy , or roma , is originally from kosovo , but settled in slovenia 20 years ago .
he married sanja , also from kosovo , and found a permanent job in slovenia ’ s second largest town maribor working for the city ’ s waste management and water supplies . but in 1992 , shatani ’ s life took a tragic turn .
he discovered , by chance , that he no longer officially existed .
having failed to apply for slovenian citizenship after the country became independent , the authorities had wiped his name from the registers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : map of slovenia " the collapse of yugoslavia and the administrative chaos here in slovenia have put us in a situation where we have died , but are still alive , " shatani said .
" we are living dead .
our fate is worse than that of cats and dogs .
we don ’ t have any identity .
my wife , my kids and myself are stateless .
we are not citizens of any country in this world . "
shatani tried to get new papers in kosovo , but he and his wife were not listed in the state registers there either .
he also sought legal help and then pursued the matter through the courts – without any immediate success . today , 13 years later , he has managed to get his permanent slovenian residency back , but not full citizenship , nor his work permit or passports for his family .
jemail ’ s wife , sanja , hasn ’ t seen her mother and her brother for 15 years now .
her four kids always ask her : " why don ’ t we have a grandmother ? "
it ’ s awful , she said in tears .
without passports you can not go anywhere . no future in slovenia in slovenia , there is no future for his family , shatani said .
if they ever get passports , they will immediately leave the country .
anywhere would be better than slovenia , he added . the " erasure " of shatani and his family is not an isolated case .
when slovenia declared independence , 130,000 or so non-slovene residents were given six months to apply for citizenship .
most completed the necessary paperwork and became slovenian citizens .
but at least 18,000 did not register .
many were not well informed and didn ’ t know about the new legislation .
others were afraid of political persecution : after all , ethnic wars were raging in neighboring bosnia and croatia , and nobody knew what the future would hold . even for those who did want slovenian citizenship , it was difficult , if not impossible to get the necessary papers because of these ongoing conflicts .
was it reasonable to expect a bosnian muslim to risk death by returning to his serb-occupied home – just to pick up a birth certificate ?
the bureaucratic demands of the slovene authorities were at odds with the realities of wartime yugoslavia . erased in 1992 even so , on feb .
26 , 1992 , those 18,000 people were simply erased from registers .
many of the erased people didn ’ t find out about their illegal status till months , even years , later . the ministry of the interior was responsible for the erasure .
today , alenka mesojedic is the head of the citizenship and naturalization section at the ministry .
she ’ s cautious – and defensive – when confronted with this allegation . “ yes .
no .
no .
it ’ s not correct .
they all remained in the register , but they were not entitled on the rights as the slovenian citizens , " she said . " no one was erased physically , but legally they were not entitled on the rights which were related to the citizens . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : piran fishing village many of these people had lived in slovenia for 10 , 20 , sometimes even 30 years .
from one day to the next they lost everything : their social security , their health care , their driving license , their passport – basically , their identity . matevz krivic is a former constitutional judge and now a legal representative for some of the erased people . “ people lost jobs , people lost pensions , people lost medical care , some of them died , " he said . serious allegations some were deported and at least seven people are known to have committed suicide .
however neva predan of helsinki monitor in slovenia , a human rights organization that has been fighting for the rights of the erased for the past 10 years , goes further . “ it is genocide , " he said .
" it is a very efficient administrative tool of ethnic cleansing and this is a speciality of slovenian authorities and it shows a genocide mind . ” twice – in 1999 and in 2003 - slovenia ’ s highest court has ordered the government to restore the rights of the erased .
but little action seems to have been taken .
the government works on a case-by-case basis , and progress is painfully slow . erwan fouere , the eu ambassador to slovenia , said he remains optimistic that the issue will eventually be resolved .
but did brussels even raise the issue of the erased during slovenia ’ s eu accession talks ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovenian and italian workers tear down a border fence between the two countries .
" it never featured in the actual negotiations , but of course in the reports there was always a reference to issues such as the erased , " he said .

slovenia has long been hailed as the most promising of the new eu members .
but not everyone has benefited from the nation 's progress : a small ethnic minority known as izbrisani has been simply erased from the books . independent from yugoslavia since 1991 , slovenia inherited a good infrastructure and trade connections , not to mention a fair amount of tourism and modern factories .
today , slovenians enjoy the highest living standards among the former communist countries that entered the european union in may . but in this tiny country of two million people , a small minority has been left out of this rising tide of prosperity .
in fact , they have been left out of just about everything .
they are known as the izbrisani , or " the erased people , " because they were removed from the administrative registers after slovenia declared its independence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : main square in the slovenian capital ljubljana slovenia was practically left untouched by the violent ethnic conflict that tore up yugoslavia in the 1990s .
it has always tried to distance itself from the negative image of the balkans , portraying itself as a modern western nation which respects human rights .
but the tragic fate of the izbrisani suggests slovenia also has its dark chapters and that balkan chauvinism in slovenia is perhaps not as far fetched as many slovenes would like to think . " we are living dead " jemail shatani , 38-year old gypsy , or roma , is originally from kosovo , but settled in slovenia 20 years ago .
he married sanja , also from kosovo , and found a permanent job in slovenia ’ s second largest town maribor working for the city ’ s waste management and water supplies . but in 1992 , shatani ’ s life took a tragic turn .
he discovered , by chance , that he no longer officially existed .
having failed to apply for slovenian citizenship after the country became independent , the authorities had wiped his name from the registers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : map of slovenia " the collapse of yugoslavia and the administrative chaos here in slovenia have put us in a situation where we have died , but are still alive , " shatani said .
" we are living dead .
our fate is worse than that of cats and dogs .
we don ’ t have any identity .
my wife , my kids and myself are stateless .
we are not citizens of any country in this world . "
shatani tried to get new papers in kosovo , but he and his wife were not listed in the state registers there either .
he also sought legal help and then pursued the matter through the courts – without any immediate success . today , 13 years later , he has managed to get his permanent slovenian residency back , but not full citizenship , nor his work permit or passports for his family .
jemail ’ s wife , sanja , hasn ’ t seen her mother and her brother for 15 years now .
her four kids always ask her : " why don ’ t we have a grandmother ? "
it ’ s awful , she said in tears .
without passports you can not go anywhere . no future in slovenia in slovenia , there is no future for his family , shatani said .
if they ever get passports , they will immediately leave the country .
anywhere would be better than slovenia , he added . the " erasure " of shatani and his family is not an isolated case .
when slovenia declared independence , 130,000 or so non-slovene residents were given six months to apply for citizenship .
most completed the necessary paperwork and became slovenian citizens .
but at least 18,000 did not register .
many were not well informed and didn ’ t know about the new legislation .
others were afraid of political persecution : after all , ethnic wars were raging in neighboring bosnia and croatia , and nobody knew what the future would hold . even for those who did want slovenian citizenship , it was difficult , if not impossible to get the necessary papers because of these ongoing conflicts .
was it reasonable to expect a bosnian muslim to risk death by returning to his serb-occupied home – just to pick up a birth certificate ?
the bureaucratic demands of the slovene authorities were at odds with the realities of wartime yugoslavia . erased in 1992 even so , on feb .
26 , 1992 , those 18,000 people were simply erased from registers .
many of the erased people didn ’ t find out about their illegal status till months , even years , later . the ministry of the interior was responsible for the erasure .
today , alenka mesojedic is the head of the citizenship and naturalization section at the ministry .
she ’ s cautious – and defensive – when confronted with this allegation . “ yes .
no .
no .
it ’ s not correct .
they all remained in the register , but they were not entitled on the rights as the slovenian citizens , " she said . " no one was erased physically , but legally they were not entitled on the rights which were related to the citizens . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : piran fishing village many of these people had lived in slovenia for 10 , 20 , sometimes even 30 years .

it has always tried to distance itself from the negative image of the balkans , portraying itself as a modern western nation which respects human rights .
but the tragic fate of the izbrisani suggests slovenia also has its dark chapters and that balkan chauvinism in slovenia is perhaps not as far fetched as many slovenes would like to think . " we are living dead " jemail shatani , 38-year old gypsy , or roma , is originally from kosovo , but settled in slovenia 20 years ago .
he married sanja , also from kosovo , and found a permanent job in slovenia ’ s second largest town maribor working for the city ’ s waste management and water supplies . but in 1992 , shatani ’ s life took a tragic turn .
he discovered , by chance , that he no longer officially existed .
having failed to apply for slovenian citizenship after the country became independent , the authorities had wiped his name from the registers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : map of slovenia " the collapse of yugoslavia and the administrative chaos here in slovenia have put us in a situation where we have died , but are still alive , " shatani said .
" we are living dead .
our fate is worse than that of cats and dogs .
we don ’ t have any identity .
my wife , my kids and myself are stateless .
we are not citizens of any country in this world . "
shatani tried to get new papers in kosovo , but he and his wife were not listed in the state registers there either .
he also sought legal help and then pursued the matter through the courts – without any immediate success . today , 13 years later , he has managed to get his permanent slovenian residency back , but not full citizenship , nor his work permit or passports for his family .
jemail ’ s wife , sanja , hasn ’ t seen her mother and her brother for 15 years now .
her four kids always ask her : " why don ’ t we have a grandmother ? "
it ’ s awful , she said in tears .
without passports you can not go anywhere . no future in slovenia in slovenia , there is no future for his family , shatani said .
if they ever get passports , they will immediately leave the country .
anywhere would be better than slovenia , he added . the " erasure " of shatani and his family is not an isolated case .
when slovenia declared independence , 130,000 or so non-slovene residents were given six months to apply for citizenship .
most completed the necessary paperwork and became slovenian citizens .
but at least 18,000 did not register .
many were not well informed and didn ’ t know about the new legislation .
others were afraid of political persecution : after all , ethnic wars were raging in neighboring bosnia and croatia , and nobody knew what the future would hold . even for those who did want slovenian citizenship , it was difficult , if not impossible to get the necessary papers because of these ongoing conflicts .
was it reasonable to expect a bosnian muslim to risk death by returning to his serb-occupied home – just to pick up a birth certificate ?
the bureaucratic demands of the slovene authorities were at odds with the realities of wartime yugoslavia . erased in 1992 even so , on feb .
26 , 1992 , those 18,000 people were simply erased from registers .
many of the erased people didn ’ t find out about their illegal status till months , even years , later . the ministry of the interior was responsible for the erasure .
today , alenka mesojedic is the head of the citizenship and naturalization section at the ministry .
she ’ s cautious – and defensive – when confronted with this allegation . “ yes .
no .
no .
it ’ s not correct .
they all remained in the register , but they were not entitled on the rights as the slovenian citizens , " she said . " no one was erased physically , but legally they were not entitled on the rights which were related to the citizens . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : piran fishing village many of these people had lived in slovenia for 10 , 20 , sometimes even 30 years .
from one day to the next they lost everything : their social security , their health care , their driving license , their passport – basically , their identity . matevz krivic is a former constitutional judge and now a legal representative for some of the erased people . “ people lost jobs , people lost pensions , people lost medical care , some of them died , " he said . serious allegations some were deported and at least seven people are known to have committed suicide .
however neva predan of helsinki monitor in slovenia , a human rights organization that has been fighting for the rights of the erased for the past 10 years , goes further . “ it is genocide , " he said .
" it is a very efficient administrative tool of ethnic cleansing and this is a speciality of slovenian authorities and it shows a genocide mind . ” twice – in 1999 and in 2003 - slovenia ’ s highest court has ordered the government to restore the rights of the erased .
but little action seems to have been taken .
the government works on a case-by-case basis , and progress is painfully slow . erwan fouere , the eu ambassador to slovenia , said he remains optimistic that the issue will eventually be resolved .
but did brussels even raise the issue of the erased during slovenia ’ s eu accession talks ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovenian and italian workers tear down a border fence between the two countries .
" it never featured in the actual negotiations , but of course in the reports there was always a reference to issues such as the erased , " he said .
" i think this highlighted that we were aware of the problem and we felt it was important that the legal limbo had to be addressed as speedy as possibly . "

" we will allow only a few days for the negotiation process .
if -lrb- prime minister viktor -rrb- yanukovych wants to drag things out , we will take active measures , " he told a crowd of tens of thousands in kiev 's independence square following friday 's talks which also involved european mediators . " we insist on the following , ” he said .
“ the main precondition for the talks is the holding of new elections for the president of ukraine . " ukraine 's parliament was due to discuss the standoff at an extraordinary session scheduled for saturday .
" the ukrainian parliament has to take political responsibility and evaluate the situation in the country , as well as the actions of the central election commission , " parliament speaker volodymyr litvine had said . rival interests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the church rallies behind yushchenko as a priest blesses the opposition 's flag during a kiev protest yushchenko 's ultimatum came after a day of some of the most feverish street rallies since last sunday 's disputed run-off polls between the two men saw the official vote count go to the moscow-backed prime minister , amid accusations of electoral fraud . outgoing president leonid kuchma put a brave face on a tense situation by reporting that some progress had indeed been made .
" we stand against any use of force that might lead to an escalation of conflict and bloodshed , " he read from a statement signed by the two rivals . " to ensure the negotiation process , the parties established a working group in order to elaborate a joint decision on the settlement of the political crisis , " kuchma ’ s statement went on . but russia , which has openly backed yanukovych and has been exchanging angry rhetoric with the european union over the poll , has encouraged its preferred candidate to stick to the official results showing him the winner .
the kremlin has accused brussels of trying to push its own western agenda in a country russia has long considered a staunch supporter . european union foreign policy chief javier solana told reporters that he had made it clear to ukraine 's leadership that he believed the vote was fraudulent and that future relations between the two sides depended on a " democratic " resolution - a clear statement of support for yushchenko 's demands . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union foreign policy chief javier solana , left , ukraine 's opposition leader viktor yushchenko , center , and polish president aleksander kwasniewski , right , during their meeting in kiev , friday , nov .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 27.11.2004 slovenia 's " erased people " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not their country anymore ?
slovenia has long been hailed as the most promising of the new eu members .
but not everyone has benefited from the nation 's progress : a small ethnic minority known as izbrisani has been simply erased from the books . independent from yugoslavia since 1991 , slovenia inherited a good infrastructure and trade connections , not to mention a fair amount of tourism and modern factories .
today , slovenians enjoy the highest living standards among the former communist countries that entered the european union in may . but in this tiny country of two million people , a small minority has been left out of this rising tide of prosperity .
in fact , they have been left out of just about everything .
they are known as the izbrisani , or " the erased people , " because they were removed from the administrative registers after slovenia declared its independence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : main square in the slovenian capital ljubljana slovenia was practically left untouched by the violent ethnic conflict that tore up yugoslavia in the 1990s .
it has always tried to distance itself from the negative image of the balkans , portraying itself as a modern western nation which respects human rights .
but the tragic fate of the izbrisani suggests slovenia also has its dark chapters and that balkan chauvinism in slovenia is perhaps not as far fetched as many slovenes would like to think . " we are living dead " jemail shatani , 38-year old gypsy , or roma , is originally from kosovo , but settled in slovenia 20 years ago .
he married sanja , also from kosovo , and found a permanent job in slovenia ’ s second largest town maribor working for the city ’ s waste management and water supplies . but in 1992 , shatani ’ s life took a tragic turn .
he discovered , by chance , that he no longer officially existed .
having failed to apply for slovenian citizenship after the country became independent , the authorities had wiped his name from the registers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : map of slovenia " the collapse of yugoslavia and the administrative chaos here in slovenia have put us in a situation where we have died , but are still alive , " shatani said .
" we are living dead .
our fate is worse than that of cats and dogs .
we don ’ t have any identity .
my wife , my kids and myself are stateless .
we are not citizens of any country in this world . "
shatani tried to get new papers in kosovo , but he and his wife were not listed in the state registers there either .
he also sought legal help and then pursued the matter through the courts – without any immediate success . today , 13 years later , he has managed to get his permanent slovenian residency back , but not full citizenship , nor his work permit or passports for his family .
jemail ’ s wife , sanja , hasn ’ t seen her mother and her brother for 15 years now .
her four kids always ask her : " why don ’ t we have a grandmother ? "
it ’ s awful , she said in tears .
without passports you can not go anywhere . no future in slovenia in slovenia , there is no future for his family , shatani said .
if they ever get passports , they will immediately leave the country .
anywhere would be better than slovenia , he added . the " erasure " of shatani and his family is not an isolated case .
when slovenia declared independence , 130,000 or so non-slovene residents were given six months to apply for citizenship .
most completed the necessary paperwork and became slovenian citizens .
but at least 18,000 did not register .
many were not well informed and didn ’ t know about the new legislation .
others were afraid of political persecution : after all , ethnic wars were raging in neighboring bosnia and croatia , and nobody knew what the future would hold . even for those who did want slovenian citizenship , it was difficult , if not impossible to get the necessary papers because of these ongoing conflicts .
was it reasonable to expect a bosnian muslim to risk death by returning to his serb-occupied home – just to pick up a birth certificate ?
the bureaucratic demands of the slovene authorities were at odds with the realities of wartime yugoslavia . erased in 1992 even so , on feb .
26 , 1992 , those 18,000 people were simply erased from registers .
many of the erased people didn ’ t find out about their illegal status till months , even years , later . the ministry of the interior was responsible for the erasure .
today , alenka mesojedic is the head of the citizenship and naturalization section at the ministry .
she ’ s cautious – and defensive – when confronted with this allegation . “ yes .
no .
no .
it ’ s not correct .
they all remained in the register , but they were not entitled on the rights as the slovenian citizens , " she said . " no one was erased physically , but legally they were not entitled on the rights which were related to the citizens . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : piran fishing village many of these people had lived in slovenia for 10 , 20 , sometimes even 30 years .
from one day to the next they lost everything : their social security , their health care , their driving license , their passport – basically , their identity . matevz krivic is a former constitutional judge and now a legal representative for some of the erased people . “ people lost jobs , people lost pensions , people lost medical care , some of them died , " he said . serious allegations some were deported and at least seven people are known to have committed suicide .
however neva predan of helsinki monitor in slovenia , a human rights organization that has been fighting for the rights of the erased for the past 10 years , goes further . “ it is genocide , " he said .
" it is a very efficient administrative tool of ethnic cleansing and this is a speciality of slovenian authorities and it shows a genocide mind . ” twice – in 1999 and in 2003 - slovenia ’ s highest court has ordered the government to restore the rights of the erased .
but little action seems to have been taken .
the government works on a case-by-case basis , and progress is painfully slow . erwan fouere , the eu ambassador to slovenia , said he remains optimistic that the issue will eventually be resolved .

slovenia has long been hailed as the most promising of the new eu members .
but not everyone has benefited from the nation 's progress : a small ethnic minority known as izbrisani has been simply erased from the books . independent from yugoslavia since 1991 , slovenia inherited a good infrastructure and trade connections , not to mention a fair amount of tourism and modern factories .
today , slovenians enjoy the highest living standards among the former communist countries that entered the european union in may . but in this tiny country of two million people , a small minority has been left out of this rising tide of prosperity .
in fact , they have been left out of just about everything .
they are known as the izbrisani , or " the erased people , " because they were removed from the administrative registers after slovenia declared its independence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : main square in the slovenian capital ljubljana slovenia was practically left untouched by the violent ethnic conflict that tore up yugoslavia in the 1990s .
it has always tried to distance itself from the negative image of the balkans , portraying itself as a modern western nation which respects human rights .
but the tragic fate of the izbrisani suggests slovenia also has its dark chapters and that balkan chauvinism in slovenia is perhaps not as far fetched as many slovenes would like to think . " we are living dead " jemail shatani , 38-year old gypsy , or roma , is originally from kosovo , but settled in slovenia 20 years ago .
he married sanja , also from kosovo , and found a permanent job in slovenia ’ s second largest town maribor working for the city ’ s waste management and water supplies . but in 1992 , shatani ’ s life took a tragic turn .
he discovered , by chance , that he no longer officially existed .
having failed to apply for slovenian citizenship after the country became independent , the authorities had wiped his name from the registers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : map of slovenia " the collapse of yugoslavia and the administrative chaos here in slovenia have put us in a situation where we have died , but are still alive , " shatani said .
" we are living dead .
our fate is worse than that of cats and dogs .
we don ’ t have any identity .
my wife , my kids and myself are stateless .
we are not citizens of any country in this world . "
shatani tried to get new papers in kosovo , but he and his wife were not listed in the state registers there either .

" we will allow only a few days for the negotiation process .
if -lrb- prime minister viktor -rrb- yanukovych wants to drag things out , we will take active measures , " he told a crowd of tens of thousands in kiev 's independence square following friday 's talks which also involved european mediators . " we insist on the following , ” he said .
“ the main precondition for the talks is the holding of new elections for the president of ukraine . " ukraine 's parliament was due to discuss the standoff at an extraordinary session scheduled for saturday .
" the ukrainian parliament has to take political responsibility and evaluate the situation in the country , as well as the actions of the central election commission , " parliament speaker volodymyr litvine had said . rival interests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the church rallies behind yushchenko as a priest blesses the opposition 's flag during a kiev protest yushchenko 's ultimatum came after a day of some of the most feverish street rallies since last sunday 's disputed run-off polls between the two men saw the official vote count go to the moscow-backed prime minister , amid accusations of electoral fraud . outgoing president leonid kuchma put a brave face on a tense situation by reporting that some progress had indeed been made .
" we stand against any use of force that might lead to an escalation of conflict and bloodshed , " he read from a statement signed by the two rivals . " to ensure the negotiation process , the parties established a working group in order to elaborate a joint decision on the settlement of the political crisis , " kuchma ’ s statement went on . but russia , which has openly backed yanukovych and has been exchanging angry rhetoric with the european union over the poll , has encouraged its preferred candidate to stick to the official results showing him the winner .
the kremlin has accused brussels of trying to push its own western agenda in a country russia has long considered a staunch supporter . european union foreign policy chief javier solana told reporters that he had made it clear to ukraine 's leadership that he believed the vote was fraudulent and that future relations between the two sides depended on a " democratic " resolution - a clear statement of support for yushchenko 's demands . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union foreign policy chief javier solana , left , ukraine 's opposition leader viktor yushchenko , center , and polish president aleksander kwasniewski , right , during their meeting in kiev , friday , nov .

fellow mediator and polish president aleksander kwasniewski , whose country borders ukraine , called the talks " a good start , but added that " the road to a compromise is still very long . ” yanukovych 's power crumbling ? friday 's roundtable meeting and the parliamentarian debate could be the first signs that ukraine 's seat of power is crumbling . ukraine 's national television news , which throughout the week has aired mostly positive coverage of yanukovych , has begun to feature the opposition . the ukrainian supreme court on monday is due to hear opposition claims that the state rigged the vote in favor of yanukovych .
analysts have said its judges have shown independence in the past and may possibly back yushchenko . however russia appears to be sticking to its guns after president vladimir putin put his own credibility on the line by twice visiting ukraine during the campaign to back yanukovych . russian foreign minister sergei lavrov told reporters in moscow that europe was trying to pull its ally into the western camp by dangerously and illegally fomenting opposition protests . " we are alarmed by attempts by certain governments to steer the situation in ukraine away from a legal path , " lavrov said .
" especially when certain european capitals are declaring that they do not recognize the elections and that ukraine has to be with the west , " he added . afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu joins ukrainian crisis round table ukraine 's two rival presidential candidates met friday for the first time since the disputed weekend vote in the presence of president leonid kuchma and european and russian mediators .

slovenia has long been hailed as the most promising of the new eu members .
but not everyone has benefited from the nation 's progress : a small ethnic minority known as izbrisani has been simply erased from the books . independent from yugoslavia since 1991 , slovenia inherited a good infrastructure and trade connections , not to mention a fair amount of tourism and modern factories .
today , slovenians enjoy the highest living standards among the former communist countries that entered the european union in may . but in this tiny country of two million people , a small minority has been left out of this rising tide of prosperity .
in fact , they have been left out of just about everything .
they are known as the izbrisani , or " the erased people , " because they were removed from the administrative registers after slovenia declared its independence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : main square in the slovenian capital ljubljana slovenia was practically left untouched by the violent ethnic conflict that tore up yugoslavia in the 1990s .
it has always tried to distance itself from the negative image of the balkans , portraying itself as a modern western nation which respects human rights .
but the tragic fate of the izbrisani suggests slovenia also has its dark chapters and that balkan chauvinism in slovenia is perhaps not as far fetched as many slovenes would like to think . " we are living dead " jemail shatani , 38-year old gypsy , or roma , is originally from kosovo , but settled in slovenia 20 years ago .
he married sanja , also from kosovo , and found a permanent job in slovenia ’ s second largest town maribor working for the city ’ s waste management and water supplies . but in 1992 , shatani ’ s life took a tragic turn .
he discovered , by chance , that he no longer officially existed .
having failed to apply for slovenian citizenship after the country became independent , the authorities had wiped his name from the registers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : map of slovenia " the collapse of yugoslavia and the administrative chaos here in slovenia have put us in a situation where we have died , but are still alive , " shatani said .
" we are living dead .
our fate is worse than that of cats and dogs .
we don ’ t have any identity .
my wife , my kids and myself are stateless .
we are not citizens of any country in this world . "
shatani tried to get new papers in kosovo , but he and his wife were not listed in the state registers there either .
he also sought legal help and then pursued the matter through the courts – without any immediate success . today , 13 years later , he has managed to get his permanent slovenian residency back , but not full citizenship , nor his work permit or passports for his family .
jemail ’ s wife , sanja , hasn ’ t seen her mother and her brother for 15 years now .
her four kids always ask her : " why don ’ t we have a grandmother ? "
it ’ s awful , she said in tears .
without passports you can not go anywhere . no future in slovenia in slovenia , there is no future for his family , shatani said .
if they ever get passports , they will immediately leave the country .
anywhere would be better than slovenia , he added . the " erasure " of shatani and his family is not an isolated case .
when slovenia declared independence , 130,000 or so non-slovene residents were given six months to apply for citizenship .
most completed the necessary paperwork and became slovenian citizens .
but at least 18,000 did not register .
many were not well informed and didn ’ t know about the new legislation .
others were afraid of political persecution : after all , ethnic wars were raging in neighboring bosnia and croatia , and nobody knew what the future would hold . even for those who did want slovenian citizenship , it was difficult , if not impossible to get the necessary papers because of these ongoing conflicts .
was it reasonable to expect a bosnian muslim to risk death by returning to his serb-occupied home – just to pick up a birth certificate ?
the bureaucratic demands of the slovene authorities were at odds with the realities of wartime yugoslavia . erased in 1992 even so , on feb .
26 , 1992 , those 18,000 people were simply erased from registers .
many of the erased people didn ’ t find out about their illegal status till months , even years , later . the ministry of the interior was responsible for the erasure .
today , alenka mesojedic is the head of the citizenship and naturalization section at the ministry .
she ’ s cautious – and defensive – when confronted with this allegation . “ yes .
no .
no .
it ’ s not correct .
they all remained in the register , but they were not entitled on the rights as the slovenian citizens , " she said . " no one was erased physically , but legally they were not entitled on the rights which were related to the citizens . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : piran fishing village many of these people had lived in slovenia for 10 , 20 , sometimes even 30 years .
from one day to the next they lost everything : their social security , their health care , their driving license , their passport – basically , their identity . matevz krivic is a former constitutional judge and now a legal representative for some of the erased people . “ people lost jobs , people lost pensions , people lost medical care , some of them died , " he said . serious allegations some were deported and at least seven people are known to have committed suicide .
however neva predan of helsinki monitor in slovenia , a human rights organization that has been fighting for the rights of the erased for the past 10 years , goes further . “ it is genocide , " he said .
" it is a very efficient administrative tool of ethnic cleansing and this is a speciality of slovenian authorities and it shows a genocide mind . ” twice – in 1999 and in 2003 - slovenia ’ s highest court has ordered the government to restore the rights of the erased .
but little action seems to have been taken .
the government works on a case-by-case basis , and progress is painfully slow . erwan fouere , the eu ambassador to slovenia , said he remains optimistic that the issue will eventually be resolved .
but did brussels even raise the issue of the erased during slovenia ’ s eu accession talks ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovenian and italian workers tear down a border fence between the two countries .
" it never featured in the actual negotiations , but of course in the reports there was always a reference to issues such as the erased , " he said .
" i think this highlighted that we were aware of the problem and we felt it was important that the legal limbo had to be addressed as speedy as possibly . "

they are known as the izbrisani , or " the erased people , " because they were removed from the administrative registers after slovenia declared its independence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : main square in the slovenian capital ljubljana slovenia was practically left untouched by the violent ethnic conflict that tore up yugoslavia in the 1990s .
it has always tried to distance itself from the negative image of the balkans , portraying itself as a modern western nation which respects human rights .
but the tragic fate of the izbrisani suggests slovenia also has its dark chapters and that balkan chauvinism in slovenia is perhaps not as far fetched as many slovenes would like to think . " we are living dead " jemail shatani , 38-year old gypsy , or roma , is originally from kosovo , but settled in slovenia 20 years ago .
he married sanja , also from kosovo , and found a permanent job in slovenia ’ s second largest town maribor working for the city ’ s waste management and water supplies . but in 1992 , shatani ’ s life took a tragic turn .
he discovered , by chance , that he no longer officially existed .
having failed to apply for slovenian citizenship after the country became independent , the authorities had wiped his name from the registers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : map of slovenia " the collapse of yugoslavia and the administrative chaos here in slovenia have put us in a situation where we have died , but are still alive , " shatani said .
" we are living dead .
our fate is worse than that of cats and dogs .
we don ’ t have any identity .
my wife , my kids and myself are stateless .
we are not citizens of any country in this world . "
shatani tried to get new papers in kosovo , but he and his wife were not listed in the state registers there either .
he also sought legal help and then pursued the matter through the courts – without any immediate success . today , 13 years later , he has managed to get his permanent slovenian residency back , but not full citizenship , nor his work permit or passports for his family .
jemail ’ s wife , sanja , hasn ’ t seen her mother and her brother for 15 years now .
her four kids always ask her : " why don ’ t we have a grandmother ? "
it ’ s awful , she said in tears .
without passports you can not go anywhere . no future in slovenia in slovenia , there is no future for his family , shatani said .
if they ever get passports , they will immediately leave the country .
anywhere would be better than slovenia , he added . the " erasure " of shatani and his family is not an isolated case .
when slovenia declared independence , 130,000 or so non-slovene residents were given six months to apply for citizenship .
most completed the necessary paperwork and became slovenian citizens .
but at least 18,000 did not register .
many were not well informed and didn ’ t know about the new legislation .
others were afraid of political persecution : after all , ethnic wars were raging in neighboring bosnia and croatia , and nobody knew what the future would hold . even for those who did want slovenian citizenship , it was difficult , if not impossible to get the necessary papers because of these ongoing conflicts .
was it reasonable to expect a bosnian muslim to risk death by returning to his serb-occupied home – just to pick up a birth certificate ?
the bureaucratic demands of the slovene authorities were at odds with the realities of wartime yugoslavia . erased in 1992 even so , on feb .
26 , 1992 , those 18,000 people were simply erased from registers .
many of the erased people didn ’ t find out about their illegal status till months , even years , later . the ministry of the interior was responsible for the erasure .
today , alenka mesojedic is the head of the citizenship and naturalization section at the ministry .
she ’ s cautious – and defensive – when confronted with this allegation . “ yes .
no .
no .
it ’ s not correct .
they all remained in the register , but they were not entitled on the rights as the slovenian citizens , " she said . " no one was erased physically , but legally they were not entitled on the rights which were related to the citizens . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : piran fishing village many of these people had lived in slovenia for 10 , 20 , sometimes even 30 years .
from one day to the next they lost everything : their social security , their health care , their driving license , their passport – basically , their identity . matevz krivic is a former constitutional judge and now a legal representative for some of the erased people . “ people lost jobs , people lost pensions , people lost medical care , some of them died , " he said . serious allegations some were deported and at least seven people are known to have committed suicide .

slovenia has long been hailed as the most promising of the new eu members .
but not everyone has benefited from the nation 's progress : a small ethnic minority known as izbrisani has been simply erased from the books . independent from yugoslavia since 1991 , slovenia inherited a good infrastructure and trade connections , not to mention a fair amount of tourism and modern factories .
today , slovenians enjoy the highest living standards among the former communist countries that entered the european union in may . but in this tiny country of two million people , a small minority has been left out of this rising tide of prosperity .
in fact , they have been left out of just about everything .
they are known as the izbrisani , or " the erased people , " because they were removed from the administrative registers after slovenia declared its independence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : main square in the slovenian capital ljubljana slovenia was practically left untouched by the violent ethnic conflict that tore up yugoslavia in the 1990s .

but the tragic fate of the izbrisani suggests slovenia also has its dark chapters and that balkan chauvinism in slovenia is perhaps not as far fetched as many slovenes would like to think . " we are living dead " jemail shatani , 38-year old gypsy , or roma , is originally from kosovo , but settled in slovenia 20 years ago .
he married sanja , also from kosovo , and found a permanent job in slovenia ’ s second largest town maribor working for the city ’ s waste management and water supplies . but in 1992 , shatani ’ s life took a tragic turn .
he discovered , by chance , that he no longer officially existed .
having failed to apply for slovenian citizenship after the country became independent , the authorities had wiped his name from the registers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : map of slovenia " the collapse of yugoslavia and the administrative chaos here in slovenia have put us in a situation where we have died , but are still alive , " shatani said .
" we are living dead .

shatani tried to get new papers in kosovo , but he and his wife were not listed in the state registers there either .
he also sought legal help and then pursued the matter through the courts – without any immediate success . today , 13 years later , he has managed to get his permanent slovenian residency back , but not full citizenship , nor his work permit or passports for his family .
jemail ’ s wife , sanja , hasn ’ t seen her mother and her brother for 15 years now .
her four kids always ask her : " why don ’ t we have a grandmother ? "
it ’ s awful , she said in tears .
without passports you can not go anywhere . no future in slovenia in slovenia , there is no future for his family , shatani said .

slovenia has long been hailed as the most promising of the new eu members .
but not everyone has benefited from the nation 's progress : a small ethnic minority known as izbrisani has been simply erased from the books . independent from yugoslavia since 1991 , slovenia inherited a good infrastructure and trade connections , not to mention a fair amount of tourism and modern factories .
today , slovenians enjoy the highest living standards among the former communist countries that entered the european union in may . but in this tiny country of two million people , a small minority has been left out of this rising tide of prosperity .
in fact , they have been left out of just about everything .
they are known as the izbrisani , or " the erased people , " because they were removed from the administrative registers after slovenia declared its independence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : main square in the slovenian capital ljubljana slovenia was practically left untouched by the violent ethnic conflict that tore up yugoslavia in the 1990s .
it has always tried to distance itself from the negative image of the balkans , portraying itself as a modern western nation which respects human rights .
but the tragic fate of the izbrisani suggests slovenia also has its dark chapters and that balkan chauvinism in slovenia is perhaps not as far fetched as many slovenes would like to think . " we are living dead " jemail shatani , 38-year old gypsy , or roma , is originally from kosovo , but settled in slovenia 20 years ago .
he married sanja , also from kosovo , and found a permanent job in slovenia ’ s second largest town maribor working for the city ’ s waste management and water supplies . but in 1992 , shatani ’ s life took a tragic turn .
he discovered , by chance , that he no longer officially existed .
having failed to apply for slovenian citizenship after the country became independent , the authorities had wiped his name from the registers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : map of slovenia " the collapse of yugoslavia and the administrative chaos here in slovenia have put us in a situation where we have died , but are still alive , " shatani said .
" we are living dead .
our fate is worse than that of cats and dogs .
we don ’ t have any identity .
my wife , my kids and myself are stateless .
we are not citizens of any country in this world . "
shatani tried to get new papers in kosovo , but he and his wife were not listed in the state registers there either .
he also sought legal help and then pursued the matter through the courts – without any immediate success . today , 13 years later , he has managed to get his permanent slovenian residency back , but not full citizenship , nor his work permit or passports for his family .
jemail ’ s wife , sanja , hasn ’ t seen her mother and her brother for 15 years now .
her four kids always ask her : " why don ’ t we have a grandmother ? "
it ’ s awful , she said in tears .
without passports you can not go anywhere . no future in slovenia in slovenia , there is no future for his family , shatani said .
if they ever get passports , they will immediately leave the country .

" we will allow only a few days for the negotiation process .
if -lrb- prime minister viktor -rrb- yanukovych wants to drag things out , we will take active measures , " he told a crowd of tens of thousands in kiev 's independence square following friday 's talks which also involved european mediators . " we insist on the following , ” he said .
“ the main precondition for the talks is the holding of new elections for the president of ukraine . " ukraine 's parliament was due to discuss the standoff at an extraordinary session scheduled for saturday .
" the ukrainian parliament has to take political responsibility and evaluate the situation in the country , as well as the actions of the central election commission , " parliament speaker volodymyr litvine had said . rival interests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the church rallies behind yushchenko as a priest blesses the opposition 's flag during a kiev protest yushchenko 's ultimatum came after a day of some of the most feverish street rallies since last sunday 's disputed run-off polls between the two men saw the official vote count go to the moscow-backed prime minister , amid accusations of electoral fraud . outgoing president leonid kuchma put a brave face on a tense situation by reporting that some progress had indeed been made .
" we stand against any use of force that might lead to an escalation of conflict and bloodshed , " he read from a statement signed by the two rivals . " to ensure the negotiation process , the parties established a working group in order to elaborate a joint decision on the settlement of the political crisis , " kuchma ’ s statement went on . but russia , which has openly backed yanukovych and has been exchanging angry rhetoric with the european union over the poll , has encouraged its preferred candidate to stick to the official results showing him the winner .
the kremlin has accused brussels of trying to push its own western agenda in a country russia has long considered a staunch supporter . european union foreign policy chief javier solana told reporters that he had made it clear to ukraine 's leadership that he believed the vote was fraudulent and that future relations between the two sides depended on a " democratic " resolution - a clear statement of support for yushchenko 's demands . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union foreign policy chief javier solana , left , ukraine 's opposition leader viktor yushchenko , center , and polish president aleksander kwasniewski , right , during their meeting in kiev , friday , nov .

fellow mediator and polish president aleksander kwasniewski , whose country borders ukraine , called the talks " a good start , but added that " the road to a compromise is still very long . ” yanukovych 's power crumbling ? friday 's roundtable meeting and the parliamentarian debate could be the first signs that ukraine 's seat of power is crumbling . ukraine 's national television news , which throughout the week has aired mostly positive coverage of yanukovych , has begun to feature the opposition . the ukrainian supreme court on monday is due to hear opposition claims that the state rigged the vote in favor of yanukovych .
analysts have said its judges have shown independence in the past and may possibly back yushchenko . however russia appears to be sticking to its guns after president vladimir putin put his own credibility on the line by twice visiting ukraine during the campaign to back yanukovych . russian foreign minister sergei lavrov told reporters in moscow that europe was trying to pull its ally into the western camp by dangerously and illegally fomenting opposition protests . " we are alarmed by attempts by certain governments to steer the situation in ukraine away from a legal path , " lavrov said .
" especially when certain european capitals are declaring that they do not recognize the elections and that ukraine has to be with the west , " he added . afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu joins ukrainian crisis round table ukraine 's two rival presidential candidates met friday for the first time since the disputed weekend vote in the presence of president leonid kuchma and european and russian mediators .

slovenia has long been hailed as the most promising of the new eu members .
but not everyone has benefited from the nation 's progress : a small ethnic minority known as izbrisani has been simply erased from the books . independent from yugoslavia since 1991 , slovenia inherited a good infrastructure and trade connections , not to mention a fair amount of tourism and modern factories .
today , slovenians enjoy the highest living standards among the former communist countries that entered the european union in may . but in this tiny country of two million people , a small minority has been left out of this rising tide of prosperity .
in fact , they have been left out of just about everything .
they are known as the izbrisani , or " the erased people , " because they were removed from the administrative registers after slovenia declared its independence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : main square in the slovenian capital ljubljana slovenia was practically left untouched by the violent ethnic conflict that tore up yugoslavia in the 1990s .
it has always tried to distance itself from the negative image of the balkans , portraying itself as a modern western nation which respects human rights .
but the tragic fate of the izbrisani suggests slovenia also has its dark chapters and that balkan chauvinism in slovenia is perhaps not as far fetched as many slovenes would like to think . " we are living dead " jemail shatani , 38-year old gypsy , or roma , is originally from kosovo , but settled in slovenia 20 years ago .
he married sanja , also from kosovo , and found a permanent job in slovenia ’ s second largest town maribor working for the city ’ s waste management and water supplies . but in 1992 , shatani ’ s life took a tragic turn .
he discovered , by chance , that he no longer officially existed .
having failed to apply for slovenian citizenship after the country became independent , the authorities had wiped his name from the registers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : map of slovenia " the collapse of yugoslavia and the administrative chaos here in slovenia have put us in a situation where we have died , but are still alive , " shatani said .
" we are living dead .
our fate is worse than that of cats and dogs .
we don ’ t have any identity .
my wife , my kids and myself are stateless .
we are not citizens of any country in this world . "
shatani tried to get new papers in kosovo , but he and his wife were not listed in the state registers there either .
he also sought legal help and then pursued the matter through the courts – without any immediate success . today , 13 years later , he has managed to get his permanent slovenian residency back , but not full citizenship , nor his work permit or passports for his family .
jemail ’ s wife , sanja , hasn ’ t seen her mother and her brother for 15 years now .
her four kids always ask her : " why don ’ t we have a grandmother ? "
it ’ s awful , she said in tears .
without passports you can not go anywhere . no future in slovenia in slovenia , there is no future for his family , shatani said .
if they ever get passports , they will immediately leave the country .
anywhere would be better than slovenia , he added . the " erasure " of shatani and his family is not an isolated case .
when slovenia declared independence , 130,000 or so non-slovene residents were given six months to apply for citizenship .
most completed the necessary paperwork and became slovenian citizens .
but at least 18,000 did not register .
many were not well informed and didn ’ t know about the new legislation .
others were afraid of political persecution : after all , ethnic wars were raging in neighboring bosnia and croatia , and nobody knew what the future would hold . even for those who did want slovenian citizenship , it was difficult , if not impossible to get the necessary papers because of these ongoing conflicts .
was it reasonable to expect a bosnian muslim to risk death by returning to his serb-occupied home – just to pick up a birth certificate ?
the bureaucratic demands of the slovene authorities were at odds with the realities of wartime yugoslavia . erased in 1992 even so , on feb .
26 , 1992 , those 18,000 people were simply erased from registers .
many of the erased people didn ’ t find out about their illegal status till months , even years , later . the ministry of the interior was responsible for the erasure .
today , alenka mesojedic is the head of the citizenship and naturalization section at the ministry .
she ’ s cautious – and defensive – when confronted with this allegation . “ yes .
no .
no .
it ’ s not correct .
they all remained in the register , but they were not entitled on the rights as the slovenian citizens , " she said . " no one was erased physically , but legally they were not entitled on the rights which were related to the citizens . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : piran fishing village many of these people had lived in slovenia for 10 , 20 , sometimes even 30 years .
from one day to the next they lost everything : their social security , their health care , their driving license , their passport – basically , their identity . matevz krivic is a former constitutional judge and now a legal representative for some of the erased people . “ people lost jobs , people lost pensions , people lost medical care , some of them died , " he said . serious allegations some were deported and at least seven people are known to have committed suicide .
however neva predan of helsinki monitor in slovenia , a human rights organization that has been fighting for the rights of the erased for the past 10 years , goes further . “ it is genocide , " he said .
" it is a very efficient administrative tool of ethnic cleansing and this is a speciality of slovenian authorities and it shows a genocide mind . ” twice – in 1999 and in 2003 - slovenia ’ s highest court has ordered the government to restore the rights of the erased .
but little action seems to have been taken .
the government works on a case-by-case basis , and progress is painfully slow . erwan fouere , the eu ambassador to slovenia , said he remains optimistic that the issue will eventually be resolved .
but did brussels even raise the issue of the erased during slovenia ’ s eu accession talks ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovenian and italian workers tear down a border fence between the two countries .
" it never featured in the actual negotiations , but of course in the reports there was always a reference to issues such as the erased , " he said .
" i think this highlighted that we were aware of the problem and we felt it was important that the legal limbo had to be addressed as speedy as possibly . "

" we are living dead " jemail shatani , 38-year old gypsy , or roma , is originally from kosovo , but settled in slovenia 20 years ago .
he married sanja , also from kosovo , and found a permanent job in slovenia ’ s second largest town maribor working for the city ’ s waste management and water supplies . but in 1992 , shatani ’ s life took a tragic turn .
he discovered , by chance , that he no longer officially existed .
having failed to apply for slovenian citizenship after the country became independent , the authorities had wiped his name from the registers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : map of slovenia " the collapse of yugoslavia and the administrative chaos here in slovenia have put us in a situation where we have died , but are still alive , " shatani said .
" we are living dead .
our fate is worse than that of cats and dogs .
we don ’ t have any identity .
my wife , my kids and myself are stateless .
we are not citizens of any country in this world . "
shatani tried to get new papers in kosovo , but he and his wife were not listed in the state registers there either .
he also sought legal help and then pursued the matter through the courts – without any immediate success . today , 13 years later , he has managed to get his permanent slovenian residency back , but not full citizenship , nor his work permit or passports for his family .
jemail ’ s wife , sanja , hasn ’ t seen her mother and her brother for 15 years now .
her four kids always ask her : " why don ’ t we have a grandmother ? "
it ’ s awful , she said in tears .
without passports you can not go anywhere . no future in slovenia in slovenia , there is no future for his family , shatani said .
if they ever get passports , they will immediately leave the country .
anywhere would be better than slovenia , he added . the " erasure " of shatani and his family is not an isolated case .
when slovenia declared independence , 130,000 or so non-slovene residents were given six months to apply for citizenship .
most completed the necessary paperwork and became slovenian citizens .
but at least 18,000 did not register .
many were not well informed and didn ’ t know about the new legislation .
others were afraid of political persecution : after all , ethnic wars were raging in neighboring bosnia and croatia , and nobody knew what the future would hold . even for those who did want slovenian citizenship , it was difficult , if not impossible to get the necessary papers because of these ongoing conflicts .
was it reasonable to expect a bosnian muslim to risk death by returning to his serb-occupied home – just to pick up a birth certificate ?
the bureaucratic demands of the slovene authorities were at odds with the realities of wartime yugoslavia . erased in 1992 even so , on feb .
26 , 1992 , those 18,000 people were simply erased from registers .
many of the erased people didn ’ t find out about their illegal status till months , even years , later . the ministry of the interior was responsible for the erasure .
today , alenka mesojedic is the head of the citizenship and naturalization section at the ministry .
she ’ s cautious – and defensive – when confronted with this allegation . “ yes .
no .
no .
it ’ s not correct .
they all remained in the register , but they were not entitled on the rights as the slovenian citizens , " she said . " no one was erased physically , but legally they were not entitled on the rights which were related to the citizens . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : piran fishing village many of these people had lived in slovenia for 10 , 20 , sometimes even 30 years .
from one day to the next they lost everything : their social security , their health care , their driving license , their passport – basically , their identity . matevz krivic is a former constitutional judge and now a legal representative for some of the erased people . “ people lost jobs , people lost pensions , people lost medical care , some of them died , " he said . serious allegations some were deported and at least seven people are known to have committed suicide .
however neva predan of helsinki monitor in slovenia , a human rights organization that has been fighting for the rights of the erased for the past 10 years , goes further . “ it is genocide , " he said .
" it is a very efficient administrative tool of ethnic cleansing and this is a speciality of slovenian authorities and it shows a genocide mind . ” twice – in 1999 and in 2003 - slovenia ’ s highest court has ordered the government to restore the rights of the erased .
but little action seems to have been taken .
the government works on a case-by-case basis , and progress is painfully slow . erwan fouere , the eu ambassador to slovenia , said he remains optimistic that the issue will eventually be resolved .
but did brussels even raise the issue of the erased during slovenia ’ s eu accession talks ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovenian and italian workers tear down a border fence between the two countries .
" it never featured in the actual negotiations , but of course in the reports there was always a reference to issues such as the erased , " he said .
" i think this highlighted that we were aware of the problem and we felt it was important that the legal limbo had to be addressed as speedy as possibly . "

critics had hoped a repeal of law - which solely applies to criticising the church of england - would be announced in the queen 's speech last week .
but home office minister fiona mactaggart told the bbc there were no plans to repeal the law .
lib dem mp evan harris said free discussion of religions was at risk .
he said by keeping the blasphemy law the government was sending out the wrong message to people of other religions - suggesting that restricting free speech was acceptable .
in a free society , we need to ensure that people are free to criticise religions and criticise each others religions lib dem mp evan harris dr harris told bbc radio 4 's today programme : " there is a great deal of worry that such a law will prevent , either directly or indirectly through self-censorship , legitimate criticism of religion , which - given the world we face at the moment - is absolutely critical . "
' discriminatory law ' repealing the blasphemy law would " send a signal " that the new legislation is designed to prevent the incitement of hatred and not to stifle debate , he said .
" people of religious views are sensitive and do take offence , but in a free society , we need to ensure that people are free to criticise religions and criticise each others religions , " said dr harris .
" the government claims that this law is not about restricting the ability to criticise religion , but one key marker of whether we can believe that is whether they abolish the discriminatory law of blasphemy , which specifically protects christian belief and doctrine from attack .
" the problem is that there is a number of , for example , muslim commentators who feel that the law the government is bringing in will give them equality with christianity -lsb- over blasphemy -rsb- .
" if that is n't the case , the government needs to repeal to show that the law they are bringing in is not about restricting the ability of people in a free society to criticise ideas , even if that is offensive . "
whitehouse prosecution in a statement , the home office told the bbc : " the priority is to fill the gap in criminal law so that people of all faiths are protected against incitement to religious hatred .
" it is going to be taken forward in the serious organised crime and police bill .
the home office will continue to keep blasphemy laws under review but at the moment we have no plans for repeal . "
there have been no public prosecutions for blasphemy since 1922 when john william gott was sentenced to nine months ' hard labour for comparing jesus with a circus clown the only successful private prosecution since then was the case brought by mary whitehouse in 1977 against gay news over a poem it printed depicting christ as a promiscuous homosexual .

critics had hoped a repeal of law - which solely applies to criticising the church of england - would be announced in the queen 's speech last week .
but home office minister fiona mactaggart told the bbc there were no plans to repeal the law .
lib dem mp evan harris said free discussion of religions was at risk .
he said by keeping the blasphemy law the government was sending out the wrong message to people of other religions - suggesting that restricting free speech was acceptable .
in a free society , we need to ensure that people are free to criticise religions and criticise each others religions lib dem mp evan harris dr harris told bbc radio 4 's today programme : " there is a great deal of worry that such a law will prevent , either directly or indirectly through self-censorship , legitimate criticism of religion , which - given the world we face at the moment - is absolutely critical . "
' discriminatory law ' repealing the blasphemy law would " send a signal " that the new legislation is designed to prevent the incitement of hatred and not to stifle debate , he said .
" people of religious views are sensitive and do take offence , but in a free society , we need to ensure that people are free to criticise religions and criticise each others religions , " said dr harris .
" the government claims that this law is not about restricting the ability to criticise religion , but one key marker of whether we can believe that is whether they abolish the discriminatory law of blasphemy , which specifically protects christian belief and doctrine from attack .
" the problem is that there is a number of , for example , muslim commentators who feel that the law the government is bringing in will give them equality with christianity -lsb- over blasphemy -rsb- .
" if that is n't the case , the government needs to repeal to show that the law they are bringing in is not about restricting the ability of people in a free society to criticise ideas , even if that is offensive . "
whitehouse prosecution in a statement , the home office told the bbc : " the priority is to fill the gap in criminal law so that people of all faiths are protected against incitement to religious hatred .
" it is going to be taken forward in the serious organised crime and police bill .
the home office will continue to keep blasphemy laws under review but at the moment we have no plans for repeal . "
there have been no public prosecutions for blasphemy since 1922 when john william gott was sentenced to nine months ' hard labour for comparing jesus with a circus clown the only successful private prosecution since then was the case brought by mary whitehouse in 1977 against gay news over a poem it printed depicting christ as a promiscuous homosexual .

an exhibition featuring a copy of the lindisfarne gospels opens at bede 's world in south tyneside on saturday .
it is part of a tour to give people the chance to see what has been described as one of the most extraordinary works of religious art ever made .
the gospels are believed to have been produced around 715-720 ad by eadfrith , bishop of lindisfarne .
the lindisfarne gospels facsimile tour has been put together by the british library in london and north east museums libraries and archives council .
the original gospels are in the british library despite an ongoing campaign to return them to the north east .
the gospels are widely regarded as one of the most important books in british history .
the gospels used revolutionary printing techniques they detail the rise of a coherent british society around the legend of st cuthbert , the patron saint of northumbria .
bede 's world curator laura sole said the centre was a very appropriate setting for the beginning of the tour .
she said : " the lindisfarne gospels were written during bede 's own lifetime , he may even have advised on the text .
" the monastery of wearmouth-jarrow introduced artistic ideas to northumbria which formed part of the inspiration of eadfrith , the artist scribe of the gospels . "
other events , including lectures , are taking place to support the exhibition which continues until 30 january 2005 .

security measures meant the 1,900-strong audience had time to admire the slate , steel and glass building .
slightly chilled audience members finally emerged from the security screens , wide-eyed , in front of the airport-style check-in desk -lrb- programmes , tickets and cloakroom in one -rrb- to start exploring .
with good humour , people repeatedly bumped into each other as they hunted for function rooms , bars , and toilets .
the show honoured welsh legends dame shirley bassey , dame gwyneth jones , alan hoddinott , sian phillips , and the late richard burton , who was represented by daughter kate .
the magnificent auditorium , dominated by layers of welsh woods and a proscenium edged in glittering copper , proved itself as a fitting showcase for a myriad of welsh and international talent .
dylan thomas ' under milkwood opening line , " to begin at the beginning " , spoken by burton , welcomed the resident companies to the stage with dancers spelling out " croeso " -lrb- " welcome " in welsh -rrb- and , echoing the words of the opening song , " something to be proud of " .
the project 's greatest ambassador , bryn terfel , welcomed the world to the " new beacon for wales " , adding : " there 's not a dry eye in the house already " .
english-speaking fiona phillips and welsh-speaking rhodri owen , both tv presenters , compered the show , elegantly balancing the bilingual approach , carried through by those both fluent in the language and those , like sir derek jacobi , willing to have a stab at it .
even nana mouskouri sang in welsh during the tribute to cardiff icon shirley bassey .
conductor alan hoddinott 's tribute included pendyrus choir , royal harpist catrin finch , and a new commission for wmc resident dance company diversions .
bafta-winning actress sian phillips ' tribute brought sir ian mckellan and sir derek jacobi to the stage , to laud , in ian mckellan 's words , the only woman to get a standing ovation in oldham .
then it was to try out the bars and function rooms and a chance to peep through the magnificent windows spelling out its bilingual message in these stones horizons sing .
show director ken caswell had to break the news that the safety curtain would not rise and a " 10-minute wait " , which lasted 25 minutes , was the preferred option to sending everyone home .
in blitz-style the audience responded with choruses of bread of heaven and we 'll keep a welcome in the hillside .
the delay also gave plenty of time to be awe-struck at the size and design of the auditorium but also to note how the seats were not particularly comfortable .
they were surprisingly small and cramped , the arms short and wooden , and with only a little bit of padding - but , oddly , not where your arms rest most of the time .
for the welsh national opera , which had waited 50 years to perform in its own home , a 25-minute delay must have seemed a trifle .
but fiona phillips ' quip after the delay - " are you still with us dame gwyneth ? " - raised a titter .
honouring opera 's dame gwyneth jones , soloists from the birmingham royal ballet were followed by bryn terfel and dennis o 'neill bringing the house down with the pearl fishers duet .
then , to honour richard burton , matthew rhys , michael sheen , jonathan pryce , and ruth madoc performed works associated with the giant : under milkwood , hamlet , and the musical camelot .
the mixed-bag of a show reflecting the nature of the venue closed with the banners of all the welsh counties , a giant welsh dragon and a rousing welsh national anthem .
the long queues to enter the building , presumably temporary , were replaced by long queues for the cloakroom , hopefully temporary .
