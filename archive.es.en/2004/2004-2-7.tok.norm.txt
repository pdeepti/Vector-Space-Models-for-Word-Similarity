at an international security meeting in munich , germany calls for the creation of a new u.s. and european peace plan for the middle east as donald rumsfeld again explains washington ’ s justification for the iraq war . one year after their famous sparring match over the planned iraq war , german foreign minister joschka fischer and united states secretary of defense donald rumsfeld again came together in munich on saturday .
though the trend in the transatlantic relationship is upward , discomfort between the two countries was still palpable at the 40th international security conference here as fischer defended germany ’ s opposition to the war and rumsfeld once again defended the u.s.-led invasion .
" the federal government feels that events have proven the position it took at the time to be right , " he said .
" it was our political decision not to join the coalition because we were not , and are still not , convinced of the validity of the reasons for war . "
still , fischer said it was crucial that the war be brought to a successful conclusion and that peace be found .
" for a failure would have had equally damaging consequences for us all , for europe as for america , for pro-war and anti-war countries , " he said .
" this conviction informed germany 's position during and after the war on iraq . "
germany : no troops for iraq fischer also expressed " deep skepticism " of any kind of nato mission in iraq , adding that germany would not stand in the way of such a mission but neither would berlin send any troops .
he also repeated german demands that the united nations be given a central leadership role in iraq .
the foreign minister called for a " sustainable long-term reform process in the region as a whole , " without which it would be impossible to bring lasting peace .
" notwithstanding the controversy about the war in iraq , we have long shared the view that following sept .
11 , 2001 , neither the u.s. nor europe and the middle east itself can tolerate the status quo in the middle east any longer , " he said .
" the middle east is at the epicenter of the greatest threat to our regional and global security at the dawn of this century : destructive jihadist terrorism with its totalitarian ideology .
this brand of terrorism does not only pose a threat to the societies of the west , but also and above all to the islamic and arab world . "
germany offers new peace plan bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer , center , stands with german defense minister peter struck , left , and nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer to wait for the start of the 40th munich conference on security policy in munich , southern germany , saturday , feb .

-lrb- ap photo / diether endlicher -rrb- spezialbild additionally , fischer proposed a new transatlantic initiative in the middle east structured around nato .
" in order to succeed , the european union and the us should , in view of this major challenge to our common security , pool their capabilities , assets and projects to form a new transatlantic initiative for the middle east . "
the foreign minister ’ s plan would come in two phases .
first , nato countries would come a common middle east policy while , simultaneously , europe and the u.s would further expand economic ties and possibly establish a free-trade zone with the middle east .
northern african countries and the entire arab league would be brought into the dialog in order to stop terrorism that is taking root there .
afterwards , the countries would create a binding agreement calling for them to disarm and renounce violence .
" if the states of europe and north america work together strategically as partners in the european union and in nato in response to the common threat , " fischer said , " and if they bring their particular abilities and strengths to bear in a new cooperation with the states of the middle east , then we can make this truly paramount contribution to our joint security . "
but fischer said military missions means would not be enough to halt the violence in the middle east .
" we can not counter the threat of this new totalitarianism by military means alone .
our response needs to be as all-encompassing as the threat .
and this response can not be issued by the west alone .
if we were to adopt a paternalistic attitude , we would only inflict the first defeat upon ourselves .
instead we must formulate a serious offer based on genuine cooperation , an offer to work together with the states and societies of the region . "
rumsfeld : " world is a safer place " u.s. defense secretary rumsfeld , however , took a different view .
" the world is a safer place today because the coalition liberated 50 million people – 25 million in afghanistan and 25 million in iraq , " he told his audience of experts .
rumsfeld only fleetingly addressed fischer ’ s proposal .
the mediterranean dialog at nato needs to be put on the agenda for the coming nato summit this summer in istanbul .
still , nato needs to strengthen its participation in the war against terrorism in the future as the threat of weapons of mass destruction are greater than ever , he said .
" unless the spread of terrorism is stopped , attacks will grow bolder and still more deadly . "
the defense secretary also offered an alternative view of nato cooperation , saying that numerous nato troops are already deployed in iraq and afghanistan , with some members stationing soldiers in both places .
" some 24 of the 26 nato allies and invitees already have forces in either afghanistan or iraq and 17 of them have forces in both afghanistan and iraq , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 07.02.2004 czechs and slovaks struggle with nuclear legacy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian environmental activists are strongly opposed to the czech temelin nuclear power plant .
when eight central and eastern european countries join the european union in may , they will bring a number of problematic nuclear reactors with them .
the czech republic and slovakia are receiving particular scrutiny . although the eu is imposing strict rules on everything from farming to food safety on the acceding countries , brussels would strangely appear to have a rather casual approach to the topic of nuclear reactors .
despite plenty of concern about old soviet-era reactors , it would appear the west ’ s political or economic interests are taking priority . of all the former east bloc countries , the czech republic and slovakia are coming in for most of the criticism over safety due to their proximity to old western border of the eu .
wedged next to germany and austria , what was once czechoslovakia was already an industrialized country during communist times . steel and coal , heavy industry , weapons and mechanical engineering , chemical and auto industries were all important areas of production .
energy consumption was correspondingly high and was met above all by means of nuclear power . today there are four nuclear power sites on the territory of the former czechoslovakia : temelin and dukovany in the czech republic , plus jaslovske bohunyitze and mochovtze in slovakia .
in the czech republic three new nuclear reactors are to be built in the next few years , if the government ’ s plans are implemented .
and that has some czech activists concerned . “ it seems to us that the industry ministry intends to re-introduce the planned economy , ” marta heveryova of the european forum for effective energy use in prague said .
“ both energy consumption and production are being dictated .
it ’ s the same as under communism . ” communist technology the technology of the nuclear power plants operated in the czech republic and slovakia today also stems from communist times .
nonetheless , there are big differences : although the southern bohemian temelin produces most of the headlines because of its proximity to austria and bavaria and a string of mishaps , it is one of the newest and is considered one of the safest nuclear power plants in what was the eastern bloc . the international atomic energy agency in vienna even considers temelin to be safer than a number of germany ’ s older reactors .
but opponents criticize above all the mix of soviet reactor technology and american safety technology .
much more problematic than temelin is dukovany , whose reactors are not protected by a safety shell .
a plane crash would have disastrous results here and a military airbase is situated just nearby . in slovakia , there are two fairly new reactors in mochovtze , which the german siemens concern helped to modernize .
in jaslovske bohunyitze , two chernobyl-type reactors are in operation .
this slovak nuclear power plant is one of the few examples where the european union has made its early closing down a condition for membership to the bloc .
one reactor is to be switched off by 2006 and the other by 2008 . increasing opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : temelin .
meanwhile , people in the czech republic are also stepping up their resistance to new atomic power plants and to the planned nuclear waste depots .
numerous local authorities have already rejected such depots in their vicinity . in the czech republic , running the country ’ s own nuclear power plants was long seen as a question of national sovereignty and eco-activists were considered nutcases .
the sometimes militant actions by temelin opponents from austria have intensified this perception . “ blockading borders , for instance , is clearly harmful , ” said vladimir halama of a czech anti-temelin initiative .
“ it would be more helpful if local authorities in other countries gave us some advice – authorities that have experience with the production of alternative energy . ” but there are economic arguments to consider , since the czech republic and slovakia export large quantities of electricity . “ last year , she says , the czech reopublic exported a record 19 terawatt hours , corresponding to the annual production of temelin ’ s two reactor blocks , ” said halama . state monopoly structures in both the czech republic and slovakia have remained in place nearly 15 years after the fall of communism and there is little or no competition in the energy sector .
unfortunately , that will not change after the forthcoming privatization of the industry .
both the czechs and slovaks only want to sell their power plants as a package .
possible bidders are the french company eléctricité de france and germany ’ s e.on. christoph scheffer -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany starts nuclear energy phase-out germany 's future is looking a lot greener with the closure of the stade nuclear reactor power plant on friday .

energy consumption was correspondingly high and was met above all by means of nuclear power . today there are four nuclear power sites on the territory of the former czechoslovakia : temelin and dukovany in the czech republic , plus jaslovske bohunyitze and mochovtze in slovakia .
in the czech republic three new nuclear reactors are to be built in the next few years , if the government ’ s plans are implemented .

nonetheless , there are big differences : although the southern bohemian temelin produces most of the headlines because of its proximity to austria and bavaria and a string of mishaps , it is one of the newest and is considered one of the safest nuclear power plants in what was the eastern bloc . the international atomic energy agency in vienna even considers temelin to be safer than a number of germany ’ s older reactors .
but opponents criticize above all the mix of soviet reactor technology and american safety technology .
much more problematic than temelin is dukovany , whose reactors are not protected by a safety shell .
a plane crash would have disastrous results here and a military airbase is situated just nearby . in slovakia , there are two fairly new reactors in mochovtze , which the german siemens concern helped to modernize .

numerous local authorities have already rejected such depots in their vicinity . in the czech republic , running the country ’ s own nuclear power plants was long seen as a question of national sovereignty and eco-activists were considered nutcases .
the sometimes militant actions by temelin opponents from austria have intensified this perception . “ blockading borders , for instance , is clearly harmful , ” said vladimir halama of a czech anti-temelin initiative .
“ it would be more helpful if local authorities in other countries gave us some advice – authorities that have experience with the production of alternative energy . ” but there are economic arguments to consider , since the czech republic and slovakia export large quantities of electricity . “ last year , she says , the czech reopublic exported a record 19 terawatt hours , corresponding to the annual production of temelin ’ s two reactor blocks , ” said halama . state monopoly structures in both the czech republic and slovakia have remained in place nearly 15 years after the fall of communism and there is little or no competition in the energy sector .

when eight central and eastern european countries join the european union in may , they will bring a number of problematic nuclear reactors with them .
the czech republic and slovakia are receiving particular scrutiny . although the eu is imposing strict rules on everything from farming to food safety on the acceding countries , brussels would strangely appear to have a rather casual approach to the topic of nuclear reactors .
despite plenty of concern about old soviet-era reactors , it would appear the west ’ s political or economic interests are taking priority . of all the former east bloc countries , the czech republic and slovakia are coming in for most of the criticism over safety due to their proximity to old western border of the eu .
wedged next to germany and austria , what was once czechoslovakia was already an industrialized country during communist times . steel and coal , heavy industry , weapons and mechanical engineering , chemical and auto industries were all important areas of production .
energy consumption was correspondingly high and was met above all by means of nuclear power . today there are four nuclear power sites on the territory of the former czechoslovakia : temelin and dukovany in the czech republic , plus jaslovske bohunyitze and mochovtze in slovakia .
in the czech republic three new nuclear reactors are to be built in the next few years , if the government ’ s plans are implemented .
and that has some czech activists concerned . “ it seems to us that the industry ministry intends to re-introduce the planned economy , ” marta heveryova of the european forum for effective energy use in prague said .
“ both energy consumption and production are being dictated .
it ’ s the same as under communism . ” communist technology the technology of the nuclear power plants operated in the czech republic and slovakia today also stems from communist times .
nonetheless , there are big differences : although the southern bohemian temelin produces most of the headlines because of its proximity to austria and bavaria and a string of mishaps , it is one of the newest and is considered one of the safest nuclear power plants in what was the eastern bloc . the international atomic energy agency in vienna even considers temelin to be safer than a number of germany ’ s older reactors .
but opponents criticize above all the mix of soviet reactor technology and american safety technology .
much more problematic than temelin is dukovany , whose reactors are not protected by a safety shell .
a plane crash would have disastrous results here and a military airbase is situated just nearby . in slovakia , there are two fairly new reactors in mochovtze , which the german siemens concern helped to modernize .
in jaslovske bohunyitze , two chernobyl-type reactors are in operation .
this slovak nuclear power plant is one of the few examples where the european union has made its early closing down a condition for membership to the bloc .
one reactor is to be switched off by 2006 and the other by 2008 . increasing opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : temelin .
meanwhile , people in the czech republic are also stepping up their resistance to new atomic power plants and to the planned nuclear waste depots .
numerous local authorities have already rejected such depots in their vicinity . in the czech republic , running the country ’ s own nuclear power plants was long seen as a question of national sovereignty and eco-activists were considered nutcases .
the sometimes militant actions by temelin opponents from austria have intensified this perception . “ blockading borders , for instance , is clearly harmful , ” said vladimir halama of a czech anti-temelin initiative .
“ it would be more helpful if local authorities in other countries gave us some advice – authorities that have experience with the production of alternative energy . ” but there are economic arguments to consider , since the czech republic and slovakia export large quantities of electricity . “ last year , she says , the czech reopublic exported a record 19 terawatt hours , corresponding to the annual production of temelin ’ s two reactor blocks , ” said halama . state monopoly structures in both the czech republic and slovakia have remained in place nearly 15 years after the fall of communism and there is little or no competition in the energy sector .
unfortunately , that will not change after the forthcoming privatization of the industry .

at an international security meeting in munich , germany calls for the creation of a new u.s. and european peace plan for the middle east as donald rumsfeld again explains washington ’ s justification for the iraq war . one year after their famous sparring match over the planned iraq war , german foreign minister joschka fischer and united states secretary of defense donald rumsfeld again came together in munich on saturday .
though the trend in the transatlantic relationship is upward , discomfort between the two countries was still palpable at the 40th international security conference here as fischer defended germany ’ s opposition to the war and rumsfeld once again defended the u.s.-led invasion .
" the federal government feels that events have proven the position it took at the time to be right , " he said .
" it was our political decision not to join the coalition because we were not , and are still not , convinced of the validity of the reasons for war . "
still , fischer said it was crucial that the war be brought to a successful conclusion and that peace be found .
" for a failure would have had equally damaging consequences for us all , for europe as for america , for pro-war and anti-war countries , " he said .
" this conviction informed germany 's position during and after the war on iraq . "
germany : no troops for iraq fischer also expressed " deep skepticism " of any kind of nato mission in iraq , adding that germany would not stand in the way of such a mission but neither would berlin send any troops .
he also repeated german demands that the united nations be given a central leadership role in iraq .
the foreign minister called for a " sustainable long-term reform process in the region as a whole , " without which it would be impossible to bring lasting peace .
" notwithstanding the controversy about the war in iraq , we have long shared the view that following sept .
11 , 2001 , neither the u.s. nor europe and the middle east itself can tolerate the status quo in the middle east any longer , " he said .
" the middle east is at the epicenter of the greatest threat to our regional and global security at the dawn of this century : destructive jihadist terrorism with its totalitarian ideology .
this brand of terrorism does not only pose a threat to the societies of the west , but also and above all to the islamic and arab world . "
germany offers new peace plan bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer , center , stands with german defense minister peter struck , left , and nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer to wait for the start of the 40th munich conference on security policy in munich , southern germany , saturday , feb .
7 , 2004 .
-lrb- ap photo / diether endlicher -rrb- spezialbild additionally , fischer proposed a new transatlantic initiative in the middle east structured around nato .
" in order to succeed , the european union and the us should , in view of this major challenge to our common security , pool their capabilities , assets and projects to form a new transatlantic initiative for the middle east . "
the foreign minister ’ s plan would come in two phases .
first , nato countries would come a common middle east policy while , simultaneously , europe and the u.s would further expand economic ties and possibly establish a free-trade zone with the middle east .
northern african countries and the entire arab league would be brought into the dialog in order to stop terrorism that is taking root there .
afterwards , the countries would create a binding agreement calling for them to disarm and renounce violence .
" if the states of europe and north america work together strategically as partners in the european union and in nato in response to the common threat , " fischer said , " and if they bring their particular abilities and strengths to bear in a new cooperation with the states of the middle east , then we can make this truly paramount contribution to our joint security . "
but fischer said military missions means would not be enough to halt the violence in the middle east .
" we can not counter the threat of this new totalitarianism by military means alone .
our response needs to be as all-encompassing as the threat .
and this response can not be issued by the west alone .
if we were to adopt a paternalistic attitude , we would only inflict the first defeat upon ourselves .
instead we must formulate a serious offer based on genuine cooperation , an offer to work together with the states and societies of the region . "
rumsfeld : " world is a safer place " u.s. defense secretary rumsfeld , however , took a different view .
" the world is a safer place today because the coalition liberated 50 million people – 25 million in afghanistan and 25 million in iraq , " he told his audience of experts .
rumsfeld only fleetingly addressed fischer ’ s proposal .
the mediterranean dialog at nato needs to be put on the agenda for the coming nato summit this summer in istanbul .
still , nato needs to strengthen its participation in the war against terrorism in the future as the threat of weapons of mass destruction are greater than ever , he said .
" unless the spread of terrorism is stopped , attacks will grow bolder and still more deadly . "
the defense secretary also offered an alternative view of nato cooperation , saying that numerous nato troops are already deployed in iraq and afghanistan , with some members stationing soldiers in both places .
" some 24 of the 26 nato allies and invitees already have forces in either afghanistan or iraq and 17 of them have forces in both afghanistan and iraq , " he said .

at an international security meeting in munich , germany calls for the creation of a new u.s. and european peace plan for the middle east as donald rumsfeld again explains washington ’ s justification for the iraq war . one year after their famous sparring match over the planned iraq war , german foreign minister joschka fischer and united states secretary of defense donald rumsfeld again came together in munich on saturday .
though the trend in the transatlantic relationship is upward , discomfort between the two countries was still palpable at the 40th international security conference here as fischer defended germany ’ s opposition to the war and rumsfeld once again defended the u.s.-led invasion .
" the federal government feels that events have proven the position it took at the time to be right , " he said .
" it was our political decision not to join the coalition because we were not , and are still not , convinced of the validity of the reasons for war . "
still , fischer said it was crucial that the war be brought to a successful conclusion and that peace be found .
" for a failure would have had equally damaging consequences for us all , for europe as for america , for pro-war and anti-war countries , " he said .
" this conviction informed germany 's position during and after the war on iraq . "
germany : no troops for iraq fischer also expressed " deep skepticism " of any kind of nato mission in iraq , adding that germany would not stand in the way of such a mission but neither would berlin send any troops .
he also repeated german demands that the united nations be given a central leadership role in iraq .
the foreign minister called for a " sustainable long-term reform process in the region as a whole , " without which it would be impossible to bring lasting peace .
" notwithstanding the controversy about the war in iraq , we have long shared the view that following sept .
11 , 2001 , neither the u.s. nor europe and the middle east itself can tolerate the status quo in the middle east any longer , " he said .
" the middle east is at the epicenter of the greatest threat to our regional and global security at the dawn of this century : destructive jihadist terrorism with its totalitarian ideology .
this brand of terrorism does not only pose a threat to the societies of the west , but also and above all to the islamic and arab world . "
germany offers new peace plan bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer , center , stands with german defense minister peter struck , left , and nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer to wait for the start of the 40th munich conference on security policy in munich , southern germany , saturday , feb .
7 , 2004 .
-lrb- ap photo / diether endlicher -rrb- spezialbild additionally , fischer proposed a new transatlantic initiative in the middle east structured around nato .
" in order to succeed , the european union and the us should , in view of this major challenge to our common security , pool their capabilities , assets and projects to form a new transatlantic initiative for the middle east . "
the foreign minister ’ s plan would come in two phases .
first , nato countries would come a common middle east policy while , simultaneously , europe and the u.s would further expand economic ties and possibly establish a free-trade zone with the middle east .
northern african countries and the entire arab league would be brought into the dialog in order to stop terrorism that is taking root there .
afterwards , the countries would create a binding agreement calling for them to disarm and renounce violence .
" if the states of europe and north america work together strategically as partners in the european union and in nato in response to the common threat , " fischer said , " and if they bring their particular abilities and strengths to bear in a new cooperation with the states of the middle east , then we can make this truly paramount contribution to our joint security . "
but fischer said military missions means would not be enough to halt the violence in the middle east .
" we can not counter the threat of this new totalitarianism by military means alone .
our response needs to be as all-encompassing as the threat .
and this response can not be issued by the west alone .
if we were to adopt a paternalistic attitude , we would only inflict the first defeat upon ourselves .
instead we must formulate a serious offer based on genuine cooperation , an offer to work together with the states and societies of the region . "
rumsfeld : " world is a safer place " u.s. defense secretary rumsfeld , however , took a different view .
" the world is a safer place today because the coalition liberated 50 million people – 25 million in afghanistan and 25 million in iraq , " he told his audience of experts .
rumsfeld only fleetingly addressed fischer ’ s proposal .
the mediterranean dialog at nato needs to be put on the agenda for the coming nato summit this summer in istanbul .
still , nato needs to strengthen its participation in the war against terrorism in the future as the threat of weapons of mass destruction are greater than ever , he said .
" unless the spread of terrorism is stopped , attacks will grow bolder and still more deadly . "
the defense secretary also offered an alternative view of nato cooperation , saying that numerous nato troops are already deployed in iraq and afghanistan , with some members stationing soldiers in both places .
" some 24 of the 26 nato allies and invitees already have forces in either afghanistan or iraq and 17 of them have forces in both afghanistan and iraq , " he said .
rumsfeld also praised nato , noting its development in recent years and the numerous military missions it has undertaken . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder backs eurocorps deployment in afghanistan german chancellor gerhard schröder on friday said he supported expanding peacekeeping operations in afghanistan , but remained cool to merging the nato deployment with the u.s. military campaign in the country .

at an international security meeting in munich , germany calls for the creation of a new u.s. and european peace plan for the middle east as donald rumsfeld again explains washington ’ s justification for the iraq war . one year after their famous sparring match over the planned iraq war , german foreign minister joschka fischer and united states secretary of defense donald rumsfeld again came together in munich on saturday .
though the trend in the transatlantic relationship is upward , discomfort between the two countries was still palpable at the 40th international security conference here as fischer defended germany ’ s opposition to the war and rumsfeld once again defended the u.s.-led invasion .
" the federal government feels that events have proven the position it took at the time to be right , " he said .
" it was our political decision not to join the coalition because we were not , and are still not , convinced of the validity of the reasons for war . "
still , fischer said it was crucial that the war be brought to a successful conclusion and that peace be found .
" for a failure would have had equally damaging consequences for us all , for europe as for america , for pro-war and anti-war countries , " he said .
" this conviction informed germany 's position during and after the war on iraq . "
germany : no troops for iraq fischer also expressed " deep skepticism " of any kind of nato mission in iraq , adding that germany would not stand in the way of such a mission but neither would berlin send any troops .
he also repeated german demands that the united nations be given a central leadership role in iraq .
the foreign minister called for a " sustainable long-term reform process in the region as a whole , " without which it would be impossible to bring lasting peace .
" notwithstanding the controversy about the war in iraq , we have long shared the view that following sept .
11 , 2001 , neither the u.s. nor europe and the middle east itself can tolerate the status quo in the middle east any longer , " he said .
" the middle east is at the epicenter of the greatest threat to our regional and global security at the dawn of this century : destructive jihadist terrorism with its totalitarian ideology .
this brand of terrorism does not only pose a threat to the societies of the west , but also and above all to the islamic and arab world . "
germany offers new peace plan bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer , center , stands with german defense minister peter struck , left , and nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer to wait for the start of the 40th munich conference on security policy in munich , southern germany , saturday , feb .

-lrb- ap photo / diether endlicher -rrb- spezialbild additionally , fischer proposed a new transatlantic initiative in the middle east structured around nato .
" in order to succeed , the european union and the us should , in view of this major challenge to our common security , pool their capabilities , assets and projects to form a new transatlantic initiative for the middle east . "
the foreign minister ’ s plan would come in two phases .
first , nato countries would come a common middle east policy while , simultaneously , europe and the u.s would further expand economic ties and possibly establish a free-trade zone with the middle east .
northern african countries and the entire arab league would be brought into the dialog in order to stop terrorism that is taking root there .
afterwards , the countries would create a binding agreement calling for them to disarm and renounce violence .
" if the states of europe and north america work together strategically as partners in the european union and in nato in response to the common threat , " fischer said , " and if they bring their particular abilities and strengths to bear in a new cooperation with the states of the middle east , then we can make this truly paramount contribution to our joint security . "
but fischer said military missions means would not be enough to halt the violence in the middle east .
" we can not counter the threat of this new totalitarianism by military means alone .
our response needs to be as all-encompassing as the threat .
and this response can not be issued by the west alone .
if we were to adopt a paternalistic attitude , we would only inflict the first defeat upon ourselves .
instead we must formulate a serious offer based on genuine cooperation , an offer to work together with the states and societies of the region . "
rumsfeld : " world is a safer place " u.s. defense secretary rumsfeld , however , took a different view .
" the world is a safer place today because the coalition liberated 50 million people – 25 million in afghanistan and 25 million in iraq , " he told his audience of experts .
rumsfeld only fleetingly addressed fischer ’ s proposal .
the mediterranean dialog at nato needs to be put on the agenda for the coming nato summit this summer in istanbul .
still , nato needs to strengthen its participation in the war against terrorism in the future as the threat of weapons of mass destruction are greater than ever , he said .
" unless the spread of terrorism is stopped , attacks will grow bolder and still more deadly . "
the defense secretary also offered an alternative view of nato cooperation , saying that numerous nato troops are already deployed in iraq and afghanistan , with some members stationing soldiers in both places .
" some 24 of the 26 nato allies and invitees already have forces in either afghanistan or iraq and 17 of them have forces in both afghanistan and iraq , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 07.02.2004 czechs and slovaks struggle with nuclear legacy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian environmental activists are strongly opposed to the czech temelin nuclear power plant .
when eight central and eastern european countries join the european union in may , they will bring a number of problematic nuclear reactors with them .
the czech republic and slovakia are receiving particular scrutiny . although the eu is imposing strict rules on everything from farming to food safety on the acceding countries , brussels would strangely appear to have a rather casual approach to the topic of nuclear reactors .
despite plenty of concern about old soviet-era reactors , it would appear the west ’ s political or economic interests are taking priority . of all the former east bloc countries , the czech republic and slovakia are coming in for most of the criticism over safety due to their proximity to old western border of the eu .
wedged next to germany and austria , what was once czechoslovakia was already an industrialized country during communist times . steel and coal , heavy industry , weapons and mechanical engineering , chemical and auto industries were all important areas of production .
energy consumption was correspondingly high and was met above all by means of nuclear power . today there are four nuclear power sites on the territory of the former czechoslovakia : temelin and dukovany in the czech republic , plus jaslovske bohunyitze and mochovtze in slovakia .
in the czech republic three new nuclear reactors are to be built in the next few years , if the government ’ s plans are implemented .
and that has some czech activists concerned . “ it seems to us that the industry ministry intends to re-introduce the planned economy , ” marta heveryova of the european forum for effective energy use in prague said .
“ both energy consumption and production are being dictated .
it ’ s the same as under communism . ” communist technology the technology of the nuclear power plants operated in the czech republic and slovakia today also stems from communist times .
nonetheless , there are big differences : although the southern bohemian temelin produces most of the headlines because of its proximity to austria and bavaria and a string of mishaps , it is one of the newest and is considered one of the safest nuclear power plants in what was the eastern bloc . the international atomic energy agency in vienna even considers temelin to be safer than a number of germany ’ s older reactors .
but opponents criticize above all the mix of soviet reactor technology and american safety technology .
much more problematic than temelin is dukovany , whose reactors are not protected by a safety shell .
a plane crash would have disastrous results here and a military airbase is situated just nearby . in slovakia , there are two fairly new reactors in mochovtze , which the german siemens concern helped to modernize .
in jaslovske bohunyitze , two chernobyl-type reactors are in operation .
this slovak nuclear power plant is one of the few examples where the european union has made its early closing down a condition for membership to the bloc .
one reactor is to be switched off by 2006 and the other by 2008 . increasing opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : temelin .
meanwhile , people in the czech republic are also stepping up their resistance to new atomic power plants and to the planned nuclear waste depots .
numerous local authorities have already rejected such depots in their vicinity . in the czech republic , running the country ’ s own nuclear power plants was long seen as a question of national sovereignty and eco-activists were considered nutcases .
the sometimes militant actions by temelin opponents from austria have intensified this perception . “ blockading borders , for instance , is clearly harmful , ” said vladimir halama of a czech anti-temelin initiative .
“ it would be more helpful if local authorities in other countries gave us some advice – authorities that have experience with the production of alternative energy . ” but there are economic arguments to consider , since the czech republic and slovakia export large quantities of electricity . “ last year , she says , the czech reopublic exported a record 19 terawatt hours , corresponding to the annual production of temelin ’ s two reactor blocks , ” said halama . state monopoly structures in both the czech republic and slovakia have remained in place nearly 15 years after the fall of communism and there is little or no competition in the energy sector .
unfortunately , that will not change after the forthcoming privatization of the industry .
both the czechs and slovaks only want to sell their power plants as a package .
possible bidders are the french company eléctricité de france and germany ’ s e.on. christoph scheffer -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany starts nuclear energy phase-out germany 's future is looking a lot greener with the closure of the stade nuclear reactor power plant on friday .

in the czech republic three new nuclear reactors are to be built in the next few years , if the government ’ s plans are implemented .
and that has some czech activists concerned . “ it seems to us that the industry ministry intends to re-introduce the planned economy , ” marta heveryova of the european forum for effective energy use in prague said .
“ both energy consumption and production are being dictated .
it ’ s the same as under communism . ” communist technology the technology of the nuclear power plants operated in the czech republic and slovakia today also stems from communist times .
nonetheless , there are big differences : although the southern bohemian temelin produces most of the headlines because of its proximity to austria and bavaria and a string of mishaps , it is one of the newest and is considered one of the safest nuclear power plants in what was the eastern bloc . the international atomic energy agency in vienna even considers temelin to be safer than a number of germany ’ s older reactors .
but opponents criticize above all the mix of soviet reactor technology and american safety technology .
much more problematic than temelin is dukovany , whose reactors are not protected by a safety shell .
a plane crash would have disastrous results here and a military airbase is situated just nearby . in slovakia , there are two fairly new reactors in mochovtze , which the german siemens concern helped to modernize .
in jaslovske bohunyitze , two chernobyl-type reactors are in operation .
this slovak nuclear power plant is one of the few examples where the european union has made its early closing down a condition for membership to the bloc .
one reactor is to be switched off by 2006 and the other by 2008 . increasing opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : temelin .
meanwhile , people in the czech republic are also stepping up their resistance to new atomic power plants and to the planned nuclear waste depots .
numerous local authorities have already rejected such depots in their vicinity . in the czech republic , running the country ’ s own nuclear power plants was long seen as a question of national sovereignty and eco-activists were considered nutcases .
the sometimes militant actions by temelin opponents from austria have intensified this perception . “ blockading borders , for instance , is clearly harmful , ” said vladimir halama of a czech anti-temelin initiative .
“ it would be more helpful if local authorities in other countries gave us some advice – authorities that have experience with the production of alternative energy . ” but there are economic arguments to consider , since the czech republic and slovakia export large quantities of electricity . “ last year , she says , the czech reopublic exported a record 19 terawatt hours , corresponding to the annual production of temelin ’ s two reactor blocks , ” said halama . state monopoly structures in both the czech republic and slovakia have remained in place nearly 15 years after the fall of communism and there is little or no competition in the energy sector .
unfortunately , that will not change after the forthcoming privatization of the industry .

at an international security meeting in munich , germany calls for the creation of a new u.s. and european peace plan for the middle east as donald rumsfeld again explains washington ’ s justification for the iraq war . one year after their famous sparring match over the planned iraq war , german foreign minister joschka fischer and united states secretary of defense donald rumsfeld again came together in munich on saturday .
though the trend in the transatlantic relationship is upward , discomfort between the two countries was still palpable at the 40th international security conference here as fischer defended germany ’ s opposition to the war and rumsfeld once again defended the u.s.-led invasion .
" the federal government feels that events have proven the position it took at the time to be right , " he said .
" it was our political decision not to join the coalition because we were not , and are still not , convinced of the validity of the reasons for war . "
still , fischer said it was crucial that the war be brought to a successful conclusion and that peace be found .
" for a failure would have had equally damaging consequences for us all , for europe as for america , for pro-war and anti-war countries , " he said .
" this conviction informed germany 's position during and after the war on iraq . "
germany : no troops for iraq fischer also expressed " deep skepticism " of any kind of nato mission in iraq , adding that germany would not stand in the way of such a mission but neither would berlin send any troops .
he also repeated german demands that the united nations be given a central leadership role in iraq .
the foreign minister called for a " sustainable long-term reform process in the region as a whole , " without which it would be impossible to bring lasting peace .
" notwithstanding the controversy about the war in iraq , we have long shared the view that following sept .
11 , 2001 , neither the u.s. nor europe and the middle east itself can tolerate the status quo in the middle east any longer , " he said .
" the middle east is at the epicenter of the greatest threat to our regional and global security at the dawn of this century : destructive jihadist terrorism with its totalitarian ideology .
this brand of terrorism does not only pose a threat to the societies of the west , but also and above all to the islamic and arab world . "
germany offers new peace plan bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer , center , stands with german defense minister peter struck , left , and nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer to wait for the start of the 40th munich conference on security policy in munich , southern germany , saturday , feb .
7 , 2004 .
-lrb- ap photo / diether endlicher -rrb- spezialbild additionally , fischer proposed a new transatlantic initiative in the middle east structured around nato .
" in order to succeed , the european union and the us should , in view of this major challenge to our common security , pool their capabilities , assets and projects to form a new transatlantic initiative for the middle east . "
the foreign minister ’ s plan would come in two phases .
first , nato countries would come a common middle east policy while , simultaneously , europe and the u.s would further expand economic ties and possibly establish a free-trade zone with the middle east .
northern african countries and the entire arab league would be brought into the dialog in order to stop terrorism that is taking root there .
afterwards , the countries would create a binding agreement calling for them to disarm and renounce violence .
" if the states of europe and north america work together strategically as partners in the european union and in nato in response to the common threat , " fischer said , " and if they bring their particular abilities and strengths to bear in a new cooperation with the states of the middle east , then we can make this truly paramount contribution to our joint security . "
but fischer said military missions means would not be enough to halt the violence in the middle east .
" we can not counter the threat of this new totalitarianism by military means alone .
our response needs to be as all-encompassing as the threat .
and this response can not be issued by the west alone .
if we were to adopt a paternalistic attitude , we would only inflict the first defeat upon ourselves .
instead we must formulate a serious offer based on genuine cooperation , an offer to work together with the states and societies of the region . "
rumsfeld : " world is a safer place " u.s. defense secretary rumsfeld , however , took a different view .
" the world is a safer place today because the coalition liberated 50 million people – 25 million in afghanistan and 25 million in iraq , " he told his audience of experts .
rumsfeld only fleetingly addressed fischer ’ s proposal .
the mediterranean dialog at nato needs to be put on the agenda for the coming nato summit this summer in istanbul .
still , nato needs to strengthen its participation in the war against terrorism in the future as the threat of weapons of mass destruction are greater than ever , he said .
" unless the spread of terrorism is stopped , attacks will grow bolder and still more deadly . "
the defense secretary also offered an alternative view of nato cooperation , saying that numerous nato troops are already deployed in iraq and afghanistan , with some members stationing soldiers in both places .
" some 24 of the 26 nato allies and invitees already have forces in either afghanistan or iraq and 17 of them have forces in both afghanistan and iraq , " he said .
rumsfeld also praised nato , noting its development in recent years and the numerous military missions it has undertaken . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder backs eurocorps deployment in afghanistan german chancellor gerhard schröder on friday said he supported expanding peacekeeping operations in afghanistan , but remained cool to merging the nato deployment with the u.s. military campaign in the country .

when eight central and eastern european countries join the european union in may , they will bring a number of problematic nuclear reactors with them .
the czech republic and slovakia are receiving particular scrutiny . although the eu is imposing strict rules on everything from farming to food safety on the acceding countries , brussels would strangely appear to have a rather casual approach to the topic of nuclear reactors .
despite plenty of concern about old soviet-era reactors , it would appear the west ’ s political or economic interests are taking priority . of all the former east bloc countries , the czech republic and slovakia are coming in for most of the criticism over safety due to their proximity to old western border of the eu .
wedged next to germany and austria , what was once czechoslovakia was already an industrialized country during communist times . steel and coal , heavy industry , weapons and mechanical engineering , chemical and auto industries were all important areas of production .
energy consumption was correspondingly high and was met above all by means of nuclear power . today there are four nuclear power sites on the territory of the former czechoslovakia : temelin and dukovany in the czech republic , plus jaslovske bohunyitze and mochovtze in slovakia .
in the czech republic three new nuclear reactors are to be built in the next few years , if the government ’ s plans are implemented .
and that has some czech activists concerned . “ it seems to us that the industry ministry intends to re-introduce the planned economy , ” marta heveryova of the european forum for effective energy use in prague said .
“ both energy consumption and production are being dictated .
it ’ s the same as under communism . ” communist technology the technology of the nuclear power plants operated in the czech republic and slovakia today also stems from communist times .
nonetheless , there are big differences : although the southern bohemian temelin produces most of the headlines because of its proximity to austria and bavaria and a string of mishaps , it is one of the newest and is considered one of the safest nuclear power plants in what was the eastern bloc . the international atomic energy agency in vienna even considers temelin to be safer than a number of germany ’ s older reactors .
but opponents criticize above all the mix of soviet reactor technology and american safety technology .
much more problematic than temelin is dukovany , whose reactors are not protected by a safety shell .
a plane crash would have disastrous results here and a military airbase is situated just nearby . in slovakia , there are two fairly new reactors in mochovtze , which the german siemens concern helped to modernize .
in jaslovske bohunyitze , two chernobyl-type reactors are in operation .
this slovak nuclear power plant is one of the few examples where the european union has made its early closing down a condition for membership to the bloc .
one reactor is to be switched off by 2006 and the other by 2008 . increasing opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : temelin .
meanwhile , people in the czech republic are also stepping up their resistance to new atomic power plants and to the planned nuclear waste depots .
numerous local authorities have already rejected such depots in their vicinity . in the czech republic , running the country ’ s own nuclear power plants was long seen as a question of national sovereignty and eco-activists were considered nutcases .
the sometimes militant actions by temelin opponents from austria have intensified this perception . “ blockading borders , for instance , is clearly harmful , ” said vladimir halama of a czech anti-temelin initiative .
“ it would be more helpful if local authorities in other countries gave us some advice – authorities that have experience with the production of alternative energy . ” but there are economic arguments to consider , since the czech republic and slovakia export large quantities of electricity . “ last year , she says , the czech reopublic exported a record 19 terawatt hours , corresponding to the annual production of temelin ’ s two reactor blocks , ” said halama . state monopoly structures in both the czech republic and slovakia have remained in place nearly 15 years after the fall of communism and there is little or no competition in the energy sector .
unfortunately , that will not change after the forthcoming privatization of the industry .

at an international security meeting in munich , germany calls for the creation of a new u.s. and european peace plan for the middle east as donald rumsfeld again explains washington ’ s justification for the iraq war . one year after their famous sparring match over the planned iraq war , german foreign minister joschka fischer and united states secretary of defense donald rumsfeld again came together in munich on saturday .
though the trend in the transatlantic relationship is upward , discomfort between the two countries was still palpable at the 40th international security conference here as fischer defended germany ’ s opposition to the war and rumsfeld once again defended the u.s.-led invasion .
" the federal government feels that events have proven the position it took at the time to be right , " he said .
" it was our political decision not to join the coalition because we were not , and are still not , convinced of the validity of the reasons for war . "
still , fischer said it was crucial that the war be brought to a successful conclusion and that peace be found .
" for a failure would have had equally damaging consequences for us all , for europe as for america , for pro-war and anti-war countries , " he said .
" this conviction informed germany 's position during and after the war on iraq . "
germany : no troops for iraq fischer also expressed " deep skepticism " of any kind of nato mission in iraq , adding that germany would not stand in the way of such a mission but neither would berlin send any troops .
he also repeated german demands that the united nations be given a central leadership role in iraq .
the foreign minister called for a " sustainable long-term reform process in the region as a whole , " without which it would be impossible to bring lasting peace .
" notwithstanding the controversy about the war in iraq , we have long shared the view that following sept .
11 , 2001 , neither the u.s. nor europe and the middle east itself can tolerate the status quo in the middle east any longer , " he said .
" the middle east is at the epicenter of the greatest threat to our regional and global security at the dawn of this century : destructive jihadist terrorism with its totalitarian ideology .
this brand of terrorism does not only pose a threat to the societies of the west , but also and above all to the islamic and arab world . "
germany offers new peace plan bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer , center , stands with german defense minister peter struck , left , and nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer to wait for the start of the 40th munich conference on security policy in munich , southern germany , saturday , feb .
7 , 2004 .
-lrb- ap photo / diether endlicher -rrb- spezialbild additionally , fischer proposed a new transatlantic initiative in the middle east structured around nato .
" in order to succeed , the european union and the us should , in view of this major challenge to our common security , pool their capabilities , assets and projects to form a new transatlantic initiative for the middle east . "
the foreign minister ’ s plan would come in two phases .
first , nato countries would come a common middle east policy while , simultaneously , europe and the u.s would further expand economic ties and possibly establish a free-trade zone with the middle east .
northern african countries and the entire arab league would be brought into the dialog in order to stop terrorism that is taking root there .
afterwards , the countries would create a binding agreement calling for them to disarm and renounce violence .
" if the states of europe and north america work together strategically as partners in the european union and in nato in response to the common threat , " fischer said , " and if they bring their particular abilities and strengths to bear in a new cooperation with the states of the middle east , then we can make this truly paramount contribution to our joint security . "
but fischer said military missions means would not be enough to halt the violence in the middle east .
" we can not counter the threat of this new totalitarianism by military means alone .
our response needs to be as all-encompassing as the threat .
and this response can not be issued by the west alone .
if we were to adopt a paternalistic attitude , we would only inflict the first defeat upon ourselves .
instead we must formulate a serious offer based on genuine cooperation , an offer to work together with the states and societies of the region . "
rumsfeld : " world is a safer place " u.s. defense secretary rumsfeld , however , took a different view .
" the world is a safer place today because the coalition liberated 50 million people – 25 million in afghanistan and 25 million in iraq , " he told his audience of experts .
rumsfeld only fleetingly addressed fischer ’ s proposal .
the mediterranean dialog at nato needs to be put on the agenda for the coming nato summit this summer in istanbul .
still , nato needs to strengthen its participation in the war against terrorism in the future as the threat of weapons of mass destruction are greater than ever , he said .
" unless the spread of terrorism is stopped , attacks will grow bolder and still more deadly . "
the defense secretary also offered an alternative view of nato cooperation , saying that numerous nato troops are already deployed in iraq and afghanistan , with some members stationing soldiers in both places .
" some 24 of the 26 nato allies and invitees already have forces in either afghanistan or iraq and 17 of them have forces in both afghanistan and iraq , " he said .
rumsfeld also praised nato , noting its development in recent years and the numerous military missions it has undertaken . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder backs eurocorps deployment in afghanistan german chancellor gerhard schröder on friday said he supported expanding peacekeeping operations in afghanistan , but remained cool to merging the nato deployment with the u.s. military campaign in the country .

when eight central and eastern european countries join the european union in may , they will bring a number of problematic nuclear reactors with them .
the czech republic and slovakia are receiving particular scrutiny . although the eu is imposing strict rules on everything from farming to food safety on the acceding countries , brussels would strangely appear to have a rather casual approach to the topic of nuclear reactors .
despite plenty of concern about old soviet-era reactors , it would appear the west ’ s political or economic interests are taking priority . of all the former east bloc countries , the czech republic and slovakia are coming in for most of the criticism over safety due to their proximity to old western border of the eu .
wedged next to germany and austria , what was once czechoslovakia was already an industrialized country during communist times . steel and coal , heavy industry , weapons and mechanical engineering , chemical and auto industries were all important areas of production .
energy consumption was correspondingly high and was met above all by means of nuclear power . today there are four nuclear power sites on the territory of the former czechoslovakia : temelin and dukovany in the czech republic , plus jaslovske bohunyitze and mochovtze in slovakia .
in the czech republic three new nuclear reactors are to be built in the next few years , if the government ’ s plans are implemented .
and that has some czech activists concerned . “ it seems to us that the industry ministry intends to re-introduce the planned economy , ” marta heveryova of the european forum for effective energy use in prague said .
“ both energy consumption and production are being dictated .

but opponents criticize above all the mix of soviet reactor technology and american safety technology .
much more problematic than temelin is dukovany , whose reactors are not protected by a safety shell .
a plane crash would have disastrous results here and a military airbase is situated just nearby . in slovakia , there are two fairly new reactors in mochovtze , which the german siemens concern helped to modernize .
in jaslovske bohunyitze , two chernobyl-type reactors are in operation .
this slovak nuclear power plant is one of the few examples where the european union has made its early closing down a condition for membership to the bloc .

the czech republic and slovakia are receiving particular scrutiny . although the eu is imposing strict rules on everything from farming to food safety on the acceding countries , brussels would strangely appear to have a rather casual approach to the topic of nuclear reactors .
despite plenty of concern about old soviet-era reactors , it would appear the west ’ s political or economic interests are taking priority . of all the former east bloc countries , the czech republic and slovakia are coming in for most of the criticism over safety due to their proximity to old western border of the eu .

energy consumption was correspondingly high and was met above all by means of nuclear power . today there are four nuclear power sites on the territory of the former czechoslovakia : temelin and dukovany in the czech republic , plus jaslovske bohunyitze and mochovtze in slovakia .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 07.02.2004 fischer calls for new roadmap for mideast peace großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer appears more optimistic at this year 's international security conference .
at an international security meeting in munich , germany calls for the creation of a new u.s. and european peace plan for the middle east as donald rumsfeld again explains washington ’ s justification for the iraq war . one year after their famous sparring match over the planned iraq war , german foreign minister joschka fischer and united states secretary of defense donald rumsfeld again came together in munich on saturday .
though the trend in the transatlantic relationship is upward , discomfort between the two countries was still palpable at the 40th international security conference here as fischer defended germany ’ s opposition to the war and rumsfeld once again defended the u.s.-led invasion .
" the federal government feels that events have proven the position it took at the time to be right , " he said .
" it was our political decision not to join the coalition because we were not , and are still not , convinced of the validity of the reasons for war . "
still , fischer said it was crucial that the war be brought to a successful conclusion and that peace be found .
" for a failure would have had equally damaging consequences for us all , for europe as for america , for pro-war and anti-war countries , " he said .
" this conviction informed germany 's position during and after the war on iraq . "
germany : no troops for iraq fischer also expressed " deep skepticism " of any kind of nato mission in iraq , adding that germany would not stand in the way of such a mission but neither would berlin send any troops .
he also repeated german demands that the united nations be given a central leadership role in iraq .
the foreign minister called for a " sustainable long-term reform process in the region as a whole , " without which it would be impossible to bring lasting peace .
" notwithstanding the controversy about the war in iraq , we have long shared the view that following sept .
11 , 2001 , neither the u.s. nor europe and the middle east itself can tolerate the status quo in the middle east any longer , " he said .
" the middle east is at the epicenter of the greatest threat to our regional and global security at the dawn of this century : destructive jihadist terrorism with its totalitarian ideology .
this brand of terrorism does not only pose a threat to the societies of the west , but also and above all to the islamic and arab world . "
germany offers new peace plan bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer , center , stands with german defense minister peter struck , left , and nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer to wait for the start of the 40th munich conference on security policy in munich , southern germany , saturday , feb .
7 , 2004 .
-lrb- ap photo / diether endlicher -rrb- spezialbild additionally , fischer proposed a new transatlantic initiative in the middle east structured around nato .
" in order to succeed , the european union and the us should , in view of this major challenge to our common security , pool their capabilities , assets and projects to form a new transatlantic initiative for the middle east . "
the foreign minister ’ s plan would come in two phases .
first , nato countries would come a common middle east policy while , simultaneously , europe and the u.s would further expand economic ties and possibly establish a free-trade zone with the middle east .
northern african countries and the entire arab league would be brought into the dialog in order to stop terrorism that is taking root there .
afterwards , the countries would create a binding agreement calling for them to disarm and renounce violence .
" if the states of europe and north america work together strategically as partners in the european union and in nato in response to the common threat , " fischer said , " and if they bring their particular abilities and strengths to bear in a new cooperation with the states of the middle east , then we can make this truly paramount contribution to our joint security . "
but fischer said military missions means would not be enough to halt the violence in the middle east .
" we can not counter the threat of this new totalitarianism by military means alone .
our response needs to be as all-encompassing as the threat .
and this response can not be issued by the west alone .
if we were to adopt a paternalistic attitude , we would only inflict the first defeat upon ourselves .
instead we must formulate a serious offer based on genuine cooperation , an offer to work together with the states and societies of the region . "
rumsfeld : " world is a safer place " u.s. defense secretary rumsfeld , however , took a different view .
" the world is a safer place today because the coalition liberated 50 million people – 25 million in afghanistan and 25 million in iraq , " he told his audience of experts .
rumsfeld only fleetingly addressed fischer ’ s proposal .
the mediterranean dialog at nato needs to be put on the agenda for the coming nato summit this summer in istanbul .
still , nato needs to strengthen its participation in the war against terrorism in the future as the threat of weapons of mass destruction are greater than ever , he said .
" unless the spread of terrorism is stopped , attacks will grow bolder and still more deadly . "
the defense secretary also offered an alternative view of nato cooperation , saying that numerous nato troops are already deployed in iraq and afghanistan , with some members stationing soldiers in both places .
" some 24 of the 26 nato allies and invitees already have forces in either afghanistan or iraq and 17 of them have forces in both afghanistan and iraq , " he said .
rumsfeld also praised nato , noting its development in recent years and the numerous military missions it has undertaken . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder backs eurocorps deployment in afghanistan german chancellor gerhard schröder on friday said he supported expanding peacekeeping operations in afghanistan , but remained cool to merging the nato deployment with the u.s. military campaign in the country .

at an international security meeting in munich , germany calls for the creation of a new u.s. and european peace plan for the middle east as donald rumsfeld again explains washington ’ s justification for the iraq war . one year after their famous sparring match over the planned iraq war , german foreign minister joschka fischer and united states secretary of defense donald rumsfeld again came together in munich on saturday .
though the trend in the transatlantic relationship is upward , discomfort between the two countries was still palpable at the 40th international security conference here as fischer defended germany ’ s opposition to the war and rumsfeld once again defended the u.s.-led invasion .
" the federal government feels that events have proven the position it took at the time to be right , " he said .
" it was our political decision not to join the coalition because we were not , and are still not , convinced of the validity of the reasons for war . "
still , fischer said it was crucial that the war be brought to a successful conclusion and that peace be found .
" for a failure would have had equally damaging consequences for us all , for europe as for america , for pro-war and anti-war countries , " he said .
" this conviction informed germany 's position during and after the war on iraq . "
germany : no troops for iraq fischer also expressed " deep skepticism " of any kind of nato mission in iraq , adding that germany would not stand in the way of such a mission but neither would berlin send any troops .
he also repeated german demands that the united nations be given a central leadership role in iraq .
the foreign minister called for a " sustainable long-term reform process in the region as a whole , " without which it would be impossible to bring lasting peace .
" notwithstanding the controversy about the war in iraq , we have long shared the view that following sept .
11 , 2001 , neither the u.s. nor europe and the middle east itself can tolerate the status quo in the middle east any longer , " he said .
" the middle east is at the epicenter of the greatest threat to our regional and global security at the dawn of this century : destructive jihadist terrorism with its totalitarian ideology .
this brand of terrorism does not only pose a threat to the societies of the west , but also and above all to the islamic and arab world . "
germany offers new peace plan bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer , center , stands with german defense minister peter struck , left , and nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer to wait for the start of the 40th munich conference on security policy in munich , southern germany , saturday , feb .
7 , 2004 .
-lrb- ap photo / diether endlicher -rrb- spezialbild additionally , fischer proposed a new transatlantic initiative in the middle east structured around nato .
" in order to succeed , the european union and the us should , in view of this major challenge to our common security , pool their capabilities , assets and projects to form a new transatlantic initiative for the middle east . "
the foreign minister ’ s plan would come in two phases .
first , nato countries would come a common middle east policy while , simultaneously , europe and the u.s would further expand economic ties and possibly establish a free-trade zone with the middle east .
northern african countries and the entire arab league would be brought into the dialog in order to stop terrorism that is taking root there .
afterwards , the countries would create a binding agreement calling for them to disarm and renounce violence .
" if the states of europe and north america work together strategically as partners in the european union and in nato in response to the common threat , " fischer said , " and if they bring their particular abilities and strengths to bear in a new cooperation with the states of the middle east , then we can make this truly paramount contribution to our joint security . "
but fischer said military missions means would not be enough to halt the violence in the middle east .
" we can not counter the threat of this new totalitarianism by military means alone .
our response needs to be as all-encompassing as the threat .
and this response can not be issued by the west alone .
if we were to adopt a paternalistic attitude , we would only inflict the first defeat upon ourselves .
instead we must formulate a serious offer based on genuine cooperation , an offer to work together with the states and societies of the region . "
rumsfeld : " world is a safer place " u.s. defense secretary rumsfeld , however , took a different view .
" the world is a safer place today because the coalition liberated 50 million people – 25 million in afghanistan and 25 million in iraq , " he told his audience of experts .
rumsfeld only fleetingly addressed fischer ’ s proposal .
the mediterranean dialog at nato needs to be put on the agenda for the coming nato summit this summer in istanbul .
still , nato needs to strengthen its participation in the war against terrorism in the future as the threat of weapons of mass destruction are greater than ever , he said .
" unless the spread of terrorism is stopped , attacks will grow bolder and still more deadly . "
the defense secretary also offered an alternative view of nato cooperation , saying that numerous nato troops are already deployed in iraq and afghanistan , with some members stationing soldiers in both places .
" some 24 of the 26 nato allies and invitees already have forces in either afghanistan or iraq and 17 of them have forces in both afghanistan and iraq , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 07.02.2004 czechs and slovaks struggle with nuclear legacy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian environmental activists are strongly opposed to the czech temelin nuclear power plant .
when eight central and eastern european countries join the european union in may , they will bring a number of problematic nuclear reactors with them .
the czech republic and slovakia are receiving particular scrutiny . although the eu is imposing strict rules on everything from farming to food safety on the acceding countries , brussels would strangely appear to have a rather casual approach to the topic of nuclear reactors .
despite plenty of concern about old soviet-era reactors , it would appear the west ’ s political or economic interests are taking priority . of all the former east bloc countries , the czech republic and slovakia are coming in for most of the criticism over safety due to their proximity to old western border of the eu .
wedged next to germany and austria , what was once czechoslovakia was already an industrialized country during communist times . steel and coal , heavy industry , weapons and mechanical engineering , chemical and auto industries were all important areas of production .
energy consumption was correspondingly high and was met above all by means of nuclear power . today there are four nuclear power sites on the territory of the former czechoslovakia : temelin and dukovany in the czech republic , plus jaslovske bohunyitze and mochovtze in slovakia .
in the czech republic three new nuclear reactors are to be built in the next few years , if the government ’ s plans are implemented .
and that has some czech activists concerned . “ it seems to us that the industry ministry intends to re-introduce the planned economy , ” marta heveryova of the european forum for effective energy use in prague said .
“ both energy consumption and production are being dictated .
it ’ s the same as under communism . ” communist technology the technology of the nuclear power plants operated in the czech republic and slovakia today also stems from communist times .
nonetheless , there are big differences : although the southern bohemian temelin produces most of the headlines because of its proximity to austria and bavaria and a string of mishaps , it is one of the newest and is considered one of the safest nuclear power plants in what was the eastern bloc . the international atomic energy agency in vienna even considers temelin to be safer than a number of germany ’ s older reactors .
but opponents criticize above all the mix of soviet reactor technology and american safety technology .
much more problematic than temelin is dukovany , whose reactors are not protected by a safety shell .
a plane crash would have disastrous results here and a military airbase is situated just nearby . in slovakia , there are two fairly new reactors in mochovtze , which the german siemens concern helped to modernize .
in jaslovske bohunyitze , two chernobyl-type reactors are in operation .
this slovak nuclear power plant is one of the few examples where the european union has made its early closing down a condition for membership to the bloc .
one reactor is to be switched off by 2006 and the other by 2008 . increasing opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : temelin .
meanwhile , people in the czech republic are also stepping up their resistance to new atomic power plants and to the planned nuclear waste depots .
numerous local authorities have already rejected such depots in their vicinity . in the czech republic , running the country ’ s own nuclear power plants was long seen as a question of national sovereignty and eco-activists were considered nutcases .
the sometimes militant actions by temelin opponents from austria have intensified this perception . “ blockading borders , for instance , is clearly harmful , ” said vladimir halama of a czech anti-temelin initiative .
“ it would be more helpful if local authorities in other countries gave us some advice – authorities that have experience with the production of alternative energy . ” but there are economic arguments to consider , since the czech republic and slovakia export large quantities of electricity . “ last year , she says , the czech reopublic exported a record 19 terawatt hours , corresponding to the annual production of temelin ’ s two reactor blocks , ” said halama . state monopoly structures in both the czech republic and slovakia have remained in place nearly 15 years after the fall of communism and there is little or no competition in the energy sector .
unfortunately , that will not change after the forthcoming privatization of the industry .
both the czechs and slovaks only want to sell their power plants as a package .
possible bidders are the french company eléctricité de france and germany ’ s e.on. christoph scheffer -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany starts nuclear energy phase-out germany 's future is looking a lot greener with the closure of the stade nuclear reactor power plant on friday .

wedged next to germany and austria , what was once czechoslovakia was already an industrialized country during communist times . steel and coal , heavy industry , weapons and mechanical engineering , chemical and auto industries were all important areas of production .
energy consumption was correspondingly high and was met above all by means of nuclear power . today there are four nuclear power sites on the territory of the former czechoslovakia : temelin and dukovany in the czech republic , plus jaslovske bohunyitze and mochovtze in slovakia .
in the czech republic three new nuclear reactors are to be built in the next few years , if the government ’ s plans are implemented .
and that has some czech activists concerned . “ it seems to us that the industry ministry intends to re-introduce the planned economy , ” marta heveryova of the european forum for effective energy use in prague said .
“ both energy consumption and production are being dictated .
it ’ s the same as under communism . ” communist technology the technology of the nuclear power plants operated in the czech republic and slovakia today also stems from communist times .
nonetheless , there are big differences : although the southern bohemian temelin produces most of the headlines because of its proximity to austria and bavaria and a string of mishaps , it is one of the newest and is considered one of the safest nuclear power plants in what was the eastern bloc . the international atomic energy agency in vienna even considers temelin to be safer than a number of germany ’ s older reactors .
but opponents criticize above all the mix of soviet reactor technology and american safety technology .
much more problematic than temelin is dukovany , whose reactors are not protected by a safety shell .
a plane crash would have disastrous results here and a military airbase is situated just nearby . in slovakia , there are two fairly new reactors in mochovtze , which the german siemens concern helped to modernize .
in jaslovske bohunyitze , two chernobyl-type reactors are in operation .
this slovak nuclear power plant is one of the few examples where the european union has made its early closing down a condition for membership to the bloc .
one reactor is to be switched off by 2006 and the other by 2008 . increasing opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : temelin .
meanwhile , people in the czech republic are also stepping up their resistance to new atomic power plants and to the planned nuclear waste depots .
numerous local authorities have already rejected such depots in their vicinity . in the czech republic , running the country ’ s own nuclear power plants was long seen as a question of national sovereignty and eco-activists were considered nutcases .
the sometimes militant actions by temelin opponents from austria have intensified this perception . “ blockading borders , for instance , is clearly harmful , ” said vladimir halama of a czech anti-temelin initiative .
“ it would be more helpful if local authorities in other countries gave us some advice – authorities that have experience with the production of alternative energy . ” but there are economic arguments to consider , since the czech republic and slovakia export large quantities of electricity . “ last year , she says , the czech reopublic exported a record 19 terawatt hours , corresponding to the annual production of temelin ’ s two reactor blocks , ” said halama . state monopoly structures in both the czech republic and slovakia have remained in place nearly 15 years after the fall of communism and there is little or no competition in the energy sector .
unfortunately , that will not change after the forthcoming privatization of the industry .
both the czechs and slovaks only want to sell their power plants as a package .
possible bidders are the french company eléctricité de france and germany ’ s e.on. christoph scheffer -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany starts nuclear energy phase-out germany 's future is looking a lot greener with the closure of the stade nuclear reactor power plant on friday .

at an international security meeting in munich , germany calls for the creation of a new u.s. and european peace plan for the middle east as donald rumsfeld again explains washington ’ s justification for the iraq war . one year after their famous sparring match over the planned iraq war , german foreign minister joschka fischer and united states secretary of defense donald rumsfeld again came together in munich on saturday .
though the trend in the transatlantic relationship is upward , discomfort between the two countries was still palpable at the 40th international security conference here as fischer defended germany ’ s opposition to the war and rumsfeld once again defended the u.s.-led invasion .
" the federal government feels that events have proven the position it took at the time to be right , " he said .
" it was our political decision not to join the coalition because we were not , and are still not , convinced of the validity of the reasons for war . "
still , fischer said it was crucial that the war be brought to a successful conclusion and that peace be found .
" for a failure would have had equally damaging consequences for us all , for europe as for america , for pro-war and anti-war countries , " he said .
" this conviction informed germany 's position during and after the war on iraq . "
germany : no troops for iraq fischer also expressed " deep skepticism " of any kind of nato mission in iraq , adding that germany would not stand in the way of such a mission but neither would berlin send any troops .
he also repeated german demands that the united nations be given a central leadership role in iraq .
the foreign minister called for a " sustainable long-term reform process in the region as a whole , " without which it would be impossible to bring lasting peace .
" notwithstanding the controversy about the war in iraq , we have long shared the view that following sept .
11 , 2001 , neither the u.s. nor europe and the middle east itself can tolerate the status quo in the middle east any longer , " he said .
" the middle east is at the epicenter of the greatest threat to our regional and global security at the dawn of this century : destructive jihadist terrorism with its totalitarian ideology .
this brand of terrorism does not only pose a threat to the societies of the west , but also and above all to the islamic and arab world . "
germany offers new peace plan bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer , center , stands with german defense minister peter struck , left , and nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer to wait for the start of the 40th munich conference on security policy in munich , southern germany , saturday , feb .
7 , 2004 .
-lrb- ap photo / diether endlicher -rrb- spezialbild additionally , fischer proposed a new transatlantic initiative in the middle east structured around nato .
" in order to succeed , the european union and the us should , in view of this major challenge to our common security , pool their capabilities , assets and projects to form a new transatlantic initiative for the middle east . "
the foreign minister ’ s plan would come in two phases .
first , nato countries would come a common middle east policy while , simultaneously , europe and the u.s would further expand economic ties and possibly establish a free-trade zone with the middle east .
northern african countries and the entire arab league would be brought into the dialog in order to stop terrorism that is taking root there .
afterwards , the countries would create a binding agreement calling for them to disarm and renounce violence .
" if the states of europe and north america work together strategically as partners in the european union and in nato in response to the common threat , " fischer said , " and if they bring their particular abilities and strengths to bear in a new cooperation with the states of the middle east , then we can make this truly paramount contribution to our joint security . "
but fischer said military missions means would not be enough to halt the violence in the middle east .
" we can not counter the threat of this new totalitarianism by military means alone .
our response needs to be as all-encompassing as the threat .
and this response can not be issued by the west alone .
if we were to adopt a paternalistic attitude , we would only inflict the first defeat upon ourselves .
instead we must formulate a serious offer based on genuine cooperation , an offer to work together with the states and societies of the region . "
rumsfeld : " world is a safer place " u.s. defense secretary rumsfeld , however , took a different view .
" the world is a safer place today because the coalition liberated 50 million people – 25 million in afghanistan and 25 million in iraq , " he told his audience of experts .
rumsfeld only fleetingly addressed fischer ’ s proposal .
the mediterranean dialog at nato needs to be put on the agenda for the coming nato summit this summer in istanbul .
still , nato needs to strengthen its participation in the war against terrorism in the future as the threat of weapons of mass destruction are greater than ever , he said .
" unless the spread of terrorism is stopped , attacks will grow bolder and still more deadly . "
the defense secretary also offered an alternative view of nato cooperation , saying that numerous nato troops are already deployed in iraq and afghanistan , with some members stationing soldiers in both places .
" some 24 of the 26 nato allies and invitees already have forces in either afghanistan or iraq and 17 of them have forces in both afghanistan and iraq , " he said .

-lrb- ap photo / diether endlicher -rrb- spezialbild additionally , fischer proposed a new transatlantic initiative in the middle east structured around nato .
" in order to succeed , the european union and the us should , in view of this major challenge to our common security , pool their capabilities , assets and projects to form a new transatlantic initiative for the middle east . "
the foreign minister ’ s plan would come in two phases .
first , nato countries would come a common middle east policy while , simultaneously , europe and the u.s would further expand economic ties and possibly establish a free-trade zone with the middle east .
northern african countries and the entire arab league would be brought into the dialog in order to stop terrorism that is taking root there .
afterwards , the countries would create a binding agreement calling for them to disarm and renounce violence .
" if the states of europe and north america work together strategically as partners in the european union and in nato in response to the common threat , " fischer said , " and if they bring their particular abilities and strengths to bear in a new cooperation with the states of the middle east , then we can make this truly paramount contribution to our joint security . "
but fischer said military missions means would not be enough to halt the violence in the middle east .
" we can not counter the threat of this new totalitarianism by military means alone .
our response needs to be as all-encompassing as the threat .
and this response can not be issued by the west alone .
if we were to adopt a paternalistic attitude , we would only inflict the first defeat upon ourselves .
instead we must formulate a serious offer based on genuine cooperation , an offer to work together with the states and societies of the region . "
rumsfeld : " world is a safer place " u.s. defense secretary rumsfeld , however , took a different view .
" the world is a safer place today because the coalition liberated 50 million people – 25 million in afghanistan and 25 million in iraq , " he told his audience of experts .
rumsfeld only fleetingly addressed fischer ’ s proposal .
the mediterranean dialog at nato needs to be put on the agenda for the coming nato summit this summer in istanbul .
still , nato needs to strengthen its participation in the war against terrorism in the future as the threat of weapons of mass destruction are greater than ever , he said .
" unless the spread of terrorism is stopped , attacks will grow bolder and still more deadly . "
the defense secretary also offered an alternative view of nato cooperation , saying that numerous nato troops are already deployed in iraq and afghanistan , with some members stationing soldiers in both places .
" some 24 of the 26 nato allies and invitees already have forces in either afghanistan or iraq and 17 of them have forces in both afghanistan and iraq , " he said .
rumsfeld also praised nato , noting its development in recent years and the numerous military missions it has undertaken . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder backs eurocorps deployment in afghanistan german chancellor gerhard schröder on friday said he supported expanding peacekeeping operations in afghanistan , but remained cool to merging the nato deployment with the u.s. military campaign in the country .

at an international security meeting in munich , germany calls for the creation of a new u.s. and european peace plan for the middle east as donald rumsfeld again explains washington ’ s justification for the iraq war . one year after their famous sparring match over the planned iraq war , german foreign minister joschka fischer and united states secretary of defense donald rumsfeld again came together in munich on saturday .
though the trend in the transatlantic relationship is upward , discomfort between the two countries was still palpable at the 40th international security conference here as fischer defended germany ’ s opposition to the war and rumsfeld once again defended the u.s.-led invasion .
" the federal government feels that events have proven the position it took at the time to be right , " he said .
" it was our political decision not to join the coalition because we were not , and are still not , convinced of the validity of the reasons for war . "
still , fischer said it was crucial that the war be brought to a successful conclusion and that peace be found .
" for a failure would have had equally damaging consequences for us all , for europe as for america , for pro-war and anti-war countries , " he said .
" this conviction informed germany 's position during and after the war on iraq . "
germany : no troops for iraq fischer also expressed " deep skepticism " of any kind of nato mission in iraq , adding that germany would not stand in the way of such a mission but neither would berlin send any troops .
he also repeated german demands that the united nations be given a central leadership role in iraq .
the foreign minister called for a " sustainable long-term reform process in the region as a whole , " without which it would be impossible to bring lasting peace .
" notwithstanding the controversy about the war in iraq , we have long shared the view that following sept .
11 , 2001 , neither the u.s. nor europe and the middle east itself can tolerate the status quo in the middle east any longer , " he said .
" the middle east is at the epicenter of the greatest threat to our regional and global security at the dawn of this century : destructive jihadist terrorism with its totalitarian ideology .
this brand of terrorism does not only pose a threat to the societies of the west , but also and above all to the islamic and arab world . "

when eight central and eastern european countries join the european union in may , they will bring a number of problematic nuclear reactors with them .
the czech republic and slovakia are receiving particular scrutiny . although the eu is imposing strict rules on everything from farming to food safety on the acceding countries , brussels would strangely appear to have a rather casual approach to the topic of nuclear reactors .
despite plenty of concern about old soviet-era reactors , it would appear the west ’ s political or economic interests are taking priority . of all the former east bloc countries , the czech republic and slovakia are coming in for most of the criticism over safety due to their proximity to old western border of the eu .
wedged next to germany and austria , what was once czechoslovakia was already an industrialized country during communist times . steel and coal , heavy industry , weapons and mechanical engineering , chemical and auto industries were all important areas of production .
energy consumption was correspondingly high and was met above all by means of nuclear power . today there are four nuclear power sites on the territory of the former czechoslovakia : temelin and dukovany in the czech republic , plus jaslovske bohunyitze and mochovtze in slovakia .
in the czech republic three new nuclear reactors are to be built in the next few years , if the government ’ s plans are implemented .
and that has some czech activists concerned . “ it seems to us that the industry ministry intends to re-introduce the planned economy , ” marta heveryova of the european forum for effective energy use in prague said .
“ both energy consumption and production are being dictated .
it ’ s the same as under communism . ” communist technology the technology of the nuclear power plants operated in the czech republic and slovakia today also stems from communist times .
nonetheless , there are big differences : although the southern bohemian temelin produces most of the headlines because of its proximity to austria and bavaria and a string of mishaps , it is one of the newest and is considered one of the safest nuclear power plants in what was the eastern bloc . the international atomic energy agency in vienna even considers temelin to be safer than a number of germany ’ s older reactors .
but opponents criticize above all the mix of soviet reactor technology and american safety technology .
much more problematic than temelin is dukovany , whose reactors are not protected by a safety shell .
a plane crash would have disastrous results here and a military airbase is situated just nearby . in slovakia , there are two fairly new reactors in mochovtze , which the german siemens concern helped to modernize .
in jaslovske bohunyitze , two chernobyl-type reactors are in operation .
this slovak nuclear power plant is one of the few examples where the european union has made its early closing down a condition for membership to the bloc .
one reactor is to be switched off by 2006 and the other by 2008 . increasing opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : temelin .
meanwhile , people in the czech republic are also stepping up their resistance to new atomic power plants and to the planned nuclear waste depots .
numerous local authorities have already rejected such depots in their vicinity . in the czech republic , running the country ’ s own nuclear power plants was long seen as a question of national sovereignty and eco-activists were considered nutcases .
the sometimes militant actions by temelin opponents from austria have intensified this perception . “ blockading borders , for instance , is clearly harmful , ” said vladimir halama of a czech anti-temelin initiative .
“ it would be more helpful if local authorities in other countries gave us some advice – authorities that have experience with the production of alternative energy . ” but there are economic arguments to consider , since the czech republic and slovakia export large quantities of electricity . “ last year , she says , the czech reopublic exported a record 19 terawatt hours , corresponding to the annual production of temelin ’ s two reactor blocks , ” said halama . state monopoly structures in both the czech republic and slovakia have remained in place nearly 15 years after the fall of communism and there is little or no competition in the energy sector .
unfortunately , that will not change after the forthcoming privatization of the industry .

at an international security meeting in munich , germany calls for the creation of a new u.s. and european peace plan for the middle east as donald rumsfeld again explains washington ’ s justification for the iraq war . one year after their famous sparring match over the planned iraq war , german foreign minister joschka fischer and united states secretary of defense donald rumsfeld again came together in munich on saturday .
though the trend in the transatlantic relationship is upward , discomfort between the two countries was still palpable at the 40th international security conference here as fischer defended germany ’ s opposition to the war and rumsfeld once again defended the u.s.-led invasion .
" the federal government feels that events have proven the position it took at the time to be right , " he said .
" it was our political decision not to join the coalition because we were not , and are still not , convinced of the validity of the reasons for war . "
still , fischer said it was crucial that the war be brought to a successful conclusion and that peace be found .
" for a failure would have had equally damaging consequences for us all , for europe as for america , for pro-war and anti-war countries , " he said .
" this conviction informed germany 's position during and after the war on iraq . "
germany : no troops for iraq fischer also expressed " deep skepticism " of any kind of nato mission in iraq , adding that germany would not stand in the way of such a mission but neither would berlin send any troops .
he also repeated german demands that the united nations be given a central leadership role in iraq .
the foreign minister called for a " sustainable long-term reform process in the region as a whole , " without which it would be impossible to bring lasting peace .
" notwithstanding the controversy about the war in iraq , we have long shared the view that following sept .
11 , 2001 , neither the u.s. nor europe and the middle east itself can tolerate the status quo in the middle east any longer , " he said .
" the middle east is at the epicenter of the greatest threat to our regional and global security at the dawn of this century : destructive jihadist terrorism with its totalitarian ideology .
this brand of terrorism does not only pose a threat to the societies of the west , but also and above all to the islamic and arab world . "
germany offers new peace plan bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer , center , stands with german defense minister peter struck , left , and nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer to wait for the start of the 40th munich conference on security policy in munich , southern germany , saturday , feb .

-lrb- ap photo / diether endlicher -rrb- spezialbild additionally , fischer proposed a new transatlantic initiative in the middle east structured around nato .
" in order to succeed , the european union and the us should , in view of this major challenge to our common security , pool their capabilities , assets and projects to form a new transatlantic initiative for the middle east . "
the foreign minister ’ s plan would come in two phases .
first , nato countries would come a common middle east policy while , simultaneously , europe and the u.s would further expand economic ties and possibly establish a free-trade zone with the middle east .
northern african countries and the entire arab league would be brought into the dialog in order to stop terrorism that is taking root there .
afterwards , the countries would create a binding agreement calling for them to disarm and renounce violence .
" if the states of europe and north america work together strategically as partners in the european union and in nato in response to the common threat , " fischer said , " and if they bring their particular abilities and strengths to bear in a new cooperation with the states of the middle east , then we can make this truly paramount contribution to our joint security . "
but fischer said military missions means would not be enough to halt the violence in the middle east .
" we can not counter the threat of this new totalitarianism by military means alone .
our response needs to be as all-encompassing as the threat .
and this response can not be issued by the west alone .
if we were to adopt a paternalistic attitude , we would only inflict the first defeat upon ourselves .
instead we must formulate a serious offer based on genuine cooperation , an offer to work together with the states and societies of the region . "
rumsfeld : " world is a safer place " u.s. defense secretary rumsfeld , however , took a different view .
" the world is a safer place today because the coalition liberated 50 million people – 25 million in afghanistan and 25 million in iraq , " he told his audience of experts .
rumsfeld only fleetingly addressed fischer ’ s proposal .
the mediterranean dialog at nato needs to be put on the agenda for the coming nato summit this summer in istanbul .
still , nato needs to strengthen its participation in the war against terrorism in the future as the threat of weapons of mass destruction are greater than ever , he said .
" unless the spread of terrorism is stopped , attacks will grow bolder and still more deadly . "
the defense secretary also offered an alternative view of nato cooperation , saying that numerous nato troops are already deployed in iraq and afghanistan , with some members stationing soldiers in both places .
" some 24 of the 26 nato allies and invitees already have forces in either afghanistan or iraq and 17 of them have forces in both afghanistan and iraq , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 07.02.2004 czechs and slovaks struggle with nuclear legacy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian environmental activists are strongly opposed to the czech temelin nuclear power plant .
when eight central and eastern european countries join the european union in may , they will bring a number of problematic nuclear reactors with them .
the czech republic and slovakia are receiving particular scrutiny . although the eu is imposing strict rules on everything from farming to food safety on the acceding countries , brussels would strangely appear to have a rather casual approach to the topic of nuclear reactors .
despite plenty of concern about old soviet-era reactors , it would appear the west ’ s political or economic interests are taking priority . of all the former east bloc countries , the czech republic and slovakia are coming in for most of the criticism over safety due to their proximity to old western border of the eu .
wedged next to germany and austria , what was once czechoslovakia was already an industrialized country during communist times . steel and coal , heavy industry , weapons and mechanical engineering , chemical and auto industries were all important areas of production .
energy consumption was correspondingly high and was met above all by means of nuclear power . today there are four nuclear power sites on the territory of the former czechoslovakia : temelin and dukovany in the czech republic , plus jaslovske bohunyitze and mochovtze in slovakia .
in the czech republic three new nuclear reactors are to be built in the next few years , if the government ’ s plans are implemented .
and that has some czech activists concerned . “ it seems to us that the industry ministry intends to re-introduce the planned economy , ” marta heveryova of the european forum for effective energy use in prague said .
“ both energy consumption and production are being dictated .
it ’ s the same as under communism . ” communist technology the technology of the nuclear power plants operated in the czech republic and slovakia today also stems from communist times .
nonetheless , there are big differences : although the southern bohemian temelin produces most of the headlines because of its proximity to austria and bavaria and a string of mishaps , it is one of the newest and is considered one of the safest nuclear power plants in what was the eastern bloc . the international atomic energy agency in vienna even considers temelin to be safer than a number of germany ’ s older reactors .
but opponents criticize above all the mix of soviet reactor technology and american safety technology .
much more problematic than temelin is dukovany , whose reactors are not protected by a safety shell .
a plane crash would have disastrous results here and a military airbase is situated just nearby . in slovakia , there are two fairly new reactors in mochovtze , which the german siemens concern helped to modernize .
in jaslovske bohunyitze , two chernobyl-type reactors are in operation .
this slovak nuclear power plant is one of the few examples where the european union has made its early closing down a condition for membership to the bloc .
one reactor is to be switched off by 2006 and the other by 2008 . increasing opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : temelin .
meanwhile , people in the czech republic are also stepping up their resistance to new atomic power plants and to the planned nuclear waste depots .
numerous local authorities have already rejected such depots in their vicinity . in the czech republic , running the country ’ s own nuclear power plants was long seen as a question of national sovereignty and eco-activists were considered nutcases .
the sometimes militant actions by temelin opponents from austria have intensified this perception . “ blockading borders , for instance , is clearly harmful , ” said vladimir halama of a czech anti-temelin initiative .
“ it would be more helpful if local authorities in other countries gave us some advice – authorities that have experience with the production of alternative energy . ” but there are economic arguments to consider , since the czech republic and slovakia export large quantities of electricity . “ last year , she says , the czech reopublic exported a record 19 terawatt hours , corresponding to the annual production of temelin ’ s two reactor blocks , ” said halama . state monopoly structures in both the czech republic and slovakia have remained in place nearly 15 years after the fall of communism and there is little or no competition in the energy sector .
unfortunately , that will not change after the forthcoming privatization of the industry .
both the czechs and slovaks only want to sell their power plants as a package .

when eight central and eastern european countries join the european union in may , they will bring a number of problematic nuclear reactors with them .
the czech republic and slovakia are receiving particular scrutiny . although the eu is imposing strict rules on everything from farming to food safety on the acceding countries , brussels would strangely appear to have a rather casual approach to the topic of nuclear reactors .
despite plenty of concern about old soviet-era reactors , it would appear the west ’ s political or economic interests are taking priority . of all the former east bloc countries , the czech republic and slovakia are coming in for most of the criticism over safety due to their proximity to old western border of the eu .
wedged next to germany and austria , what was once czechoslovakia was already an industrialized country during communist times . steel and coal , heavy industry , weapons and mechanical engineering , chemical and auto industries were all important areas of production .
energy consumption was correspondingly high and was met above all by means of nuclear power . today there are four nuclear power sites on the territory of the former czechoslovakia : temelin and dukovany in the czech republic , plus jaslovske bohunyitze and mochovtze in slovakia .
in the czech republic three new nuclear reactors are to be built in the next few years , if the government ’ s plans are implemented .
and that has some czech activists concerned . “ it seems to us that the industry ministry intends to re-introduce the planned economy , ” marta heveryova of the european forum for effective energy use in prague said .
“ both energy consumption and production are being dictated .
it ’ s the same as under communism . ” communist technology the technology of the nuclear power plants operated in the czech republic and slovakia today also stems from communist times .
nonetheless , there are big differences : although the southern bohemian temelin produces most of the headlines because of its proximity to austria and bavaria and a string of mishaps , it is one of the newest and is considered one of the safest nuclear power plants in what was the eastern bloc . the international atomic energy agency in vienna even considers temelin to be safer than a number of germany ’ s older reactors .
but opponents criticize above all the mix of soviet reactor technology and american safety technology .
much more problematic than temelin is dukovany , whose reactors are not protected by a safety shell .
a plane crash would have disastrous results here and a military airbase is situated just nearby . in slovakia , there are two fairly new reactors in mochovtze , which the german siemens concern helped to modernize .
in jaslovske bohunyitze , two chernobyl-type reactors are in operation .
this slovak nuclear power plant is one of the few examples where the european union has made its early closing down a condition for membership to the bloc .
one reactor is to be switched off by 2006 and the other by 2008 . increasing opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : temelin .
meanwhile , people in the czech republic are also stepping up their resistance to new atomic power plants and to the planned nuclear waste depots .
numerous local authorities have already rejected such depots in their vicinity . in the czech republic , running the country ’ s own nuclear power plants was long seen as a question of national sovereignty and eco-activists were considered nutcases .
the sometimes militant actions by temelin opponents from austria have intensified this perception . “ blockading borders , for instance , is clearly harmful , ” said vladimir halama of a czech anti-temelin initiative .
“ it would be more helpful if local authorities in other countries gave us some advice – authorities that have experience with the production of alternative energy . ” but there are economic arguments to consider , since the czech republic and slovakia export large quantities of electricity . “ last year , she says , the czech reopublic exported a record 19 terawatt hours , corresponding to the annual production of temelin ’ s two reactor blocks , ” said halama . state monopoly structures in both the czech republic and slovakia have remained in place nearly 15 years after the fall of communism and there is little or no competition in the energy sector .
unfortunately , that will not change after the forthcoming privatization of the industry .
both the czechs and slovaks only want to sell their power plants as a package .

“ it would be more helpful if local authorities in other countries gave us some advice – authorities that have experience with the production of alternative energy . ” but there are economic arguments to consider , since the czech republic and slovakia export large quantities of electricity . “ last year , she says , the czech reopublic exported a record 19 terawatt hours , corresponding to the annual production of temelin ’ s two reactor blocks , ” said halama . state monopoly structures in both the czech republic and slovakia have remained in place nearly 15 years after the fall of communism and there is little or no competition in the energy sector .
unfortunately , that will not change after the forthcoming privatization of the industry .
both the czechs and slovaks only want to sell their power plants as a package .

at an international security meeting in munich , germany calls for the creation of a new u.s. and european peace plan for the middle east as donald rumsfeld again explains washington ’ s justification for the iraq war . one year after their famous sparring match over the planned iraq war , german foreign minister joschka fischer and united states secretary of defense donald rumsfeld again came together in munich on saturday .
though the trend in the transatlantic relationship is upward , discomfort between the two countries was still palpable at the 40th international security conference here as fischer defended germany ’ s opposition to the war and rumsfeld once again defended the u.s.-led invasion .
" the federal government feels that events have proven the position it took at the time to be right , " he said .
" it was our political decision not to join the coalition because we were not , and are still not , convinced of the validity of the reasons for war . "
still , fischer said it was crucial that the war be brought to a successful conclusion and that peace be found .
" for a failure would have had equally damaging consequences for us all , for europe as for america , for pro-war and anti-war countries , " he said .
" this conviction informed germany 's position during and after the war on iraq . "
germany : no troops for iraq fischer also expressed " deep skepticism " of any kind of nato mission in iraq , adding that germany would not stand in the way of such a mission but neither would berlin send any troops .
he also repeated german demands that the united nations be given a central leadership role in iraq .
the foreign minister called for a " sustainable long-term reform process in the region as a whole , " without which it would be impossible to bring lasting peace .
" notwithstanding the controversy about the war in iraq , we have long shared the view that following sept .
11 , 2001 , neither the u.s. nor europe and the middle east itself can tolerate the status quo in the middle east any longer , " he said .
" the middle east is at the epicenter of the greatest threat to our regional and global security at the dawn of this century : destructive jihadist terrorism with its totalitarian ideology .
this brand of terrorism does not only pose a threat to the societies of the west , but also and above all to the islamic and arab world . "
germany offers new peace plan bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer , center , stands with german defense minister peter struck , left , and nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer to wait for the start of the 40th munich conference on security policy in munich , southern germany , saturday , feb .
7 , 2004 .
-lrb- ap photo / diether endlicher -rrb- spezialbild additionally , fischer proposed a new transatlantic initiative in the middle east structured around nato .
" in order to succeed , the european union and the us should , in view of this major challenge to our common security , pool their capabilities , assets and projects to form a new transatlantic initiative for the middle east . "
the foreign minister ’ s plan would come in two phases .
first , nato countries would come a common middle east policy while , simultaneously , europe and the u.s would further expand economic ties and possibly establish a free-trade zone with the middle east .
northern african countries and the entire arab league would be brought into the dialog in order to stop terrorism that is taking root there .
afterwards , the countries would create a binding agreement calling for them to disarm and renounce violence .
" if the states of europe and north america work together strategically as partners in the european union and in nato in response to the common threat , " fischer said , " and if they bring their particular abilities and strengths to bear in a new cooperation with the states of the middle east , then we can make this truly paramount contribution to our joint security . "
but fischer said military missions means would not be enough to halt the violence in the middle east .
" we can not counter the threat of this new totalitarianism by military means alone .
our response needs to be as all-encompassing as the threat .
and this response can not be issued by the west alone .
if we were to adopt a paternalistic attitude , we would only inflict the first defeat upon ourselves .
instead we must formulate a serious offer based on genuine cooperation , an offer to work together with the states and societies of the region . "
rumsfeld : " world is a safer place " u.s. defense secretary rumsfeld , however , took a different view .
" the world is a safer place today because the coalition liberated 50 million people – 25 million in afghanistan and 25 million in iraq , " he told his audience of experts .
rumsfeld only fleetingly addressed fischer ’ s proposal .
the mediterranean dialog at nato needs to be put on the agenda for the coming nato summit this summer in istanbul .
still , nato needs to strengthen its participation in the war against terrorism in the future as the threat of weapons of mass destruction are greater than ever , he said .
" unless the spread of terrorism is stopped , attacks will grow bolder and still more deadly . "
the defense secretary also offered an alternative view of nato cooperation , saying that numerous nato troops are already deployed in iraq and afghanistan , with some members stationing soldiers in both places .
" some 24 of the 26 nato allies and invitees already have forces in either afghanistan or iraq and 17 of them have forces in both afghanistan and iraq , " he said .

at an international security meeting in munich , germany calls for the creation of a new u.s. and european peace plan for the middle east as donald rumsfeld again explains washington ’ s justification for the iraq war . one year after their famous sparring match over the planned iraq war , german foreign minister joschka fischer and united states secretary of defense donald rumsfeld again came together in munich on saturday .
though the trend in the transatlantic relationship is upward , discomfort between the two countries was still palpable at the 40th international security conference here as fischer defended germany ’ s opposition to the war and rumsfeld once again defended the u.s.-led invasion .
" the federal government feels that events have proven the position it took at the time to be right , " he said .
" it was our political decision not to join the coalition because we were not , and are still not , convinced of the validity of the reasons for war . "
still , fischer said it was crucial that the war be brought to a successful conclusion and that peace be found .
" for a failure would have had equally damaging consequences for us all , for europe as for america , for pro-war and anti-war countries , " he said .
" this conviction informed germany 's position during and after the war on iraq . "
germany : no troops for iraq fischer also expressed " deep skepticism " of any kind of nato mission in iraq , adding that germany would not stand in the way of such a mission but neither would berlin send any troops .
he also repeated german demands that the united nations be given a central leadership role in iraq .
the foreign minister called for a " sustainable long-term reform process in the region as a whole , " without which it would be impossible to bring lasting peace .
" notwithstanding the controversy about the war in iraq , we have long shared the view that following sept .
11 , 2001 , neither the u.s. nor europe and the middle east itself can tolerate the status quo in the middle east any longer , " he said .
" the middle east is at the epicenter of the greatest threat to our regional and global security at the dawn of this century : destructive jihadist terrorism with its totalitarian ideology .
this brand of terrorism does not only pose a threat to the societies of the west , but also and above all to the islamic and arab world . "
germany offers new peace plan bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer , center , stands with german defense minister peter struck , left , and nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer to wait for the start of the 40th munich conference on security policy in munich , southern germany , saturday , feb .
7 , 2004 .
-lrb- ap photo / diether endlicher -rrb- spezialbild additionally , fischer proposed a new transatlantic initiative in the middle east structured around nato .
" in order to succeed , the european union and the us should , in view of this major challenge to our common security , pool their capabilities , assets and projects to form a new transatlantic initiative for the middle east . "
the foreign minister ’ s plan would come in two phases .
first , nato countries would come a common middle east policy while , simultaneously , europe and the u.s would further expand economic ties and possibly establish a free-trade zone with the middle east .
northern african countries and the entire arab league would be brought into the dialog in order to stop terrorism that is taking root there .
afterwards , the countries would create a binding agreement calling for them to disarm and renounce violence .
" if the states of europe and north america work together strategically as partners in the european union and in nato in response to the common threat , " fischer said , " and if they bring their particular abilities and strengths to bear in a new cooperation with the states of the middle east , then we can make this truly paramount contribution to our joint security . "
but fischer said military missions means would not be enough to halt the violence in the middle east .
" we can not counter the threat of this new totalitarianism by military means alone .
our response needs to be as all-encompassing as the threat .
and this response can not be issued by the west alone .
if we were to adopt a paternalistic attitude , we would only inflict the first defeat upon ourselves .
instead we must formulate a serious offer based on genuine cooperation , an offer to work together with the states and societies of the region . "
rumsfeld : " world is a safer place " u.s. defense secretary rumsfeld , however , took a different view .
" the world is a safer place today because the coalition liberated 50 million people – 25 million in afghanistan and 25 million in iraq , " he told his audience of experts .
rumsfeld only fleetingly addressed fischer ’ s proposal .
the mediterranean dialog at nato needs to be put on the agenda for the coming nato summit this summer in istanbul .
still , nato needs to strengthen its participation in the war against terrorism in the future as the threat of weapons of mass destruction are greater than ever , he said .
" unless the spread of terrorism is stopped , attacks will grow bolder and still more deadly . "
the defense secretary also offered an alternative view of nato cooperation , saying that numerous nato troops are already deployed in iraq and afghanistan , with some members stationing soldiers in both places .

at an international security meeting in munich , germany calls for the creation of a new u.s. and european peace plan for the middle east as donald rumsfeld again explains washington ’ s justification for the iraq war . one year after their famous sparring match over the planned iraq war , german foreign minister joschka fischer and united states secretary of defense donald rumsfeld again came together in munich on saturday .
though the trend in the transatlantic relationship is upward , discomfort between the two countries was still palpable at the 40th international security conference here as fischer defended germany ’ s opposition to the war and rumsfeld once again defended the u.s.-led invasion .
" the federal government feels that events have proven the position it took at the time to be right , " he said .
" it was our political decision not to join the coalition because we were not , and are still not , convinced of the validity of the reasons for war . "
still , fischer said it was crucial that the war be brought to a successful conclusion and that peace be found .
" for a failure would have had equally damaging consequences for us all , for europe as for america , for pro-war and anti-war countries , " he said .
" this conviction informed germany 's position during and after the war on iraq . "
germany : no troops for iraq fischer also expressed " deep skepticism " of any kind of nato mission in iraq , adding that germany would not stand in the way of such a mission but neither would berlin send any troops .
he also repeated german demands that the united nations be given a central leadership role in iraq .
the foreign minister called for a " sustainable long-term reform process in the region as a whole , " without which it would be impossible to bring lasting peace .
" notwithstanding the controversy about the war in iraq , we have long shared the view that following sept .
11 , 2001 , neither the u.s. nor europe and the middle east itself can tolerate the status quo in the middle east any longer , " he said .
" the middle east is at the epicenter of the greatest threat to our regional and global security at the dawn of this century : destructive jihadist terrorism with its totalitarian ideology .
this brand of terrorism does not only pose a threat to the societies of the west , but also and above all to the islamic and arab world . "

-lrb- ap photo / diether endlicher -rrb- spezialbild additionally , fischer proposed a new transatlantic initiative in the middle east structured around nato .
" in order to succeed , the european union and the us should , in view of this major challenge to our common security , pool their capabilities , assets and projects to form a new transatlantic initiative for the middle east . "
the foreign minister ’ s plan would come in two phases .
first , nato countries would come a common middle east policy while , simultaneously , europe and the u.s would further expand economic ties and possibly establish a free-trade zone with the middle east .
northern african countries and the entire arab league would be brought into the dialog in order to stop terrorism that is taking root there .
afterwards , the countries would create a binding agreement calling for them to disarm and renounce violence .
" if the states of europe and north america work together strategically as partners in the european union and in nato in response to the common threat , " fischer said , " and if they bring their particular abilities and strengths to bear in a new cooperation with the states of the middle east , then we can make this truly paramount contribution to our joint security . "
but fischer said military missions means would not be enough to halt the violence in the middle east .
" we can not counter the threat of this new totalitarianism by military means alone .
our response needs to be as all-encompassing as the threat .
and this response can not be issued by the west alone .
if we were to adopt a paternalistic attitude , we would only inflict the first defeat upon ourselves .
instead we must formulate a serious offer based on genuine cooperation , an offer to work together with the states and societies of the region . "
rumsfeld : " world is a safer place " u.s. defense secretary rumsfeld , however , took a different view .
" the world is a safer place today because the coalition liberated 50 million people – 25 million in afghanistan and 25 million in iraq , " he told his audience of experts .
rumsfeld only fleetingly addressed fischer ’ s proposal .
the mediterranean dialog at nato needs to be put on the agenda for the coming nato summit this summer in istanbul .
still , nato needs to strengthen its participation in the war against terrorism in the future as the threat of weapons of mass destruction are greater than ever , he said .
" unless the spread of terrorism is stopped , attacks will grow bolder and still more deadly . "
the defense secretary also offered an alternative view of nato cooperation , saying that numerous nato troops are already deployed in iraq and afghanistan , with some members stationing soldiers in both places .
" some 24 of the 26 nato allies and invitees already have forces in either afghanistan or iraq and 17 of them have forces in both afghanistan and iraq , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 07.02.2004 czechs and slovaks struggle with nuclear legacy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian environmental activists are strongly opposed to the czech temelin nuclear power plant .
when eight central and eastern european countries join the european union in may , they will bring a number of problematic nuclear reactors with them .
the czech republic and slovakia are receiving particular scrutiny . although the eu is imposing strict rules on everything from farming to food safety on the acceding countries , brussels would strangely appear to have a rather casual approach to the topic of nuclear reactors .
despite plenty of concern about old soviet-era reactors , it would appear the west ’ s political or economic interests are taking priority . of all the former east bloc countries , the czech republic and slovakia are coming in for most of the criticism over safety due to their proximity to old western border of the eu .
wedged next to germany and austria , what was once czechoslovakia was already an industrialized country during communist times . steel and coal , heavy industry , weapons and mechanical engineering , chemical and auto industries were all important areas of production .
energy consumption was correspondingly high and was met above all by means of nuclear power . today there are four nuclear power sites on the territory of the former czechoslovakia : temelin and dukovany in the czech republic , plus jaslovske bohunyitze and mochovtze in slovakia .
in the czech republic three new nuclear reactors are to be built in the next few years , if the government ’ s plans are implemented .
and that has some czech activists concerned . “ it seems to us that the industry ministry intends to re-introduce the planned economy , ” marta heveryova of the european forum for effective energy use in prague said .
“ both energy consumption and production are being dictated .
it ’ s the same as under communism . ” communist technology the technology of the nuclear power plants operated in the czech republic and slovakia today also stems from communist times .
nonetheless , there are big differences : although the southern bohemian temelin produces most of the headlines because of its proximity to austria and bavaria and a string of mishaps , it is one of the newest and is considered one of the safest nuclear power plants in what was the eastern bloc . the international atomic energy agency in vienna even considers temelin to be safer than a number of germany ’ s older reactors .
but opponents criticize above all the mix of soviet reactor technology and american safety technology .
much more problematic than temelin is dukovany , whose reactors are not protected by a safety shell .
a plane crash would have disastrous results here and a military airbase is situated just nearby . in slovakia , there are two fairly new reactors in mochovtze , which the german siemens concern helped to modernize .
in jaslovske bohunyitze , two chernobyl-type reactors are in operation .
this slovak nuclear power plant is one of the few examples where the european union has made its early closing down a condition for membership to the bloc .
one reactor is to be switched off by 2006 and the other by 2008 . increasing opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : temelin .
meanwhile , people in the czech republic are also stepping up their resistance to new atomic power plants and to the planned nuclear waste depots .
numerous local authorities have already rejected such depots in their vicinity . in the czech republic , running the country ’ s own nuclear power plants was long seen as a question of national sovereignty and eco-activists were considered nutcases .
the sometimes militant actions by temelin opponents from austria have intensified this perception . “ blockading borders , for instance , is clearly harmful , ” said vladimir halama of a czech anti-temelin initiative .
“ it would be more helpful if local authorities in other countries gave us some advice – authorities that have experience with the production of alternative energy . ” but there are economic arguments to consider , since the czech republic and slovakia export large quantities of electricity . “ last year , she says , the czech reopublic exported a record 19 terawatt hours , corresponding to the annual production of temelin ’ s two reactor blocks , ” said halama . state monopoly structures in both the czech republic and slovakia have remained in place nearly 15 years after the fall of communism and there is little or no competition in the energy sector .
unfortunately , that will not change after the forthcoming privatization of the industry .
both the czechs and slovaks only want to sell their power plants as a package .
possible bidders are the french company eléctricité de france and germany ’ s e.on. christoph scheffer -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany starts nuclear energy phase-out germany 's future is looking a lot greener with the closure of the stade nuclear reactor power plant on friday .

the czech republic and slovakia are receiving particular scrutiny . although the eu is imposing strict rules on everything from farming to food safety on the acceding countries , brussels would strangely appear to have a rather casual approach to the topic of nuclear reactors .
despite plenty of concern about old soviet-era reactors , it would appear the west ’ s political or economic interests are taking priority . of all the former east bloc countries , the czech republic and slovakia are coming in for most of the criticism over safety due to their proximity to old western border of the eu .
wedged next to germany and austria , what was once czechoslovakia was already an industrialized country during communist times . steel and coal , heavy industry , weapons and mechanical engineering , chemical and auto industries were all important areas of production .
energy consumption was correspondingly high and was met above all by means of nuclear power . today there are four nuclear power sites on the territory of the former czechoslovakia : temelin and dukovany in the czech republic , plus jaslovske bohunyitze and mochovtze in slovakia .
in the czech republic three new nuclear reactors are to be built in the next few years , if the government ’ s plans are implemented .
and that has some czech activists concerned . “ it seems to us that the industry ministry intends to re-introduce the planned economy , ” marta heveryova of the european forum for effective energy use in prague said .
“ both energy consumption and production are being dictated .
it ’ s the same as under communism . ” communist technology the technology of the nuclear power plants operated in the czech republic and slovakia today also stems from communist times .
nonetheless , there are big differences : although the southern bohemian temelin produces most of the headlines because of its proximity to austria and bavaria and a string of mishaps , it is one of the newest and is considered one of the safest nuclear power plants in what was the eastern bloc . the international atomic energy agency in vienna even considers temelin to be safer than a number of germany ’ s older reactors .
but opponents criticize above all the mix of soviet reactor technology and american safety technology .
much more problematic than temelin is dukovany , whose reactors are not protected by a safety shell .
a plane crash would have disastrous results here and a military airbase is situated just nearby . in slovakia , there are two fairly new reactors in mochovtze , which the german siemens concern helped to modernize .
in jaslovske bohunyitze , two chernobyl-type reactors are in operation .
this slovak nuclear power plant is one of the few examples where the european union has made its early closing down a condition for membership to the bloc .
one reactor is to be switched off by 2006 and the other by 2008 . increasing opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : temelin .
meanwhile , people in the czech republic are also stepping up their resistance to new atomic power plants and to the planned nuclear waste depots .
numerous local authorities have already rejected such depots in their vicinity . in the czech republic , running the country ’ s own nuclear power plants was long seen as a question of national sovereignty and eco-activists were considered nutcases .
the sometimes militant actions by temelin opponents from austria have intensified this perception . “ blockading borders , for instance , is clearly harmful , ” said vladimir halama of a czech anti-temelin initiative .
“ it would be more helpful if local authorities in other countries gave us some advice – authorities that have experience with the production of alternative energy . ” but there are economic arguments to consider , since the czech republic and slovakia export large quantities of electricity . “ last year , she says , the czech reopublic exported a record 19 terawatt hours , corresponding to the annual production of temelin ’ s two reactor blocks , ” said halama . state monopoly structures in both the czech republic and slovakia have remained in place nearly 15 years after the fall of communism and there is little or no competition in the energy sector .
unfortunately , that will not change after the forthcoming privatization of the industry .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 07.02.2004 fischer calls for new roadmap for mideast peace großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer appears more optimistic at this year 's international security conference .
at an international security meeting in munich , germany calls for the creation of a new u.s. and european peace plan for the middle east as donald rumsfeld again explains washington ’ s justification for the iraq war . one year after their famous sparring match over the planned iraq war , german foreign minister joschka fischer and united states secretary of defense donald rumsfeld again came together in munich on saturday .
though the trend in the transatlantic relationship is upward , discomfort between the two countries was still palpable at the 40th international security conference here as fischer defended germany ’ s opposition to the war and rumsfeld once again defended the u.s.-led invasion .
" the federal government feels that events have proven the position it took at the time to be right , " he said .
" it was our political decision not to join the coalition because we were not , and are still not , convinced of the validity of the reasons for war . "
still , fischer said it was crucial that the war be brought to a successful conclusion and that peace be found .
" for a failure would have had equally damaging consequences for us all , for europe as for america , for pro-war and anti-war countries , " he said .
" this conviction informed germany 's position during and after the war on iraq . "
germany : no troops for iraq fischer also expressed " deep skepticism " of any kind of nato mission in iraq , adding that germany would not stand in the way of such a mission but neither would berlin send any troops .
he also repeated german demands that the united nations be given a central leadership role in iraq .
the foreign minister called for a " sustainable long-term reform process in the region as a whole , " without which it would be impossible to bring lasting peace .
" notwithstanding the controversy about the war in iraq , we have long shared the view that following sept .
11 , 2001 , neither the u.s. nor europe and the middle east itself can tolerate the status quo in the middle east any longer , " he said .
" the middle east is at the epicenter of the greatest threat to our regional and global security at the dawn of this century : destructive jihadist terrorism with its totalitarian ideology .
this brand of terrorism does not only pose a threat to the societies of the west , but also and above all to the islamic and arab world . "
germany offers new peace plan bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer , center , stands with german defense minister peter struck , left , and nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer to wait for the start of the 40th munich conference on security policy in munich , southern germany , saturday , feb .
7 , 2004 .
-lrb- ap photo / diether endlicher -rrb- spezialbild additionally , fischer proposed a new transatlantic initiative in the middle east structured around nato .
" in order to succeed , the european union and the us should , in view of this major challenge to our common security , pool their capabilities , assets and projects to form a new transatlantic initiative for the middle east . "
the foreign minister ’ s plan would come in two phases .
first , nato countries would come a common middle east policy while , simultaneously , europe and the u.s would further expand economic ties and possibly establish a free-trade zone with the middle east .
northern african countries and the entire arab league would be brought into the dialog in order to stop terrorism that is taking root there .
afterwards , the countries would create a binding agreement calling for them to disarm and renounce violence .
" if the states of europe and north america work together strategically as partners in the european union and in nato in response to the common threat , " fischer said , " and if they bring their particular abilities and strengths to bear in a new cooperation with the states of the middle east , then we can make this truly paramount contribution to our joint security . "
but fischer said military missions means would not be enough to halt the violence in the middle east .
" we can not counter the threat of this new totalitarianism by military means alone .
our response needs to be as all-encompassing as the threat .
and this response can not be issued by the west alone .
if we were to adopt a paternalistic attitude , we would only inflict the first defeat upon ourselves .
instead we must formulate a serious offer based on genuine cooperation , an offer to work together with the states and societies of the region . "
rumsfeld : " world is a safer place " u.s. defense secretary rumsfeld , however , took a different view .
" the world is a safer place today because the coalition liberated 50 million people – 25 million in afghanistan and 25 million in iraq , " he told his audience of experts .
rumsfeld only fleetingly addressed fischer ’ s proposal .
the mediterranean dialog at nato needs to be put on the agenda for the coming nato summit this summer in istanbul .
still , nato needs to strengthen its participation in the war against terrorism in the future as the threat of weapons of mass destruction are greater than ever , he said .
" unless the spread of terrorism is stopped , attacks will grow bolder and still more deadly . "
the defense secretary also offered an alternative view of nato cooperation , saying that numerous nato troops are already deployed in iraq and afghanistan , with some members stationing soldiers in both places .
" some 24 of the 26 nato allies and invitees already have forces in either afghanistan or iraq and 17 of them have forces in both afghanistan and iraq , " he said .
rumsfeld also praised nato , noting its development in recent years and the numerous military missions it has undertaken . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder backs eurocorps deployment in afghanistan german chancellor gerhard schröder on friday said he supported expanding peacekeeping operations in afghanistan , but remained cool to merging the nato deployment with the u.s. military campaign in the country .

bbc news -pipe- technology -pipe- blaming the dark side of gaming bbc news / technology graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- saturday , 7 february , 2004 , 08:29 gmt blaming the dark side of gaming it is trite and irresponsible to accuse violent video games of promoting crime , argues daniel etherington of bbci collective in his weekly games column .
it has long been a key argument - are we formulated more by our genes or our environment ?
if a gene can dictate that your eyesight will be bad , can another dictate a propensity for violence ?
or can certain experiences make you violent ?
as a consumer of games that are regularly deemed bad influences , i have to wonder .
can they nurture violence in oneself ?
or were the killers whose activities have been linked to games already psychopaths before they ever played the games ?
a point here is that often the crimes associated with specific games are perpetrated by young people , many of whom technically should not have been playing games given a mature rating in the first place .
it is elusive but , potentially , teenagers whose moral and ethical understanding of how society works is immature or unformulated could be affected by violence in cultural items .
instead of slippery ethical notions , though , it is easier to get more cohesive answers to questions of physiology and neurobiology .
genetic questions young men are generally central to the crimes in question , and young men are notorious for their testosterone - something that 's long caused injury in more generic violence , such as brawling .
in terms of the nature / nurture argument , are such young men also inclined to violence through their genes ? "
in the case of gaming there is very much a missing link that would connect it concretely with real-world violence " increasingly , it looks like the nature versus nurture dichotomy is not only misleading , but wrong .
it may seem obvious , but how can there be one without the other ?
scientific evidence points to how environmental factors can cause changes in hormone and protein levels which can then affect certain genes .
so , for example , stress hormone glucocorticoid can regulate the expression of genes that have a bearing on depression .
other evidence indicates that environmental factors such as prolonged trauma can potentially result in changes to fear and anxiety levels .
such work would indicate that , yes , even cultural items such as games and movies , may affect us , and engaging with an ultra-violent game could conceivably register with the brain as a stressful or traumatic experience .
however , it must be emphasised that there is no solid evidence in this specific area as yet .
in the case of gaming there is very much a missing link that would connect it concretely with real-world violence .
as michael moore so eloquently discussed in bowling for columbine , canada has violence in movies and games , plus more guns per capita than the us , but proportionately a fraction of the killings .
japan provides a similar case study where fictional violence is arguably more widespread than in the us , but the country 's murder rate is around 800 per year in a population of 127 million .
in new york city , there were around 600 murders in 2003 in a population of eight million .
social , cultural , ethical and neurobiological issues remain in such a tangle that it is trite and irresponsible of ill-informed commentators to claim that games like grand theft auto are central to terrible crime .
before such accusations are explicitly made , more credible work has to be done in this area .
scientific conclusions may well remain elusive for decades .
for now , enjoy your gaming .

first-person shooters are popular with gamers it has long been a key argument - are we formulated more by our genes or our environment ?
if a gene can dictate that your eyesight will be bad , can another dictate a propensity for violence ?
or can certain experiences make you violent ?
as a consumer of games that are regularly deemed bad influences , i have to wonder .
can they nurture violence in oneself ?
or were the killers whose activities have been linked to games already psychopaths before they ever played the games ?
a point here is that often the crimes associated with specific games are perpetrated by young people , many of whom technically should not have been playing games given a mature rating in the first place .
it is elusive but , potentially , teenagers whose moral and ethical understanding of how society works is immature or unformulated could be affected by violence in cultural items .
instead of slippery ethical notions , though , it is easier to get more cohesive answers to questions of physiology and neurobiology .
genetic questions young men are generally central to the crimes in question , and young men are notorious for their testosterone - something that 's long caused injury in more generic violence , such as brawling .
in terms of the nature / nurture argument , are such young men also inclined to violence through their genes ?
in the case of gaming there is very much a missing link that would connect it concretely with real-world violence discuss this story on bbci collective increasingly , it looks like the nature versus nurture dichotomy is not only misleading , but wrong .
it may seem obvious , but how can there be one without the other ?
scientific evidence points to how environmental factors can cause changes in hormone and protein levels which can then affect certain genes .
so , for example , stress hormone glucocorticoid can regulate the expression of genes that have a bearing on depression .
other evidence indicates that environmental factors such as prolonged trauma can potentially result in changes to fear and anxiety levels .
such work would indicate that , yes , even cultural items such as games and movies , may affect us , and engaging with an ultra-violent game could conceivably register with the brain as a stressful or traumatic experience .
however , it must be emphasised that there is no solid evidence in this specific area as yet .
in the case of gaming there is very much a missing link that would connect it concretely with real-world violence .
as michael moore so eloquently discussed in bowling for columbine , canada has violence in movies and games , plus more guns per capita than the us , but proportionately a fraction of the killings .
japan provides a similar case study where fictional violence is arguably more widespread than in the us , but the country 's murder rate is around 800 per year in a population of 127 million .
in new york city , there were around 600 murders in 2003 in a population of eight million .
social , cultural , ethical and neurobiological issues remain in such a tangle that it is trite and irresponsible of ill-informed commentators to claim that games like grand theft auto are central to terrible crime .
before such accusations are explicitly made , more credible work has to be done in this area .
scientific conclusions may well remain elusive for decades .
for now , enjoy your gaming .

a point here is that often the crimes associated with specific games are perpetrated by young people , many of whom technically should not have been playing games given a mature rating in the first place .

instead of slippery ethical notions , though , it is easier to get more cohesive answers to questions of physiology and neurobiology .
genetic questions young men are generally central to the crimes in question , and young men are notorious for their testosterone - something that 's long caused injury in more generic violence , such as brawling .
in terms of the nature / nurture argument , are such young men also inclined to violence through their genes ?

scientific evidence points to how environmental factors can cause changes in hormone and protein levels which can then affect certain genes .
so , for example , stress hormone glucocorticoid can regulate the expression of genes that have a bearing on depression .
other evidence indicates that environmental factors such as prolonged trauma can potentially result in changes to fear and anxiety levels .
such work would indicate that , yes , even cultural items such as games and movies , may affect us , and engaging with an ultra-violent game could conceivably register with the brain as a stressful or traumatic experience .

mr jones , who heads the party in the assembly , wants the issue discussed once the richard commission has published its report in march .
in a speech in cardiff on monday he will warn against a labour " stitch-up " , while setting out his party 's arguments for a welsh parliament .
earlier this week , first minister rhodri morgan confirmed that he favoured devolving full law-making powers to the assembly .
but he drew the line at allowing it to raise taxes .

he wants a review of the barnett formula - the system which calculates how much money wales gets from westminster - and he wants the assembly to be able to vary income tax and corporation tax .
ieuan wyn jones : demanding action plaid hopes to draw attention to its campaign for a welsh parliament with a rally in machynlleth later this month .
the event will be held on 28 february - the 600th anniversary of welsh hero owain glyndwr establishing his parliament in the town .
the assembly 's powers - or lack of them - were thrown into the spotlight on tuesday , when rhodri morgan spoke to assembly members during first minister 's question time .
his comments gave the clearest indication so far on two of the big issues for the future of devolution .
he said : " the broad thrust of my own personal belief is that it would be better if we had primary legislative powers and it would give us more capability to do more good things for the people of wales , but i take the completely opposite view on tax-varying powers . "
his comments came as the richard commission - the body looking into the future of the devolution settlement in wales - put the finishing touches to its final report .

mr morgan told ams that he had chosen to keep his views largely under wraps while the commission was drawing up its report .
the commission is due to publish its report on 31 march .
the uk government is understood to have declared three " no-go " areas on the issue of further powers for the assembly .
these are thought to be tax-varying powers , any cut in the number of mps , and anything requiring a referendum .

mr jones , who heads the party in the assembly , wants the issue discussed once the richard commission has published its report in march .
in a speech in cardiff on monday he will warn against a labour " stitch-up " , while setting out his party 's arguments for a welsh parliament .
earlier this week , first minister rhodri morgan confirmed that he favoured devolving full law-making powers to the assembly .
but he drew the line at allowing it to raise taxes .
mr jones , however , will outline his arguments for more radical change .
he wants a review of the barnett formula - the system which calculates how much money wales gets from westminster - and he wants the assembly to be able to vary income tax and corporation tax .
ieuan wyn jones : demanding action plaid hopes to draw attention to its campaign for a welsh parliament with a rally in machynlleth later this month .
the event will be held on 28 february - the 600th anniversary of welsh hero owain glyndwr establishing his parliament in the town .
the assembly 's powers - or lack of them - were thrown into the spotlight on tuesday , when rhodri morgan spoke to assembly members during first minister 's question time .
his comments gave the clearest indication so far on two of the big issues for the future of devolution .
he said : " the broad thrust of my own personal belief is that it would be better if we had primary legislative powers and it would give us more capability to do more good things for the people of wales , but i take the completely opposite view on tax-varying powers . "
his comments came as the richard commission - the body looking into the future of the devolution settlement in wales - put the finishing touches to its final report .
under wraps both plaid cymru and the liberal democrats welcomed his words .
mr morgan told ams that he had chosen to keep his views largely under wraps while the commission was drawing up its report .
the commission is due to publish its report on 31 march .
the uk government is understood to have declared three " no-go " areas on the issue of further powers for the assembly .
these are thought to be tax-varying powers , any cut in the number of mps , and anything requiring a referendum .
the commission , set up in 2002 , has been examining the assembly 's work since the devolved body was set up in 1999 .

the farmers ' union of wales has said this week 's heavy rain and subsequent flooding across large parts of wales had highlighted the plight facing many of its members in areas particularly prone to flooding .
" although farmers can have insurance cover for their homes , no such cover exists for outbuildings , stock , produce or land , " said the union 's director of business development , emyr james .
" this means that , when large tracts of land are hit by flooding , the farmer has to race against time to save his stock and protect his property . "
devastating flooding in ruthin earlier this week , for example , has left silt 30cm high on some areas of farmland where ewes were about to start giving birth .
" the land is totally unsuitable for lambing until this debris is removed , " said mr james .
floods have brought misery to many farmers " this means that the farmers involved must now seek alternative areas of land , possibly at considerable cost , to enable their ewes to lamb in safety , " he said .
the plight of several horses left stranded near the conwy village of trefriw also made headlines across the uk - they were later rescued .
floods have also wreaked havoc with livestock feed like silage , so farmers are having to pay for additional supplies .
mr james said instances of serious flooding had increased in many areas in wales in recent years .
consequently , many farmers who had been hit several times had found it difficult or impossible to find insurance cover .
" the fuw would like our politicians in the assembly and westminster to examine the possibility of establishing a national emergency disaster fund to assist farmers - and any other businesses - who can not obtain insurance cover for parts of their operation , " he added .

archaeologists using the latest radio-carbon dating technology found that the ukhahlamba-drakensberg paintings are 3,000 years old .
earlier findings by researchers had indicated that the paintings by san hunters-gatherers were 1,000 years old .
the latest research was carried out by the britain 's newcastle university and australian national university .
there are more than 40,000 rock paintings at the site in south africa .
" this is a small but important step forward in the interpretation of the some of the world 's finest collection of rock art , " said dr aron mazel , a south african researcher primitive and crude the findings by dr mazel and dr alan watchman are published in the current edition of the academic journal , south african humanities .
the paintings are made mainly of black , white , red and orange pigments when europeans first encountered the rock paintings 150 years ago they considered them as primitive and crude .
but experts now consider the area to be the largest grouping of paintings in africa , south of the sahara .
the paintings by the san hunter-gatherers who settled in the area about 8,000 years ago were made using mainly black , white and orange pigments .
they depict animals and human scenes and are said to represent religious beliefs of the san .
" we hope to use this technique to date more of the paintings and organise them in chronological order in the hope that , like a family photograph album they can tell us a little more about how life evolved for the san people , " dr mazel said .

" this is a small but important step forward in the interpretation of the some of the world 's finest collection of rock art , " said dr aron mazel , a south african researcher primitive and crude the findings by dr mazel and dr alan watchman are published in the current edition of the academic journal , south african humanities .
the paintings are made mainly of black , white , red and orange pigments when europeans first encountered the rock paintings 150 years ago they considered them as primitive and crude .
but experts now consider the area to be the largest grouping of paintings in africa , south of the sahara .
the paintings by the san hunter-gatherers who settled in the area about 8,000 years ago were made using mainly black , white and orange pigments .
they depict animals and human scenes and are said to represent religious beliefs of the san .
" we hope to use this technique to date more of the paintings and organise them in chronological order in the hope that , like a family photograph album they can tell us a little more about how life evolved for the san people , " dr mazel said .

sasha , a staffordshire bull terrier , plunged down a natural fissure on farmland at cassop , near spennymoor , on thursday .
a firm made a mechanical digger available as a fire crew aided by rspca officers carried out a painstaking attempt to free the pet .
the team was carefully trying to move earth around the hole , at times using buckets to shift it manually , so as not to cause a collapse on to the dog below .
john percival , 43 , from nearby newton hall , had been walking sasha with his son stephen , 20 , when the puppy fell .
larger hole rescuers began their efforts on thursday , but were forced to call off the operation as night fell and it became too dangerous to continue .
they resumed at first light on friday .
but a spokesman for durham and darlington fire and rescue said that they had failed to gain access to the fissure , and it appeared that the dog had fallen into a second , much larger hole .
he said : " we are closing down the incident now .
" we took advice from the rspca and our officer at the scene had decided that , as we have n't heard from the dog in some time and the hole seems to be falling in on itself , we are going to have to close it down . "
mr percival said : " my son tried to catch her , but she disappeared over the edge of the deep crevice . "

the bbc had to be wary of labelling stories as " exclusive " , he added .

it also found that bbc management had failed to properly investigate whether that report was accurate and fair .

american balloonist steve fossett is hoping to break the jules verne record in his 125-foot catamaran , the cheyenne .
fossett and his 12-strong crew set sail from plymouth on friday and completed the 120-mile trip to the start-finish line at le stiff lighthouse on the french island of ouessant at 0510 gmt on saturday .
he is aiming to slash the record to circumnavigate the globe , which stands at 64 days and eight hours and was set two years ago .
the first task is to make it round without breaking the equipment steve fossett the cheyenne 's 21,760-mile -lrb- 35,019-kilometre -rrb- voyage will go via the cape of good hope , cape leeuwin and cape horn .

brian thompson from southampton ; engineer mark featherstone from salcombe ; justin slattery and damian foxall , both from the irish republic , are among the cheyenne 's multi-national crew .
speaking ahead of his departure from plymouth , mr fossett said : " the first task is to make it round without breaking the equipment , because only half the round the world record attempts ever finish .
" this is the only major world record in sailing that we have not got .
" it is the most important of the records and it is imperative that we give this a try . "
the american hit the headlines 18 months ago when flew a hot air balloon around the world in 16 days .

the latest results come after a woman teacher at portsdown primary school in portsmouth was diagnosed with tb on 19 january .
thirty-six of 60 year six pupils initially tested positive for the bacteria , but only three of these have gone on to develop a form of the disease .
the 11-year-olds are now being treated with antibiotics .
none of them is thought to be contagious .
chest x-rays the latest group of youngsters and adults to have positive results follows testing of the rest of the school , a health protection agency spokeswoman said .
the group will now be treated with a course of antibiotics to prevent them developing tb .
they will also undergo chest x-rays to see if they show signs of developing the disease .
the skin test which was used , only reveals if a person has been exposed to tb , and not whether they have contracted it .
the health agency spokeswoman said the risk of those who had been infected or exposed to the disease of passing it on was low because tb requires prolonged contact to be caught .
the teacher who originally contracted the disease has not yet returned to work .
about 10 % of people infected with the tb bug go on to develop the disease , which attacks the respiratory system and can be fatal if untreated .

the group of more than 30 cocklers were caught in rising tides on thursday night ; 16 are known to have survived .
officers have begun interviewing some of the survivors , who are under social services care , through interpreters .
the incident has already sparked calls for more protection of migrant workers and strict licensing of cockle pickers .
' dignity ' assistant chief constable julia hodson , of lancashire police , told a news conference on friday : " nobody deserves to die in these circumstances . "
she added : " we still do not know if the people involved are illegal workers , we still do not know if they had the required permits and if they were working for anyone else . "
she said five of the survivors , who are all in the care of social services , were unknown to immigration service and four have since claimed political asylum .
the two non-chinese survivors were described as white europeans .

morecambe 's deadly sands on saturday don pollard from the tgwu told bbc radio 4 's today programme : " the big issue is the registration of gang masters .
" at the present time nothing is required of any gang master to register and that 's what enables a lot of exploitation of workers to take place .

bishop patrick o 'donoghue said : " i do n't think that voluntary codes are sufficient here .
" i think we need the government to step in and set in legislation . "

they were pulled out of the near freezing sea during a huge rescue effort by coastguards , lifeboats and the raf overnight .
