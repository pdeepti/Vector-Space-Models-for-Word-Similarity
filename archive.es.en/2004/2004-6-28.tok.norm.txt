but a democratic iraq is still very far away , according to peter philipp . former israeli ambassador avi primor , normally exceedingly popular in germany , elicited uncomfortable silence during a panel discussion recently when he said that you wo n't soon see real democracy in iraq and that the country might be better off with a new " strong man . " the german audience was taken down a peg in its political correctness and political wishful thinking .
though many people did n't accept george w. bush 's democratic domino theory for the middle east , since the " official " end of hostilities 14 months ago , they have became increasingly more impatient and called for a rapid democratization of iraq . such demands or even just expectations were n't exactly underpinned by experience .
the view was - and is - obscured by the unspeakable torture affair and the continual picking to pieces of even the last official reason for going to war : there were neither weapons of mass destruction nor was there an alliance between saddam hussein and international terrorists . war continues to rage on the other hand , a war is raging in iraq against the occupiers , against members of the interim government , against foreigners , against everyone who is at all involved in building a new , better iraq .
that even the united states speaks of " insurgents " bolsters the feeling that this is a war against foreign occupation which , according to international law - and emotionally more than ever - is sanctioned . it 's hardly a good starting point for a transferal of power .
even if the responsibility is officially put in the interim government 's hands , it will have an extremely difficult status .
its members will continue to be endangered .
there 's no reason to assume that the attacks will stop , attacks that only have one aim : to create terror and prevent normalization .
the suicide bombers and kidnappers are n't acting in the interests of the iraqi people , which have long been concentrated on only one issue : security . in any case , it was an exaggeration to expect the country to be democratized in a matter of a few months .
after world war ii , germany needed four years until the first free elections and ten years until sovereignty .
why should the process go faster in iraq , a country which does n't even have a history of democracy but really only of totalitarian rule ? security has priority fourteen months after the official end of hostilities , the iraqi citizen 's dream of freedom and democracy has also faded and lost ground to the simple desire for safety and survival .
the interim government will - and wants to - address those concerns : the security forces should be strengthened , old officers should be rehired , and emergency ordinances should give the government a free hand to pursue terrorists and violent criminals . such a crackdown on the violent criminals is hardly a guarantee that the security situation will improve .
if it does n't , the government 's success is put into question .
how can voters and candidates be motivated if they automatically become the targets of extremists ? elections are supposed to take place in early 2005 , but , like in afghanistan , such plans can quickly fall victim to local developments .
ultimately , there is the " classic " risk : the government must take tough action against violent criminals , but in doing so it risks deepening the abyss and suspending those freedoms that democracy is supposed to bring .
thus , june 28 is surely an important date but hardly more than the prelude to a more than problematic new period in the unfortunate history of iraq . peter philipp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. restores iraqi sovereignty ahead of schedule on monday morning , paul bremer , the u.s. administrator in iraq , formally passed the reins of power to the country 's new government before leaving for the u.s. the handover took place two days earlier than planned .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 28.06.2004 viacom snaps up german mtv rival viva großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the much-loved german music broadcaster viva has been bought by viacom mtv owner viacom last week announced it would be buying a majority stake in german rival viva media .
critics fear the buyout could crush competition in the music video market . rumors of the planned bid had been circulating for months , so it was no big surprise when u.s. media giant viacom revealed thursday that a group of 14 viva shareholders , including media conglomerates time warner inc. and vivendi universal , would be selling viacom 75.8 percent of the cologne-based music tv broadcaster 's shares , an offer supported by viva 's management .
the deal , which values viva at € 308.8 million -lrb- $ 373 million -rrb- , is viacom 's largest ever acquisition outside the united states .
bill rhoedy , president of mtv networks international , said the takeover would n't be stopping there .
viacom is now expected to make a further offer for the remaining 24.2 percent . " we want to acquire 100 percent , " he stressed in frankfurt last week .
" germany is the largest cable and satellite market in the world outside the u.s. , " he added , saying , " we believe there 's enormous potential for growth in this market and viva will help consolidate us in germany and europe . "
tom freston , viacom 's co-president , echoed his statements .
" acquiring viva is a top priority to drive mtv 's expansion in germany , " he said , emphasizing that " it 's a critical tv market globally . "
former rivals the two-step deal is by no means without its critics - first and foremost because viacom 's acquisition of loss-making viva will increase mtv 's presence in germany from two to four channels and make it the dominant force within germany 's music-television landscape .
viva first hit tv screens in 1993 , charged with challenging mtv 's hegemony by promoting the german music industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heike makatsch viva 's two channels soon cornered a market share of 3.2 percent in the target audience of 14-to-29-year-olds , beaming in to some 32 million homes .
the station gave homegrown bands such as die fantastischen vier and guano apes their breakthrough and helped launch the careers of a whole host of german celebrities , including stefan raab and heike makatsch -lrb- photo -rrb- , who recently appeared in the british hit film " love actually . "
with insiders concerned that germany 's domestic music scene will now have to take a back seat , mtv insists it will still be concentrating on local culture .
" we 're not going to just replant a u.s. brand in germany , " catherine muehlemann , manager of mtv central , told reporters .
" we want to keep our focus local . "
regulatory issues nonetheless , the deal may attract regulatory scrutiny .
according to reuters , industry sources expect major music labels and german tv channels to complain to cartel officials about the deal , arguing that it gives viacom a stronghold on which videos are broadcast as well as the related advertising market .
simon guild , deputy head of mtv networks europe , told reuters that he did not expect " material regulatory issues " but admitted the deal would have to be submitted to authorities for approval .
viacom also pointed out that the deal was subject to german merger and media ownership approvals .
shares rise viva operates two music channels in germany , while its brain pool unit produces tv shows and movies such as the hugely popular comedy shows " tv total , " " ladykracher " and " anke late night . "
it owns a 51 percent stake in its viva plus tv channel , while the rest is owned by time warner inc . , which is now selling its stake to viacom . recent years saw viva hard hit by the german advertising slump , with net tv advertising sales falling 20 percent since 2000 .
in 2003 , it posted losses of € 42 million .
but once the viacom bid was clinched , viva 's shares were up 5.3 percent at € 12.64 , trading just one cent shy of the offer price , € 12.65 a share , and hitting their highest level for almost two years .
viva stock more than doubled over the past year on speculation of a takeover , and the bid represents a 21 percent premium over its average share price over the three months before the offer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.06.2004 portuguese prime minister likely to head eu commission großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : probably the next eu commission president : durao barroso the search for a new european commission president seems finally to have come to an end .
portuguese prime minister durao barroso is expected to fill a position with prerequisites few candidates can satisfy . irish prime minister bertie ahern , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said sunday he would propose portuguese prime minister jose manuel durao barroso for the eu 's top job at a special bloc summit set for tuesday evening . ahern said there was " overwhelming support " for durao barroso .
german chancellor gerhard schröder stressed sunday that durao barroso " could count on germany 's support , " and british prime minister tony blair said he was certain barroso " would do an outstanding job " and that he hoped he would " be able to accept the challenge , " the associated press reported . so far durao barroso has n't commented on taking over the reins from outgoing eu commission president romano prodi .
assuming he does so though , portugal will be faced with the challenge figuring out what to do next , since the country has no clear rules for how to replace him . shifting allegiances in his youth , as a law student under the portuguese dictatorship , durao barroso was a marxist activist , but already at age 20 , his allegiances shifted towards the political center .
durao barroso completed his law degree in lisbon and studied political science in geneva and new york .
at 29 , after returning from the united states , he was elected to parliament .
the following year he was appointed state secretary and later , at 36 , foreign minister . when his party , the conservative liberal social democrats -lrb- psd -rrb- , was voted out of office in 1995 , durao barroso bridged the time back in the united states teaching at georgetown university in washington .
but he returned to portugal and worked his way up in the psd .
his time finally came in march 2002 , when the party , with durao barroso at its helm , - barely - won early elections called after socialist prime minister antonio guterres resigned over poor local election returns . durao barroso worked closely with former spanish prime minister jose maria aznar , and hosted a meeting between aznar , u.s. president george w. bush and british prime minister blair on the azores in march 2003 that cemented the four countries ' decision to cooperate in the iraq war .
portugal still has 120 police deployed in iraq , which durao barroso recently refused to withdraw . horse-trading the " horse-trading " over who would fill the top eu post has been going on intensely since an eu leaders failed to agree on a candidate at a summit in mid-june .
france and germany insisted that the commission head be from a country that fully participates in all eu initiatives , which ruled out britain 's chris patten , since his country is not part of the single currency .
britain had already succeeded in blocking germany 's choice , belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt , partly because he was considered too critical of u.s. foreign policy . france was adamant that the eu president should speak french .

portuguese prime minister durao barroso is expected to fill a position with prerequisites few candidates can satisfy . irish prime minister bertie ahern , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said sunday he would propose portuguese prime minister jose manuel durao barroso for the eu 's top job at a special bloc summit set for tuesday evening . ahern said there was " overwhelming support " for durao barroso .
german chancellor gerhard schröder stressed sunday that durao barroso " could count on germany 's support , " and british prime minister tony blair said he was certain barroso " would do an outstanding job " and that he hoped he would " be able to accept the challenge , " the associated press reported . so far durao barroso has n't commented on taking over the reins from outgoing eu commission president romano prodi .
assuming he does so though , portugal will be faced with the challenge figuring out what to do next , since the country has no clear rules for how to replace him . shifting allegiances in his youth , as a law student under the portuguese dictatorship , durao barroso was a marxist activist , but already at age 20 , his allegiances shifted towards the political center .
durao barroso completed his law degree in lisbon and studied political science in geneva and new york .
at 29 , after returning from the united states , he was elected to parliament .
the following year he was appointed state secretary and later , at 36 , foreign minister . when his party , the conservative liberal social democrats -lrb- psd -rrb- , was voted out of office in 1995 , durao barroso bridged the time back in the united states teaching at georgetown university in washington .
but he returned to portugal and worked his way up in the psd .
his time finally came in march 2002 , when the party , with durao barroso at its helm , - barely - won early elections called after socialist prime minister antonio guterres resigned over poor local election returns . durao barroso worked closely with former spanish prime minister jose maria aznar , and hosted a meeting between aznar , u.s. president george w. bush and british prime minister blair on the azores in march 2003 that cemented the four countries ' decision to cooperate in the iraq war .
portugal still has 120 police deployed in iraq , which durao barroso recently refused to withdraw . horse-trading the " horse-trading " over who would fill the top eu post has been going on intensely since an eu leaders failed to agree on a candidate at a summit in mid-june .
france and germany insisted that the commission head be from a country that fully participates in all eu initiatives , which ruled out britain 's chris patten , since his country is not part of the single currency .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 28.06.2004 viacom snaps up german mtv rival viva großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the much-loved german music broadcaster viva has been bought by viacom mtv owner viacom last week announced it would be buying a majority stake in german rival viva media .
critics fear the buyout could crush competition in the music video market . rumors of the planned bid had been circulating for months , so it was no big surprise when u.s. media giant viacom revealed thursday that a group of 14 viva shareholders , including media conglomerates time warner inc. and vivendi universal , would be selling viacom 75.8 percent of the cologne-based music tv broadcaster 's shares , an offer supported by viva 's management .
the deal , which values viva at € 308.8 million -lrb- $ 373 million -rrb- , is viacom 's largest ever acquisition outside the united states .
bill rhoedy , president of mtv networks international , said the takeover would n't be stopping there .
viacom is now expected to make a further offer for the remaining 24.2 percent . " we want to acquire 100 percent , " he stressed in frankfurt last week .
" germany is the largest cable and satellite market in the world outside the u.s. , " he added , saying , " we believe there 's enormous potential for growth in this market and viva will help consolidate us in germany and europe . "
tom freston , viacom 's co-president , echoed his statements .
" acquiring viva is a top priority to drive mtv 's expansion in germany , " he said , emphasizing that " it 's a critical tv market globally . "
former rivals the two-step deal is by no means without its critics - first and foremost because viacom 's acquisition of loss-making viva will increase mtv 's presence in germany from two to four channels and make it the dominant force within germany 's music-television landscape .
viva first hit tv screens in 1993 , charged with challenging mtv 's hegemony by promoting the german music industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heike makatsch viva 's two channels soon cornered a market share of 3.2 percent in the target audience of 14-to-29-year-olds , beaming in to some 32 million homes .
the station gave homegrown bands such as die fantastischen vier and guano apes their breakthrough and helped launch the careers of a whole host of german celebrities , including stefan raab and heike makatsch -lrb- photo -rrb- , who recently appeared in the british hit film " love actually . "
with insiders concerned that germany 's domestic music scene will now have to take a back seat , mtv insists it will still be concentrating on local culture .
" we 're not going to just replant a u.s. brand in germany , " catherine muehlemann , manager of mtv central , told reporters .
" we want to keep our focus local . "
regulatory issues nonetheless , the deal may attract regulatory scrutiny .
according to reuters , industry sources expect major music labels and german tv channels to complain to cartel officials about the deal , arguing that it gives viacom a stronghold on which videos are broadcast as well as the related advertising market .
simon guild , deputy head of mtv networks europe , told reuters that he did not expect " material regulatory issues " but admitted the deal would have to be submitted to authorities for approval .
viacom also pointed out that the deal was subject to german merger and media ownership approvals .
shares rise viva operates two music channels in germany , while its brain pool unit produces tv shows and movies such as the hugely popular comedy shows " tv total , " " ladykracher " and " anke late night . "
it owns a 51 percent stake in its viva plus tv channel , while the rest is owned by time warner inc . , which is now selling its stake to viacom . recent years saw viva hard hit by the german advertising slump , with net tv advertising sales falling 20 percent since 2000 .
in 2003 , it posted losses of € 42 million .
but once the viacom bid was clinched , viva 's shares were up 5.3 percent at € 12.64 , trading just one cent shy of the offer price , € 12.65 a share , and hitting their highest level for almost two years .
viva stock more than doubled over the past year on speculation of a takeover , and the bid represents a 21 percent premium over its average share price over the three months before the offer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 28.06.2004 powerful union accuses schröder of ' failure ' großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellor is losing the support of the world 's largest services union , ver.di.
as once strong relations between germany 's unions and the ruling social democrats plunge to new lows , one of the labor movement 's most-powerful leaders threatens to withdraw his support for chancellor gerhard schröder . frank bsirske , head of the german public sector union ver.di , infuriated the coalition government of social democrats and greens over the weekend by telling the newspaper welt am sonntag that chancellor gerhard schröder 's social and economic reform policy has been a huge failure .
" measured against his claim that he would create jobs , reduce joblessness and pep up the economy , gerhard schröder has been a failure , " bsirske told the paper .
bsirske acknowledged that cuts to the country 's generous social welfare system were needed to keep it afloat , while at the same time making the allegation that the government 's policy had by no means led to better employment opportunities in the country .
economic growth rates remain at well below 1 percent this year after three years of total stagnation .
move could hurt social democrats for bsirske 's part , the move was calculated .
himself a member of the green party , he knows his criticism will primarily hurt the social democrats .

as once strong relations between germany 's unions and the ruling social democrats plunge to new lows , one of the labor movement 's most-powerful leaders threatens to withdraw his support for chancellor gerhard schröder . frank bsirske , head of the german public sector union ver.di , infuriated the coalition government of social democrats and greens over the weekend by telling the newspaper welt am sonntag that chancellor gerhard schröder 's social and economic reform policy has been a huge failure .
" measured against his claim that he would create jobs , reduce joblessness and pep up the economy , gerhard schröder has been a failure , " bsirske told the paper .
bsirske acknowledged that cuts to the country 's generous social welfare system were needed to keep it afloat , while at the same time making the allegation that the government 's policy had by no means led to better employment opportunities in the country .
economic growth rates remain at well below 1 percent this year after three years of total stagnation .
move could hurt social democrats for bsirske 's part , the move was calculated .
himself a member of the green party , he knows his criticism will primarily hurt the social democrats .
the spd 's popularity has fallen to an unparalleled low in recent months , while the greens have recorded major gains in regional elections despite the fact that , as the spd 's junior coalition partner , they are also responsible for germany 's current social and economic policies .
bsirske , as well as other union leaders , are hoping to strengthen the rebellious left-wingers within the spd - many of whom harbor nagging doubts about the political reorientation of their party , which has traditionally represented the interests of the underprivileged in society .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.06.2004 serbs face clear choice in presidential polls großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a win for boris tadic will improve serbia 's ties with the west .
serbian voters go to the polls sunday in crucial presidential elections that pit pro-eu reformer boris tadic against ultranationalist tomislav nikolic .
the result will largely determine the country 's political direction . on paper , serbia 's five-year presidency is largely ceremonial , but former president milosevic proved how effectively its few powers could be exploited . sunday 's vote could thus determine whether serbia moves closer to the eu and nato and improves relations with the west or lapses back into the chauvinism and isolation reminiscent of milosevic 's former regime . opinion polls this week gave boris tadic , a pro-europe liberal , a lead of up to 54 percent against 46 percent for tomislav nikolic , an ardent nationalist whose radical party propped up milosevic 's regime and supported his military adventures in the 1990s . but despite the lead enjoyed by tadic , analysts say that a turnout of under 40 percent could still hand the presidency to nikolic , who commands greater loyalty among his supporters . choosing between eu and belarus european union officials have warned that a victory for nikolic would diplomatically isolate serbia , whereas a win for tadic would ease relations . chris patten , the european commissioner for external affairs , said this week that serbs had a choice " between joining the european family or belarus . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tomislav nikolic , frontrunner of the ultranationalist serbian radical party .
nikolic -lrb- photo -rrb- is against serbia 's entry to the eu and any victory for him could leave serbia isolated on the international stage and scare off investors from the west . " we need the east .
russia supplies us with resources and power .
why should n't we exploit that ?
the west should help us to manufacture goods and we should sell them in the east , " nikolic said recently . championing himself as the candidate for the working class , nikolic 's strident rhetoric and calls to limit foreign trade appeal to the unemployed , which make up almost 30 percent of the country 's 7.5 million inhabitants . " serbia has opened its doors to the west , but the west has n't improved your lives .
it has n't made the factories churn out more or brought better harvests , " nikolic said . " eu will improve our lives " tadic , on the other hand , has made no bones about the fact that he 'd like to see serbia in the eu and even the nato one day .
an admirer of assassinated prime minister zoran djindjic , tadic took over the democratic party in february after djindjic 's death .
he has vowed to continue with the reform agenda started by djindjic . tadic is considered popular with business leaders , artists and women alike and has continued the policies of his pro-western predecessor , calling for open borders and greater tolerance . " we must become a member of the european union .
we must continue with these reforms , so we can join the bloc .
that would improve our lives .
without the eu , we can not overcome our problems , " tadic said . the vote could n't be further polarized with the two candidates unequivocal about where they 'd like to take serbia in the future .
opinion polls , however , show serbs to be divided , with many wanting to improve relations with the west but hostile to cooperating further with the international war crimes tribunal , which is trying a host of serbian leaders including milosevic for war crimes at the hague . tough decisions over kosovo the country also faces tough decisions over kosovo , the united nations-administered province , which belgrade insists remain part of serbia even though the majority ethnic albanian population wants independence . nikolic has called for sending security forces back to the troubled province of kosovo , inhabited mainly by ethnic albanians .
he clings to the dream of a greater serbia - saying it would be good for his people if all serbs were united . tadic , meanwhile , advocates a political solution to the future of kosovo . reform versus stagnation reporters at belgrade 's independent television station b-92 expect the election to be a watershed event for serbia .
they say if tadic wins , serbia will open up .
but if nikolic wins , serbia will turn inward , stop delivering suspected war criminals to the international criminal court in the hague , and become more isolated .
the reform process would grind to a halt . it 's a scenario that boris tadic has already laid out before the serbs .

serbian voters go to the polls sunday in crucial presidential elections that pit pro-eu reformer boris tadic against ultranationalist tomislav nikolic .
the result will largely determine the country 's political direction . on paper , serbia 's five-year presidency is largely ceremonial , but former president milosevic proved how effectively its few powers could be exploited . sunday 's vote could thus determine whether serbia moves closer to the eu and nato and improves relations with the west or lapses back into the chauvinism and isolation reminiscent of milosevic 's former regime . opinion polls this week gave boris tadic , a pro-europe liberal , a lead of up to 54 percent against 46 percent for tomislav nikolic , an ardent nationalist whose radical party propped up milosevic 's regime and supported his military adventures in the 1990s . but despite the lead enjoyed by tadic , analysts say that a turnout of under 40 percent could still hand the presidency to nikolic , who commands greater loyalty among his supporters . choosing between eu and belarus european union officials have warned that a victory for nikolic would diplomatically isolate serbia , whereas a win for tadic would ease relations . chris patten , the european commissioner for external affairs , said this week that serbs had a choice " between joining the european family or belarus . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tomislav nikolic , frontrunner of the ultranationalist serbian radical party .
nikolic -lrb- photo -rrb- is against serbia 's entry to the eu and any victory for him could leave serbia isolated on the international stage and scare off investors from the west . " we need the east .
russia supplies us with resources and power .
why should n't we exploit that ?
the west should help us to manufacture goods and we should sell them in the east , " nikolic said recently . championing himself as the candidate for the working class , nikolic 's strident rhetoric and calls to limit foreign trade appeal to the unemployed , which make up almost 30 percent of the country 's 7.5 million inhabitants . " serbia has opened its doors to the west , but the west has n't improved your lives .
it has n't made the factories churn out more or brought better harvests , " nikolic said . " eu will improve our lives " tadic , on the other hand , has made no bones about the fact that he 'd like to see serbia in the eu and even the nato one day .
an admirer of assassinated prime minister zoran djindjic , tadic took over the democratic party in february after djindjic 's death .
he has vowed to continue with the reform agenda started by djindjic . tadic is considered popular with business leaders , artists and women alike and has continued the policies of his pro-western predecessor , calling for open borders and greater tolerance . " we must become a member of the european union .
we must continue with these reforms , so we can join the bloc .
that would improve our lives .
without the eu , we can not overcome our problems , " tadic said . the vote could n't be further polarized with the two candidates unequivocal about where they 'd like to take serbia in the future .
opinion polls , however , show serbs to be divided , with many wanting to improve relations with the west but hostile to cooperating further with the international war crimes tribunal , which is trying a host of serbian leaders including milosevic for war crimes at the hague . tough decisions over kosovo the country also faces tough decisions over kosovo , the united nations-administered province , which belgrade insists remain part of serbia even though the majority ethnic albanian population wants independence . nikolic has called for sending security forces back to the troubled province of kosovo , inhabited mainly by ethnic albanians .
he clings to the dream of a greater serbia - saying it would be good for his people if all serbs were united . tadic , meanwhile , advocates a political solution to the future of kosovo . reform versus stagnation reporters at belgrade 's independent television station b-92 expect the election to be a watershed event for serbia .
they say if tadic wins , serbia will open up .
but if nikolic wins , serbia will turn inward , stop delivering suspected war criminals to the international criminal court in the hague , and become more isolated .
the reform process would grind to a halt . it 's a scenario that boris tadic has already laid out before the serbs .

they will also discuss training of security forces in iraq .
but germany has made it clear its non-engagement pledge remains . on sunday , the 26 nato heads of state and government attended a formal dinner in an ottoman-era palace on the banks of the bosporus to thrash out an agreement on a nato role in training military and police forces for the future sovereign iraqi government . differences however remained over when , and especially where , the training is to take place .
the dispute has given german chancellor gerhard schröder another opportunity to stress that no german soldier will set a foot on iraqi soil . shortly before official talks began in istanbul on monday , the german chancellor expressed his support for attempts to bring stability and democracy to iraq .
speaking to journalists in berlin before boarding a plan to istanbul on sunday , gerhard schröder said the transatlantic row over the iraq war belonged in the history books and that all nato states were interested in improving security in iraq .
at the same time , however , he expressed his determination not to budge on his refusal to send troops to the war-torn country . training must take place in germany - chancellor " we are of course willing to participate in the training of iraqi troops if the iraqi government wants that , " he says .
" but this has to take place in training centers in germany because we stick to our position that no german troops will be sent to iraq .
in istanbul i will once again make that clear . " sixteen nato members have forces in iraq , but key members , including germany and france , have so far resisted pressure from washington to participate .
they have also thwarted the bush administration ’ s original hope of a nato-led force to take command of a peacekeeping force south of baghdad .
schröder ’ s resistance against a german troop deployment is fully backed by his junior coalition partner in the government – the greens .
greens party leader angelika beer believes that nato members won ’ t agree to the alliance 's direct participation on the ground in iraq . greens doubt european support for nato role " i expect there will be an agreement on military training but outside iraq , " she said . " there won ’ t be support for a nato role inside the country so that the controversy may linger on .
the european member states will make it clear again that humanitarian and training assistance is all they are willing to provide .
after all the conflicts in the entire middle east are still waiting for an answer from nato . " the wrangling over military and police training echoes nato divisions before the iraq war when france and germany blocked military assistance of the alliance to turkey , iraq ’ s neighbor .
and senior leaders of iraq ’ s interim government have expressed their dissatisfaction about the rift . hoshyar zebari , foreign minister in the iraqi government which formally assumes sovereignty on wednesday , insisted that any training must take place inside the country to be adaptable to iraqi conditions . uwe hessler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush courts turkey amid protests and violence u.s. president bush renewed calls for turkey 's eu entry as he sought to boost ties with the country in ankara on the eve of a nato summit .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.06.2004 portuguese prime minister likely to head eu commission großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : probably the next eu commission president : durao barroso the search for a new european commission president seems finally to have come to an end .
portuguese prime minister durao barroso is expected to fill a position with prerequisites few candidates can satisfy . irish prime minister bertie ahern , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said sunday he would propose portuguese prime minister jose manuel durao barroso for the eu 's top job at a special bloc summit set for tuesday evening . ahern said there was " overwhelming support " for durao barroso .
german chancellor gerhard schröder stressed sunday that durao barroso " could count on germany 's support , " and british prime minister tony blair said he was certain barroso " would do an outstanding job " and that he hoped he would " be able to accept the challenge , " the associated press reported . so far durao barroso has n't commented on taking over the reins from outgoing eu commission president romano prodi .
assuming he does so though , portugal will be faced with the challenge figuring out what to do next , since the country has no clear rules for how to replace him . shifting allegiances in his youth , as a law student under the portuguese dictatorship , durao barroso was a marxist activist , but already at age 20 , his allegiances shifted towards the political center .
durao barroso completed his law degree in lisbon and studied political science in geneva and new york .
at 29 , after returning from the united states , he was elected to parliament .
the following year he was appointed state secretary and later , at 36 , foreign minister . when his party , the conservative liberal social democrats -lrb- psd -rrb- , was voted out of office in 1995 , durao barroso bridged the time back in the united states teaching at georgetown university in washington .
but he returned to portugal and worked his way up in the psd .
his time finally came in march 2002 , when the party , with durao barroso at its helm , - barely - won early elections called after socialist prime minister antonio guterres resigned over poor local election returns . durao barroso worked closely with former spanish prime minister jose maria aznar , and hosted a meeting between aznar , u.s. president george w. bush and british prime minister blair on the azores in march 2003 that cemented the four countries ' decision to cooperate in the iraq war .
portugal still has 120 police deployed in iraq , which durao barroso recently refused to withdraw . horse-trading the " horse-trading " over who would fill the top eu post has been going on intensely since an eu leaders failed to agree on a candidate at a summit in mid-june .
france and germany insisted that the commission head be from a country that fully participates in all eu initiatives , which ruled out britain 's chris patten , since his country is not part of the single currency .
britain had already succeeded in blocking germany 's choice , belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt , partly because he was considered too critical of u.s. foreign policy . france was adamant that the eu president should speak french .
the conservative-liberal european people 's party , the largest political group in the european parliament , demanded a candidate from the center-right .
others pressed for a politician experienced in the highest government levels .
still others asserted that the right person for the job should be from a smaller eu country . in the end , the 48-year-old portuguese prime minister fits all the requirements .
and besides french , he also speaks english and spanish .
unless durao barroso 's nomination is accepted by all 25 eu heads of state on tuesday , the european parliament will have to vote on whether to appoint him , which could happen as early as mid-july .
he would almost certainly be approved by the conservative-liberal dominated parliament .
he would take office in november . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de portugal hopes for euro economic bonus when portugal hosts this year 's european championship this summer , thousands of visiting soccer fans will spend plenty of euros .

as once strong relations between germany 's unions and the ruling social democrats plunge to new lows , one of the labor movement 's most-powerful leaders threatens to withdraw his support for chancellor gerhard schröder . frank bsirske , head of the german public sector union ver.di , infuriated the coalition government of social democrats and greens over the weekend by telling the newspaper welt am sonntag that chancellor gerhard schröder 's social and economic reform policy has been a huge failure .
" measured against his claim that he would create jobs , reduce joblessness and pep up the economy , gerhard schröder has been a failure , " bsirske told the paper .
bsirske acknowledged that cuts to the country 's generous social welfare system were needed to keep it afloat , while at the same time making the allegation that the government 's policy had by no means led to better employment opportunities in the country .
economic growth rates remain at well below 1 percent this year after three years of total stagnation .
move could hurt social democrats for bsirske 's part , the move was calculated .
himself a member of the green party , he knows his criticism will primarily hurt the social democrats .
the spd 's popularity has fallen to an unparalleled low in recent months , while the greens have recorded major gains in regional elections despite the fact that , as the spd 's junior coalition partner , they are also responsible for germany 's current social and economic policies .
bsirske , as well as other union leaders , are hoping to strengthen the rebellious left-wingers within the spd - many of whom harbor nagging doubts about the political reorientation of their party , which has traditionally represented the interests of the underprivileged in society .
schröder : i 'm not budging for his part , schröder told the newsweekly der spiegel that the " unions need to abandon their abstract considerations instead ask concrete questions in their companies . "
schröder said the unions should focus on what 's really best for their workers .
the chancellor also categorically refused to make any additional change to his labor reform laws .
" i 'm not going to do any more snipping , " he said , referring to his agenda 2010 reform plan .
green party chief reinhard bütikofer did what was expected of him and dismissed bsirske ’ s criticism as " unfounded " and " unconstructive . "
and deputy spd chief kurt beck brushed off bsirske ’ s demand for a change of course in the reform process as " nonsense . "
" a change of course – what ’ s that supposed to mean ? "
beck asked .
" weren ’ t we all agreed that considering our own demographic problems and global developments our social system has to be changed in order to survive at all ?
and weren ’ t we all agreed that the necessary reforms could not be carried out without sacrifices ?
so i don ’ t really understand why some are now calling on the government to revise its policy .
we don ’ t have the right to change our course , because we were elected to do the things that are necessary for germany to become competitive again . "
row to enter new round the row between the government and the trade unions is expected to enter yet another round on wednesday , when an inter-parliamentary arbitration committee is scheduled to agree on the details of combining germany 's welfare and unemployment benefits starting next year .
the move is expected to create even greater hardships for the economically disadvantaged .
" it looks as if there is no capacity and no mechanisms in place to make job placement procedures more efficient as of jan .
1 of next year , " said hermann-joseph ahrentz , the social affairs spokesman for the conservative opposition christian democratic union .
" but since long-term unemployed people will get fewer benefits under the new plan , they should at least have the opportunity to find work more easily .
but i can ’ t see this happening .
this is why the government ’ s policy can only be described as a rush job and a patchwork , and as socially unjust , since it hits the poor and underprivileged once again . "
a conundrum for the spd 's base an editorial in the monday issue of the financial times deutschland newspaper concluded that the spat between unions and the spd is making it impossible for core social democrat voters to maintain their loyalty to both their party and the trade unions .
both are complaining about dwindling membership .
bsirske and his colleagues are well aware that with a conservative government at the helm in 2006 the unions are even less likely to strike a deal for softer reforms .
but the unions may have another strategy altogether .
as bsirske noted on sunday : the unions could much more easily fight a conservative chancellor than a social democrat who claims to be on the unions ' side . hardy graupner -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

nikolic got 45.1 percent of the vote according to independent monitors from belgrade 's cesid group . more than 6.5 million voters were eligible to cast ballots .
analysts said turnout was 48.5 percent . the presidential election was widely seen as crucial to determine whether serbia would move towards the eu and adopt western-style reforms or whether it would lapse into the nationalist isolation and diplomatic wilderness of the autocratic milosevic regime . three previous attempts to elect a president since 2002 failed because too few voters showed up at the polls .
this vote was certain to produce a president regardless of the turnout , after parliament earlier this year scrapped a 50 percent turnout requirement . " we must join the eu " tadic , who is considered popular with artists and business leaders alike , has received support from prime minister vojislav kostunica , ethnic minorities and dozens of local celebrities . the sarajevo-born psychologist and belgrade college professor had made closer ties with the west a central plank of his campaign .
" we must become a member of the european union .
we must continue with these reforms , so we can join the bloc .
that would improve our lives .
without the eu , we can not overcome our problems , " tadic said . tadic took over the leadership of the democratic party after the march 2003 assassination of zoran djindjic , the democrats ' leader and serbia 's first noncommunist prime minister since world war ii . he has vowed to continue with the reform agenda of his predecessor .

nikolic got 45.1 percent of the vote according to independent monitors from belgrade 's cesid group . more than 6.5 million voters were eligible to cast ballots .
analysts said turnout was 48.5 percent . the presidential election was widely seen as crucial to determine whether serbia would move towards the eu and adopt western-style reforms or whether it would lapse into the nationalist isolation and diplomatic wilderness of the autocratic milosevic regime . three previous attempts to elect a president since 2002 failed because too few voters showed up at the polls .
this vote was certain to produce a president regardless of the turnout , after parliament earlier this year scrapped a 50 percent turnout requirement . " we must join the eu " tadic , who is considered popular with artists and business leaders alike , has received support from prime minister vojislav kostunica , ethnic minorities and dozens of local celebrities . the sarajevo-born psychologist and belgrade college professor had made closer ties with the west a central plank of his campaign .
" we must become a member of the european union .
we must continue with these reforms , so we can join the bloc .

analysts said turnout was 48.5 percent . the presidential election was widely seen as crucial to determine whether serbia would move towards the eu and adopt western-style reforms or whether it would lapse into the nationalist isolation and diplomatic wilderness of the autocratic milosevic regime . three previous attempts to elect a president since 2002 failed because too few voters showed up at the polls .
this vote was certain to produce a president regardless of the turnout , after parliament earlier this year scrapped a 50 percent turnout requirement . " we must join the eu " tadic , who is considered popular with artists and business leaders alike , has received support from prime minister vojislav kostunica , ethnic minorities and dozens of local celebrities . the sarajevo-born psychologist and belgrade college professor had made closer ties with the west a central plank of his campaign .
" we must become a member of the european union .
we must continue with these reforms , so we can join the bloc .
that would improve our lives .
without the eu , we can not overcome our problems , " tadic said . tadic took over the leadership of the democratic party after the march 2003 assassination of zoran djindjic , the democrats ' leader and serbia 's first noncommunist prime minister since world war ii . he has vowed to continue with the reform agenda of his predecessor .
tadic is also an ardent supporter of extraditing serb war crimes suspects to the u.n. war crimes tribunal in the hague , where milosevic and others are standing trial on charges related to their roles in the balkan wars in the 1990s . " the west has n't improved our life " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tomislav nikolic of the ultranationalist serbian radical party .
tadic 's challenger , 52-year-old nikolic -lrb- photo -rrb- is against serbia 's entry to the eu and it was feared that any victory for him could leave serbia isolated on the international stage and scare off investors from the west . after casting his ballot in belgrade earlier in the day , nikolic predicted a tight race but said his " victory would return pride and dignity to serbia . " championing himself as the candidate for the working class , nikolic 's strident rhetoric and calls to limit foreign trade appeal to the unemployed , which make up almost 30 percent of the country 's 7.5 million inhabitants . " serbia has opened its doors to the west , but the west has n't improved your lives .
it has n't made the factories churn out more or brought better harvests , " nikolic said . nikolic has also strongly opposed western demands that belgrade extradite serbs to the hague , and had said that if he won the presidency , he would dedicate his victory to milosevic . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de serbs face clear choice in presidential polls serbian voters go to the polls sunday in crucial presidential elections that pit pro-eu reformer boris tadic against ultranationalist tomislav nikolic .

as once strong relations between germany 's unions and the ruling social democrats plunge to new lows , one of the labor movement 's most-powerful leaders threatens to withdraw his support for chancellor gerhard schröder . frank bsirske , head of the german public sector union ver.di , infuriated the coalition government of social democrats and greens over the weekend by telling the newspaper welt am sonntag that chancellor gerhard schröder 's social and economic reform policy has been a huge failure .
" measured against his claim that he would create jobs , reduce joblessness and pep up the economy , gerhard schröder has been a failure , " bsirske told the paper .
bsirske acknowledged that cuts to the country 's generous social welfare system were needed to keep it afloat , while at the same time making the allegation that the government 's policy had by no means led to better employment opportunities in the country .
economic growth rates remain at well below 1 percent this year after three years of total stagnation .
move could hurt social democrats for bsirske 's part , the move was calculated .
himself a member of the green party , he knows his criticism will primarily hurt the social democrats .
the spd 's popularity has fallen to an unparalleled low in recent months , while the greens have recorded major gains in regional elections despite the fact that , as the spd 's junior coalition partner , they are also responsible for germany 's current social and economic policies .
bsirske , as well as other union leaders , are hoping to strengthen the rebellious left-wingers within the spd - many of whom harbor nagging doubts about the political reorientation of their party , which has traditionally represented the interests of the underprivileged in society .
schröder : i 'm not budging for his part , schröder told the newsweekly der spiegel that the " unions need to abandon their abstract considerations instead ask concrete questions in their companies . "
schröder said the unions should focus on what 's really best for their workers .
the chancellor also categorically refused to make any additional change to his labor reform laws .
" i 'm not going to do any more snipping , " he said , referring to his agenda 2010 reform plan .
green party chief reinhard bütikofer did what was expected of him and dismissed bsirske ’ s criticism as " unfounded " and " unconstructive . "
and deputy spd chief kurt beck brushed off bsirske ’ s demand for a change of course in the reform process as " nonsense . "
" a change of course – what ’ s that supposed to mean ? "
beck asked .
" weren ’ t we all agreed that considering our own demographic problems and global developments our social system has to be changed in order to survive at all ?
and weren ’ t we all agreed that the necessary reforms could not be carried out without sacrifices ?
so i don ’ t really understand why some are now calling on the government to revise its policy .
we don ’ t have the right to change our course , because we were elected to do the things that are necessary for germany to become competitive again . "
row to enter new round the row between the government and the trade unions is expected to enter yet another round on wednesday , when an inter-parliamentary arbitration committee is scheduled to agree on the details of combining germany 's welfare and unemployment benefits starting next year .
the move is expected to create even greater hardships for the economically disadvantaged .
" it looks as if there is no capacity and no mechanisms in place to make job placement procedures more efficient as of jan .
1 of next year , " said hermann-joseph ahrentz , the social affairs spokesman for the conservative opposition christian democratic union .
" but since long-term unemployed people will get fewer benefits under the new plan , they should at least have the opportunity to find work more easily .
but i can ’ t see this happening .
this is why the government ’ s policy can only be described as a rush job and a patchwork , and as socially unjust , since it hits the poor and underprivileged once again . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 28.06.2004 schröder to reiterate no troop pledge at nato iraq summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will train new recruits but not on iraqi soil , says schröder nato leaders are in istanbul for a summit aimed at repairing relations torn by the iraq war .
they will also discuss training of security forces in iraq .
but germany has made it clear its non-engagement pledge remains . on sunday , the 26 nato heads of state and government attended a formal dinner in an ottoman-era palace on the banks of the bosporus to thrash out an agreement on a nato role in training military and police forces for the future sovereign iraqi government . differences however remained over when , and especially where , the training is to take place .
the dispute has given german chancellor gerhard schröder another opportunity to stress that no german soldier will set a foot on iraqi soil . shortly before official talks began in istanbul on monday , the german chancellor expressed his support for attempts to bring stability and democracy to iraq .
speaking to journalists in berlin before boarding a plan to istanbul on sunday , gerhard schröder said the transatlantic row over the iraq war belonged in the history books and that all nato states were interested in improving security in iraq .
at the same time , however , he expressed his determination not to budge on his refusal to send troops to the war-torn country . training must take place in germany - chancellor " we are of course willing to participate in the training of iraqi troops if the iraqi government wants that , " he says .
" but this has to take place in training centers in germany because we stick to our position that no german troops will be sent to iraq .
in istanbul i will once again make that clear . " sixteen nato members have forces in iraq , but key members , including germany and france , have so far resisted pressure from washington to participate .
they have also thwarted the bush administration ’ s original hope of a nato-led force to take command of a peacekeeping force south of baghdad .
schröder ’ s resistance against a german troop deployment is fully backed by his junior coalition partner in the government – the greens .
greens party leader angelika beer believes that nato members won ’ t agree to the alliance 's direct participation on the ground in iraq . greens doubt european support for nato role " i expect there will be an agreement on military training but outside iraq , " she said . " there won ’ t be support for a nato role inside the country so that the controversy may linger on .
the european member states will make it clear again that humanitarian and training assistance is all they are willing to provide .
after all the conflicts in the entire middle east are still waiting for an answer from nato . " the wrangling over military and police training echoes nato divisions before the iraq war when france and germany blocked military assistance of the alliance to turkey , iraq ’ s neighbor .
and senior leaders of iraq ’ s interim government have expressed their dissatisfaction about the rift . hoshyar zebari , foreign minister in the iraqi government which formally assumes sovereignty on wednesday , insisted that any training must take place inside the country to be adaptable to iraqi conditions . uwe hessler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush courts turkey amid protests and violence u.s. president bush renewed calls for turkey 's eu entry as he sought to boost ties with the country in ankara on the eve of a nato summit .

but a democratic iraq is still very far away , according to peter philipp . former israeli ambassador avi primor , normally exceedingly popular in germany , elicited uncomfortable silence during a panel discussion recently when he said that you wo n't soon see real democracy in iraq and that the country might be better off with a new " strong man . " the german audience was taken down a peg in its political correctness and political wishful thinking .
though many people did n't accept george w. bush 's democratic domino theory for the middle east , since the " official " end of hostilities 14 months ago , they have became increasingly more impatient and called for a rapid democratization of iraq . such demands or even just expectations were n't exactly underpinned by experience .
the view was - and is - obscured by the unspeakable torture affair and the continual picking to pieces of even the last official reason for going to war : there were neither weapons of mass destruction nor was there an alliance between saddam hussein and international terrorists . war continues to rage on the other hand , a war is raging in iraq against the occupiers , against members of the interim government , against foreigners , against everyone who is at all involved in building a new , better iraq .
that even the united states speaks of " insurgents " bolsters the feeling that this is a war against foreign occupation which , according to international law - and emotionally more than ever - is sanctioned . it 's hardly a good starting point for a transferal of power .
even if the responsibility is officially put in the interim government 's hands , it will have an extremely difficult status .
its members will continue to be endangered .
there 's no reason to assume that the attacks will stop , attacks that only have one aim : to create terror and prevent normalization .
the suicide bombers and kidnappers are n't acting in the interests of the iraqi people , which have long been concentrated on only one issue : security . in any case , it was an exaggeration to expect the country to be democratized in a matter of a few months .
after world war ii , germany needed four years until the first free elections and ten years until sovereignty .
why should the process go faster in iraq , a country which does n't even have a history of democracy but really only of totalitarian rule ? security has priority fourteen months after the official end of hostilities , the iraqi citizen 's dream of freedom and democracy has also faded and lost ground to the simple desire for safety and survival .
the interim government will - and wants to - address those concerns : the security forces should be strengthened , old officers should be rehired , and emergency ordinances should give the government a free hand to pursue terrorists and violent criminals . such a crackdown on the violent criminals is hardly a guarantee that the security situation will improve .
if it does n't , the government 's success is put into question .
how can voters and candidates be motivated if they automatically become the targets of extremists ? elections are supposed to take place in early 2005 , but , like in afghanistan , such plans can quickly fall victim to local developments .
ultimately , there is the " classic " risk : the government must take tough action against violent criminals , but in doing so it risks deepening the abyss and suspending those freedoms that democracy is supposed to bring .
thus , june 28 is surely an important date but hardly more than the prelude to a more than problematic new period in the unfortunate history of iraq . peter philipp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. restores iraqi sovereignty ahead of schedule on monday morning , paul bremer , the u.s. administrator in iraq , formally passed the reins of power to the country 's new government before leaving for the u.s. the handover took place two days earlier than planned .

the result will largely determine the country 's political direction . on paper , serbia 's five-year presidency is largely ceremonial , but former president milosevic proved how effectively its few powers could be exploited . sunday 's vote could thus determine whether serbia moves closer to the eu and nato and improves relations with the west or lapses back into the chauvinism and isolation reminiscent of milosevic 's former regime . opinion polls this week gave boris tadic , a pro-europe liberal , a lead of up to 54 percent against 46 percent for tomislav nikolic , an ardent nationalist whose radical party propped up milosevic 's regime and supported his military adventures in the 1990s . but despite the lead enjoyed by tadic , analysts say that a turnout of under 40 percent could still hand the presidency to nikolic , who commands greater loyalty among his supporters . choosing between eu and belarus european union officials have warned that a victory for nikolic would diplomatically isolate serbia , whereas a win for tadic would ease relations . chris patten , the european commissioner for external affairs , said this week that serbs had a choice " between joining the european family or belarus . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tomislav nikolic , frontrunner of the ultranationalist serbian radical party .
nikolic -lrb- photo -rrb- is against serbia 's entry to the eu and any victory for him could leave serbia isolated on the international stage and scare off investors from the west . " we need the east .
russia supplies us with resources and power .
why should n't we exploit that ?
the west should help us to manufacture goods and we should sell them in the east , " nikolic said recently . championing himself as the candidate for the working class , nikolic 's strident rhetoric and calls to limit foreign trade appeal to the unemployed , which make up almost 30 percent of the country 's 7.5 million inhabitants . " serbia has opened its doors to the west , but the west has n't improved your lives .
it has n't made the factories churn out more or brought better harvests , " nikolic said . " eu will improve our lives " tadic , on the other hand , has made no bones about the fact that he 'd like to see serbia in the eu and even the nato one day .
an admirer of assassinated prime minister zoran djindjic , tadic took over the democratic party in february after djindjic 's death .
he has vowed to continue with the reform agenda started by djindjic . tadic is considered popular with business leaders , artists and women alike and has continued the policies of his pro-western predecessor , calling for open borders and greater tolerance . " we must become a member of the european union .
we must continue with these reforms , so we can join the bloc .
that would improve our lives .
without the eu , we can not overcome our problems , " tadic said . the vote could n't be further polarized with the two candidates unequivocal about where they 'd like to take serbia in the future .
opinion polls , however , show serbs to be divided , with many wanting to improve relations with the west but hostile to cooperating further with the international war crimes tribunal , which is trying a host of serbian leaders including milosevic for war crimes at the hague . tough decisions over kosovo the country also faces tough decisions over kosovo , the united nations-administered province , which belgrade insists remain part of serbia even though the majority ethnic albanian population wants independence . nikolic has called for sending security forces back to the troubled province of kosovo , inhabited mainly by ethnic albanians .
he clings to the dream of a greater serbia - saying it would be good for his people if all serbs were united . tadic , meanwhile , advocates a political solution to the future of kosovo . reform versus stagnation reporters at belgrade 's independent television station b-92 expect the election to be a watershed event for serbia .
they say if tadic wins , serbia will open up .
but if nikolic wins , serbia will turn inward , stop delivering suspected war criminals to the international criminal court in the hague , and become more isolated .
the reform process would grind to a halt . it 's a scenario that boris tadic has already laid out before the serbs .

but a democratic iraq is still very far away , according to peter philipp . former israeli ambassador avi primor , normally exceedingly popular in germany , elicited uncomfortable silence during a panel discussion recently when he said that you wo n't soon see real democracy in iraq and that the country might be better off with a new " strong man . " the german audience was taken down a peg in its political correctness and political wishful thinking .
though many people did n't accept george w. bush 's democratic domino theory for the middle east , since the " official " end of hostilities 14 months ago , they have became increasingly more impatient and called for a rapid democratization of iraq . such demands or even just expectations were n't exactly underpinned by experience .
the view was - and is - obscured by the unspeakable torture affair and the continual picking to pieces of even the last official reason for going to war : there were neither weapons of mass destruction nor was there an alliance between saddam hussein and international terrorists . war continues to rage on the other hand , a war is raging in iraq against the occupiers , against members of the interim government , against foreigners , against everyone who is at all involved in building a new , better iraq .
that even the united states speaks of " insurgents " bolsters the feeling that this is a war against foreign occupation which , according to international law - and emotionally more than ever - is sanctioned . it 's hardly a good starting point for a transferal of power .
even if the responsibility is officially put in the interim government 's hands , it will have an extremely difficult status .
its members will continue to be endangered .
there 's no reason to assume that the attacks will stop , attacks that only have one aim : to create terror and prevent normalization .
the suicide bombers and kidnappers are n't acting in the interests of the iraqi people , which have long been concentrated on only one issue : security . in any case , it was an exaggeration to expect the country to be democratized in a matter of a few months .
after world war ii , germany needed four years until the first free elections and ten years until sovereignty .
why should the process go faster in iraq , a country which does n't even have a history of democracy but really only of totalitarian rule ? security has priority fourteen months after the official end of hostilities , the iraqi citizen 's dream of freedom and democracy has also faded and lost ground to the simple desire for safety and survival .
the interim government will - and wants to - address those concerns : the security forces should be strengthened , old officers should be rehired , and emergency ordinances should give the government a free hand to pursue terrorists and violent criminals . such a crackdown on the violent criminals is hardly a guarantee that the security situation will improve .
if it does n't , the government 's success is put into question .
how can voters and candidates be motivated if they automatically become the targets of extremists ? elections are supposed to take place in early 2005 , but , like in afghanistan , such plans can quickly fall victim to local developments .
ultimately , there is the " classic " risk : the government must take tough action against violent criminals , but in doing so it risks deepening the abyss and suspending those freedoms that democracy is supposed to bring .
thus , june 28 is surely an important date but hardly more than the prelude to a more than problematic new period in the unfortunate history of iraq . peter philipp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. restores iraqi sovereignty ahead of schedule on monday morning , paul bremer , the u.s. administrator in iraq , formally passed the reins of power to the country 's new government before leaving for the u.s. the handover took place two days earlier than planned .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 28.06.2004 building bridges with books großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : showing some spine : frankfurt book fair organizers welcome controversy building a bridge between the middle east and the west is no small task , but its something the organizers of this year 's book fair in frankfurt hope to accomplish .
can literature and commerce do the job ? the organizers of the frankfurt book fair are set to find out in october , when the arab world makes its debut as guest of honor as the world 's largest publishing trade fair opens its doors in october .
despite the difficulties of organizing such an event while arab-western relations are in a state of crisis , authors or booksellers from 17 of 22 nations in the arab league will officially attend -lrb- absent are algeria , morocco , libya , kuwait and iraq . -rrb-
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt book fair poster , 2004 still , authors from these countries are nonetheless represented , arab league representative mohamed ghoneim stressed .
some 200 publishers 150 authors are expected to give readings , lead discussions , and otherwise take part in the program .
for many , the fair offers a chance to break through to a larger market .
the choice to feature the arab world at the book fair was interesting but inherently difficult , organizers say - if only because so many different countries are involved .
despite common roots , the region is plagued by unresolved , divisive political issues , such as the near east conflict and the iraq war .
" would a german author bother worrying about a book fair when dresden is being bombed ? " wondered egyptian novelist sonallah ibrahim .
hot debate but despite the diversity of countries that have been invited , it makes sense to have them all as the focus of the fair together , since the output of literary texts in individual countries is often small -lrb- the trade in religious texts is much stronger . -rrb-
more than likely , some of planned discussions will turn into hot debates .
scandal is far from unheard of in arab literary circles .
for example , sonallah ibrahim caused an uproar when he turned down a coveted egyptian literary prize at the cairo opera house , citing oppression of the egyption people by the government as his grounds .
and algerian author assia djebar - who writes in french - would like to see a talk on the topic of language-based discrimination in arab literature .
" the literature in the arab world needs to become more pluralistic , " she said .
in 2000 , djebar won the german booksellers ' peace prize .
arab league agenda other planned topics which could prove controversial : the role of women in islam , human rights and religious tolerance .
arab league representatives say they are hoping the fair will show the arab world in all its modernity and diversity - and help rectify the biased view many westerners hold of arabs .
publishers and authors will speak out at the fair against " intellectual tyrrany " and " all forms of intellectual terrorism , " said mongi bousneina , the general director for cultural arm of the arab league .
and those in the west seem eager to open the debates .
said book fair director volker neumann : " any chance for a dialog has to be grasped with both hands .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.06.2004 opinion : iraq sovereignty is neither the beginning nor the end großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraq 's road to democracy could yet be long hopeful plans of free , democratic elections in 2005 accompanied the handover of sovereignty from the u.s. to the iraqi interim government monday .
but a democratic iraq is still very far away , according to peter philipp . former israeli ambassador avi primor , normally exceedingly popular in germany , elicited uncomfortable silence during a panel discussion recently when he said that you wo n't soon see real democracy in iraq and that the country might be better off with a new " strong man . " the german audience was taken down a peg in its political correctness and political wishful thinking .
though many people did n't accept george w. bush 's democratic domino theory for the middle east , since the " official " end of hostilities 14 months ago , they have became increasingly more impatient and called for a rapid democratization of iraq . such demands or even just expectations were n't exactly underpinned by experience .
the view was - and is - obscured by the unspeakable torture affair and the continual picking to pieces of even the last official reason for going to war : there were neither weapons of mass destruction nor was there an alliance between saddam hussein and international terrorists . war continues to rage on the other hand , a war is raging in iraq against the occupiers , against members of the interim government , against foreigners , against everyone who is at all involved in building a new , better iraq .
that even the united states speaks of " insurgents " bolsters the feeling that this is a war against foreign occupation which , according to international law - and emotionally more than ever - is sanctioned . it 's hardly a good starting point for a transferal of power .
even if the responsibility is officially put in the interim government 's hands , it will have an extremely difficult status .
its members will continue to be endangered .
there 's no reason to assume that the attacks will stop , attacks that only have one aim : to create terror and prevent normalization .
the suicide bombers and kidnappers are n't acting in the interests of the iraqi people , which have long been concentrated on only one issue : security . in any case , it was an exaggeration to expect the country to be democratized in a matter of a few months .
after world war ii , germany needed four years until the first free elections and ten years until sovereignty .
why should the process go faster in iraq , a country which does n't even have a history of democracy but really only of totalitarian rule ? security has priority fourteen months after the official end of hostilities , the iraqi citizen 's dream of freedom and democracy has also faded and lost ground to the simple desire for safety and survival .
the interim government will - and wants to - address those concerns : the security forces should be strengthened , old officers should be rehired , and emergency ordinances should give the government a free hand to pursue terrorists and violent criminals . such a crackdown on the violent criminals is hardly a guarantee that the security situation will improve .
if it does n't , the government 's success is put into question .
how can voters and candidates be motivated if they automatically become the targets of extremists ? elections are supposed to take place in early 2005 , but , like in afghanistan , such plans can quickly fall victim to local developments .
ultimately , there is the " classic " risk : the government must take tough action against violent criminals , but in doing so it risks deepening the abyss and suspending those freedoms that democracy is supposed to bring .
thus , june 28 is surely an important date but hardly more than the prelude to a more than problematic new period in the unfortunate history of iraq . peter philipp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. restores iraqi sovereignty ahead of schedule on monday morning , paul bremer , the u.s. administrator in iraq , formally passed the reins of power to the country 's new government before leaving for the u.s. the handover took place two days earlier than planned .

the result will largely determine the country 's political direction . on paper , serbia 's five-year presidency is largely ceremonial , but former president milosevic proved how effectively its few powers could be exploited . sunday 's vote could thus determine whether serbia moves closer to the eu and nato and improves relations with the west or lapses back into the chauvinism and isolation reminiscent of milosevic 's former regime . opinion polls this week gave boris tadic , a pro-europe liberal , a lead of up to 54 percent against 46 percent for tomislav nikolic , an ardent nationalist whose radical party propped up milosevic 's regime and supported his military adventures in the 1990s . but despite the lead enjoyed by tadic , analysts say that a turnout of under 40 percent could still hand the presidency to nikolic , who commands greater loyalty among his supporters . choosing between eu and belarus european union officials have warned that a victory for nikolic would diplomatically isolate serbia , whereas a win for tadic would ease relations . chris patten , the european commissioner for external affairs , said this week that serbs had a choice " between joining the european family or belarus . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tomislav nikolic , frontrunner of the ultranationalist serbian radical party .
nikolic -lrb- photo -rrb- is against serbia 's entry to the eu and any victory for him could leave serbia isolated on the international stage and scare off investors from the west . " we need the east .
russia supplies us with resources and power .
why should n't we exploit that ?
the west should help us to manufacture goods and we should sell them in the east , " nikolic said recently . championing himself as the candidate for the working class , nikolic 's strident rhetoric and calls to limit foreign trade appeal to the unemployed , which make up almost 30 percent of the country 's 7.5 million inhabitants . " serbia has opened its doors to the west , but the west has n't improved your lives .
it has n't made the factories churn out more or brought better harvests , " nikolic said . " eu will improve our lives " tadic , on the other hand , has made no bones about the fact that he 'd like to see serbia in the eu and even the nato one day .
an admirer of assassinated prime minister zoran djindjic , tadic took over the democratic party in february after djindjic 's death .
he has vowed to continue with the reform agenda started by djindjic . tadic is considered popular with business leaders , artists and women alike and has continued the policies of his pro-western predecessor , calling for open borders and greater tolerance . " we must become a member of the european union .
we must continue with these reforms , so we can join the bloc .
that would improve our lives .
without the eu , we can not overcome our problems , " tadic said . the vote could n't be further polarized with the two candidates unequivocal about where they 'd like to take serbia in the future .
opinion polls , however , show serbs to be divided , with many wanting to improve relations with the west but hostile to cooperating further with the international war crimes tribunal , which is trying a host of serbian leaders including milosevic for war crimes at the hague . tough decisions over kosovo the country also faces tough decisions over kosovo , the united nations-administered province , which belgrade insists remain part of serbia even though the majority ethnic albanian population wants independence . nikolic has called for sending security forces back to the troubled province of kosovo , inhabited mainly by ethnic albanians .
he clings to the dream of a greater serbia - saying it would be good for his people if all serbs were united . tadic , meanwhile , advocates a political solution to the future of kosovo . reform versus stagnation reporters at belgrade 's independent television station b-92 expect the election to be a watershed event for serbia .
they say if tadic wins , serbia will open up .
but if nikolic wins , serbia will turn inward , stop delivering suspected war criminals to the international criminal court in the hague , and become more isolated .
the reform process would grind to a halt . it 's a scenario that boris tadic has already laid out before the serbs .
" voters must be clear on the consequences of this election .
if nikolic wins , serbia will be isolated .
if i win , serbia will open up . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debating kosovo 's future five years after the war , kosovo remains troubled by ethnic tensions .

but a democratic iraq is still very far away , according to peter philipp . former israeli ambassador avi primor , normally exceedingly popular in germany , elicited uncomfortable silence during a panel discussion recently when he said that you wo n't soon see real democracy in iraq and that the country might be better off with a new " strong man . " the german audience was taken down a peg in its political correctness and political wishful thinking .
though many people did n't accept george w. bush 's democratic domino theory for the middle east , since the " official " end of hostilities 14 months ago , they have became increasingly more impatient and called for a rapid democratization of iraq . such demands or even just expectations were n't exactly underpinned by experience .
the view was - and is - obscured by the unspeakable torture affair and the continual picking to pieces of even the last official reason for going to war : there were neither weapons of mass destruction nor was there an alliance between saddam hussein and international terrorists . war continues to rage on the other hand , a war is raging in iraq against the occupiers , against members of the interim government , against foreigners , against everyone who is at all involved in building a new , better iraq .
that even the united states speaks of " insurgents " bolsters the feeling that this is a war against foreign occupation which , according to international law - and emotionally more than ever - is sanctioned . it 's hardly a good starting point for a transferal of power .
even if the responsibility is officially put in the interim government 's hands , it will have an extremely difficult status .
its members will continue to be endangered .
there 's no reason to assume that the attacks will stop , attacks that only have one aim : to create terror and prevent normalization .
the suicide bombers and kidnappers are n't acting in the interests of the iraqi people , which have long been concentrated on only one issue : security . in any case , it was an exaggeration to expect the country to be democratized in a matter of a few months .
after world war ii , germany needed four years until the first free elections and ten years until sovereignty .
why should the process go faster in iraq , a country which does n't even have a history of democracy but really only of totalitarian rule ? security has priority fourteen months after the official end of hostilities , the iraqi citizen 's dream of freedom and democracy has also faded and lost ground to the simple desire for safety and survival .
the interim government will - and wants to - address those concerns : the security forces should be strengthened , old officers should be rehired , and emergency ordinances should give the government a free hand to pursue terrorists and violent criminals . such a crackdown on the violent criminals is hardly a guarantee that the security situation will improve .
if it does n't , the government 's success is put into question .
how can voters and candidates be motivated if they automatically become the targets of extremists ? elections are supposed to take place in early 2005 , but , like in afghanistan , such plans can quickly fall victim to local developments .
ultimately , there is the " classic " risk : the government must take tough action against violent criminals , but in doing so it risks deepening the abyss and suspending those freedoms that democracy is supposed to bring .
thus , june 28 is surely an important date but hardly more than the prelude to a more than problematic new period in the unfortunate history of iraq . peter philipp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. restores iraqi sovereignty ahead of schedule on monday morning , paul bremer , the u.s. administrator in iraq , formally passed the reins of power to the country 's new government before leaving for the u.s. the handover took place two days earlier than planned .

they will also discuss training of security forces in iraq .
but germany has made it clear its non-engagement pledge remains . on sunday , the 26 nato heads of state and government attended a formal dinner in an ottoman-era palace on the banks of the bosporus to thrash out an agreement on a nato role in training military and police forces for the future sovereign iraqi government . differences however remained over when , and especially where , the training is to take place .
the dispute has given german chancellor gerhard schröder another opportunity to stress that no german soldier will set a foot on iraqi soil . shortly before official talks began in istanbul on monday , the german chancellor expressed his support for attempts to bring stability and democracy to iraq .
speaking to journalists in berlin before boarding a plan to istanbul on sunday , gerhard schröder said the transatlantic row over the iraq war belonged in the history books and that all nato states were interested in improving security in iraq .
at the same time , however , he expressed his determination not to budge on his refusal to send troops to the war-torn country . training must take place in germany - chancellor " we are of course willing to participate in the training of iraqi troops if the iraqi government wants that , " he says .
" but this has to take place in training centers in germany because we stick to our position that no german troops will be sent to iraq .
in istanbul i will once again make that clear . " sixteen nato members have forces in iraq , but key members , including germany and france , have so far resisted pressure from washington to participate .
they have also thwarted the bush administration ’ s original hope of a nato-led force to take command of a peacekeeping force south of baghdad .
schröder ’ s resistance against a german troop deployment is fully backed by his junior coalition partner in the government – the greens .
greens party leader angelika beer believes that nato members won ’ t agree to the alliance 's direct participation on the ground in iraq . greens doubt european support for nato role " i expect there will be an agreement on military training but outside iraq , " she said . " there won ’ t be support for a nato role inside the country so that the controversy may linger on .
the european member states will make it clear again that humanitarian and training assistance is all they are willing to provide .
after all the conflicts in the entire middle east are still waiting for an answer from nato . " the wrangling over military and police training echoes nato divisions before the iraq war when france and germany blocked military assistance of the alliance to turkey , iraq ’ s neighbor .
and senior leaders of iraq ’ s interim government have expressed their dissatisfaction about the rift . hoshyar zebari , foreign minister in the iraqi government which formally assumes sovereignty on wednesday , insisted that any training must take place inside the country to be adaptable to iraqi conditions . uwe hessler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush courts turkey amid protests and violence u.s. president bush renewed calls for turkey 's eu entry as he sought to boost ties with the country in ankara on the eve of a nato summit .

u.s. administrator paul bremer passed the legal documentation to iraqi chief justice midhat al-mahmodi and with them the running of the war-torn country , 15 months after the invasion to remove saddam hussein . during the ceremony , bremer told the assembled officials that as " ex-administrator of the coalition provisional authority " he would " leave iraq confident in the future and confident in the ability of the government to meet the challenges of the future . "
coalition officials said bremer left iraq less than an hour after the ceremony , saying that he was " going home . " reactions from the international community on the whole were positive , with europe 's leaders among the first to offer words of support for the new government .
however , the overall feeling was one of caution . europe sends muted congratulations the german government displayed little excitement over the surprise move , simply sending its cordial greetings to the new , sovereign government in baghdad . deputy government spokesman hans-hermann langguth reported that immediately after the news broke monday morning , chancellor schröder sent a letter to the iraqi president , iyad allawi , congratulating him on his country ’ s new sovereignty .
however , langguth added that the handover of power did not mean that germany would be changing its policy on iraq . " the german envoy in baghdad has handed over a letter to the iraqi president pledging germany ’ s support in rebuilding the country , " he said .
" the chancellor also made it clear that we are prepared to give humanitarian assistance wherever possible , but that this would not include sending troops to iraq . " antje leendertse , spokeswomen for the german foreign ministry , expressed the hope that iraq could now find a respected place among the family of independent nations .
she added that the government in baghdad still faced difficult times ahead . " it ’ s clear that the next important step must be democratic elections under united nations guidance at the end of the year , " she said .
" germany will wholeheartedly support the world body in its effort to make these elections possible . " leendertse said germany ’ s willingness to contribute to the training of iraqi police and military forces , but said this was only possible outside the country . volker rühe , defense expert with the conservative opposition , said it was important to scale back the presence of foreign troops in iraq and strengthen the newly established iraqi police force .
he reiterated his opinion that the disbanding of the old iraqi army by the u.s.-led provisional authority was a major mistake which had contributed to the current security problems in iraq . in france , the reception was equally lukewarm .
french president jacques chirac had " taken note " of the transfer , but the handover was only one step in the political process there , his spokeswoman told afp on monday .
" the transfer of sovereignty is a long-awaited event , important .
it is a step in the political process that will run until 2005 , " she said .
" other steps must follow and france wishes the interim government and the iraqi people every success . " british prime minister tony blair 's spokesman told reporters that downing street welcomed the earlier-than-expected handover , saying it was an attempt to " seize the initiative " from the insurgents .
" we obviously welcome it because it 's their decision and it 's them taking control , " he said .
" what 's important now is that the iraqi people can see iraqi leaders taking charge in baghdad . " irish foreign minister brian cowen , in a statement on behalf of the eu presidency , which ireland currently holds , said that he wished iraq 's government " every success in their mission to govern iraq to the stage where free and fair elections can take place . " in poland , janusz zemke , the deputy defense minister , told reporters : " this is very good .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 28.06.2004 viacom snaps up german mtv rival viva großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the much-loved german music broadcaster viva has been bought by viacom mtv owner viacom last week announced it would be buying a majority stake in german rival viva media .
critics fear the buyout could crush competition in the music video market . rumors of the planned bid had been circulating for months , so it was no big surprise when u.s. media giant viacom revealed thursday that a group of 14 viva shareholders , including media conglomerates time warner inc. and vivendi universal , would be selling viacom 75.8 percent of the cologne-based music tv broadcaster 's shares , an offer supported by viva 's management .
the deal , which values viva at € 308.8 million -lrb- $ 373 million -rrb- , is viacom 's largest ever acquisition outside the united states .
bill rhoedy , president of mtv networks international , said the takeover would n't be stopping there .
viacom is now expected to make a further offer for the remaining 24.2 percent . " we want to acquire 100 percent , " he stressed in frankfurt last week .
" germany is the largest cable and satellite market in the world outside the u.s. , " he added , saying , " we believe there 's enormous potential for growth in this market and viva will help consolidate us in germany and europe . "
tom freston , viacom 's co-president , echoed his statements .
" acquiring viva is a top priority to drive mtv 's expansion in germany , " he said , emphasizing that " it 's a critical tv market globally . "
former rivals the two-step deal is by no means without its critics - first and foremost because viacom 's acquisition of loss-making viva will increase mtv 's presence in germany from two to four channels and make it the dominant force within germany 's music-television landscape .
viva first hit tv screens in 1993 , charged with challenging mtv 's hegemony by promoting the german music industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heike makatsch viva 's two channels soon cornered a market share of 3.2 percent in the target audience of 14-to-29-year-olds , beaming in to some 32 million homes .
the station gave homegrown bands such as die fantastischen vier and guano apes their breakthrough and helped launch the careers of a whole host of german celebrities , including stefan raab and heike makatsch -lrb- photo -rrb- , who recently appeared in the british hit film " love actually . "
with insiders concerned that germany 's domestic music scene will now have to take a back seat , mtv insists it will still be concentrating on local culture .
" we 're not going to just replant a u.s. brand in germany , " catherine muehlemann , manager of mtv central , told reporters .
" we want to keep our focus local . "
regulatory issues nonetheless , the deal may attract regulatory scrutiny .
according to reuters , industry sources expect major music labels and german tv channels to complain to cartel officials about the deal , arguing that it gives viacom a stronghold on which videos are broadcast as well as the related advertising market .
simon guild , deputy head of mtv networks europe , told reuters that he did not expect " material regulatory issues " but admitted the deal would have to be submitted to authorities for approval .
viacom also pointed out that the deal was subject to german merger and media ownership approvals .
shares rise viva operates two music channels in germany , while its brain pool unit produces tv shows and movies such as the hugely popular comedy shows " tv total , " " ladykracher " and " anke late night . "
it owns a 51 percent stake in its viva plus tv channel , while the rest is owned by time warner inc . , which is now selling its stake to viacom . recent years saw viva hard hit by the german advertising slump , with net tv advertising sales falling 20 percent since 2000 .
in 2003 , it posted losses of € 42 million .
but once the viacom bid was clinched , viva 's shares were up 5.3 percent at € 12.64 , trading just one cent shy of the offer price , € 12.65 a share , and hitting their highest level for almost two years .
viva stock more than doubled over the past year on speculation of a takeover , and the bid represents a 21 percent premium over its average share price over the three months before the offer .

former rivals the two-step deal is by no means without its critics - first and foremost because viacom 's acquisition of loss-making viva will increase mtv 's presence in germany from two to four channels and make it the dominant force within germany 's music-television landscape .
viva first hit tv screens in 1993 , charged with challenging mtv 's hegemony by promoting the german music industry .

the station gave homegrown bands such as die fantastischen vier and guano apes their breakthrough and helped launch the careers of a whole host of german celebrities , including stefan raab and heike makatsch -lrb- photo -rrb- , who recently appeared in the british hit film " love actually . "
with insiders concerned that germany 's domestic music scene will now have to take a back seat , mtv insists it will still be concentrating on local culture .
" we 're not going to just replant a u.s. brand in germany , " catherine muehlemann , manager of mtv central , told reporters .
" we want to keep our focus local . "
regulatory issues nonetheless , the deal may attract regulatory scrutiny .
according to reuters , industry sources expect major music labels and german tv channels to complain to cartel officials about the deal , arguing that it gives viacom a stronghold on which videos are broadcast as well as the related advertising market .
simon guild , deputy head of mtv networks europe , told reuters that he did not expect " material regulatory issues " but admitted the deal would have to be submitted to authorities for approval .
viacom also pointed out that the deal was subject to german merger and media ownership approvals .
shares rise viva operates two music channels in germany , while its brain pool unit produces tv shows and movies such as the hugely popular comedy shows " tv total , " " ladykracher " and " anke late night . "
it owns a 51 percent stake in its viva plus tv channel , while the rest is owned by time warner inc . , which is now selling its stake to viacom . recent years saw viva hard hit by the german advertising slump , with net tv advertising sales falling 20 percent since 2000 .
in 2003 , it posted losses of € 42 million .
but once the viacom bid was clinched , viva 's shares were up 5.3 percent at € 12.64 , trading just one cent shy of the offer price , € 12.65 a share , and hitting their highest level for almost two years .
viva stock more than doubled over the past year on speculation of a takeover , and the bid represents a 21 percent premium over its average share price over the three months before the offer .

critics fear the buyout could crush competition in the music video market . rumors of the planned bid had been circulating for months , so it was no big surprise when u.s. media giant viacom revealed thursday that a group of 14 viva shareholders , including media conglomerates time warner inc. and vivendi universal , would be selling viacom 75.8 percent of the cologne-based music tv broadcaster 's shares , an offer supported by viva 's management .
the deal , which values viva at € 308.8 million -lrb- $ 373 million -rrb- , is viacom 's largest ever acquisition outside the united states .
bill rhoedy , president of mtv networks international , said the takeover would n't be stopping there .
viacom is now expected to make a further offer for the remaining 24.2 percent . " we want to acquire 100 percent , " he stressed in frankfurt last week .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.06.2004 -pipe- 17:00 utc microsoft gets reprieve from eu commission the european commission has halted an order requiring microsoft to change its business practices upon review by the eu 's highest court on a request by the software giant to suspend the measures .
microsoft lost an anti-trust ruling in march that said the company had abused its market dominance in europe .
the commission ruled that the seattle-based company had to put a series of " remedies " in place by monday , including offering a european version of its windows operating system stripped of its audio and video player .
microsoft argued that it faced " irreversible " damage if the measures were imposed before a decision was made on an appeal to the ruling .
the commission has said its decision to postpone the punishment was " without prejudice to microsoft 's obligation to implement the remedies " should the court reject the company 's request .
the court could rule on the suspension request within two months . dw-world.de microsoft slapped with biggest fine in eu history the european union on wednesday levied the largest fine against any company in the bloc 's history , ruling that microsoft must pay a half billion euros for abusing its " near monopoly " status .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.06.2004 opinion : iraq sovereignty is neither the beginning nor the end großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraq 's road to democracy could yet be long hopeful plans of free , democratic elections in 2005 accompanied the handover of sovereignty from the u.s. to the iraqi interim government monday .
but a democratic iraq is still very far away , according to peter philipp . former israeli ambassador avi primor , normally exceedingly popular in germany , elicited uncomfortable silence during a panel discussion recently when he said that you wo n't soon see real democracy in iraq and that the country might be better off with a new " strong man . " the german audience was taken down a peg in its political correctness and political wishful thinking .
though many people did n't accept george w. bush 's democratic domino theory for the middle east , since the " official " end of hostilities 14 months ago , they have became increasingly more impatient and called for a rapid democratization of iraq . such demands or even just expectations were n't exactly underpinned by experience .
the view was - and is - obscured by the unspeakable torture affair and the continual picking to pieces of even the last official reason for going to war : there were neither weapons of mass destruction nor was there an alliance between saddam hussein and international terrorists . war continues to rage on the other hand , a war is raging in iraq against the occupiers , against members of the interim government , against foreigners , against everyone who is at all involved in building a new , better iraq .
that even the united states speaks of " insurgents " bolsters the feeling that this is a war against foreign occupation which , according to international law - and emotionally more than ever - is sanctioned . it 's hardly a good starting point for a transferal of power .
even if the responsibility is officially put in the interim government 's hands , it will have an extremely difficult status .
its members will continue to be endangered .
there 's no reason to assume that the attacks will stop , attacks that only have one aim : to create terror and prevent normalization .
the suicide bombers and kidnappers are n't acting in the interests of the iraqi people , which have long been concentrated on only one issue : security . in any case , it was an exaggeration to expect the country to be democratized in a matter of a few months .
after world war ii , germany needed four years until the first free elections and ten years until sovereignty .
why should the process go faster in iraq , a country which does n't even have a history of democracy but really only of totalitarian rule ? security has priority fourteen months after the official end of hostilities , the iraqi citizen 's dream of freedom and democracy has also faded and lost ground to the simple desire for safety and survival .
the interim government will - and wants to - address those concerns : the security forces should be strengthened , old officers should be rehired , and emergency ordinances should give the government a free hand to pursue terrorists and violent criminals . such a crackdown on the violent criminals is hardly a guarantee that the security situation will improve .
if it does n't , the government 's success is put into question .
how can voters and candidates be motivated if they automatically become the targets of extremists ? elections are supposed to take place in early 2005 , but , like in afghanistan , such plans can quickly fall victim to local developments .
ultimately , there is the " classic " risk : the government must take tough action against violent criminals , but in doing so it risks deepening the abyss and suspending those freedoms that democracy is supposed to bring .
thus , june 28 is surely an important date but hardly more than the prelude to a more than problematic new period in the unfortunate history of iraq . peter philipp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. restores iraqi sovereignty ahead of schedule on monday morning , paul bremer , the u.s. administrator in iraq , formally passed the reins of power to the country 's new government before leaving for the u.s. the handover took place two days earlier than planned .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.06.2004 opinion : iraq sovereignty is neither the beginning nor the end großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraq 's road to democracy could yet be long hopeful plans of free , democratic elections in 2005 accompanied the handover of sovereignty from the u.s. to the iraqi interim government monday .
but a democratic iraq is still very far away , according to peter philipp . former israeli ambassador avi primor , normally exceedingly popular in germany , elicited uncomfortable silence during a panel discussion recently when he said that you wo n't soon see real democracy in iraq and that the country might be better off with a new " strong man . " the german audience was taken down a peg in its political correctness and political wishful thinking .
though many people did n't accept george w. bush 's democratic domino theory for the middle east , since the " official " end of hostilities 14 months ago , they have became increasingly more impatient and called for a rapid democratization of iraq . such demands or even just expectations were n't exactly underpinned by experience .
the view was - and is - obscured by the unspeakable torture affair and the continual picking to pieces of even the last official reason for going to war : there were neither weapons of mass destruction nor was there an alliance between saddam hussein and international terrorists . war continues to rage on the other hand , a war is raging in iraq against the occupiers , against members of the interim government , against foreigners , against everyone who is at all involved in building a new , better iraq .
that even the united states speaks of " insurgents " bolsters the feeling that this is a war against foreign occupation which , according to international law - and emotionally more than ever - is sanctioned . it 's hardly a good starting point for a transferal of power .
even if the responsibility is officially put in the interim government 's hands , it will have an extremely difficult status .
its members will continue to be endangered .
there 's no reason to assume that the attacks will stop , attacks that only have one aim : to create terror and prevent normalization .
the suicide bombers and kidnappers are n't acting in the interests of the iraqi people , which have long been concentrated on only one issue : security . in any case , it was an exaggeration to expect the country to be democratized in a matter of a few months .
after world war ii , germany needed four years until the first free elections and ten years until sovereignty .
why should the process go faster in iraq , a country which does n't even have a history of democracy but really only of totalitarian rule ? security has priority fourteen months after the official end of hostilities , the iraqi citizen 's dream of freedom and democracy has also faded and lost ground to the simple desire for safety and survival .
the interim government will - and wants to - address those concerns : the security forces should be strengthened , old officers should be rehired , and emergency ordinances should give the government a free hand to pursue terrorists and violent criminals . such a crackdown on the violent criminals is hardly a guarantee that the security situation will improve .

portuguese prime minister durao barroso is expected to fill a position with prerequisites few candidates can satisfy . irish prime minister bertie ahern , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said sunday he would propose portuguese prime minister jose manuel durao barroso for the eu 's top job at a special bloc summit set for tuesday evening . ahern said there was " overwhelming support " for durao barroso .
german chancellor gerhard schröder stressed sunday that durao barroso " could count on germany 's support , " and british prime minister tony blair said he was certain barroso " would do an outstanding job " and that he hoped he would " be able to accept the challenge , " the associated press reported . so far durao barroso has n't commented on taking over the reins from outgoing eu commission president romano prodi .
assuming he does so though , portugal will be faced with the challenge figuring out what to do next , since the country has no clear rules for how to replace him . shifting allegiances in his youth , as a law student under the portuguese dictatorship , durao barroso was a marxist activist , but already at age 20 , his allegiances shifted towards the political center .
durao barroso completed his law degree in lisbon and studied political science in geneva and new york .
at 29 , after returning from the united states , he was elected to parliament .
the following year he was appointed state secretary and later , at 36 , foreign minister . when his party , the conservative liberal social democrats -lrb- psd -rrb- , was voted out of office in 1995 , durao barroso bridged the time back in the united states teaching at georgetown university in washington .
but he returned to portugal and worked his way up in the psd .
his time finally came in march 2002 , when the party , with durao barroso at its helm , - barely - won early elections called after socialist prime minister antonio guterres resigned over poor local election returns . durao barroso worked closely with former spanish prime minister jose maria aznar , and hosted a meeting between aznar , u.s. president george w. bush and british prime minister blair on the azores in march 2003 that cemented the four countries ' decision to cooperate in the iraq war .
portugal still has 120 police deployed in iraq , which durao barroso recently refused to withdraw . horse-trading the " horse-trading " over who would fill the top eu post has been going on intensely since an eu leaders failed to agree on a candidate at a summit in mid-june .
france and germany insisted that the commission head be from a country that fully participates in all eu initiatives , which ruled out britain 's chris patten , since his country is not part of the single currency .
britain had already succeeded in blocking germany 's choice , belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt , partly because he was considered too critical of u.s. foreign policy . france was adamant that the eu president should speak french .
the conservative-liberal european people 's party , the largest political group in the european parliament , demanded a candidate from the center-right .
others pressed for a politician experienced in the highest government levels .
still others asserted that the right person for the job should be from a smaller eu country . in the end , the 48-year-old portuguese prime minister fits all the requirements .
and besides french , he also speaks english and spanish .
unless durao barroso 's nomination is accepted by all 25 eu heads of state on tuesday , the european parliament will have to vote on whether to appoint him , which could happen as early as mid-july .
he would almost certainly be approved by the conservative-liberal dominated parliament .
he would take office in november . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de portugal hopes for euro economic bonus when portugal hosts this year 's european championship this summer , thousands of visiting soccer fans will spend plenty of euros .

portuguese prime minister durao barroso is expected to fill a position with prerequisites few candidates can satisfy . irish prime minister bertie ahern , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said sunday he would propose portuguese prime minister jose manuel durao barroso for the eu 's top job at a special bloc summit set for tuesday evening . ahern said there was " overwhelming support " for durao barroso .
german chancellor gerhard schröder stressed sunday that durao barroso " could count on germany 's support , " and british prime minister tony blair said he was certain barroso " would do an outstanding job " and that he hoped he would " be able to accept the challenge , " the associated press reported . so far durao barroso has n't commented on taking over the reins from outgoing eu commission president romano prodi .
assuming he does so though , portugal will be faced with the challenge figuring out what to do next , since the country has no clear rules for how to replace him . shifting allegiances in his youth , as a law student under the portuguese dictatorship , durao barroso was a marxist activist , but already at age 20 , his allegiances shifted towards the political center .
durao barroso completed his law degree in lisbon and studied political science in geneva and new york .
at 29 , after returning from the united states , he was elected to parliament .
the following year he was appointed state secretary and later , at 36 , foreign minister . when his party , the conservative liberal social democrats -lrb- psd -rrb- , was voted out of office in 1995 , durao barroso bridged the time back in the united states teaching at georgetown university in washington .
but he returned to portugal and worked his way up in the psd .
his time finally came in march 2002 , when the party , with durao barroso at its helm , - barely - won early elections called after socialist prime minister antonio guterres resigned over poor local election returns . durao barroso worked closely with former spanish prime minister jose maria aznar , and hosted a meeting between aznar , u.s. president george w. bush and british prime minister blair on the azores in march 2003 that cemented the four countries ' decision to cooperate in the iraq war .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 28.06.2004 powerful union accuses schröder of ' failure ' großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellor is losing the support of the world 's largest services union , ver.di.
as once strong relations between germany 's unions and the ruling social democrats plunge to new lows , one of the labor movement 's most-powerful leaders threatens to withdraw his support for chancellor gerhard schröder . frank bsirske , head of the german public sector union ver.di , infuriated the coalition government of social democrats and greens over the weekend by telling the newspaper welt am sonntag that chancellor gerhard schröder 's social and economic reform policy has been a huge failure .
" measured against his claim that he would create jobs , reduce joblessness and pep up the economy , gerhard schröder has been a failure , " bsirske told the paper .
bsirske acknowledged that cuts to the country 's generous social welfare system were needed to keep it afloat , while at the same time making the allegation that the government 's policy had by no means led to better employment opportunities in the country .
economic growth rates remain at well below 1 percent this year after three years of total stagnation .
move could hurt social democrats for bsirske 's part , the move was calculated .
himself a member of the green party , he knows his criticism will primarily hurt the social democrats .
the spd 's popularity has fallen to an unparalleled low in recent months , while the greens have recorded major gains in regional elections despite the fact that , as the spd 's junior coalition partner , they are also responsible for germany 's current social and economic policies .
bsirske , as well as other union leaders , are hoping to strengthen the rebellious left-wingers within the spd - many of whom harbor nagging doubts about the political reorientation of their party , which has traditionally represented the interests of the underprivileged in society .
schröder : i 'm not budging for his part , schröder told the newsweekly der spiegel that the " unions need to abandon their abstract considerations instead ask concrete questions in their companies . "
schröder said the unions should focus on what 's really best for their workers .
the chancellor also categorically refused to make any additional change to his labor reform laws .
" i 'm not going to do any more snipping , " he said , referring to his agenda 2010 reform plan .
green party chief reinhard bütikofer did what was expected of him and dismissed bsirske ’ s criticism as " unfounded " and " unconstructive . "
and deputy spd chief kurt beck brushed off bsirske ’ s demand for a change of course in the reform process as " nonsense . "
" a change of course – what ’ s that supposed to mean ? "
beck asked .
" weren ’ t we all agreed that considering our own demographic problems and global developments our social system has to be changed in order to survive at all ?
and weren ’ t we all agreed that the necessary reforms could not be carried out without sacrifices ?
so i don ’ t really understand why some are now calling on the government to revise its policy .
we don ’ t have the right to change our course , because we were elected to do the things that are necessary for germany to become competitive again . "
row to enter new round the row between the government and the trade unions is expected to enter yet another round on wednesday , when an inter-parliamentary arbitration committee is scheduled to agree on the details of combining germany 's welfare and unemployment benefits starting next year .
the move is expected to create even greater hardships for the economically disadvantaged .
" it looks as if there is no capacity and no mechanisms in place to make job placement procedures more efficient as of jan .
1 of next year , " said hermann-joseph ahrentz , the social affairs spokesman for the conservative opposition christian democratic union .
" but since long-term unemployed people will get fewer benefits under the new plan , they should at least have the opportunity to find work more easily .
but i can ’ t see this happening .
this is why the government ’ s policy can only be described as a rush job and a patchwork , and as socially unjust , since it hits the poor and underprivileged once again . "
a conundrum for the spd 's base an editorial in the monday issue of the financial times deutschland newspaper concluded that the spat between unions and the spd is making it impossible for core social democrat voters to maintain their loyalty to both their party and the trade unions .
both are complaining about dwindling membership .
bsirske and his colleagues are well aware that with a conservative government at the helm in 2006 the unions are even less likely to strike a deal for softer reforms .
but the unions may have another strategy altogether .
as bsirske noted on sunday : the unions could much more easily fight a conservative chancellor than a social democrat who claims to be on the unions ' side . hardy graupner -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.06.2004 serbs face clear choice in presidential polls großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a win for boris tadic will improve serbia 's ties with the west .
serbian voters go to the polls sunday in crucial presidential elections that pit pro-eu reformer boris tadic against ultranationalist tomislav nikolic .
the result will largely determine the country 's political direction . on paper , serbia 's five-year presidency is largely ceremonial , but former president milosevic proved how effectively its few powers could be exploited . sunday 's vote could thus determine whether serbia moves closer to the eu and nato and improves relations with the west or lapses back into the chauvinism and isolation reminiscent of milosevic 's former regime . opinion polls this week gave boris tadic , a pro-europe liberal , a lead of up to 54 percent against 46 percent for tomislav nikolic , an ardent nationalist whose radical party propped up milosevic 's regime and supported his military adventures in the 1990s . but despite the lead enjoyed by tadic , analysts say that a turnout of under 40 percent could still hand the presidency to nikolic , who commands greater loyalty among his supporters . choosing between eu and belarus european union officials have warned that a victory for nikolic would diplomatically isolate serbia , whereas a win for tadic would ease relations . chris patten , the european commissioner for external affairs , said this week that serbs had a choice " between joining the european family or belarus . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tomislav nikolic , frontrunner of the ultranationalist serbian radical party .
nikolic -lrb- photo -rrb- is against serbia 's entry to the eu and any victory for him could leave serbia isolated on the international stage and scare off investors from the west . " we need the east .
russia supplies us with resources and power .

serbian voters go to the polls sunday in crucial presidential elections that pit pro-eu reformer boris tadic against ultranationalist tomislav nikolic .
the result will largely determine the country 's political direction . on paper , serbia 's five-year presidency is largely ceremonial , but former president milosevic proved how effectively its few powers could be exploited . sunday 's vote could thus determine whether serbia moves closer to the eu and nato and improves relations with the west or lapses back into the chauvinism and isolation reminiscent of milosevic 's former regime . opinion polls this week gave boris tadic , a pro-europe liberal , a lead of up to 54 percent against 46 percent for tomislav nikolic , an ardent nationalist whose radical party propped up milosevic 's regime and supported his military adventures in the 1990s . but despite the lead enjoyed by tadic , analysts say that a turnout of under 40 percent could still hand the presidency to nikolic , who commands greater loyalty among his supporters . choosing between eu and belarus european union officials have warned that a victory for nikolic would diplomatically isolate serbia , whereas a win for tadic would ease relations . chris patten , the european commissioner for external affairs , said this week that serbs had a choice " between joining the european family or belarus . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tomislav nikolic , frontrunner of the ultranationalist serbian radical party .
nikolic -lrb- photo -rrb- is against serbia 's entry to the eu and any victory for him could leave serbia isolated on the international stage and scare off investors from the west . " we need the east .
russia supplies us with resources and power .
why should n't we exploit that ?
the west should help us to manufacture goods and we should sell them in the east , " nikolic said recently . championing himself as the candidate for the working class , nikolic 's strident rhetoric and calls to limit foreign trade appeal to the unemployed , which make up almost 30 percent of the country 's 7.5 million inhabitants . " serbia has opened its doors to the west , but the west has n't improved your lives .
it has n't made the factories churn out more or brought better harvests , " nikolic said . " eu will improve our lives " tadic , on the other hand , has made no bones about the fact that he 'd like to see serbia in the eu and even the nato one day .
an admirer of assassinated prime minister zoran djindjic , tadic took over the democratic party in february after djindjic 's death .
he has vowed to continue with the reform agenda started by djindjic . tadic is considered popular with business leaders , artists and women alike and has continued the policies of his pro-western predecessor , calling for open borders and greater tolerance . " we must become a member of the european union .

as once strong relations between germany 's unions and the ruling social democrats plunge to new lows , one of the labor movement 's most-powerful leaders threatens to withdraw his support for chancellor gerhard schröder . frank bsirske , head of the german public sector union ver.di , infuriated the coalition government of social democrats and greens over the weekend by telling the newspaper welt am sonntag that chancellor gerhard schröder 's social and economic reform policy has been a huge failure .
" measured against his claim that he would create jobs , reduce joblessness and pep up the economy , gerhard schröder has been a failure , " bsirske told the paper .
bsirske acknowledged that cuts to the country 's generous social welfare system were needed to keep it afloat , while at the same time making the allegation that the government 's policy had by no means led to better employment opportunities in the country .
economic growth rates remain at well below 1 percent this year after three years of total stagnation .
move could hurt social democrats for bsirske 's part , the move was calculated .
himself a member of the green party , he knows his criticism will primarily hurt the social democrats .
the spd 's popularity has fallen to an unparalleled low in recent months , while the greens have recorded major gains in regional elections despite the fact that , as the spd 's junior coalition partner , they are also responsible for germany 's current social and economic policies .
bsirske , as well as other union leaders , are hoping to strengthen the rebellious left-wingers within the spd - many of whom harbor nagging doubts about the political reorientation of their party , which has traditionally represented the interests of the underprivileged in society .
schröder : i 'm not budging for his part , schröder told the newsweekly der spiegel that the " unions need to abandon their abstract considerations instead ask concrete questions in their companies . "
schröder said the unions should focus on what 's really best for their workers .
the chancellor also categorically refused to make any additional change to his labor reform laws .
" i 'm not going to do any more snipping , " he said , referring to his agenda 2010 reform plan .
green party chief reinhard bütikofer did what was expected of him and dismissed bsirske ’ s criticism as " unfounded " and " unconstructive . "
and deputy spd chief kurt beck brushed off bsirske ’ s demand for a change of course in the reform process as " nonsense . "
" a change of course – what ’ s that supposed to mean ? "
beck asked .
" weren ’ t we all agreed that considering our own demographic problems and global developments our social system has to be changed in order to survive at all ?
and weren ’ t we all agreed that the necessary reforms could not be carried out without sacrifices ?
so i don ’ t really understand why some are now calling on the government to revise its policy .
we don ’ t have the right to change our course , because we were elected to do the things that are necessary for germany to become competitive again . "
row to enter new round the row between the government and the trade unions is expected to enter yet another round on wednesday , when an inter-parliamentary arbitration committee is scheduled to agree on the details of combining germany 's welfare and unemployment benefits starting next year .
the move is expected to create even greater hardships for the economically disadvantaged .
" it looks as if there is no capacity and no mechanisms in place to make job placement procedures more efficient as of jan .
1 of next year , " said hermann-joseph ahrentz , the social affairs spokesman for the conservative opposition christian democratic union .
" but since long-term unemployed people will get fewer benefits under the new plan , they should at least have the opportunity to find work more easily .
but i can ’ t see this happening .
this is why the government ’ s policy can only be described as a rush job and a patchwork , and as socially unjust , since it hits the poor and underprivileged once again . "
a conundrum for the spd 's base an editorial in the monday issue of the financial times deutschland newspaper concluded that the spat between unions and the spd is making it impossible for core social democrat voters to maintain their loyalty to both their party and the trade unions .
both are complaining about dwindling membership .
bsirske and his colleagues are well aware that with a conservative government at the helm in 2006 the unions are even less likely to strike a deal for softer reforms .
but the unions may have another strategy altogether .

as once strong relations between germany 's unions and the ruling social democrats plunge to new lows , one of the labor movement 's most-powerful leaders threatens to withdraw his support for chancellor gerhard schröder . frank bsirske , head of the german public sector union ver.di , infuriated the coalition government of social democrats and greens over the weekend by telling the newspaper welt am sonntag that chancellor gerhard schröder 's social and economic reform policy has been a huge failure .
" measured against his claim that he would create jobs , reduce joblessness and pep up the economy , gerhard schröder has been a failure , " bsirske told the paper .
bsirske acknowledged that cuts to the country 's generous social welfare system were needed to keep it afloat , while at the same time making the allegation that the government 's policy had by no means led to better employment opportunities in the country .
economic growth rates remain at well below 1 percent this year after three years of total stagnation .
move could hurt social democrats for bsirske 's part , the move was calculated .
himself a member of the green party , he knows his criticism will primarily hurt the social democrats .
the spd 's popularity has fallen to an unparalleled low in recent months , while the greens have recorded major gains in regional elections despite the fact that , as the spd 's junior coalition partner , they are also responsible for germany 's current social and economic policies .
bsirske , as well as other union leaders , are hoping to strengthen the rebellious left-wingers within the spd - many of whom harbor nagging doubts about the political reorientation of their party , which has traditionally represented the interests of the underprivileged in society .
schröder : i 'm not budging for his part , schröder told the newsweekly der spiegel that the " unions need to abandon their abstract considerations instead ask concrete questions in their companies . "
schröder said the unions should focus on what 's really best for their workers .
the chancellor also categorically refused to make any additional change to his labor reform laws .
" i 'm not going to do any more snipping , " he said , referring to his agenda 2010 reform plan .
green party chief reinhard bütikofer did what was expected of him and dismissed bsirske ’ s criticism as " unfounded " and " unconstructive . "
and deputy spd chief kurt beck brushed off bsirske ’ s demand for a change of course in the reform process as " nonsense . "
" a change of course – what ’ s that supposed to mean ? "
beck asked .
" weren ’ t we all agreed that considering our own demographic problems and global developments our social system has to be changed in order to survive at all ?
and weren ’ t we all agreed that the necessary reforms could not be carried out without sacrifices ?
so i don ’ t really understand why some are now calling on the government to revise its policy .
we don ’ t have the right to change our course , because we were elected to do the things that are necessary for germany to become competitive again . "
row to enter new round the row between the government and the trade unions is expected to enter yet another round on wednesday , when an inter-parliamentary arbitration committee is scheduled to agree on the details of combining germany 's welfare and unemployment benefits starting next year .
the move is expected to create even greater hardships for the economically disadvantaged .
" it looks as if there is no capacity and no mechanisms in place to make job placement procedures more efficient as of jan .
1 of next year , " said hermann-joseph ahrentz , the social affairs spokesman for the conservative opposition christian democratic union .
" but since long-term unemployed people will get fewer benefits under the new plan , they should at least have the opportunity to find work more easily .
but i can ’ t see this happening .
this is why the government ’ s policy can only be described as a rush job and a patchwork , and as socially unjust , since it hits the poor and underprivileged once again . "
a conundrum for the spd 's base an editorial in the monday issue of the financial times deutschland newspaper concluded that the spat between unions and the spd is making it impossible for core social democrat voters to maintain their loyalty to both their party and the trade unions .
both are complaining about dwindling membership .
bsirske and his colleagues are well aware that with a conservative government at the helm in 2006 the unions are even less likely to strike a deal for softer reforms .
but the unions may have another strategy altogether .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 28.06.2004 building bridges with books großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : showing some spine : frankfurt book fair organizers welcome controversy building a bridge between the middle east and the west is no small task , but its something the organizers of this year 's book fair in frankfurt hope to accomplish .
can literature and commerce do the job ? the organizers of the frankfurt book fair are set to find out in october , when the arab world makes its debut as guest of honor as the world 's largest publishing trade fair opens its doors in october .
despite the difficulties of organizing such an event while arab-western relations are in a state of crisis , authors or booksellers from 17 of 22 nations in the arab league will officially attend -lrb- absent are algeria , morocco , libya , kuwait and iraq . -rrb-
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt book fair poster , 2004 still , authors from these countries are nonetheless represented , arab league representative mohamed ghoneim stressed .
some 200 publishers 150 authors are expected to give readings , lead discussions , and otherwise take part in the program .
for many , the fair offers a chance to break through to a larger market .
the choice to feature the arab world at the book fair was interesting but inherently difficult , organizers say - if only because so many different countries are involved .
despite common roots , the region is plagued by unresolved , divisive political issues , such as the near east conflict and the iraq war .
" would a german author bother worrying about a book fair when dresden is being bombed ? " wondered egyptian novelist sonallah ibrahim .
hot debate but despite the diversity of countries that have been invited , it makes sense to have them all as the focus of the fair together , since the output of literary texts in individual countries is often small -lrb- the trade in religious texts is much stronger . -rrb-
more than likely , some of planned discussions will turn into hot debates .
scandal is far from unheard of in arab literary circles .
for example , sonallah ibrahim caused an uproar when he turned down a coveted egyptian literary prize at the cairo opera house , citing oppression of the egyption people by the government as his grounds .
and algerian author assia djebar - who writes in french - would like to see a talk on the topic of language-based discrimination in arab literature .
" the literature in the arab world needs to become more pluralistic , " she said .
in 2000 , djebar won the german booksellers ' peace prize .
arab league agenda other planned topics which could prove controversial : the role of women in islam , human rights and religious tolerance .
arab league representatives say they are hoping the fair will show the arab world in all its modernity and diversity - and help rectify the biased view many westerners hold of arabs .
publishers and authors will speak out at the fair against " intellectual tyrrany " and " all forms of intellectual terrorism , " said mongi bousneina , the general director for cultural arm of the arab league .
and those in the west seem eager to open the debates .
said book fair director volker neumann : " any chance for a dialog has to be grasped with both hands .

and algerian author assia djebar - who writes in french - would like to see a talk on the topic of language-based discrimination in arab literature .
" the literature in the arab world needs to become more pluralistic , " she said .
in 2000 , djebar won the german booksellers ' peace prize .
arab league agenda other planned topics which could prove controversial : the role of women in islam , human rights and religious tolerance .
arab league representatives say they are hoping the fair will show the arab world in all its modernity and diversity - and help rectify the biased view many westerners hold of arabs .
publishers and authors will speak out at the fair against " intellectual tyrrany " and " all forms of intellectual terrorism , " said mongi bousneina , the general director for cultural arm of the arab league .
and those in the west seem eager to open the debates .

u.s. administrator paul bremer passed the legal documentation to iraqi chief justice midhat al-mahmodi and with them the running of the war-torn country , 15 months after the invasion to remove saddam hussein . during the ceremony , bremer told the assembled officials that as " ex-administrator of the coalition provisional authority " he would " leave iraq confident in the future and confident in the ability of the government to meet the challenges of the future . "
coalition officials said bremer left iraq less than an hour after the ceremony , saying that he was " going home . " reactions from the international community on the whole were positive , with europe 's leaders among the first to offer words of support for the new government .
however , the overall feeling was one of caution . europe sends muted congratulations the german government displayed little excitement over the surprise move , simply sending its cordial greetings to the new , sovereign government in baghdad . deputy government spokesman hans-hermann langguth reported that immediately after the news broke monday morning , chancellor schröder sent a letter to the iraqi president , iyad allawi , congratulating him on his country ’ s new sovereignty .
however , langguth added that the handover of power did not mean that germany would be changing its policy on iraq . " the german envoy in baghdad has handed over a letter to the iraqi president pledging germany ’ s support in rebuilding the country , " he said .
" the chancellor also made it clear that we are prepared to give humanitarian assistance wherever possible , but that this would not include sending troops to iraq . " antje leendertse , spokeswomen for the german foreign ministry , expressed the hope that iraq could now find a respected place among the family of independent nations .
she added that the government in baghdad still faced difficult times ahead . " it ’ s clear that the next important step must be democratic elections under united nations guidance at the end of the year , " she said .
" germany will wholeheartedly support the world body in its effort to make these elections possible . " leendertse said germany ’ s willingness to contribute to the training of iraqi police and military forces , but said this was only possible outside the country . volker rühe , defense expert with the conservative opposition , said it was important to scale back the presence of foreign troops in iraq and strengthen the newly established iraqi police force .
he reiterated his opinion that the disbanding of the old iraqi army by the u.s.-led provisional authority was a major mistake which had contributed to the current security problems in iraq . in france , the reception was equally lukewarm .
french president jacques chirac had " taken note " of the transfer , but the handover was only one step in the political process there , his spokeswoman told afp on monday .
" the transfer of sovereignty is a long-awaited event , important .
it is a step in the political process that will run until 2005 , " she said .
" other steps must follow and france wishes the interim government and the iraqi people every success . " british prime minister tony blair 's spokesman told reporters that downing street welcomed the earlier-than-expected handover , saying it was an attempt to " seize the initiative " from the insurgents .
" we obviously welcome it because it 's their decision and it 's them taking control , " he said .
" what 's important now is that the iraqi people can see iraqi leaders taking charge in baghdad . " irish foreign minister brian cowen , in a statement on behalf of the eu presidency , which ireland currently holds , said that he wished iraq 's government " every success in their mission to govern iraq to the stage where free and fair elections can take place . " in poland , janusz zemke , the deputy defense minister , told reporters : " this is very good .
everything that accelerates the process of transfer of power to the iraqis and speeds up their taking of responsibility is very good .

nikolic got 45.1 percent of the vote according to independent monitors from belgrade 's cesid group . more than 6.5 million voters were eligible to cast ballots .
analysts said turnout was 48.5 percent . the presidential election was widely seen as crucial to determine whether serbia would move towards the eu and adopt western-style reforms or whether it would lapse into the nationalist isolation and diplomatic wilderness of the autocratic milosevic regime . three previous attempts to elect a president since 2002 failed because too few voters showed up at the polls .
this vote was certain to produce a president regardless of the turnout , after parliament earlier this year scrapped a 50 percent turnout requirement . " we must join the eu " tadic , who is considered popular with artists and business leaders alike , has received support from prime minister vojislav kostunica , ethnic minorities and dozens of local celebrities . the sarajevo-born psychologist and belgrade college professor had made closer ties with the west a central plank of his campaign .

tadic is also an ardent supporter of extraditing serb war crimes suspects to the u.n. war crimes tribunal in the hague , where milosevic and others are standing trial on charges related to their roles in the balkan wars in the 1990s .

nikolic got 45.1 percent of the vote according to independent monitors from belgrade 's cesid group . more than 6.5 million voters were eligible to cast ballots .
analysts said turnout was 48.5 percent . the presidential election was widely seen as crucial to determine whether serbia would move towards the eu and adopt western-style reforms or whether it would lapse into the nationalist isolation and diplomatic wilderness of the autocratic milosevic regime . three previous attempts to elect a president since 2002 failed because too few voters showed up at the polls .
this vote was certain to produce a president regardless of the turnout , after parliament earlier this year scrapped a 50 percent turnout requirement .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.06.2004 u.s. restores iraqi sovereignty ahead of schedule großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over to you : paul bremer hands back sovereignty to iraq on monday morning , paul bremer , the u.s. administrator in iraq , formally passed the reins of power to the country 's new government before leaving for the u.s. the handover took place two days earlier than planned . two days ahead of schedule , the united states has formally handed over power in iraq at a low-key ceremony in baghdad which took place at 10:26 local time -lrb- 7:26 cet -rrb- on monday morning .
u.s. administrator paul bremer passed the legal documentation to iraqi chief justice midhat al-mahmodi and with them the running of the war-torn country , 15 months after the invasion to remove saddam hussein . during the ceremony , bremer told the assembled officials that as " ex-administrator of the coalition provisional authority " he would " leave iraq confident in the future and confident in the ability of the government to meet the challenges of the future . "
coalition officials said bremer left iraq less than an hour after the ceremony , saying that he was " going home . " reactions from the international community on the whole were positive , with europe 's leaders among the first to offer words of support for the new government .
however , the overall feeling was one of caution . europe sends muted congratulations the german government displayed little excitement over the surprise move , simply sending its cordial greetings to the new , sovereign government in baghdad . deputy government spokesman hans-hermann langguth reported that immediately after the news broke monday morning , chancellor schröder sent a letter to the iraqi president , iyad allawi , congratulating him on his country ’ s new sovereignty .
however , langguth added that the handover of power did not mean that germany would be changing its policy on iraq . " the german envoy in baghdad has handed over a letter to the iraqi president pledging germany ’ s support in rebuilding the country , " he said .
" the chancellor also made it clear that we are prepared to give humanitarian assistance wherever possible , but that this would not include sending troops to iraq . " antje leendertse , spokeswomen for the german foreign ministry , expressed the hope that iraq could now find a respected place among the family of independent nations .
she added that the government in baghdad still faced difficult times ahead . " it ’ s clear that the next important step must be democratic elections under united nations guidance at the end of the year , " she said .
" germany will wholeheartedly support the world body in its effort to make these elections possible . " leendertse said germany ’ s willingness to contribute to the training of iraqi police and military forces , but said this was only possible outside the country . volker rühe , defense expert with the conservative opposition , said it was important to scale back the presence of foreign troops in iraq and strengthen the newly established iraqi police force .
he reiterated his opinion that the disbanding of the old iraqi army by the u.s.-led provisional authority was a major mistake which had contributed to the current security problems in iraq . in france , the reception was equally lukewarm .
french president jacques chirac had " taken note " of the transfer , but the handover was only one step in the political process there , his spokeswoman told afp on monday .
" the transfer of sovereignty is a long-awaited event , important .
it is a step in the political process that will run until 2005 , " she said .
" other steps must follow and france wishes the interim government and the iraqi people every success . " british prime minister tony blair 's spokesman told reporters that downing street welcomed the earlier-than-expected handover , saying it was an attempt to " seize the initiative " from the insurgents .
" we obviously welcome it because it 's their decision and it 's them taking control , " he said .
" what 's important now is that the iraqi people can see iraqi leaders taking charge in baghdad . " irish foreign minister brian cowen , in a statement on behalf of the eu presidency , which ireland currently holds , said that he wished iraq 's government " every success in their mission to govern iraq to the stage where free and fair elections can take place . " in poland , janusz zemke , the deputy defense minister , told reporters : " this is very good .
everything that accelerates the process of transfer of power to the iraqis and speeds up their taking of responsibility is very good .

u.s. administrator paul bremer passed the legal documentation to iraqi chief justice midhat al-mahmodi and with them the running of the war-torn country , 15 months after the invasion to remove saddam hussein . during the ceremony , bremer told the assembled officials that as " ex-administrator of the coalition provisional authority " he would " leave iraq confident in the future and confident in the ability of the government to meet the challenges of the future . "
coalition officials said bremer left iraq less than an hour after the ceremony , saying that he was " going home . " reactions from the international community on the whole were positive , with europe 's leaders among the first to offer words of support for the new government .
however , the overall feeling was one of caution . europe sends muted congratulations the german government displayed little excitement over the surprise move , simply sending its cordial greetings to the new , sovereign government in baghdad . deputy government spokesman hans-hermann langguth reported that immediately after the news broke monday morning , chancellor schröder sent a letter to the iraqi president , iyad allawi , congratulating him on his country ’ s new sovereignty .
however , langguth added that the handover of power did not mean that germany would be changing its policy on iraq . " the german envoy in baghdad has handed over a letter to the iraqi president pledging germany ’ s support in rebuilding the country , " he said .
" the chancellor also made it clear that we are prepared to give humanitarian assistance wherever possible , but that this would not include sending troops to iraq . " antje leendertse , spokeswomen for the german foreign ministry , expressed the hope that iraq could now find a respected place among the family of independent nations .
she added that the government in baghdad still faced difficult times ahead . " it ’ s clear that the next important step must be democratic elections under united nations guidance at the end of the year , " she said .
" germany will wholeheartedly support the world body in its effort to make these elections possible . " leendertse said germany ’ s willingness to contribute to the training of iraqi police and military forces , but said this was only possible outside the country . volker rühe , defense expert with the conservative opposition , said it was important to scale back the presence of foreign troops in iraq and strengthen the newly established iraqi police force .
he reiterated his opinion that the disbanding of the old iraqi army by the u.s.-led provisional authority was a major mistake which had contributed to the current security problems in iraq . in france , the reception was equally lukewarm .
french president jacques chirac had " taken note " of the transfer , but the handover was only one step in the political process there , his spokeswoman told afp on monday .
" the transfer of sovereignty is a long-awaited event , important .
it is a step in the political process that will run until 2005 , " she said .
" other steps must follow and france wishes the interim government and the iraqi people every success . " british prime minister tony blair 's spokesman told reporters that downing street welcomed the earlier-than-expected handover , saying it was an attempt to " seize the initiative " from the insurgents .
" we obviously welcome it because it 's their decision and it 's them taking control , " he said .
" what 's important now is that the iraqi people can see iraqi leaders taking charge in baghdad . " irish foreign minister brian cowen , in a statement on behalf of the eu presidency , which ireland currently holds , said that he wished iraq 's government " every success in their mission to govern iraq to the stage where free and fair elections can take place . " in poland , janusz zemke , the deputy defense minister , told reporters : " this is very good .

u.s. administrator paul bremer passed the legal documentation to iraqi chief justice midhat al-mahmodi and with them the running of the war-torn country , 15 months after the invasion to remove saddam hussein . during the ceremony , bremer told the assembled officials that as " ex-administrator of the coalition provisional authority " he would " leave iraq confident in the future and confident in the ability of the government to meet the challenges of the future . "
coalition officials said bremer left iraq less than an hour after the ceremony , saying that he was " going home . " reactions from the international community on the whole were positive , with europe 's leaders among the first to offer words of support for the new government .
however , the overall feeling was one of caution . europe sends muted congratulations the german government displayed little excitement over the surprise move , simply sending its cordial greetings to the new , sovereign government in baghdad . deputy government spokesman hans-hermann langguth reported that immediately after the news broke monday morning , chancellor schröder sent a letter to the iraqi president , iyad allawi , congratulating him on his country ’ s new sovereignty .
however , langguth added that the handover of power did not mean that germany would be changing its policy on iraq . " the german envoy in baghdad has handed over a letter to the iraqi president pledging germany ’ s support in rebuilding the country , " he said .
" the chancellor also made it clear that we are prepared to give humanitarian assistance wherever possible , but that this would not include sending troops to iraq . " antje leendertse , spokeswomen for the german foreign ministry , expressed the hope that iraq could now find a respected place among the family of independent nations .
she added that the government in baghdad still faced difficult times ahead . " it ’ s clear that the next important step must be democratic elections under united nations guidance at the end of the year , " she said .
" germany will wholeheartedly support the world body in its effort to make these elections possible . " leendertse said germany ’ s willingness to contribute to the training of iraqi police and military forces , but said this was only possible outside the country . volker rühe , defense expert with the conservative opposition , said it was important to scale back the presence of foreign troops in iraq and strengthen the newly established iraqi police force .
he reiterated his opinion that the disbanding of the old iraqi army by the u.s.-led provisional authority was a major mistake which had contributed to the current security problems in iraq . in france , the reception was equally lukewarm .
french president jacques chirac had " taken note " of the transfer , but the handover was only one step in the political process there , his spokeswoman told afp on monday .
" the transfer of sovereignty is a long-awaited event , important .
it is a step in the political process that will run until 2005 , " she said .
" other steps must follow and france wishes the interim government and the iraqi people every success . " british prime minister tony blair 's spokesman told reporters that downing street welcomed the earlier-than-expected handover , saying it was an attempt to " seize the initiative " from the insurgents .
" we obviously welcome it because it 's their decision and it 's them taking control , " he said .
" what 's important now is that the iraqi people can see iraqi leaders taking charge in baghdad . " irish foreign minister brian cowen , in a statement on behalf of the eu presidency , which ireland currently holds , said that he wished iraq 's government " every success in their mission to govern iraq to the stage where free and fair elections can take place . " in poland , janusz zemke , the deputy defense minister , told reporters : " this is very good .
everything that accelerates the process of transfer of power to the iraqis and speeds up their taking of responsibility is very good .

they will also discuss training of security forces in iraq .
but germany has made it clear its non-engagement pledge remains . on sunday , the 26 nato heads of state and government attended a formal dinner in an ottoman-era palace on the banks of the bosporus to thrash out an agreement on a nato role in training military and police forces for the future sovereign iraqi government . differences however remained over when , and especially where , the training is to take place .
the dispute has given german chancellor gerhard schröder another opportunity to stress that no german soldier will set a foot on iraqi soil . shortly before official talks began in istanbul on monday , the german chancellor expressed his support for attempts to bring stability and democracy to iraq .
speaking to journalists in berlin before boarding a plan to istanbul on sunday , gerhard schröder said the transatlantic row over the iraq war belonged in the history books and that all nato states were interested in improving security in iraq .
at the same time , however , he expressed his determination not to budge on his refusal to send troops to the war-torn country . training must take place in germany - chancellor " we are of course willing to participate in the training of iraqi troops if the iraqi government wants that , " he says .
" but this has to take place in training centers in germany because we stick to our position that no german troops will be sent to iraq .
in istanbul i will once again make that clear . " sixteen nato members have forces in iraq , but key members , including germany and france , have so far resisted pressure from washington to participate .
they have also thwarted the bush administration ’ s original hope of a nato-led force to take command of a peacekeeping force south of baghdad .
schröder ’ s resistance against a german troop deployment is fully backed by his junior coalition partner in the government – the greens .
greens party leader angelika beer believes that nato members won ’ t agree to the alliance 's direct participation on the ground in iraq . greens doubt european support for nato role " i expect there will be an agreement on military training but outside iraq , " she said . " there won ’ t be support for a nato role inside the country so that the controversy may linger on .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 28.06.2004 viacom snaps up german mtv rival viva großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the much-loved german music broadcaster viva has been bought by viacom mtv owner viacom last week announced it would be buying a majority stake in german rival viva media .
critics fear the buyout could crush competition in the music video market . rumors of the planned bid had been circulating for months , so it was no big surprise when u.s. media giant viacom revealed thursday that a group of 14 viva shareholders , including media conglomerates time warner inc. and vivendi universal , would be selling viacom 75.8 percent of the cologne-based music tv broadcaster 's shares , an offer supported by viva 's management .
the deal , which values viva at € 308.8 million -lrb- $ 373 million -rrb- , is viacom 's largest ever acquisition outside the united states .
bill rhoedy , president of mtv networks international , said the takeover would n't be stopping there .
viacom is now expected to make a further offer for the remaining 24.2 percent . " we want to acquire 100 percent , " he stressed in frankfurt last week .
" germany is the largest cable and satellite market in the world outside the u.s. , " he added , saying , " we believe there 's enormous potential for growth in this market and viva will help consolidate us in germany and europe . "
tom freston , viacom 's co-president , echoed his statements .
" acquiring viva is a top priority to drive mtv 's expansion in germany , " he said , emphasizing that " it 's a critical tv market globally . "
former rivals the two-step deal is by no means without its critics - first and foremost because viacom 's acquisition of loss-making viva will increase mtv 's presence in germany from two to four channels and make it the dominant force within germany 's music-television landscape .
viva first hit tv screens in 1993 , charged with challenging mtv 's hegemony by promoting the german music industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heike makatsch viva 's two channels soon cornered a market share of 3.2 percent in the target audience of 14-to-29-year-olds , beaming in to some 32 million homes .
the station gave homegrown bands such as die fantastischen vier and guano apes their breakthrough and helped launch the careers of a whole host of german celebrities , including stefan raab and heike makatsch -lrb- photo -rrb- , who recently appeared in the british hit film " love actually . "
with insiders concerned that germany 's domestic music scene will now have to take a back seat , mtv insists it will still be concentrating on local culture .
" we 're not going to just replant a u.s. brand in germany , " catherine muehlemann , manager of mtv central , told reporters .
" we want to keep our focus local . "
regulatory issues nonetheless , the deal may attract regulatory scrutiny .
according to reuters , industry sources expect major music labels and german tv channels to complain to cartel officials about the deal , arguing that it gives viacom a stronghold on which videos are broadcast as well as the related advertising market .
simon guild , deputy head of mtv networks europe , told reuters that he did not expect " material regulatory issues " but admitted the deal would have to be submitted to authorities for approval .
viacom also pointed out that the deal was subject to german merger and media ownership approvals .
shares rise viva operates two music channels in germany , while its brain pool unit produces tv shows and movies such as the hugely popular comedy shows " tv total , " " ladykracher " and " anke late night . "
it owns a 51 percent stake in its viva plus tv channel , while the rest is owned by time warner inc . , which is now selling its stake to viacom . recent years saw viva hard hit by the german advertising slump , with net tv advertising sales falling 20 percent since 2000 .
in 2003 , it posted losses of € 42 million .
but once the viacom bid was clinched , viva 's shares were up 5.3 percent at € 12.64 , trading just one cent shy of the offer price , € 12.65 a share , and hitting their highest level for almost two years .
viva stock more than doubled over the past year on speculation of a takeover , and the bid represents a 21 percent premium over its average share price over the three months before the offer .

it owns a 51 percent stake in its viva plus tv channel , while the rest is owned by time warner inc . , which is now selling its stake to viacom . recent years saw viva hard hit by the german advertising slump , with net tv advertising sales falling 20 percent since 2000 .
in 2003 , it posted losses of € 42 million .
but once the viacom bid was clinched , viva 's shares were up 5.3 percent at € 12.64 , trading just one cent shy of the offer price , € 12.65 a share , and hitting their highest level for almost two years .
viva stock more than doubled over the past year on speculation of a takeover , and the bid represents a 21 percent premium over its average share price over the three months before the offer .

serbian voters go to the polls sunday in crucial presidential elections that pit pro-eu reformer boris tadic against ultranationalist tomislav nikolic .
the result will largely determine the country 's political direction . on paper , serbia 's five-year presidency is largely ceremonial , but former president milosevic proved how effectively its few powers could be exploited . sunday 's vote could thus determine whether serbia moves closer to the eu and nato and improves relations with the west or lapses back into the chauvinism and isolation reminiscent of milosevic 's former regime . opinion polls this week gave boris tadic , a pro-europe liberal , a lead of up to 54 percent against 46 percent for tomislav nikolic , an ardent nationalist whose radical party propped up milosevic 's regime and supported his military adventures in the 1990s . but despite the lead enjoyed by tadic , analysts say that a turnout of under 40 percent could still hand the presidency to nikolic , who commands greater loyalty among his supporters . choosing between eu and belarus european union officials have warned that a victory for nikolic would diplomatically isolate serbia , whereas a win for tadic would ease relations . chris patten , the european commissioner for external affairs , said this week that serbs had a choice " between joining the european family or belarus . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tomislav nikolic , frontrunner of the ultranationalist serbian radical party .
nikolic -lrb- photo -rrb- is against serbia 's entry to the eu and any victory for him could leave serbia isolated on the international stage and scare off investors from the west . " we need the east .
russia supplies us with resources and power .
why should n't we exploit that ?
the west should help us to manufacture goods and we should sell them in the east , " nikolic said recently . championing himself as the candidate for the working class , nikolic 's strident rhetoric and calls to limit foreign trade appeal to the unemployed , which make up almost 30 percent of the country 's 7.5 million inhabitants . " serbia has opened its doors to the west , but the west has n't improved your lives .
it has n't made the factories churn out more or brought better harvests , " nikolic said . " eu will improve our lives " tadic , on the other hand , has made no bones about the fact that he 'd like to see serbia in the eu and even the nato one day .
an admirer of assassinated prime minister zoran djindjic , tadic took over the democratic party in february after djindjic 's death .
he has vowed to continue with the reform agenda started by djindjic . tadic is considered popular with business leaders , artists and women alike and has continued the policies of his pro-western predecessor , calling for open borders and greater tolerance . " we must become a member of the european union .
we must continue with these reforms , so we can join the bloc .
that would improve our lives .
without the eu , we can not overcome our problems , " tadic said . the vote could n't be further polarized with the two candidates unequivocal about where they 'd like to take serbia in the future .
opinion polls , however , show serbs to be divided , with many wanting to improve relations with the west but hostile to cooperating further with the international war crimes tribunal , which is trying a host of serbian leaders including milosevic for war crimes at the hague . tough decisions over kosovo the country also faces tough decisions over kosovo , the united nations-administered province , which belgrade insists remain part of serbia even though the majority ethnic albanian population wants independence . nikolic has called for sending security forces back to the troubled province of kosovo , inhabited mainly by ethnic albanians .
he clings to the dream of a greater serbia - saying it would be good for his people if all serbs were united . tadic , meanwhile , advocates a political solution to the future of kosovo . reform versus stagnation reporters at belgrade 's independent television station b-92 expect the election to be a watershed event for serbia .
they say if tadic wins , serbia will open up .
but if nikolic wins , serbia will turn inward , stop delivering suspected war criminals to the international criminal court in the hague , and become more isolated .
the reform process would grind to a halt . it 's a scenario that boris tadic has already laid out before the serbs .
" voters must be clear on the consequences of this election .
if nikolic wins , serbia will be isolated .
if i win , serbia will open up . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debating kosovo 's future five years after the war , kosovo remains troubled by ethnic tensions .

verheugen had gained " enormous esteem " during his first term , chancellor gerhard schröder said monday in istanbul , according to the associated press .
" it would be the wrong decision if germany nominated someone else , " he added .
schröder has been pushing for verheugen to become the first economics commissioner , a position championed by germany , but which has not yet been created .
although christian democratic party leader angela merkel has backed establishment of the new post as well as the claim that it should be filled by a german , she criticized choosing verheugen instead of a " proven expert . "
politicians from the bavarian christian social union have spoken out in favor of merkel 's deputy friedrich merz .
since 1999 , verheugen , a social democrat like schröder , has been charged with coordinating the eu expansion that took place on june 1 . more briefs 28.06.2004 -pipe- german dentist to referee euro 2004 final 28.06.2004 -pipe- economics minister threatens to quit if reforms fail 25.06.2004 -pipe- law banning headscarves " constitutional " says court 25.06.2004 -pipe- t-mobile names tour de france team 25.06.2004 -pipe- german internet domains top global porn study 25.06.2004 -pipe- ruling on former nazi officer overturned 25.06.2004 -pipe- court upholds headscarf laws 24.06.2004 -pipe- study says controversial school teaches hate radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

nikolic got 45.1 percent of the vote according to independent monitors from belgrade 's cesid group . more than 6.5 million voters were eligible to cast ballots .
analysts said turnout was 48.5 percent . the presidential election was widely seen as crucial to determine whether serbia would move towards the eu and adopt western-style reforms or whether it would lapse into the nationalist isolation and diplomatic wilderness of the autocratic milosevic regime . three previous attempts to elect a president since 2002 failed because too few voters showed up at the polls .
this vote was certain to produce a president regardless of the turnout , after parliament earlier this year scrapped a 50 percent turnout requirement .

tadic is also an ardent supporter of extraditing serb war crimes suspects to the u.n. war crimes tribunal in the hague , where milosevic and others are standing trial on charges related to their roles in the balkan wars in the 1990s .

nikolic got 45.1 percent of the vote according to independent monitors from belgrade 's cesid group . more than 6.5 million voters were eligible to cast ballots .
analysts said turnout was 48.5 percent . the presidential election was widely seen as crucial to determine whether serbia would move towards the eu and adopt western-style reforms or whether it would lapse into the nationalist isolation and diplomatic wilderness of the autocratic milosevic regime . three previous attempts to elect a president since 2002 failed because too few voters showed up at the polls .
this vote was certain to produce a president regardless of the turnout , after parliament earlier this year scrapped a 50 percent turnout requirement .

analysts said turnout was 48.5 percent . the presidential election was widely seen as crucial to determine whether serbia would move towards the eu and adopt western-style reforms or whether it would lapse into the nationalist isolation and diplomatic wilderness of the autocratic milosevic regime . three previous attempts to elect a president since 2002 failed because too few voters showed up at the polls .
this vote was certain to produce a president regardless of the turnout , after parliament earlier this year scrapped a 50 percent turnout requirement . " we must join the eu " tadic , who is considered popular with artists and business leaders alike , has received support from prime minister vojislav kostunica , ethnic minorities and dozens of local celebrities . the sarajevo-born psychologist and belgrade college professor had made closer ties with the west a central plank of his campaign .
" we must become a member of the european union .
we must continue with these reforms , so we can join the bloc .
that would improve our lives .
without the eu , we can not overcome our problems , " tadic said . tadic took over the leadership of the democratic party after the march 2003 assassination of zoran djindjic , the democrats ' leader and serbia 's first noncommunist prime minister since world war ii . he has vowed to continue with the reform agenda of his predecessor .
tadic is also an ardent supporter of extraditing serb war crimes suspects to the u.n. war crimes tribunal in the hague , where milosevic and others are standing trial on charges related to their roles in the balkan wars in the 1990s . " the west has n't improved our life " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tomislav nikolic of the ultranationalist serbian radical party .
tadic 's challenger , 52-year-old nikolic -lrb- photo -rrb- is against serbia 's entry to the eu and it was feared that any victory for him could leave serbia isolated on the international stage and scare off investors from the west . after casting his ballot in belgrade earlier in the day , nikolic predicted a tight race but said his " victory would return pride and dignity to serbia . " championing himself as the candidate for the working class , nikolic 's strident rhetoric and calls to limit foreign trade appeal to the unemployed , which make up almost 30 percent of the country 's 7.5 million inhabitants . " serbia has opened its doors to the west , but the west has n't improved your lives .
it has n't made the factories churn out more or brought better harvests , " nikolic said . nikolic has also strongly opposed western demands that belgrade extradite serbs to the hague , and had said that if he won the presidency , he would dedicate his victory to milosevic . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de serbs face clear choice in presidential polls serbian voters go to the polls sunday in crucial presidential elections that pit pro-eu reformer boris tadic against ultranationalist tomislav nikolic .

but germany has made it clear its non-engagement pledge remains . on sunday , the 26 nato heads of state and government attended a formal dinner in an ottoman-era palace on the banks of the bosporus to thrash out an agreement on a nato role in training military and police forces for the future sovereign iraqi government . differences however remained over when , and especially where , the training is to take place .
the dispute has given german chancellor gerhard schröder another opportunity to stress that no german soldier will set a foot on iraqi soil . shortly before official talks began in istanbul on monday , the german chancellor expressed his support for attempts to bring stability and democracy to iraq .
speaking to journalists in berlin before boarding a plan to istanbul on sunday , gerhard schröder said the transatlantic row over the iraq war belonged in the history books and that all nato states were interested in improving security in iraq .
at the same time , however , he expressed his determination not to budge on his refusal to send troops to the war-torn country . training must take place in germany - chancellor " we are of course willing to participate in the training of iraqi troops if the iraqi government wants that , " he says .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 28.06.2004 schröder to reiterate no troop pledge at nato iraq summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will train new recruits but not on iraqi soil , says schröder nato leaders are in istanbul for a summit aimed at repairing relations torn by the iraq war .
they will also discuss training of security forces in iraq .
but germany has made it clear its non-engagement pledge remains . on sunday , the 26 nato heads of state and government attended a formal dinner in an ottoman-era palace on the banks of the bosporus to thrash out an agreement on a nato role in training military and police forces for the future sovereign iraqi government . differences however remained over when , and especially where , the training is to take place .
the dispute has given german chancellor gerhard schröder another opportunity to stress that no german soldier will set a foot on iraqi soil . shortly before official talks began in istanbul on monday , the german chancellor expressed his support for attempts to bring stability and democracy to iraq .
speaking to journalists in berlin before boarding a plan to istanbul on sunday , gerhard schröder said the transatlantic row over the iraq war belonged in the history books and that all nato states were interested in improving security in iraq .
at the same time , however , he expressed his determination not to budge on his refusal to send troops to the war-torn country . training must take place in germany - chancellor " we are of course willing to participate in the training of iraqi troops if the iraqi government wants that , " he says .
" but this has to take place in training centers in germany because we stick to our position that no german troops will be sent to iraq .
in istanbul i will once again make that clear . " sixteen nato members have forces in iraq , but key members , including germany and france , have so far resisted pressure from washington to participate .
they have also thwarted the bush administration ’ s original hope of a nato-led force to take command of a peacekeeping force south of baghdad .
schröder ’ s resistance against a german troop deployment is fully backed by his junior coalition partner in the government – the greens .
greens party leader angelika beer believes that nato members won ’ t agree to the alliance 's direct participation on the ground in iraq . greens doubt european support for nato role " i expect there will be an agreement on military training but outside iraq , " she said . " there won ’ t be support for a nato role inside the country so that the controversy may linger on .
the european member states will make it clear again that humanitarian and training assistance is all they are willing to provide .
after all the conflicts in the entire middle east are still waiting for an answer from nato . " the wrangling over military and police training echoes nato divisions before the iraq war when france and germany blocked military assistance of the alliance to turkey , iraq ’ s neighbor .
and senior leaders of iraq ’ s interim government have expressed their dissatisfaction about the rift . hoshyar zebari , foreign minister in the iraqi government which formally assumes sovereignty on wednesday , insisted that any training must take place inside the country to be adaptable to iraqi conditions . uwe hessler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush courts turkey amid protests and violence u.s. president bush renewed calls for turkey 's eu entry as he sought to boost ties with the country in ankara on the eve of a nato summit .

but a democratic iraq is still very far away , according to peter philipp . former israeli ambassador avi primor , normally exceedingly popular in germany , elicited uncomfortable silence during a panel discussion recently when he said that you wo n't soon see real democracy in iraq and that the country might be better off with a new " strong man . " the german audience was taken down a peg in its political correctness and political wishful thinking .
though many people did n't accept george w. bush 's democratic domino theory for the middle east , since the " official " end of hostilities 14 months ago , they have became increasingly more impatient and called for a rapid democratization of iraq . such demands or even just expectations were n't exactly underpinned by experience .
the view was - and is - obscured by the unspeakable torture affair and the continual picking to pieces of even the last official reason for going to war : there were neither weapons of mass destruction nor was there an alliance between saddam hussein and international terrorists . war continues to rage on the other hand , a war is raging in iraq against the occupiers , against members of the interim government , against foreigners , against everyone who is at all involved in building a new , better iraq .
that even the united states speaks of " insurgents " bolsters the feeling that this is a war against foreign occupation which , according to international law - and emotionally more than ever - is sanctioned . it 's hardly a good starting point for a transferal of power .
even if the responsibility is officially put in the interim government 's hands , it will have an extremely difficult status .
its members will continue to be endangered .
there 's no reason to assume that the attacks will stop , attacks that only have one aim : to create terror and prevent normalization .
the suicide bombers and kidnappers are n't acting in the interests of the iraqi people , which have long been concentrated on only one issue : security . in any case , it was an exaggeration to expect the country to be democratized in a matter of a few months .
after world war ii , germany needed four years until the first free elections and ten years until sovereignty .
why should the process go faster in iraq , a country which does n't even have a history of democracy but really only of totalitarian rule ? security has priority fourteen months after the official end of hostilities , the iraqi citizen 's dream of freedom and democracy has also faded and lost ground to the simple desire for safety and survival .
the interim government will - and wants to - address those concerns : the security forces should be strengthened , old officers should be rehired , and emergency ordinances should give the government a free hand to pursue terrorists and violent criminals . such a crackdown on the violent criminals is hardly a guarantee that the security situation will improve .
if it does n't , the government 's success is put into question .
how can voters and candidates be motivated if they automatically become the targets of extremists ? elections are supposed to take place in early 2005 , but , like in afghanistan , such plans can quickly fall victim to local developments .
ultimately , there is the " classic " risk : the government must take tough action against violent criminals , but in doing so it risks deepening the abyss and suspending those freedoms that democracy is supposed to bring .
thus , june 28 is surely an important date but hardly more than the prelude to a more than problematic new period in the unfortunate history of iraq . peter philipp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. restores iraqi sovereignty ahead of schedule on monday morning , paul bremer , the u.s. administrator in iraq , formally passed the reins of power to the country 's new government before leaving for the u.s. the handover took place two days earlier than planned .

the delay in transposing eu regulation into national law in the netherlands has actually grown in the last year , according to dutch newspaper nrc handelsblad .
the dutch , who take over at the eu helm on 1 july , now lag behind in implementing around 65 eu directives - which is 15 more than one year ago .
last april , the european commission published its latest two-monthly progress reports on the implementation of eu directives in all eu member states .

the netherlands , along with 8 other member states , was taken to the european court of justice by the commission for not implementing an eu copyright directive .

the decision was taken at a highly secretive meeting in brussels involving officials from the 12 euro zone countries , the european central bank , denmark , and the three countries that had applied for erm-2 entry , according to the baltic news service .
erm-2 is often referred to as the " holding bay " for the euro .
countries wishing to join the euro must participate in erm-2 for a minimum of two years .
during these two years , the mechanism aims to ensure a stable exchange rate between the euro and the currency of the prospective euro member since currencies in erm-2 are not allowed to fluctuate by more than 15 percent against the euro .
but before joining the euro , the applicant country must fulfil other criteria , such as maintaining low inflation and a low budget deficit .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 28.06.2004 viacom snaps up german mtv rival viva großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the much-loved german music broadcaster viva has been bought by viacom mtv owner viacom last week announced it would be buying a majority stake in german rival viva media .
critics fear the buyout could crush competition in the music video market . rumors of the planned bid had been circulating for months , so it was no big surprise when u.s. media giant viacom revealed thursday that a group of 14 viva shareholders , including media conglomerates time warner inc. and vivendi universal , would be selling viacom 75.8 percent of the cologne-based music tv broadcaster 's shares , an offer supported by viva 's management .
the deal , which values viva at € 308.8 million -lrb- $ 373 million -rrb- , is viacom 's largest ever acquisition outside the united states .
bill rhoedy , president of mtv networks international , said the takeover would n't be stopping there .
viacom is now expected to make a further offer for the remaining 24.2 percent . " we want to acquire 100 percent , " he stressed in frankfurt last week .
" germany is the largest cable and satellite market in the world outside the u.s. , " he added , saying , " we believe there 's enormous potential for growth in this market and viva will help consolidate us in germany and europe . "
tom freston , viacom 's co-president , echoed his statements .
" acquiring viva is a top priority to drive mtv 's expansion in germany , " he said , emphasizing that " it 's a critical tv market globally . "
former rivals the two-step deal is by no means without its critics - first and foremost because viacom 's acquisition of loss-making viva will increase mtv 's presence in germany from two to four channels and make it the dominant force within germany 's music-television landscape .
viva first hit tv screens in 1993 , charged with challenging mtv 's hegemony by promoting the german music industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heike makatsch viva 's two channels soon cornered a market share of 3.2 percent in the target audience of 14-to-29-year-olds , beaming in to some 32 million homes .
the station gave homegrown bands such as die fantastischen vier and guano apes their breakthrough and helped launch the careers of a whole host of german celebrities , including stefan raab and heike makatsch -lrb- photo -rrb- , who recently appeared in the british hit film " love actually . "
with insiders concerned that germany 's domestic music scene will now have to take a back seat , mtv insists it will still be concentrating on local culture .
" we 're not going to just replant a u.s. brand in germany , " catherine muehlemann , manager of mtv central , told reporters .
" we want to keep our focus local . "
regulatory issues nonetheless , the deal may attract regulatory scrutiny .
according to reuters , industry sources expect major music labels and german tv channels to complain to cartel officials about the deal , arguing that it gives viacom a stronghold on which videos are broadcast as well as the related advertising market .
simon guild , deputy head of mtv networks europe , told reuters that he did not expect " material regulatory issues " but admitted the deal would have to be submitted to authorities for approval .
viacom also pointed out that the deal was subject to german merger and media ownership approvals .
shares rise viva operates two music channels in germany , while its brain pool unit produces tv shows and movies such as the hugely popular comedy shows " tv total , " " ladykracher " and " anke late night . "
it owns a 51 percent stake in its viva plus tv channel , while the rest is owned by time warner inc . , which is now selling its stake to viacom . recent years saw viva hard hit by the german advertising slump , with net tv advertising sales falling 20 percent since 2000 .
in 2003 , it posted losses of € 42 million .
but once the viacom bid was clinched , viva 's shares were up 5.3 percent at € 12.64 , trading just one cent shy of the offer price , € 12.65 a share , and hitting their highest level for almost two years .
viva stock more than doubled over the past year on speculation of a takeover , and the bid represents a 21 percent premium over its average share price over the three months before the offer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 28.06.2004 viacom snaps up german mtv rival viva großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the much-loved german music broadcaster viva has been bought by viacom mtv owner viacom last week announced it would be buying a majority stake in german rival viva media .
critics fear the buyout could crush competition in the music video market . rumors of the planned bid had been circulating for months , so it was no big surprise when u.s. media giant viacom revealed thursday that a group of 14 viva shareholders , including media conglomerates time warner inc. and vivendi universal , would be selling viacom 75.8 percent of the cologne-based music tv broadcaster 's shares , an offer supported by viva 's management .
the deal , which values viva at € 308.8 million -lrb- $ 373 million -rrb- , is viacom 's largest ever acquisition outside the united states .
bill rhoedy , president of mtv networks international , said the takeover would n't be stopping there .
viacom is now expected to make a further offer for the remaining 24.2 percent . " we want to acquire 100 percent , " he stressed in frankfurt last week .
" germany is the largest cable and satellite market in the world outside the u.s. , " he added , saying , " we believe there 's enormous potential for growth in this market and viva will help consolidate us in germany and europe . "
tom freston , viacom 's co-president , echoed his statements .
" acquiring viva is a top priority to drive mtv 's expansion in germany , " he said , emphasizing that " it 's a critical tv market globally . "
former rivals the two-step deal is by no means without its critics - first and foremost because viacom 's acquisition of loss-making viva will increase mtv 's presence in germany from two to four channels and make it the dominant force within germany 's music-television landscape .
viva first hit tv screens in 1993 , charged with challenging mtv 's hegemony by promoting the german music industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heike makatsch viva 's two channels soon cornered a market share of 3.2 percent in the target audience of 14-to-29-year-olds , beaming in to some 32 million homes .
the station gave homegrown bands such as die fantastischen vier and guano apes their breakthrough and helped launch the careers of a whole host of german celebrities , including stefan raab and heike makatsch -lrb- photo -rrb- , who recently appeared in the british hit film " love actually . "
with insiders concerned that germany 's domestic music scene will now have to take a back seat , mtv insists it will still be concentrating on local culture .
" we 're not going to just replant a u.s. brand in germany , " catherine muehlemann , manager of mtv central , told reporters .
" we want to keep our focus local . "
regulatory issues nonetheless , the deal may attract regulatory scrutiny .
according to reuters , industry sources expect major music labels and german tv channels to complain to cartel officials about the deal , arguing that it gives viacom a stronghold on which videos are broadcast as well as the related advertising market .
simon guild , deputy head of mtv networks europe , told reuters that he did not expect " material regulatory issues " but admitted the deal would have to be submitted to authorities for approval .
viacom also pointed out that the deal was subject to german merger and media ownership approvals .
shares rise viva operates two music channels in germany , while its brain pool unit produces tv shows and movies such as the hugely popular comedy shows " tv total , " " ladykracher " and " anke late night . "
it owns a 51 percent stake in its viva plus tv channel , while the rest is owned by time warner inc . , which is now selling its stake to viacom . recent years saw viva hard hit by the german advertising slump , with net tv advertising sales falling 20 percent since 2000 .
in 2003 , it posted losses of € 42 million .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 28.06.2004 viacom snaps up german mtv rival viva großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the much-loved german music broadcaster viva has been bought by viacom mtv owner viacom last week announced it would be buying a majority stake in german rival viva media .
critics fear the buyout could crush competition in the music video market . rumors of the planned bid had been circulating for months , so it was no big surprise when u.s. media giant viacom revealed thursday that a group of 14 viva shareholders , including media conglomerates time warner inc. and vivendi universal , would be selling viacom 75.8 percent of the cologne-based music tv broadcaster 's shares , an offer supported by viva 's management .
the deal , which values viva at € 308.8 million -lrb- $ 373 million -rrb- , is viacom 's largest ever acquisition outside the united states .
bill rhoedy , president of mtv networks international , said the takeover would n't be stopping there .
viacom is now expected to make a further offer for the remaining 24.2 percent . " we want to acquire 100 percent , " he stressed in frankfurt last week .
" germany is the largest cable and satellite market in the world outside the u.s. , " he added , saying , " we believe there 's enormous potential for growth in this market and viva will help consolidate us in germany and europe . "
tom freston , viacom 's co-president , echoed his statements .
" acquiring viva is a top priority to drive mtv 's expansion in germany , " he said , emphasizing that " it 's a critical tv market globally . "
former rivals the two-step deal is by no means without its critics - first and foremost because viacom 's acquisition of loss-making viva will increase mtv 's presence in germany from two to four channels and make it the dominant force within germany 's music-television landscape .
viva first hit tv screens in 1993 , charged with challenging mtv 's hegemony by promoting the german music industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heike makatsch viva 's two channels soon cornered a market share of 3.2 percent in the target audience of 14-to-29-year-olds , beaming in to some 32 million homes .
the station gave homegrown bands such as die fantastischen vier and guano apes their breakthrough and helped launch the careers of a whole host of german celebrities , including stefan raab and heike makatsch -lrb- photo -rrb- , who recently appeared in the british hit film " love actually . "
with insiders concerned that germany 's domestic music scene will now have to take a back seat , mtv insists it will still be concentrating on local culture .
" we 're not going to just replant a u.s. brand in germany , " catherine muehlemann , manager of mtv central , told reporters .
" we want to keep our focus local . "
regulatory issues nonetheless , the deal may attract regulatory scrutiny .
according to reuters , industry sources expect major music labels and german tv channels to complain to cartel officials about the deal , arguing that it gives viacom a stronghold on which videos are broadcast as well as the related advertising market .
simon guild , deputy head of mtv networks europe , told reuters that he did not expect " material regulatory issues " but admitted the deal would have to be submitted to authorities for approval .
viacom also pointed out that the deal was subject to german merger and media ownership approvals .
shares rise viva operates two music channels in germany , while its brain pool unit produces tv shows and movies such as the hugely popular comedy shows " tv total , " " ladykracher " and " anke late night . "
it owns a 51 percent stake in its viva plus tv channel , while the rest is owned by time warner inc . , which is now selling its stake to viacom . recent years saw viva hard hit by the german advertising slump , with net tv advertising sales falling 20 percent since 2000 .
in 2003 , it posted losses of € 42 million .
but once the viacom bid was clinched , viva 's shares were up 5.3 percent at € 12.64 , trading just one cent shy of the offer price , € 12.65 a share , and hitting their highest level for almost two years .
viva stock more than doubled over the past year on speculation of a takeover , and the bid represents a 21 percent premium over its average share price over the three months before the offer .

u.s. administrator paul bremer passed the legal documentation to iraqi chief justice midhat al-mahmodi and with them the running of the war-torn country , 15 months after the invasion to remove saddam hussein . during the ceremony , bremer told the assembled officials that as " ex-administrator of the coalition provisional authority " he would " leave iraq confident in the future and confident in the ability of the government to meet the challenges of the future . "
coalition officials said bremer left iraq less than an hour after the ceremony , saying that he was " going home . " reactions from the international community on the whole were positive , with europe 's leaders among the first to offer words of support for the new government .
however , the overall feeling was one of caution . europe sends muted congratulations the german government displayed little excitement over the surprise move , simply sending its cordial greetings to the new , sovereign government in baghdad . deputy government spokesman hans-hermann langguth reported that immediately after the news broke monday morning , chancellor schröder sent a letter to the iraqi president , iyad allawi , congratulating him on his country ’ s new sovereignty .
however , langguth added that the handover of power did not mean that germany would be changing its policy on iraq . " the german envoy in baghdad has handed over a letter to the iraqi president pledging germany ’ s support in rebuilding the country , " he said .
" the chancellor also made it clear that we are prepared to give humanitarian assistance wherever possible , but that this would not include sending troops to iraq . " antje leendertse , spokeswomen for the german foreign ministry , expressed the hope that iraq could now find a respected place among the family of independent nations .
she added that the government in baghdad still faced difficult times ahead . " it ’ s clear that the next important step must be democratic elections under united nations guidance at the end of the year , " she said .
" germany will wholeheartedly support the world body in its effort to make these elections possible . " leendertse said germany ’ s willingness to contribute to the training of iraqi police and military forces , but said this was only possible outside the country . volker rühe , defense expert with the conservative opposition , said it was important to scale back the presence of foreign troops in iraq and strengthen the newly established iraqi police force .
he reiterated his opinion that the disbanding of the old iraqi army by the u.s.-led provisional authority was a major mistake which had contributed to the current security problems in iraq . in france , the reception was equally lukewarm .
french president jacques chirac had " taken note " of the transfer , but the handover was only one step in the political process there , his spokeswoman told afp on monday .
" the transfer of sovereignty is a long-awaited event , important .
it is a step in the political process that will run until 2005 , " she said .
" other steps must follow and france wishes the interim government and the iraqi people every success . " british prime minister tony blair 's spokesman told reporters that downing street welcomed the earlier-than-expected handover , saying it was an attempt to " seize the initiative " from the insurgents .
" we obviously welcome it because it 's their decision and it 's them taking control , " he said .
" what 's important now is that the iraqi people can see iraqi leaders taking charge in baghdad . " irish foreign minister brian cowen , in a statement on behalf of the eu presidency , which ireland currently holds , said that he wished iraq 's government " every success in their mission to govern iraq to the stage where free and fair elections can take place . " in poland , janusz zemke , the deputy defense minister , told reporters : " this is very good .

however , the overall feeling was one of caution . europe sends muted congratulations the german government displayed little excitement over the surprise move , simply sending its cordial greetings to the new , sovereign government in baghdad . deputy government spokesman hans-hermann langguth reported that immediately after the news broke monday morning , chancellor schröder sent a letter to the iraqi president , iyad allawi , congratulating him on his country ’ s new sovereignty .
however , langguth added that the handover of power did not mean that germany would be changing its policy on iraq . " the german envoy in baghdad has handed over a letter to the iraqi president pledging germany ’ s support in rebuilding the country , " he said .
" the chancellor also made it clear that we are prepared to give humanitarian assistance wherever possible , but that this would not include sending troops to iraq . " antje leendertse , spokeswomen for the german foreign ministry , expressed the hope that iraq could now find a respected place among the family of independent nations .
she added that the government in baghdad still faced difficult times ahead . " it ’ s clear that the next important step must be democratic elections under united nations guidance at the end of the year , " she said .
" germany will wholeheartedly support the world body in its effort to make these elections possible . " leendertse said germany ’ s willingness to contribute to the training of iraqi police and military forces , but said this was only possible outside the country . volker rühe , defense expert with the conservative opposition , said it was important to scale back the presence of foreign troops in iraq and strengthen the newly established iraqi police force .
he reiterated his opinion that the disbanding of the old iraqi army by the u.s.-led provisional authority was a major mistake which had contributed to the current security problems in iraq . in france , the reception was equally lukewarm .
french president jacques chirac had " taken note " of the transfer , but the handover was only one step in the political process there , his spokeswoman told afp on monday .
" the transfer of sovereignty is a long-awaited event , important .
it is a step in the political process that will run until 2005 , " she said .
" other steps must follow and france wishes the interim government and the iraqi people every success . " british prime minister tony blair 's spokesman told reporters that downing street welcomed the earlier-than-expected handover , saying it was an attempt to " seize the initiative " from the insurgents .
" we obviously welcome it because it 's their decision and it 's them taking control , " he said .
" what 's important now is that the iraqi people can see iraqi leaders taking charge in baghdad . " irish foreign minister brian cowen , in a statement on behalf of the eu presidency , which ireland currently holds , said that he wished iraq 's government " every success in their mission to govern iraq to the stage where free and fair elections can take place .

u.s. administrator paul bremer passed the legal documentation to iraqi chief justice midhat al-mahmodi and with them the running of the war-torn country , 15 months after the invasion to remove saddam hussein . during the ceremony , bremer told the assembled officials that as " ex-administrator of the coalition provisional authority " he would " leave iraq confident in the future and confident in the ability of the government to meet the challenges of the future . "
coalition officials said bremer left iraq less than an hour after the ceremony , saying that he was " going home . " reactions from the international community on the whole were positive , with europe 's leaders among the first to offer words of support for the new government .
however , the overall feeling was one of caution . europe sends muted congratulations the german government displayed little excitement over the surprise move , simply sending its cordial greetings to the new , sovereign government in baghdad . deputy government spokesman hans-hermann langguth reported that immediately after the news broke monday morning , chancellor schröder sent a letter to the iraqi president , iyad allawi , congratulating him on his country ’ s new sovereignty .
however , langguth added that the handover of power did not mean that germany would be changing its policy on iraq . " the german envoy in baghdad has handed over a letter to the iraqi president pledging germany ’ s support in rebuilding the country , " he said .
" the chancellor also made it clear that we are prepared to give humanitarian assistance wherever possible , but that this would not include sending troops to iraq . " antje leendertse , spokeswomen for the german foreign ministry , expressed the hope that iraq could now find a respected place among the family of independent nations .
she added that the government in baghdad still faced difficult times ahead . " it ’ s clear that the next important step must be democratic elections under united nations guidance at the end of the year , " she said .
" germany will wholeheartedly support the world body in its effort to make these elections possible . " leendertse said germany ’ s willingness to contribute to the training of iraqi police and military forces , but said this was only possible outside the country . volker rühe , defense expert with the conservative opposition , said it was important to scale back the presence of foreign troops in iraq and strengthen the newly established iraqi police force .
he reiterated his opinion that the disbanding of the old iraqi army by the u.s.-led provisional authority was a major mistake which had contributed to the current security problems in iraq . in france , the reception was equally lukewarm .
french president jacques chirac had " taken note " of the transfer , but the handover was only one step in the political process there , his spokeswoman told afp on monday .
" the transfer of sovereignty is a long-awaited event , important .
it is a step in the political process that will run until 2005 , " she said .
" other steps must follow and france wishes the interim government and the iraqi people every success . " british prime minister tony blair 's spokesman told reporters that downing street welcomed the earlier-than-expected handover , saying it was an attempt to " seize the initiative " from the insurgents .
" we obviously welcome it because it 's their decision and it 's them taking control , " he said .
" what 's important now is that the iraqi people can see iraqi leaders taking charge in baghdad . " irish foreign minister brian cowen , in a statement on behalf of the eu presidency , which ireland currently holds , said that he wished iraq 's government " every success in their mission to govern iraq to the stage where free and fair elections can take place .

can literature and commerce do the job ? the organizers of the frankfurt book fair are set to find out in october , when the arab world makes its debut as guest of honor as the world 's largest publishing trade fair opens its doors in october .
despite the difficulties of organizing such an event while arab-western relations are in a state of crisis , authors or booksellers from 17 of 22 nations in the arab league will officially attend -lrb- absent are algeria , morocco , libya , kuwait and iraq . -rrb-
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt book fair poster , 2004 still , authors from these countries are nonetheless represented , arab league representative mohamed ghoneim stressed .
some 200 publishers 150 authors are expected to give readings , lead discussions , and otherwise take part in the program .
for many , the fair offers a chance to break through to a larger market .
the choice to feature the arab world at the book fair was interesting but inherently difficult , organizers say - if only because so many different countries are involved .
despite common roots , the region is plagued by unresolved , divisive political issues , such as the near east conflict and the iraq war .
" would a german author bother worrying about a book fair when dresden is being bombed ? " wondered egyptian novelist sonallah ibrahim .
hot debate but despite the diversity of countries that have been invited , it makes sense to have them all as the focus of the fair together , since the output of literary texts in individual countries is often small -lrb- the trade in religious texts is much stronger . -rrb-
more than likely , some of planned discussions will turn into hot debates .
scandal is far from unheard of in arab literary circles .
for example , sonallah ibrahim caused an uproar when he turned down a coveted egyptian literary prize at the cairo opera house , citing oppression of the egyption people by the government as his grounds .
and algerian author assia djebar - who writes in french - would like to see a talk on the topic of language-based discrimination in arab literature .
" the literature in the arab world needs to become more pluralistic , " she said .
in 2000 , djebar won the german booksellers ' peace prize .
arab league agenda other planned topics which could prove controversial : the role of women in islam , human rights and religious tolerance .
arab league representatives say they are hoping the fair will show the arab world in all its modernity and diversity - and help rectify the biased view many westerners hold of arabs .
publishers and authors will speak out at the fair against " intellectual tyrrany " and " all forms of intellectual terrorism , " said mongi bousneina , the general director for cultural arm of the arab league .
and those in the west seem eager to open the debates .
said book fair director volker neumann : " any chance for a dialog has to be grasped with both hands .

serbian voters go to the polls sunday in crucial presidential elections that pit pro-eu reformer boris tadic against ultranationalist tomislav nikolic .
the result will largely determine the country 's political direction . on paper , serbia 's five-year presidency is largely ceremonial , but former president milosevic proved how effectively its few powers could be exploited . sunday 's vote could thus determine whether serbia moves closer to the eu and nato and improves relations with the west or lapses back into the chauvinism and isolation reminiscent of milosevic 's former regime . opinion polls this week gave boris tadic , a pro-europe liberal , a lead of up to 54 percent against 46 percent for tomislav nikolic , an ardent nationalist whose radical party propped up milosevic 's regime and supported his military adventures in the 1990s . but despite the lead enjoyed by tadic , analysts say that a turnout of under 40 percent could still hand the presidency to nikolic , who commands greater loyalty among his supporters . choosing between eu and belarus european union officials have warned that a victory for nikolic would diplomatically isolate serbia , whereas a win for tadic would ease relations . chris patten , the european commissioner for external affairs , said this week that serbs had a choice " between joining the european family or belarus . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tomislav nikolic , frontrunner of the ultranationalist serbian radical party .
nikolic -lrb- photo -rrb- is against serbia 's entry to the eu and any victory for him could leave serbia isolated on the international stage and scare off investors from the west . " we need the east .
russia supplies us with resources and power .
why should n't we exploit that ?
the west should help us to manufacture goods and we should sell them in the east , " nikolic said recently . championing himself as the candidate for the working class , nikolic 's strident rhetoric and calls to limit foreign trade appeal to the unemployed , which make up almost 30 percent of the country 's 7.5 million inhabitants . " serbia has opened its doors to the west , but the west has n't improved your lives .
it has n't made the factories churn out more or brought better harvests , " nikolic said . " eu will improve our lives " tadic , on the other hand , has made no bones about the fact that he 'd like to see serbia in the eu and even the nato one day .
an admirer of assassinated prime minister zoran djindjic , tadic took over the democratic party in february after djindjic 's death .
he has vowed to continue with the reform agenda started by djindjic . tadic is considered popular with business leaders , artists and women alike and has continued the policies of his pro-western predecessor , calling for open borders and greater tolerance . " we must become a member of the european union .
we must continue with these reforms , so we can join the bloc .
that would improve our lives .
without the eu , we can not overcome our problems , " tadic said . the vote could n't be further polarized with the two candidates unequivocal about where they 'd like to take serbia in the future .
opinion polls , however , show serbs to be divided , with many wanting to improve relations with the west but hostile to cooperating further with the international war crimes tribunal , which is trying a host of serbian leaders including milosevic for war crimes at the hague . tough decisions over kosovo the country also faces tough decisions over kosovo , the united nations-administered province , which belgrade insists remain part of serbia even though the majority ethnic albanian population wants independence . nikolic has called for sending security forces back to the troubled province of kosovo , inhabited mainly by ethnic albanians .
he clings to the dream of a greater serbia - saying it would be good for his people if all serbs were united . tadic , meanwhile , advocates a political solution to the future of kosovo . reform versus stagnation reporters at belgrade 's independent television station b-92 expect the election to be a watershed event for serbia .
they say if tadic wins , serbia will open up .
but if nikolic wins , serbia will turn inward , stop delivering suspected war criminals to the international criminal court in the hague , and become more isolated .
the reform process would grind to a halt . it 's a scenario that boris tadic has already laid out before the serbs .
" voters must be clear on the consequences of this election .

if i win , serbia will open up . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debating kosovo 's future five years after the war , kosovo remains troubled by ethnic tensions .

portuguese prime minister durao barroso is expected to fill a position with prerequisites few candidates can satisfy . irish prime minister bertie ahern , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said sunday he would propose portuguese prime minister jose manuel durao barroso for the eu 's top job at a special bloc summit set for tuesday evening . ahern said there was " overwhelming support " for durao barroso .
german chancellor gerhard schröder stressed sunday that durao barroso " could count on germany 's support , " and british prime minister tony blair said he was certain barroso " would do an outstanding job " and that he hoped he would " be able to accept the challenge , " the associated press reported . so far durao barroso has n't commented on taking over the reins from outgoing eu commission president romano prodi .
assuming he does so though , portugal will be faced with the challenge figuring out what to do next , since the country has no clear rules for how to replace him . shifting allegiances in his youth , as a law student under the portuguese dictatorship , durao barroso was a marxist activist , but already at age 20 , his allegiances shifted towards the political center .
durao barroso completed his law degree in lisbon and studied political science in geneva and new york .
at 29 , after returning from the united states , he was elected to parliament .
the following year he was appointed state secretary and later , at 36 , foreign minister . when his party , the conservative liberal social democrats -lrb- psd -rrb- , was voted out of office in 1995 , durao barroso bridged the time back in the united states teaching at georgetown university in washington .
but he returned to portugal and worked his way up in the psd .
his time finally came in march 2002 , when the party , with durao barroso at its helm , - barely - won early elections called after socialist prime minister antonio guterres resigned over poor local election returns . durao barroso worked closely with former spanish prime minister jose maria aznar , and hosted a meeting between aznar , u.s. president george w. bush and british prime minister blair on the azores in march 2003 that cemented the four countries ' decision to cooperate in the iraq war .
portugal still has 120 police deployed in iraq , which durao barroso recently refused to withdraw . horse-trading the " horse-trading " over who would fill the top eu post has been going on intensely since an eu leaders failed to agree on a candidate at a summit in mid-june .
france and germany insisted that the commission head be from a country that fully participates in all eu initiatives , which ruled out britain 's chris patten , since his country is not part of the single currency .
britain had already succeeded in blocking germany 's choice , belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt , partly because he was considered too critical of u.s. foreign policy . france was adamant that the eu president should speak french .
the conservative-liberal european people 's party , the largest political group in the european parliament , demanded a candidate from the center-right .
others pressed for a politician experienced in the highest government levels .
still others asserted that the right person for the job should be from a smaller eu country . in the end , the 48-year-old portuguese prime minister fits all the requirements .
and besides french , he also speaks english and spanish .
unless durao barroso 's nomination is accepted by all 25 eu heads of state on tuesday , the european parliament will have to vote on whether to appoint him , which could happen as early as mid-july .
he would almost certainly be approved by the conservative-liberal dominated parliament .
he would take office in november . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de portugal hopes for euro economic bonus when portugal hosts this year 's european championship this summer , thousands of visiting soccer fans will spend plenty of euros .

portuguese prime minister durao barroso is expected to fill a position with prerequisites few candidates can satisfy . irish prime minister bertie ahern , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said sunday he would propose portuguese prime minister jose manuel durao barroso for the eu 's top job at a special bloc summit set for tuesday evening . ahern said there was " overwhelming support " for durao barroso .
german chancellor gerhard schröder stressed sunday that durao barroso " could count on germany 's support , " and british prime minister tony blair said he was certain barroso " would do an outstanding job " and that he hoped he would " be able to accept the challenge , " the associated press reported . so far durao barroso has n't commented on taking over the reins from outgoing eu commission president romano prodi .
assuming he does so though , portugal will be faced with the challenge figuring out what to do next , since the country has no clear rules for how to replace him . shifting allegiances in his youth , as a law student under the portuguese dictatorship , durao barroso was a marxist activist , but already at age 20 , his allegiances shifted towards the political center .
durao barroso completed his law degree in lisbon and studied political science in geneva and new york .
at 29 , after returning from the united states , he was elected to parliament .
the following year he was appointed state secretary and later , at 36 , foreign minister . when his party , the conservative liberal social democrats -lrb- psd -rrb- , was voted out of office in 1995 , durao barroso bridged the time back in the united states teaching at georgetown university in washington .
but he returned to portugal and worked his way up in the psd .
his time finally came in march 2002 , when the party , with durao barroso at its helm , - barely - won early elections called after socialist prime minister antonio guterres resigned over poor local election returns . durao barroso worked closely with former spanish prime minister jose maria aznar , and hosted a meeting between aznar , u.s. president george w. bush and british prime minister blair on the azores in march 2003 that cemented the four countries ' decision to cooperate in the iraq war .
portugal still has 120 police deployed in iraq , which durao barroso recently refused to withdraw . horse-trading the " horse-trading " over who would fill the top eu post has been going on intensely since an eu leaders failed to agree on a candidate at a summit in mid-june .
france and germany insisted that the commission head be from a country that fully participates in all eu initiatives , which ruled out britain 's chris patten , since his country is not part of the single currency .
britain had already succeeded in blocking germany 's choice , belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt , partly because he was considered too critical of u.s. foreign policy . france was adamant that the eu president should speak french .
the conservative-liberal european people 's party , the largest political group in the european parliament , demanded a candidate from the center-right .
others pressed for a politician experienced in the highest government levels .
still others asserted that the right person for the job should be from a smaller eu country . in the end , the 48-year-old portuguese prime minister fits all the requirements .
and besides french , he also speaks english and spanish .
unless durao barroso 's nomination is accepted by all 25 eu heads of state on tuesday , the european parliament will have to vote on whether to appoint him , which could happen as early as mid-july .
he would almost certainly be approved by the conservative-liberal dominated parliament .
he would take office in november . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de portugal hopes for euro economic bonus when portugal hosts this year 's european championship this summer , thousands of visiting soccer fans will spend plenty of euros .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.06.2004 portuguese prime minister likely to head eu commission großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : probably the next eu commission president : durao barroso the search for a new european commission president seems finally to have come to an end .
portuguese prime minister durao barroso is expected to fill a position with prerequisites few candidates can satisfy . irish prime minister bertie ahern , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said sunday he would propose portuguese prime minister jose manuel durao barroso for the eu 's top job at a special bloc summit set for tuesday evening . ahern said there was " overwhelming support " for durao barroso .
german chancellor gerhard schröder stressed sunday that durao barroso " could count on germany 's support , " and british prime minister tony blair said he was certain barroso " would do an outstanding job " and that he hoped he would " be able to accept the challenge , " the associated press reported . so far durao barroso has n't commented on taking over the reins from outgoing eu commission president romano prodi .
assuming he does so though , portugal will be faced with the challenge figuring out what to do next , since the country has no clear rules for how to replace him . shifting allegiances in his youth , as a law student under the portuguese dictatorship , durao barroso was a marxist activist , but already at age 20 , his allegiances shifted towards the political center .
durao barroso completed his law degree in lisbon and studied political science in geneva and new york .
at 29 , after returning from the united states , he was elected to parliament .
the following year he was appointed state secretary and later , at 36 , foreign minister . when his party , the conservative liberal social democrats -lrb- psd -rrb- , was voted out of office in 1995 , durao barroso bridged the time back in the united states teaching at georgetown university in washington .
but he returned to portugal and worked his way up in the psd .
his time finally came in march 2002 , when the party , with durao barroso at its helm , - barely - won early elections called after socialist prime minister antonio guterres resigned over poor local election returns . durao barroso worked closely with former spanish prime minister jose maria aznar , and hosted a meeting between aznar , u.s. president george w. bush and british prime minister blair on the azores in march 2003 that cemented the four countries ' decision to cooperate in the iraq war .
portugal still has 120 police deployed in iraq , which durao barroso recently refused to withdraw . horse-trading the " horse-trading " over who would fill the top eu post has been going on intensely since an eu leaders failed to agree on a candidate at a summit in mid-june .
france and germany insisted that the commission head be from a country that fully participates in all eu initiatives , which ruled out britain 's chris patten , since his country is not part of the single currency .
britain had already succeeded in blocking germany 's choice , belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt , partly because he was considered too critical of u.s. foreign policy . france was adamant that the eu president should speak french .
the conservative-liberal european people 's party , the largest political group in the european parliament , demanded a candidate from the center-right .
others pressed for a politician experienced in the highest government levels .
still others asserted that the right person for the job should be from a smaller eu country . in the end , the 48-year-old portuguese prime minister fits all the requirements .
and besides french , he also speaks english and spanish .
unless durao barroso 's nomination is accepted by all 25 eu heads of state on tuesday , the european parliament will have to vote on whether to appoint him , which could happen as early as mid-july .
he would almost certainly be approved by the conservative-liberal dominated parliament .

as once strong relations between germany 's unions and the ruling social democrats plunge to new lows , one of the labor movement 's most-powerful leaders threatens to withdraw his support for chancellor gerhard schröder . frank bsirske , head of the german public sector union ver.di , infuriated the coalition government of social democrats and greens over the weekend by telling the newspaper welt am sonntag that chancellor gerhard schröder 's social and economic reform policy has been a huge failure .
" measured against his claim that he would create jobs , reduce joblessness and pep up the economy , gerhard schröder has been a failure , " bsirske told the paper .
bsirske acknowledged that cuts to the country 's generous social welfare system were needed to keep it afloat , while at the same time making the allegation that the government 's policy had by no means led to better employment opportunities in the country .
economic growth rates remain at well below 1 percent this year after three years of total stagnation .
move could hurt social democrats for bsirske 's part , the move was calculated .
himself a member of the green party , he knows his criticism will primarily hurt the social democrats .
the spd 's popularity has fallen to an unparalleled low in recent months , while the greens have recorded major gains in regional elections despite the fact that , as the spd 's junior coalition partner , they are also responsible for germany 's current social and economic policies .
bsirske , as well as other union leaders , are hoping to strengthen the rebellious left-wingers within the spd - many of whom harbor nagging doubts about the political reorientation of their party , which has traditionally represented the interests of the underprivileged in society .
schröder : i 'm not budging for his part , schröder told the newsweekly der spiegel that the " unions need to abandon their abstract considerations instead ask concrete questions in their companies . "
schröder said the unions should focus on what 's really best for their workers .
the chancellor also categorically refused to make any additional change to his labor reform laws .
" i 'm not going to do any more snipping , " he said , referring to his agenda 2010 reform plan .
green party chief reinhard bütikofer did what was expected of him and dismissed bsirske ’ s criticism as " unfounded " and " unconstructive . "
and deputy spd chief kurt beck brushed off bsirske ’ s demand for a change of course in the reform process as " nonsense . "
" a change of course – what ’ s that supposed to mean ? "
beck asked .
" weren ’ t we all agreed that considering our own demographic problems and global developments our social system has to be changed in order to survive at all ?
and weren ’ t we all agreed that the necessary reforms could not be carried out without sacrifices ?
so i don ’ t really understand why some are now calling on the government to revise its policy .
we don ’ t have the right to change our course , because we were elected to do the things that are necessary for germany to become competitive again . "
row to enter new round the row between the government and the trade unions is expected to enter yet another round on wednesday , when an inter-parliamentary arbitration committee is scheduled to agree on the details of combining germany 's welfare and unemployment benefits starting next year .
the move is expected to create even greater hardships for the economically disadvantaged .
" it looks as if there is no capacity and no mechanisms in place to make job placement procedures more efficient as of jan .
1 of next year , " said hermann-joseph ahrentz , the social affairs spokesman for the conservative opposition christian democratic union .
" but since long-term unemployed people will get fewer benefits under the new plan , they should at least have the opportunity to find work more easily .
but i can ’ t see this happening .
this is why the government ’ s policy can only be described as a rush job and a patchwork , and as socially unjust , since it hits the poor and underprivileged once again . "
a conundrum for the spd 's base an editorial in the monday issue of the financial times deutschland newspaper concluded that the spat between unions and the spd is making it impossible for core social democrat voters to maintain their loyalty to both their party and the trade unions .
both are complaining about dwindling membership .
bsirske and his colleagues are well aware that with a conservative government at the helm in 2006 the unions are even less likely to strike a deal for softer reforms .
but the unions may have another strategy altogether .

as once strong relations between germany 's unions and the ruling social democrats plunge to new lows , one of the labor movement 's most-powerful leaders threatens to withdraw his support for chancellor gerhard schröder . frank bsirske , head of the german public sector union ver.di , infuriated the coalition government of social democrats and greens over the weekend by telling the newspaper welt am sonntag that chancellor gerhard schröder 's social and economic reform policy has been a huge failure .
" measured against his claim that he would create jobs , reduce joblessness and pep up the economy , gerhard schröder has been a failure , " bsirske told the paper .
bsirske acknowledged that cuts to the country 's generous social welfare system were needed to keep it afloat , while at the same time making the allegation that the government 's policy had by no means led to better employment opportunities in the country .
economic growth rates remain at well below 1 percent this year after three years of total stagnation .
move could hurt social democrats for bsirske 's part , the move was calculated .
himself a member of the green party , he knows his criticism will primarily hurt the social democrats .
the spd 's popularity has fallen to an unparalleled low in recent months , while the greens have recorded major gains in regional elections despite the fact that , as the spd 's junior coalition partner , they are also responsible for germany 's current social and economic policies .
bsirske , as well as other union leaders , are hoping to strengthen the rebellious left-wingers within the spd - many of whom harbor nagging doubts about the political reorientation of their party , which has traditionally represented the interests of the underprivileged in society .
schröder : i 'm not budging for his part , schröder told the newsweekly der spiegel that the " unions need to abandon their abstract considerations instead ask concrete questions in their companies . "
schröder said the unions should focus on what 's really best for their workers .
the chancellor also categorically refused to make any additional change to his labor reform laws .
" i 'm not going to do any more snipping , " he said , referring to his agenda 2010 reform plan .
green party chief reinhard bütikofer did what was expected of him and dismissed bsirske ’ s criticism as " unfounded " and " unconstructive . "
and deputy spd chief kurt beck brushed off bsirske ’ s demand for a change of course in the reform process as " nonsense . "
" a change of course – what ’ s that supposed to mean ? "
beck asked .
" weren ’ t we all agreed that considering our own demographic problems and global developments our social system has to be changed in order to survive at all ?
and weren ’ t we all agreed that the necessary reforms could not be carried out without sacrifices ?

and deputy spd chief kurt beck brushed off bsirske ’ s demand for a change of course in the reform process as " nonsense . "
" a change of course – what ’ s that supposed to mean ? "
beck asked .
" weren ’ t we all agreed that considering our own demographic problems and global developments our social system has to be changed in order to survive at all ?
and weren ’ t we all agreed that the necessary reforms could not be carried out without sacrifices ?
so i don ’ t really understand why some are now calling on the government to revise its policy .
we don ’ t have the right to change our course , because we were elected to do the things that are necessary for germany to become competitive again . "
row to enter new round the row between the government and the trade unions is expected to enter yet another round on wednesday , when an inter-parliamentary arbitration committee is scheduled to agree on the details of combining germany 's welfare and unemployment benefits starting next year .
the move is expected to create even greater hardships for the economically disadvantaged .
" it looks as if there is no capacity and no mechanisms in place to make job placement procedures more efficient as of jan .
1 of next year , " said hermann-joseph ahrentz , the social affairs spokesman for the conservative opposition christian democratic union .
" but since long-term unemployed people will get fewer benefits under the new plan , they should at least have the opportunity to find work more easily .
but i can ’ t see this happening .
this is why the government ’ s policy can only be described as a rush job and a patchwork , and as socially unjust , since it hits the poor and underprivileged once again . "
a conundrum for the spd 's base an editorial in the monday issue of the financial times deutschland newspaper concluded that the spat between unions and the spd is making it impossible for core social democrat voters to maintain their loyalty to both their party and the trade unions .
both are complaining about dwindling membership .
bsirske and his colleagues are well aware that with a conservative government at the helm in 2006 the unions are even less likely to strike a deal for softer reforms .
but the unions may have another strategy altogether .
as bsirske noted on sunday : the unions could much more easily fight a conservative chancellor than a social democrat who claims to be on the unions ' side . hardy graupner -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

serbian voters go to the polls sunday in crucial presidential elections that pit pro-eu reformer boris tadic against ultranationalist tomislav nikolic .
the result will largely determine the country 's political direction . on paper , serbia 's five-year presidency is largely ceremonial , but former president milosevic proved how effectively its few powers could be exploited . sunday 's vote could thus determine whether serbia moves closer to the eu and nato and improves relations with the west or lapses back into the chauvinism and isolation reminiscent of milosevic 's former regime . opinion polls this week gave boris tadic , a pro-europe liberal , a lead of up to 54 percent against 46 percent for tomislav nikolic , an ardent nationalist whose radical party propped up milosevic 's regime and supported his military adventures in the 1990s . but despite the lead enjoyed by tadic , analysts say that a turnout of under 40 percent could still hand the presidency to nikolic , who commands greater loyalty among his supporters . choosing between eu and belarus european union officials have warned that a victory for nikolic would diplomatically isolate serbia , whereas a win for tadic would ease relations . chris patten , the european commissioner for external affairs , said this week that serbs had a choice " between joining the european family or belarus . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tomislav nikolic , frontrunner of the ultranationalist serbian radical party .
nikolic -lrb- photo -rrb- is against serbia 's entry to the eu and any victory for him could leave serbia isolated on the international stage and scare off investors from the west . " we need the east .

" serbia has opened its doors to the west , but the west has n't improved your lives .
it has n't made the factories churn out more or brought better harvests , " nikolic said . " eu will improve our lives " tadic , on the other hand , has made no bones about the fact that he 'd like to see serbia in the eu and even the nato one day .

he has vowed to continue with the reform agenda started by djindjic . tadic is considered popular with business leaders , artists and women alike and has continued the policies of his pro-western predecessor , calling for open borders and greater tolerance . " we must become a member of the european union .

serbian voters go to the polls sunday in crucial presidential elections that pit pro-eu reformer boris tadic against ultranationalist tomislav nikolic .
the result will largely determine the country 's political direction . on paper , serbia 's five-year presidency is largely ceremonial , but former president milosevic proved how effectively its few powers could be exploited . sunday 's vote could thus determine whether serbia moves closer to the eu and nato and improves relations with the west or lapses back into the chauvinism and isolation reminiscent of milosevic 's former regime . opinion polls this week gave boris tadic , a pro-europe liberal , a lead of up to 54 percent against 46 percent for tomislav nikolic , an ardent nationalist whose radical party propped up milosevic 's regime and supported his military adventures in the 1990s . but despite the lead enjoyed by tadic , analysts say that a turnout of under 40 percent could still hand the presidency to nikolic , who commands greater loyalty among his supporters . choosing between eu and belarus european union officials have warned that a victory for nikolic would diplomatically isolate serbia , whereas a win for tadic would ease relations . chris patten , the european commissioner for external affairs , said this week that serbs had a choice " between joining the european family or belarus . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tomislav nikolic , frontrunner of the ultranationalist serbian radical party .
nikolic -lrb- photo -rrb- is against serbia 's entry to the eu and any victory for him could leave serbia isolated on the international stage and scare off investors from the west . " we need the east .
russia supplies us with resources and power .
why should n't we exploit that ?
the west should help us to manufacture goods and we should sell them in the east , " nikolic said recently . championing himself as the candidate for the working class , nikolic 's strident rhetoric and calls to limit foreign trade appeal to the unemployed , which make up almost 30 percent of the country 's 7.5 million inhabitants . " serbia has opened its doors to the west , but the west has n't improved your lives .
it has n't made the factories churn out more or brought better harvests , " nikolic said . " eu will improve our lives " tadic , on the other hand , has made no bones about the fact that he 'd like to see serbia in the eu and even the nato one day .
an admirer of assassinated prime minister zoran djindjic , tadic took over the democratic party in february after djindjic 's death .
he has vowed to continue with the reform agenda started by djindjic . tadic is considered popular with business leaders , artists and women alike and has continued the policies of his pro-western predecessor , calling for open borders and greater tolerance . " we must become a member of the european union .
we must continue with these reforms , so we can join the bloc .
that would improve our lives .
without the eu , we can not overcome our problems , " tadic said . the vote could n't be further polarized with the two candidates unequivocal about where they 'd like to take serbia in the future .
opinion polls , however , show serbs to be divided , with many wanting to improve relations with the west but hostile to cooperating further with the international war crimes tribunal , which is trying a host of serbian leaders including milosevic for war crimes at the hague . tough decisions over kosovo the country also faces tough decisions over kosovo , the united nations-administered province , which belgrade insists remain part of serbia even though the majority ethnic albanian population wants independence . nikolic has called for sending security forces back to the troubled province of kosovo , inhabited mainly by ethnic albanians .
he clings to the dream of a greater serbia - saying it would be good for his people if all serbs were united . tadic , meanwhile , advocates a political solution to the future of kosovo . reform versus stagnation reporters at belgrade 's independent television station b-92 expect the election to be a watershed event for serbia .
they say if tadic wins , serbia will open up .
but if nikolic wins , serbia will turn inward , stop delivering suspected war criminals to the international criminal court in the hague , and become more isolated .
the reform process would grind to a halt . it 's a scenario that boris tadic has already laid out before the serbs .

as once strong relations between germany 's unions and the ruling social democrats plunge to new lows , one of the labor movement 's most-powerful leaders threatens to withdraw his support for chancellor gerhard schröder . frank bsirske , head of the german public sector union ver.di , infuriated the coalition government of social democrats and greens over the weekend by telling the newspaper welt am sonntag that chancellor gerhard schröder 's social and economic reform policy has been a huge failure .
" measured against his claim that he would create jobs , reduce joblessness and pep up the economy , gerhard schröder has been a failure , " bsirske told the paper .
bsirske acknowledged that cuts to the country 's generous social welfare system were needed to keep it afloat , while at the same time making the allegation that the government 's policy had by no means led to better employment opportunities in the country .
economic growth rates remain at well below 1 percent this year after three years of total stagnation .
move could hurt social democrats for bsirske 's part , the move was calculated .
himself a member of the green party , he knows his criticism will primarily hurt the social democrats .
the spd 's popularity has fallen to an unparalleled low in recent months , while the greens have recorded major gains in regional elections despite the fact that , as the spd 's junior coalition partner , they are also responsible for germany 's current social and economic policies .
bsirske , as well as other union leaders , are hoping to strengthen the rebellious left-wingers within the spd - many of whom harbor nagging doubts about the political reorientation of their party , which has traditionally represented the interests of the underprivileged in society .
schröder : i 'm not budging for his part , schröder told the newsweekly der spiegel that the " unions need to abandon their abstract considerations instead ask concrete questions in their companies . "
schröder said the unions should focus on what 's really best for their workers .
the chancellor also categorically refused to make any additional change to his labor reform laws .
" i 'm not going to do any more snipping , " he said , referring to his agenda 2010 reform plan .
green party chief reinhard bütikofer did what was expected of him and dismissed bsirske ’ s criticism as " unfounded " and " unconstructive . "
and deputy spd chief kurt beck brushed off bsirske ’ s demand for a change of course in the reform process as " nonsense . "
" a change of course – what ’ s that supposed to mean ? "
beck asked .
" weren ’ t we all agreed that considering our own demographic problems and global developments our social system has to be changed in order to survive at all ?
and weren ’ t we all agreed that the necessary reforms could not be carried out without sacrifices ?
so i don ’ t really understand why some are now calling on the government to revise its policy .
we don ’ t have the right to change our course , because we were elected to do the things that are necessary for germany to become competitive again . "
row to enter new round the row between the government and the trade unions is expected to enter yet another round on wednesday , when an inter-parliamentary arbitration committee is scheduled to agree on the details of combining germany 's welfare and unemployment benefits starting next year .
the move is expected to create even greater hardships for the economically disadvantaged .
" it looks as if there is no capacity and no mechanisms in place to make job placement procedures more efficient as of jan .
1 of next year , " said hermann-joseph ahrentz , the social affairs spokesman for the conservative opposition christian democratic union .
" but since long-term unemployed people will get fewer benefits under the new plan , they should at least have the opportunity to find work more easily .
but i can ’ t see this happening .
this is why the government ’ s policy can only be described as a rush job and a patchwork , and as socially unjust , since it hits the poor and underprivileged once again . "
a conundrum for the spd 's base an editorial in the monday issue of the financial times deutschland newspaper concluded that the spat between unions and the spd is making it impossible for core social democrat voters to maintain their loyalty to both their party and the trade unions .
both are complaining about dwindling membership .
bsirske and his colleagues are well aware that with a conservative government at the helm in 2006 the unions are even less likely to strike a deal for softer reforms .
but the unions may have another strategy altogether .

bsirske , as well as other union leaders , are hoping to strengthen the rebellious left-wingers within the spd - many of whom harbor nagging doubts about the political reorientation of their party , which has traditionally represented the interests of the underprivileged in society .
schröder : i 'm not budging for his part , schröder told the newsweekly der spiegel that the " unions need to abandon their abstract considerations instead ask concrete questions in their companies . "
schröder said the unions should focus on what 's really best for their workers .
the chancellor also categorically refused to make any additional change to his labor reform laws .
" i 'm not going to do any more snipping , " he said , referring to his agenda 2010 reform plan .
green party chief reinhard bütikofer did what was expected of him and dismissed bsirske ’ s criticism as " unfounded " and " unconstructive . "
and deputy spd chief kurt beck brushed off bsirske ’ s demand for a change of course in the reform process as " nonsense . "
" a change of course – what ’ s that supposed to mean ? "
beck asked .
" weren ’ t we all agreed that considering our own demographic problems and global developments our social system has to be changed in order to survive at all ?
and weren ’ t we all agreed that the necessary reforms could not be carried out without sacrifices ?
so i don ’ t really understand why some are now calling on the government to revise its policy .
we don ’ t have the right to change our course , because we were elected to do the things that are necessary for germany to become competitive again . "
row to enter new round the row between the government and the trade unions is expected to enter yet another round on wednesday , when an inter-parliamentary arbitration committee is scheduled to agree on the details of combining germany 's welfare and unemployment benefits starting next year .
the move is expected to create even greater hardships for the economically disadvantaged .
" it looks as if there is no capacity and no mechanisms in place to make job placement procedures more efficient as of jan .
1 of next year , " said hermann-joseph ahrentz , the social affairs spokesman for the conservative opposition christian democratic union .
" but since long-term unemployed people will get fewer benefits under the new plan , they should at least have the opportunity to find work more easily .
but i can ’ t see this happening .
this is why the government ’ s policy can only be described as a rush job and a patchwork , and as socially unjust , since it hits the poor and underprivileged once again . "
a conundrum for the spd 's base an editorial in the monday issue of the financial times deutschland newspaper concluded that the spat between unions and the spd is making it impossible for core social democrat voters to maintain their loyalty to both their party and the trade unions .
both are complaining about dwindling membership .
bsirske and his colleagues are well aware that with a conservative government at the helm in 2006 the unions are even less likely to strike a deal for softer reforms .
but the unions may have another strategy altogether .
as bsirske noted on sunday : the unions could much more easily fight a conservative chancellor than a social democrat who claims to be on the unions ' side . hardy graupner -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 28.06.2004 viacom snaps up german mtv rival viva großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the much-loved german music broadcaster viva has been bought by viacom mtv owner viacom last week announced it would be buying a majority stake in german rival viva media .
critics fear the buyout could crush competition in the music video market . rumors of the planned bid had been circulating for months , so it was no big surprise when u.s. media giant viacom revealed thursday that a group of 14 viva shareholders , including media conglomerates time warner inc. and vivendi universal , would be selling viacom 75.8 percent of the cologne-based music tv broadcaster 's shares , an offer supported by viva 's management .
the deal , which values viva at € 308.8 million -lrb- $ 373 million -rrb- , is viacom 's largest ever acquisition outside the united states .
bill rhoedy , president of mtv networks international , said the takeover would n't be stopping there .
viacom is now expected to make a further offer for the remaining 24.2 percent . " we want to acquire 100 percent , " he stressed in frankfurt last week .
" germany is the largest cable and satellite market in the world outside the u.s. , " he added , saying , " we believe there 's enormous potential for growth in this market and viva will help consolidate us in germany and europe . "
tom freston , viacom 's co-president , echoed his statements .
" acquiring viva is a top priority to drive mtv 's expansion in germany , " he said , emphasizing that " it 's a critical tv market globally . "
former rivals the two-step deal is by no means without its critics - first and foremost because viacom 's acquisition of loss-making viva will increase mtv 's presence in germany from two to four channels and make it the dominant force within germany 's music-television landscape .
viva first hit tv screens in 1993 , charged with challenging mtv 's hegemony by promoting the german music industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heike makatsch viva 's two channels soon cornered a market share of 3.2 percent in the target audience of 14-to-29-year-olds , beaming in to some 32 million homes .
the station gave homegrown bands such as die fantastischen vier and guano apes their breakthrough and helped launch the careers of a whole host of german celebrities , including stefan raab and heike makatsch -lrb- photo -rrb- , who recently appeared in the british hit film " love actually . "
with insiders concerned that germany 's domestic music scene will now have to take a back seat , mtv insists it will still be concentrating on local culture .
" we 're not going to just replant a u.s. brand in germany , " catherine muehlemann , manager of mtv central , told reporters .
" we want to keep our focus local . "
regulatory issues nonetheless , the deal may attract regulatory scrutiny .
according to reuters , industry sources expect major music labels and german tv channels to complain to cartel officials about the deal , arguing that it gives viacom a stronghold on which videos are broadcast as well as the related advertising market .
simon guild , deputy head of mtv networks europe , told reuters that he did not expect " material regulatory issues " but admitted the deal would have to be submitted to authorities for approval .
viacom also pointed out that the deal was subject to german merger and media ownership approvals .
shares rise viva operates two music channels in germany , while its brain pool unit produces tv shows and movies such as the hugely popular comedy shows " tv total , " " ladykracher " and " anke late night . "
it owns a 51 percent stake in its viva plus tv channel , while the rest is owned by time warner inc . , which is now selling its stake to viacom . recent years saw viva hard hit by the german advertising slump , with net tv advertising sales falling 20 percent since 2000 .
in 2003 , it posted losses of € 42 million .
but once the viacom bid was clinched , viva 's shares were up 5.3 percent at € 12.64 , trading just one cent shy of the offer price , € 12.65 a share , and hitting their highest level for almost two years .
viva stock more than doubled over the past year on speculation of a takeover , and the bid represents a 21 percent premium over its average share price over the three months before the offer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 28.06.2004 viacom snaps up german mtv rival viva großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the much-loved german music broadcaster viva has been bought by viacom mtv owner viacom last week announced it would be buying a majority stake in german rival viva media .
critics fear the buyout could crush competition in the music video market . rumors of the planned bid had been circulating for months , so it was no big surprise when u.s. media giant viacom revealed thursday that a group of 14 viva shareholders , including media conglomerates time warner inc. and vivendi universal , would be selling viacom 75.8 percent of the cologne-based music tv broadcaster 's shares , an offer supported by viva 's management .
the deal , which values viva at € 308.8 million -lrb- $ 373 million -rrb- , is viacom 's largest ever acquisition outside the united states .
bill rhoedy , president of mtv networks international , said the takeover would n't be stopping there .
viacom is now expected to make a further offer for the remaining 24.2 percent . " we want to acquire 100 percent , " he stressed in frankfurt last week .
" germany is the largest cable and satellite market in the world outside the u.s. , " he added , saying , " we believe there 's enormous potential for growth in this market and viva will help consolidate us in germany and europe . "
tom freston , viacom 's co-president , echoed his statements .
" acquiring viva is a top priority to drive mtv 's expansion in germany , " he said , emphasizing that " it 's a critical tv market globally . "
former rivals the two-step deal is by no means without its critics - first and foremost because viacom 's acquisition of loss-making viva will increase mtv 's presence in germany from two to four channels and make it the dominant force within germany 's music-television landscape .
viva first hit tv screens in 1993 , charged with challenging mtv 's hegemony by promoting the german music industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heike makatsch viva 's two channels soon cornered a market share of 3.2 percent in the target audience of 14-to-29-year-olds , beaming in to some 32 million homes .
the station gave homegrown bands such as die fantastischen vier and guano apes their breakthrough and helped launch the careers of a whole host of german celebrities , including stefan raab and heike makatsch -lrb- photo -rrb- , who recently appeared in the british hit film " love actually . "
with insiders concerned that germany 's domestic music scene will now have to take a back seat , mtv insists it will still be concentrating on local culture .
" we 're not going to just replant a u.s. brand in germany , " catherine muehlemann , manager of mtv central , told reporters .
" we want to keep our focus local . "
regulatory issues nonetheless , the deal may attract regulatory scrutiny .
according to reuters , industry sources expect major music labels and german tv channels to complain to cartel officials about the deal , arguing that it gives viacom a stronghold on which videos are broadcast as well as the related advertising market .
simon guild , deputy head of mtv networks europe , told reuters that he did not expect " material regulatory issues " but admitted the deal would have to be submitted to authorities for approval .
viacom also pointed out that the deal was subject to german merger and media ownership approvals .
shares rise viva operates two music channels in germany , while its brain pool unit produces tv shows and movies such as the hugely popular comedy shows " tv total , " " ladykracher " and " anke late night . "
it owns a 51 percent stake in its viva plus tv channel , while the rest is owned by time warner inc . , which is now selling its stake to viacom . recent years saw viva hard hit by the german advertising slump , with net tv advertising sales falling 20 percent since 2000 .
in 2003 , it posted losses of € 42 million .
but once the viacom bid was clinched , viva 's shares were up 5.3 percent at € 12.64 , trading just one cent shy of the offer price , € 12.65 a share , and hitting their highest level for almost two years .
viva stock more than doubled over the past year on speculation of a takeover , and the bid represents a 21 percent premium over its average share price over the three months before the offer .

u.s. administrator paul bremer passed the legal documentation to iraqi chief justice midhat al-mahmodi and with them the running of the war-torn country , 15 months after the invasion to remove saddam hussein . during the ceremony , bremer told the assembled officials that as " ex-administrator of the coalition provisional authority " he would " leave iraq confident in the future and confident in the ability of the government to meet the challenges of the future . "
coalition officials said bremer left iraq less than an hour after the ceremony , saying that he was " going home . " reactions from the international community on the whole were positive , with europe 's leaders among the first to offer words of support for the new government .
however , the overall feeling was one of caution . europe sends muted congratulations the german government displayed little excitement over the surprise move , simply sending its cordial greetings to the new , sovereign government in baghdad . deputy government spokesman hans-hermann langguth reported that immediately after the news broke monday morning , chancellor schröder sent a letter to the iraqi president , iyad allawi , congratulating him on his country ’ s new sovereignty .
however , langguth added that the handover of power did not mean that germany would be changing its policy on iraq . " the german envoy in baghdad has handed over a letter to the iraqi president pledging germany ’ s support in rebuilding the country , " he said .
" the chancellor also made it clear that we are prepared to give humanitarian assistance wherever possible , but that this would not include sending troops to iraq . " antje leendertse , spokeswomen for the german foreign ministry , expressed the hope that iraq could now find a respected place among the family of independent nations .
she added that the government in baghdad still faced difficult times ahead . " it ’ s clear that the next important step must be democratic elections under united nations guidance at the end of the year , " she said .
" germany will wholeheartedly support the world body in its effort to make these elections possible . " leendertse said germany ’ s willingness to contribute to the training of iraqi police and military forces , but said this was only possible outside the country . volker rühe , defense expert with the conservative opposition , said it was important to scale back the presence of foreign troops in iraq and strengthen the newly established iraqi police force .
he reiterated his opinion that the disbanding of the old iraqi army by the u.s.-led provisional authority was a major mistake which had contributed to the current security problems in iraq . in france , the reception was equally lukewarm .
french president jacques chirac had " taken note " of the transfer , but the handover was only one step in the political process there , his spokeswoman told afp on monday .
" the transfer of sovereignty is a long-awaited event , important .
it is a step in the political process that will run until 2005 , " she said .
" other steps must follow and france wishes the interim government and the iraqi people every success . " british prime minister tony blair 's spokesman told reporters that downing street welcomed the earlier-than-expected handover , saying it was an attempt to " seize the initiative " from the insurgents .
" we obviously welcome it because it 's their decision and it 's them taking control , " he said .
" what 's important now is that the iraqi people can see iraqi leaders taking charge in baghdad . " irish foreign minister brian cowen , in a statement on behalf of the eu presidency , which ireland currently holds , said that he wished iraq 's government " every success in their mission to govern iraq to the stage where free and fair elections can take place . " in poland , janusz zemke , the deputy defense minister , told reporters : " this is very good .

u.s. administrator paul bremer passed the legal documentation to iraqi chief justice midhat al-mahmodi and with them the running of the war-torn country , 15 months after the invasion to remove saddam hussein . during the ceremony , bremer told the assembled officials that as " ex-administrator of the coalition provisional authority " he would " leave iraq confident in the future and confident in the ability of the government to meet the challenges of the future . "
coalition officials said bremer left iraq less than an hour after the ceremony , saying that he was " going home . " reactions from the international community on the whole were positive , with europe 's leaders among the first to offer words of support for the new government .
however , the overall feeling was one of caution . europe sends muted congratulations the german government displayed little excitement over the surprise move , simply sending its cordial greetings to the new , sovereign government in baghdad . deputy government spokesman hans-hermann langguth reported that immediately after the news broke monday morning , chancellor schröder sent a letter to the iraqi president , iyad allawi , congratulating him on his country ’ s new sovereignty .
however , langguth added that the handover of power did not mean that germany would be changing its policy on iraq . " the german envoy in baghdad has handed over a letter to the iraqi president pledging germany ’ s support in rebuilding the country , " he said .
" the chancellor also made it clear that we are prepared to give humanitarian assistance wherever possible , but that this would not include sending troops to iraq . " antje leendertse , spokeswomen for the german foreign ministry , expressed the hope that iraq could now find a respected place among the family of independent nations .
she added that the government in baghdad still faced difficult times ahead . " it ’ s clear that the next important step must be democratic elections under united nations guidance at the end of the year , " she said .
" germany will wholeheartedly support the world body in its effort to make these elections possible . " leendertse said germany ’ s willingness to contribute to the training of iraqi police and military forces , but said this was only possible outside the country . volker rühe , defense expert with the conservative opposition , said it was important to scale back the presence of foreign troops in iraq and strengthen the newly established iraqi police force .
he reiterated his opinion that the disbanding of the old iraqi army by the u.s.-led provisional authority was a major mistake which had contributed to the current security problems in iraq . in france , the reception was equally lukewarm .
french president jacques chirac had " taken note " of the transfer , but the handover was only one step in the political process there , his spokeswoman told afp on monday .
" the transfer of sovereignty is a long-awaited event , important .
it is a step in the political process that will run until 2005 , " she said .
" other steps must follow and france wishes the interim government and the iraqi people every success . " british prime minister tony blair 's spokesman told reporters that downing street welcomed the earlier-than-expected handover , saying it was an attempt to " seize the initiative " from the insurgents .
" we obviously welcome it because it 's their decision and it 's them taking control , " he said .
" what 's important now is that the iraqi people can see iraqi leaders taking charge in baghdad . " irish foreign minister brian cowen , in a statement on behalf of the eu presidency , which ireland currently holds , said that he wished iraq 's government " every success in their mission to govern iraq to the stage where free and fair elections can take place . " in poland , janusz zemke , the deputy defense minister , told reporters : " this is very good .

they will also discuss training of security forces in iraq .
but germany has made it clear its non-engagement pledge remains . on sunday , the 26 nato heads of state and government attended a formal dinner in an ottoman-era palace on the banks of the bosporus to thrash out an agreement on a nato role in training military and police forces for the future sovereign iraqi government . differences however remained over when , and especially where , the training is to take place .
the dispute has given german chancellor gerhard schröder another opportunity to stress that no german soldier will set a foot on iraqi soil . shortly before official talks began in istanbul on monday , the german chancellor expressed his support for attempts to bring stability and democracy to iraq .
speaking to journalists in berlin before boarding a plan to istanbul on sunday , gerhard schröder said the transatlantic row over the iraq war belonged in the history books and that all nato states were interested in improving security in iraq .
at the same time , however , he expressed his determination not to budge on his refusal to send troops to the war-torn country . training must take place in germany - chancellor " we are of course willing to participate in the training of iraqi troops if the iraqi government wants that , " he says .
" but this has to take place in training centers in germany because we stick to our position that no german troops will be sent to iraq .
in istanbul i will once again make that clear . " sixteen nato members have forces in iraq , but key members , including germany and france , have so far resisted pressure from washington to participate .
they have also thwarted the bush administration ’ s original hope of a nato-led force to take command of a peacekeeping force south of baghdad .
schröder ’ s resistance against a german troop deployment is fully backed by his junior coalition partner in the government – the greens .
greens party leader angelika beer believes that nato members won ’ t agree to the alliance 's direct participation on the ground in iraq . greens doubt european support for nato role " i expect there will be an agreement on military training but outside iraq , " she said . " there won ’ t be support for a nato role inside the country so that the controversy may linger on .
the european member states will make it clear again that humanitarian and training assistance is all they are willing to provide .
after all the conflicts in the entire middle east are still waiting for an answer from nato . " the wrangling over military and police training echoes nato divisions before the iraq war when france and germany blocked military assistance of the alliance to turkey , iraq ’ s neighbor .
and senior leaders of iraq ’ s interim government have expressed their dissatisfaction about the rift . hoshyar zebari , foreign minister in the iraqi government which formally assumes sovereignty on wednesday , insisted that any training must take place inside the country to be adaptable to iraqi conditions . uwe hessler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush courts turkey amid protests and violence u.s. president bush renewed calls for turkey 's eu entry as he sought to boost ties with the country in ankara on the eve of a nato summit .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.06.2004 opinion : iraq sovereignty is neither the beginning nor the end großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraq 's road to democracy could yet be long hopeful plans of free , democratic elections in 2005 accompanied the handover of sovereignty from the u.s. to the iraqi interim government monday .
but a democratic iraq is still very far away , according to peter philipp . former israeli ambassador avi primor , normally exceedingly popular in germany , elicited uncomfortable silence during a panel discussion recently when he said that you wo n't soon see real democracy in iraq and that the country might be better off with a new " strong man . " the german audience was taken down a peg in its political correctness and political wishful thinking .
though many people did n't accept george w. bush 's democratic domino theory for the middle east , since the " official " end of hostilities 14 months ago , they have became increasingly more impatient and called for a rapid democratization of iraq . such demands or even just expectations were n't exactly underpinned by experience .
the view was - and is - obscured by the unspeakable torture affair and the continual picking to pieces of even the last official reason for going to war : there were neither weapons of mass destruction nor was there an alliance between saddam hussein and international terrorists . war continues to rage on the other hand , a war is raging in iraq against the occupiers , against members of the interim government , against foreigners , against everyone who is at all involved in building a new , better iraq .
that even the united states speaks of " insurgents " bolsters the feeling that this is a war against foreign occupation which , according to international law - and emotionally more than ever - is sanctioned . it 's hardly a good starting point for a transferal of power .
even if the responsibility is officially put in the interim government 's hands , it will have an extremely difficult status .
its members will continue to be endangered .
there 's no reason to assume that the attacks will stop , attacks that only have one aim : to create terror and prevent normalization .
the suicide bombers and kidnappers are n't acting in the interests of the iraqi people , which have long been concentrated on only one issue : security . in any case , it was an exaggeration to expect the country to be democratized in a matter of a few months .
after world war ii , germany needed four years until the first free elections and ten years until sovereignty .
why should the process go faster in iraq , a country which does n't even have a history of democracy but really only of totalitarian rule ? security has priority fourteen months after the official end of hostilities , the iraqi citizen 's dream of freedom and democracy has also faded and lost ground to the simple desire for safety and survival .
the interim government will - and wants to - address those concerns : the security forces should be strengthened , old officers should be rehired , and emergency ordinances should give the government a free hand to pursue terrorists and violent criminals . such a crackdown on the violent criminals is hardly a guarantee that the security situation will improve .
if it does n't , the government 's success is put into question .
how can voters and candidates be motivated if they automatically become the targets of extremists ? elections are supposed to take place in early 2005 , but , like in afghanistan , such plans can quickly fall victim to local developments .
ultimately , there is the " classic " risk : the government must take tough action against violent criminals , but in doing so it risks deepening the abyss and suspending those freedoms that democracy is supposed to bring .
thus , june 28 is surely an important date but hardly more than the prelude to a more than problematic new period in the unfortunate history of iraq . peter philipp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. restores iraqi sovereignty ahead of schedule on monday morning , paul bremer , the u.s. administrator in iraq , formally passed the reins of power to the country 's new government before leaving for the u.s. the handover took place two days earlier than planned .

though many people did n't accept george w. bush 's democratic domino theory for the middle east , since the " official " end of hostilities 14 months ago , they have became increasingly more impatient and called for a rapid democratization of iraq . such demands or even just expectations were n't exactly underpinned by experience .
the view was - and is - obscured by the unspeakable torture affair and the continual picking to pieces of even the last official reason for going to war : there were neither weapons of mass destruction nor was there an alliance between saddam hussein and international terrorists . war continues to rage on the other hand , a war is raging in iraq against the occupiers , against members of the interim government , against foreigners , against everyone who is at all involved in building a new , better iraq .

microsoft lost an anti-trust ruling in march that said the company had abused its market dominance in europe .
the commission ruled that the seattle-based company had to put a series of " remedies " in place by monday , including offering a european version of its windows operating system stripped of its audio and video player .
microsoft argued that it faced " irreversible " damage if the measures were imposed before a decision was made on an appeal to the ruling .
the commission has said its decision to postpone the punishment was " without prejudice to microsoft 's obligation to implement the remedies " should the court reject the company 's request .
the court could rule on the suspension request within two months . dw-world.de microsoft slapped with biggest fine in eu history the european union on wednesday levied the largest fine against any company in the bloc 's history , ruling that microsoft must pay a half billion euros for abusing its " near monopoly " status .

portuguese prime minister durao barroso is expected to fill a position with prerequisites few candidates can satisfy . irish prime minister bertie ahern , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said sunday he would propose portuguese prime minister jose manuel durao barroso for the eu 's top job at a special bloc summit set for tuesday evening . ahern said there was " overwhelming support " for durao barroso .
german chancellor gerhard schröder stressed sunday that durao barroso " could count on germany 's support , " and british prime minister tony blair said he was certain barroso " would do an outstanding job " and that he hoped he would " be able to accept the challenge , " the associated press reported . so far durao barroso has n't commented on taking over the reins from outgoing eu commission president romano prodi .
assuming he does so though , portugal will be faced with the challenge figuring out what to do next , since the country has no clear rules for how to replace him . shifting allegiances in his youth , as a law student under the portuguese dictatorship , durao barroso was a marxist activist , but already at age 20 , his allegiances shifted towards the political center .
durao barroso completed his law degree in lisbon and studied political science in geneva and new york .
at 29 , after returning from the united states , he was elected to parliament .
the following year he was appointed state secretary and later , at 36 , foreign minister . when his party , the conservative liberal social democrats -lrb- psd -rrb- , was voted out of office in 1995 , durao barroso bridged the time back in the united states teaching at georgetown university in washington .
but he returned to portugal and worked his way up in the psd .
his time finally came in march 2002 , when the party , with durao barroso at its helm , - barely - won early elections called after socialist prime minister antonio guterres resigned over poor local election returns . durao barroso worked closely with former spanish prime minister jose maria aznar , and hosted a meeting between aznar , u.s. president george w. bush and british prime minister blair on the azores in march 2003 that cemented the four countries ' decision to cooperate in the iraq war .
portugal still has 120 police deployed in iraq , which durao barroso recently refused to withdraw . horse-trading the " horse-trading " over who would fill the top eu post has been going on intensely since an eu leaders failed to agree on a candidate at a summit in mid-june .
france and germany insisted that the commission head be from a country that fully participates in all eu initiatives , which ruled out britain 's chris patten , since his country is not part of the single currency .
britain had already succeeded in blocking germany 's choice , belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt , partly because he was considered too critical of u.s. foreign policy . france was adamant that the eu president should speak french .
the conservative-liberal european people 's party , the largest political group in the european parliament , demanded a candidate from the center-right .
others pressed for a politician experienced in the highest government levels .
still others asserted that the right person for the job should be from a smaller eu country . in the end , the 48-year-old portuguese prime minister fits all the requirements .
and besides french , he also speaks english and spanish .
unless durao barroso 's nomination is accepted by all 25 eu heads of state on tuesday , the european parliament will have to vote on whether to appoint him , which could happen as early as mid-july .
he would almost certainly be approved by the conservative-liberal dominated parliament .
he would take office in november . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de portugal hopes for euro economic bonus when portugal hosts this year 's european championship this summer , thousands of visiting soccer fans will spend plenty of euros .

portuguese prime minister durao barroso is expected to fill a position with prerequisites few candidates can satisfy . irish prime minister bertie ahern , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said sunday he would propose portuguese prime minister jose manuel durao barroso for the eu 's top job at a special bloc summit set for tuesday evening . ahern said there was " overwhelming support " for durao barroso .
german chancellor gerhard schröder stressed sunday that durao barroso " could count on germany 's support , " and british prime minister tony blair said he was certain barroso " would do an outstanding job " and that he hoped he would " be able to accept the challenge , " the associated press reported . so far durao barroso has n't commented on taking over the reins from outgoing eu commission president romano prodi .
assuming he does so though , portugal will be faced with the challenge figuring out what to do next , since the country has no clear rules for how to replace him . shifting allegiances in his youth , as a law student under the portuguese dictatorship , durao barroso was a marxist activist , but already at age 20 , his allegiances shifted towards the political center .
durao barroso completed his law degree in lisbon and studied political science in geneva and new york .
at 29 , after returning from the united states , he was elected to parliament .
the following year he was appointed state secretary and later , at 36 , foreign minister . when his party , the conservative liberal social democrats -lrb- psd -rrb- , was voted out of office in 1995 , durao barroso bridged the time back in the united states teaching at georgetown university in washington .

microsoft lost an anti-trust ruling in march that said the company had abused its market dominance in europe .
the commission ruled that the seattle-based company had to put a series of " remedies " in place by monday , including offering a european version of its windows operating system stripped of its audio and video player .
microsoft argued that it faced " irreversible " damage if the measures were imposed before a decision was made on an appeal to the ruling .
the commission has said its decision to postpone the punishment was " without prejudice to microsoft 's obligation to implement the remedies " should the court reject the company 's request .
the court could rule on the suspension request within two months . dw-world.de microsoft slapped with biggest fine in eu history the european union on wednesday levied the largest fine against any company in the bloc 's history , ruling that microsoft must pay a half billion euros for abusing its " near monopoly " status .

nikolic got 45.1 percent of the vote according to independent monitors from belgrade 's cesid group . more than 6.5 million voters were eligible to cast ballots .
analysts said turnout was 48.5 percent . the presidential election was widely seen as crucial to determine whether serbia would move towards the eu and adopt western-style reforms or whether it would lapse into the nationalist isolation and diplomatic wilderness of the autocratic milosevic regime . three previous attempts to elect a president since 2002 failed because too few voters showed up at the polls .
this vote was certain to produce a president regardless of the turnout , after parliament earlier this year scrapped a 50 percent turnout requirement .

nikolic got 45.1 percent of the vote according to independent monitors from belgrade 's cesid group . more than 6.5 million voters were eligible to cast ballots .
analysts said turnout was 48.5 percent . the presidential election was widely seen as crucial to determine whether serbia would move towards the eu and adopt western-style reforms or whether it would lapse into the nationalist isolation and diplomatic wilderness of the autocratic milosevic regime . three previous attempts to elect a president since 2002 failed because too few voters showed up at the polls .
this vote was certain to produce a president regardless of the turnout , after parliament earlier this year scrapped a 50 percent turnout requirement . " we must join the eu " tadic , who is considered popular with artists and business leaders alike , has received support from prime minister vojislav kostunica , ethnic minorities and dozens of local celebrities . the sarajevo-born psychologist and belgrade college professor had made closer ties with the west a central plank of his campaign .
" we must become a member of the european union .
we must continue with these reforms , so we can join the bloc .
that would improve our lives .
without the eu , we can not overcome our problems , " tadic said . tadic took over the leadership of the democratic party after the march 2003 assassination of zoran djindjic , the democrats ' leader and serbia 's first noncommunist prime minister since world war ii . he has vowed to continue with the reform agenda of his predecessor .
tadic is also an ardent supporter of extraditing serb war crimes suspects to the u.n. war crimes tribunal in the hague , where milosevic and others are standing trial on charges related to their roles in the balkan wars in the 1990s . " the west has n't improved our life " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tomislav nikolic of the ultranationalist serbian radical party .
tadic 's challenger , 52-year-old nikolic -lrb- photo -rrb- is against serbia 's entry to the eu and it was feared that any victory for him could leave serbia isolated on the international stage and scare off investors from the west . after casting his ballot in belgrade earlier in the day , nikolic predicted a tight race but said his " victory would return pride and dignity to serbia . " championing himself as the candidate for the working class , nikolic 's strident rhetoric and calls to limit foreign trade appeal to the unemployed , which make up almost 30 percent of the country 's 7.5 million inhabitants .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.06.2004 serbs face clear choice in presidential polls großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a win for boris tadic will improve serbia 's ties with the west .
serbian voters go to the polls sunday in crucial presidential elections that pit pro-eu reformer boris tadic against ultranationalist tomislav nikolic .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.06.2004 opinion : iraq sovereignty is neither the beginning nor the end großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraq 's road to democracy could yet be long hopeful plans of free , democratic elections in 2005 accompanied the handover of sovereignty from the u.s. to the iraqi interim government monday .
but a democratic iraq is still very far away , according to peter philipp . former israeli ambassador avi primor , normally exceedingly popular in germany , elicited uncomfortable silence during a panel discussion recently when he said that you wo n't soon see real democracy in iraq and that the country might be better off with a new " strong man . " the german audience was taken down a peg in its political correctness and political wishful thinking .
though many people did n't accept george w. bush 's democratic domino theory for the middle east , since the " official " end of hostilities 14 months ago , they have became increasingly more impatient and called for a rapid democratization of iraq . such demands or even just expectations were n't exactly underpinned by experience .
the view was - and is - obscured by the unspeakable torture affair and the continual picking to pieces of even the last official reason for going to war : there were neither weapons of mass destruction nor was there an alliance between saddam hussein and international terrorists . war continues to rage on the other hand , a war is raging in iraq against the occupiers , against members of the interim government , against foreigners , against everyone who is at all involved in building a new , better iraq .

but a democratic iraq is still very far away , according to peter philipp . former israeli ambassador avi primor , normally exceedingly popular in germany , elicited uncomfortable silence during a panel discussion recently when he said that you wo n't soon see real democracy in iraq and that the country might be better off with a new " strong man . " the german audience was taken down a peg in its political correctness and political wishful thinking .
though many people did n't accept george w. bush 's democratic domino theory for the middle east , since the " official " end of hostilities 14 months ago , they have became increasingly more impatient and called for a rapid democratization of iraq . such demands or even just expectations were n't exactly underpinned by experience .
the view was - and is - obscured by the unspeakable torture affair and the continual picking to pieces of even the last official reason for going to war : there were neither weapons of mass destruction nor was there an alliance between saddam hussein and international terrorists . war continues to rage on the other hand , a war is raging in iraq against the occupiers , against members of the interim government , against foreigners , against everyone who is at all involved in building a new , better iraq .
that even the united states speaks of " insurgents " bolsters the feeling that this is a war against foreign occupation which , according to international law - and emotionally more than ever - is sanctioned . it 's hardly a good starting point for a transferal of power .
even if the responsibility is officially put in the interim government 's hands , it will have an extremely difficult status .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.06.2004 serbs face clear choice in presidential polls großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a win for boris tadic will improve serbia 's ties with the west .
serbian voters go to the polls sunday in crucial presidential elections that pit pro-eu reformer boris tadic against ultranationalist tomislav nikolic .
the result will largely determine the country 's political direction . on paper , serbia 's five-year presidency is largely ceremonial , but former president milosevic proved how effectively its few powers could be exploited . sunday 's vote could thus determine whether serbia moves closer to the eu and nato and improves relations with the west or lapses back into the chauvinism and isolation reminiscent of milosevic 's former regime . opinion polls this week gave boris tadic , a pro-europe liberal , a lead of up to 54 percent against 46 percent for tomislav nikolic , an ardent nationalist whose radical party propped up milosevic 's regime and supported his military adventures in the 1990s . but despite the lead enjoyed by tadic , analysts say that a turnout of under 40 percent could still hand the presidency to nikolic , who commands greater loyalty among his supporters . choosing between eu and belarus european union officials have warned that a victory for nikolic would diplomatically isolate serbia , whereas a win for tadic would ease relations . chris patten , the european commissioner for external affairs , said this week that serbs had a choice " between joining the european family or belarus . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tomislav nikolic , frontrunner of the ultranationalist serbian radical party .
nikolic -lrb- photo -rrb- is against serbia 's entry to the eu and any victory for him could leave serbia isolated on the international stage and scare off investors from the west . " we need the east .
russia supplies us with resources and power .
why should n't we exploit that ?
the west should help us to manufacture goods and we should sell them in the east , " nikolic said recently . championing himself as the candidate for the working class , nikolic 's strident rhetoric and calls to limit foreign trade appeal to the unemployed , which make up almost 30 percent of the country 's 7.5 million inhabitants . " serbia has opened its doors to the west , but the west has n't improved your lives .
it has n't made the factories churn out more or brought better harvests , " nikolic said . " eu will improve our lives " tadic , on the other hand , has made no bones about the fact that he 'd like to see serbia in the eu and even the nato one day .
an admirer of assassinated prime minister zoran djindjic , tadic took over the democratic party in february after djindjic 's death .
he has vowed to continue with the reform agenda started by djindjic . tadic is considered popular with business leaders , artists and women alike and has continued the policies of his pro-western predecessor , calling for open borders and greater tolerance . " we must become a member of the european union .
we must continue with these reforms , so we can join the bloc .
that would improve our lives .
without the eu , we can not overcome our problems , " tadic said . the vote could n't be further polarized with the two candidates unequivocal about where they 'd like to take serbia in the future .
opinion polls , however , show serbs to be divided , with many wanting to improve relations with the west but hostile to cooperating further with the international war crimes tribunal , which is trying a host of serbian leaders including milosevic for war crimes at the hague . tough decisions over kosovo the country also faces tough decisions over kosovo , the united nations-administered province , which belgrade insists remain part of serbia even though the majority ethnic albanian population wants independence . nikolic has called for sending security forces back to the troubled province of kosovo , inhabited mainly by ethnic albanians .
he clings to the dream of a greater serbia - saying it would be good for his people if all serbs were united . tadic , meanwhile , advocates a political solution to the future of kosovo . reform versus stagnation reporters at belgrade 's independent television station b-92 expect the election to be a watershed event for serbia .
they say if tadic wins , serbia will open up .
but if nikolic wins , serbia will turn inward , stop delivering suspected war criminals to the international criminal court in the hague , and become more isolated .
the reform process would grind to a halt . it 's a scenario that boris tadic has already laid out before the serbs .
" voters must be clear on the consequences of this election .
if nikolic wins , serbia will be isolated .
if i win , serbia will open up . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debating kosovo 's future five years after the war , kosovo remains troubled by ethnic tensions .

as once strong relations between germany 's unions and the ruling social democrats plunge to new lows , one of the labor movement 's most-powerful leaders threatens to withdraw his support for chancellor gerhard schröder . frank bsirske , head of the german public sector union ver.di , infuriated the coalition government of social democrats and greens over the weekend by telling the newspaper welt am sonntag that chancellor gerhard schröder 's social and economic reform policy has been a huge failure .
" measured against his claim that he would create jobs , reduce joblessness and pep up the economy , gerhard schröder has been a failure , " bsirske told the paper .
bsirske acknowledged that cuts to the country 's generous social welfare system were needed to keep it afloat , while at the same time making the allegation that the government 's policy had by no means led to better employment opportunities in the country .
economic growth rates remain at well below 1 percent this year after three years of total stagnation .
move could hurt social democrats for bsirske 's part , the move was calculated .
himself a member of the green party , he knows his criticism will primarily hurt the social democrats .
the spd 's popularity has fallen to an unparalleled low in recent months , while the greens have recorded major gains in regional elections despite the fact that , as the spd 's junior coalition partner , they are also responsible for germany 's current social and economic policies .
bsirske , as well as other union leaders , are hoping to strengthen the rebellious left-wingers within the spd - many of whom harbor nagging doubts about the political reorientation of their party , which has traditionally represented the interests of the underprivileged in society .
schröder : i 'm not budging for his part , schröder told the newsweekly der spiegel that the " unions need to abandon their abstract considerations instead ask concrete questions in their companies . "
schröder said the unions should focus on what 's really best for their workers .
the chancellor also categorically refused to make any additional change to his labor reform laws .
" i 'm not going to do any more snipping , " he said , referring to his agenda 2010 reform plan .
green party chief reinhard bütikofer did what was expected of him and dismissed bsirske ’ s criticism as " unfounded " and " unconstructive . "
and deputy spd chief kurt beck brushed off bsirske ’ s demand for a change of course in the reform process as " nonsense . "
" a change of course – what ’ s that supposed to mean ? "
beck asked .
" weren ’ t we all agreed that considering our own demographic problems and global developments our social system has to be changed in order to survive at all ?
and weren ’ t we all agreed that the necessary reforms could not be carried out without sacrifices ?
so i don ’ t really understand why some are now calling on the government to revise its policy .
we don ’ t have the right to change our course , because we were elected to do the things that are necessary for germany to become competitive again . "
row to enter new round the row between the government and the trade unions is expected to enter yet another round on wednesday , when an inter-parliamentary arbitration committee is scheduled to agree on the details of combining germany 's welfare and unemployment benefits starting next year .
the move is expected to create even greater hardships for the economically disadvantaged .
" it looks as if there is no capacity and no mechanisms in place to make job placement procedures more efficient as of jan .
1 of next year , " said hermann-joseph ahrentz , the social affairs spokesman for the conservative opposition christian democratic union .
" but since long-term unemployed people will get fewer benefits under the new plan , they should at least have the opportunity to find work more easily .
but i can ’ t see this happening .
this is why the government ’ s policy can only be described as a rush job and a patchwork , and as socially unjust , since it hits the poor and underprivileged once again . "
a conundrum for the spd 's base an editorial in the monday issue of the financial times deutschland newspaper concluded that the spat between unions and the spd is making it impossible for core social democrat voters to maintain their loyalty to both their party and the trade unions .
both are complaining about dwindling membership .
bsirske and his colleagues are well aware that with a conservative government at the helm in 2006 the unions are even less likely to strike a deal for softer reforms .

bsirske acknowledged that cuts to the country 's generous social welfare system were needed to keep it afloat , while at the same time making the allegation that the government 's policy had by no means led to better employment opportunities in the country .
economic growth rates remain at well below 1 percent this year after three years of total stagnation .
move could hurt social democrats for bsirske 's part , the move was calculated .
himself a member of the green party , he knows his criticism will primarily hurt the social democrats .
the spd 's popularity has fallen to an unparalleled low in recent months , while the greens have recorded major gains in regional elections despite the fact that , as the spd 's junior coalition partner , they are also responsible for germany 's current social and economic policies .
bsirske , as well as other union leaders , are hoping to strengthen the rebellious left-wingers within the spd - many of whom harbor nagging doubts about the political reorientation of their party , which has traditionally represented the interests of the underprivileged in society .
schröder : i 'm not budging for his part , schröder told the newsweekly der spiegel that the " unions need to abandon their abstract considerations instead ask concrete questions in their companies . "
schröder said the unions should focus on what 's really best for their workers .
the chancellor also categorically refused to make any additional change to his labor reform laws .
" i 'm not going to do any more snipping , " he said , referring to his agenda 2010 reform plan .
green party chief reinhard bütikofer did what was expected of him and dismissed bsirske ’ s criticism as " unfounded " and " unconstructive . "
and deputy spd chief kurt beck brushed off bsirske ’ s demand for a change of course in the reform process as " nonsense . "
" a change of course – what ’ s that supposed to mean ? "
beck asked .
" weren ’ t we all agreed that considering our own demographic problems and global developments our social system has to be changed in order to survive at all ?
and weren ’ t we all agreed that the necessary reforms could not be carried out without sacrifices ?
so i don ’ t really understand why some are now calling on the government to revise its policy .
we don ’ t have the right to change our course , because we were elected to do the things that are necessary for germany to become competitive again . "
row to enter new round the row between the government and the trade unions is expected to enter yet another round on wednesday , when an inter-parliamentary arbitration committee is scheduled to agree on the details of combining germany 's welfare and unemployment benefits starting next year .
the move is expected to create even greater hardships for the economically disadvantaged .
" it looks as if there is no capacity and no mechanisms in place to make job placement procedures more efficient as of jan .
1 of next year , " said hermann-joseph ahrentz , the social affairs spokesman for the conservative opposition christian democratic union .
" but since long-term unemployed people will get fewer benefits under the new plan , they should at least have the opportunity to find work more easily .
but i can ’ t see this happening .
this is why the government ’ s policy can only be described as a rush job and a patchwork , and as socially unjust , since it hits the poor and underprivileged once again . "
a conundrum for the spd 's base an editorial in the monday issue of the financial times deutschland newspaper concluded that the spat between unions and the spd is making it impossible for core social democrat voters to maintain their loyalty to both their party and the trade unions .
both are complaining about dwindling membership .
bsirske and his colleagues are well aware that with a conservative government at the helm in 2006 the unions are even less likely to strike a deal for softer reforms .
but the unions may have another strategy altogether .
as bsirske noted on sunday : the unions could much more easily fight a conservative chancellor than a social democrat who claims to be on the unions ' side . hardy graupner -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.06.2004 portuguese prime minister likely to head eu commission großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : probably the next eu commission president : durao barroso the search for a new european commission president seems finally to have come to an end .
portuguese prime minister durao barroso is expected to fill a position with prerequisites few candidates can satisfy . irish prime minister bertie ahern , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said sunday he would propose portuguese prime minister jose manuel durao barroso for the eu 's top job at a special bloc summit set for tuesday evening . ahern said there was " overwhelming support " for durao barroso .
german chancellor gerhard schröder stressed sunday that durao barroso " could count on germany 's support , " and british prime minister tony blair said he was certain barroso " would do an outstanding job " and that he hoped he would " be able to accept the challenge , " the associated press reported . so far durao barroso has n't commented on taking over the reins from outgoing eu commission president romano prodi .
assuming he does so though , portugal will be faced with the challenge figuring out what to do next , since the country has no clear rules for how to replace him . shifting allegiances in his youth , as a law student under the portuguese dictatorship , durao barroso was a marxist activist , but already at age 20 , his allegiances shifted towards the political center .
durao barroso completed his law degree in lisbon and studied political science in geneva and new york .
at 29 , after returning from the united states , he was elected to parliament .
the following year he was appointed state secretary and later , at 36 , foreign minister . when his party , the conservative liberal social democrats -lrb- psd -rrb- , was voted out of office in 1995 , durao barroso bridged the time back in the united states teaching at georgetown university in washington .
but he returned to portugal and worked his way up in the psd .
his time finally came in march 2002 , when the party , with durao barroso at its helm , - barely - won early elections called after socialist prime minister antonio guterres resigned over poor local election returns . durao barroso worked closely with former spanish prime minister jose maria aznar , and hosted a meeting between aznar , u.s. president george w. bush and british prime minister blair on the azores in march 2003 that cemented the four countries ' decision to cooperate in the iraq war .
portugal still has 120 police deployed in iraq , which durao barroso recently refused to withdraw . horse-trading the " horse-trading " over who would fill the top eu post has been going on intensely since an eu leaders failed to agree on a candidate at a summit in mid-june .
france and germany insisted that the commission head be from a country that fully participates in all eu initiatives , which ruled out britain 's chris patten , since his country is not part of the single currency .
britain had already succeeded in blocking germany 's choice , belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt , partly because he was considered too critical of u.s. foreign policy . france was adamant that the eu president should speak french .
the conservative-liberal european people 's party , the largest political group in the european parliament , demanded a candidate from the center-right .
others pressed for a politician experienced in the highest government levels .
still others asserted that the right person for the job should be from a smaller eu country . in the end , the 48-year-old portuguese prime minister fits all the requirements .
and besides french , he also speaks english and spanish .
unless durao barroso 's nomination is accepted by all 25 eu heads of state on tuesday , the european parliament will have to vote on whether to appoint him , which could happen as early as mid-july .
he would almost certainly be approved by the conservative-liberal dominated parliament .
he would take office in november . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de portugal hopes for euro economic bonus when portugal hosts this year 's european championship this summer , thousands of visiting soccer fans will spend plenty of euros .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.06.2004 -pipe- 17:00 utc microsoft gets reprieve from eu commission the european commission has halted an order requiring microsoft to change its business practices upon review by the eu 's highest court on a request by the software giant to suspend the measures .
microsoft lost an anti-trust ruling in march that said the company had abused its market dominance in europe .
the commission ruled that the seattle-based company had to put a series of " remedies " in place by monday , including offering a european version of its windows operating system stripped of its audio and video player .
microsoft argued that it faced " irreversible " damage if the measures were imposed before a decision was made on an appeal to the ruling .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.06.2004 portuguese prime minister likely to head eu commission großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : probably the next eu commission president : durao barroso the search for a new european commission president seems finally to have come to an end .
portuguese prime minister durao barroso is expected to fill a position with prerequisites few candidates can satisfy . irish prime minister bertie ahern , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said sunday he would propose portuguese prime minister jose manuel durao barroso for the eu 's top job at a special bloc summit set for tuesday evening . ahern said there was " overwhelming support " for durao barroso .
german chancellor gerhard schröder stressed sunday that durao barroso " could count on germany 's support , " and british prime minister tony blair said he was certain barroso " would do an outstanding job " and that he hoped he would " be able to accept the challenge , " the associated press reported . so far durao barroso has n't commented on taking over the reins from outgoing eu commission president romano prodi .
assuming he does so though , portugal will be faced with the challenge figuring out what to do next , since the country has no clear rules for how to replace him . shifting allegiances in his youth , as a law student under the portuguese dictatorship , durao barroso was a marxist activist , but already at age 20 , his allegiances shifted towards the political center .
durao barroso completed his law degree in lisbon and studied political science in geneva and new york .
at 29 , after returning from the united states , he was elected to parliament .
the following year he was appointed state secretary and later , at 36 , foreign minister . when his party , the conservative liberal social democrats -lrb- psd -rrb- , was voted out of office in 1995 , durao barroso bridged the time back in the united states teaching at georgetown university in washington .
but he returned to portugal and worked his way up in the psd .
his time finally came in march 2002 , when the party , with durao barroso at its helm , - barely - won early elections called after socialist prime minister antonio guterres resigned over poor local election returns . durao barroso worked closely with former spanish prime minister jose maria aznar , and hosted a meeting between aznar , u.s. president george w. bush and british prime minister blair on the azores in march 2003 that cemented the four countries ' decision to cooperate in the iraq war .
portugal still has 120 police deployed in iraq , which durao barroso recently refused to withdraw . horse-trading the " horse-trading " over who would fill the top eu post has been going on intensely since an eu leaders failed to agree on a candidate at a summit in mid-june .
france and germany insisted that the commission head be from a country that fully participates in all eu initiatives , which ruled out britain 's chris patten , since his country is not part of the single currency .
britain had already succeeded in blocking germany 's choice , belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt , partly because he was considered too critical of u.s. foreign policy . france was adamant that the eu president should speak french .
the conservative-liberal european people 's party , the largest political group in the european parliament , demanded a candidate from the center-right .
others pressed for a politician experienced in the highest government levels .
still others asserted that the right person for the job should be from a smaller eu country . in the end , the 48-year-old portuguese prime minister fits all the requirements .
and besides french , he also speaks english and spanish .
unless durao barroso 's nomination is accepted by all 25 eu heads of state on tuesday , the european parliament will have to vote on whether to appoint him , which could happen as early as mid-july .
he would almost certainly be approved by the conservative-liberal dominated parliament .
he would take office in november . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de portugal hopes for euro economic bonus when portugal hosts this year 's european championship this summer , thousands of visiting soccer fans will spend plenty of euros .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.06.2004 serbs face clear choice in presidential polls großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a win for boris tadic will improve serbia 's ties with the west .
serbian voters go to the polls sunday in crucial presidential elections that pit pro-eu reformer boris tadic against ultranationalist tomislav nikolic .
the result will largely determine the country 's political direction . on paper , serbia 's five-year presidency is largely ceremonial , but former president milosevic proved how effectively its few powers could be exploited . sunday 's vote could thus determine whether serbia moves closer to the eu and nato and improves relations with the west or lapses back into the chauvinism and isolation reminiscent of milosevic 's former regime . opinion polls this week gave boris tadic , a pro-europe liberal , a lead of up to 54 percent against 46 percent for tomislav nikolic , an ardent nationalist whose radical party propped up milosevic 's regime and supported his military adventures in the 1990s . but despite the lead enjoyed by tadic , analysts say that a turnout of under 40 percent could still hand the presidency to nikolic , who commands greater loyalty among his supporters . choosing between eu and belarus european union officials have warned that a victory for nikolic would diplomatically isolate serbia , whereas a win for tadic would ease relations . chris patten , the european commissioner for external affairs , said this week that serbs had a choice " between joining the european family or belarus . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tomislav nikolic , frontrunner of the ultranationalist serbian radical party .
nikolic -lrb- photo -rrb- is against serbia 's entry to the eu and any victory for him could leave serbia isolated on the international stage and scare off investors from the west . " we need the east .
russia supplies us with resources and power .
why should n't we exploit that ?
the west should help us to manufacture goods and we should sell them in the east , " nikolic said recently . championing himself as the candidate for the working class , nikolic 's strident rhetoric and calls to limit foreign trade appeal to the unemployed , which make up almost 30 percent of the country 's 7.5 million inhabitants .

the result will largely determine the country 's political direction . on paper , serbia 's five-year presidency is largely ceremonial , but former president milosevic proved how effectively its few powers could be exploited . sunday 's vote could thus determine whether serbia moves closer to the eu and nato and improves relations with the west or lapses back into the chauvinism and isolation reminiscent of milosevic 's former regime . opinion polls this week gave boris tadic , a pro-europe liberal , a lead of up to 54 percent against 46 percent for tomislav nikolic , an ardent nationalist whose radical party propped up milosevic 's regime and supported his military adventures in the 1990s . but despite the lead enjoyed by tadic , analysts say that a turnout of under 40 percent could still hand the presidency to nikolic , who commands greater loyalty among his supporters . choosing between eu and belarus european union officials have warned that a victory for nikolic would diplomatically isolate serbia , whereas a win for tadic would ease relations . chris patten , the european commissioner for external affairs , said this week that serbs had a choice " between joining the european family or belarus .

serbian voters go to the polls sunday in crucial presidential elections that pit pro-eu reformer boris tadic against ultranationalist tomislav nikolic .
the result will largely determine the country 's political direction . on paper , serbia 's five-year presidency is largely ceremonial , but former president milosevic proved how effectively its few powers could be exploited . sunday 's vote could thus determine whether serbia moves closer to the eu and nato and improves relations with the west or lapses back into the chauvinism and isolation reminiscent of milosevic 's former regime . opinion polls this week gave boris tadic , a pro-europe liberal , a lead of up to 54 percent against 46 percent for tomislav nikolic , an ardent nationalist whose radical party propped up milosevic 's regime and supported his military adventures in the 1990s . but despite the lead enjoyed by tadic , analysts say that a turnout of under 40 percent could still hand the presidency to nikolic , who commands greater loyalty among his supporters . choosing between eu and belarus european union officials have warned that a victory for nikolic would diplomatically isolate serbia , whereas a win for tadic would ease relations . chris patten , the european commissioner for external affairs , said this week that serbs had a choice " between joining the european family or belarus . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tomislav nikolic , frontrunner of the ultranationalist serbian radical party .
nikolic -lrb- photo -rrb- is against serbia 's entry to the eu and any victory for him could leave serbia isolated on the international stage and scare off investors from the west . " we need the east .
russia supplies us with resources and power .
why should n't we exploit that ?
the west should help us to manufacture goods and we should sell them in the east , " nikolic said recently . championing himself as the candidate for the working class , nikolic 's strident rhetoric and calls to limit foreign trade appeal to the unemployed , which make up almost 30 percent of the country 's 7.5 million inhabitants . " serbia has opened its doors to the west , but the west has n't improved your lives .
it has n't made the factories churn out more or brought better harvests , " nikolic said . " eu will improve our lives " tadic , on the other hand , has made no bones about the fact that he 'd like to see serbia in the eu and even the nato one day .
an admirer of assassinated prime minister zoran djindjic , tadic took over the democratic party in february after djindjic 's death .
he has vowed to continue with the reform agenda started by djindjic . tadic is considered popular with business leaders , artists and women alike and has continued the policies of his pro-western predecessor , calling for open borders and greater tolerance . " we must become a member of the european union .
we must continue with these reforms , so we can join the bloc .
that would improve our lives .
without the eu , we can not overcome our problems , " tadic said . the vote could n't be further polarized with the two candidates unequivocal about where they 'd like to take serbia in the future .
opinion polls , however , show serbs to be divided , with many wanting to improve relations with the west but hostile to cooperating further with the international war crimes tribunal , which is trying a host of serbian leaders including milosevic for war crimes at the hague . tough decisions over kosovo the country also faces tough decisions over kosovo , the united nations-administered province , which belgrade insists remain part of serbia even though the majority ethnic albanian population wants independence . nikolic has called for sending security forces back to the troubled province of kosovo , inhabited mainly by ethnic albanians .
he clings to the dream of a greater serbia - saying it would be good for his people if all serbs were united . tadic , meanwhile , advocates a political solution to the future of kosovo . reform versus stagnation reporters at belgrade 's independent television station b-92 expect the election to be a watershed event for serbia .
they say if tadic wins , serbia will open up .
but if nikolic wins , serbia will turn inward , stop delivering suspected war criminals to the international criminal court in the hague , and become more isolated .
the reform process would grind to a halt . it 's a scenario that boris tadic has already laid out before the serbs .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.06.2004 opinion : iraq sovereignty is neither the beginning nor the end großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraq 's road to democracy could yet be long hopeful plans of free , democratic elections in 2005 accompanied the handover of sovereignty from the u.s. to the iraqi interim government monday .
but a democratic iraq is still very far away , according to peter philipp . former israeli ambassador avi primor , normally exceedingly popular in germany , elicited uncomfortable silence during a panel discussion recently when he said that you wo n't soon see real democracy in iraq and that the country might be better off with a new " strong man . " the german audience was taken down a peg in its political correctness and political wishful thinking .
though many people did n't accept george w. bush 's democratic domino theory for the middle east , since the " official " end of hostilities 14 months ago , they have became increasingly more impatient and called for a rapid democratization of iraq . such demands or even just expectations were n't exactly underpinned by experience .
the view was - and is - obscured by the unspeakable torture affair and the continual picking to pieces of even the last official reason for going to war : there were neither weapons of mass destruction nor was there an alliance between saddam hussein and international terrorists . war continues to rage on the other hand , a war is raging in iraq against the occupiers , against members of the interim government , against foreigners , against everyone who is at all involved in building a new , better iraq .
that even the united states speaks of " insurgents " bolsters the feeling that this is a war against foreign occupation which , according to international law - and emotionally more than ever - is sanctioned . it 's hardly a good starting point for a transferal of power .
even if the responsibility is officially put in the interim government 's hands , it will have an extremely difficult status .
its members will continue to be endangered .
there 's no reason to assume that the attacks will stop , attacks that only have one aim : to create terror and prevent normalization .
the suicide bombers and kidnappers are n't acting in the interests of the iraqi people , which have long been concentrated on only one issue : security . in any case , it was an exaggeration to expect the country to be democratized in a matter of a few months .
after world war ii , germany needed four years until the first free elections and ten years until sovereignty .
why should the process go faster in iraq , a country which does n't even have a history of democracy but really only of totalitarian rule ? security has priority fourteen months after the official end of hostilities , the iraqi citizen 's dream of freedom and democracy has also faded and lost ground to the simple desire for safety and survival .
the interim government will - and wants to - address those concerns : the security forces should be strengthened , old officers should be rehired , and emergency ordinances should give the government a free hand to pursue terrorists and violent criminals . such a crackdown on the violent criminals is hardly a guarantee that the security situation will improve .
if it does n't , the government 's success is put into question .
how can voters and candidates be motivated if they automatically become the targets of extremists ? elections are supposed to take place in early 2005 , but , like in afghanistan , such plans can quickly fall victim to local developments .
ultimately , there is the " classic " risk : the government must take tough action against violent criminals , but in doing so it risks deepening the abyss and suspending those freedoms that democracy is supposed to bring .
thus , june 28 is surely an important date but hardly more than the prelude to a more than problematic new period in the unfortunate history of iraq . peter philipp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. restores iraqi sovereignty ahead of schedule on monday morning , paul bremer , the u.s. administrator in iraq , formally passed the reins of power to the country 's new government before leaving for the u.s. the handover took place two days earlier than planned .

nikolic got 45.1 percent of the vote according to independent monitors from belgrade 's cesid group . more than 6.5 million voters were eligible to cast ballots .
analysts said turnout was 48.5 percent . the presidential election was widely seen as crucial to determine whether serbia would move towards the eu and adopt western-style reforms or whether it would lapse into the nationalist isolation and diplomatic wilderness of the autocratic milosevic regime . three previous attempts to elect a president since 2002 failed because too few voters showed up at the polls .
this vote was certain to produce a president regardless of the turnout , after parliament earlier this year scrapped a 50 percent turnout requirement .

they will also discuss training of security forces in iraq .
but germany has made it clear its non-engagement pledge remains . on sunday , the 26 nato heads of state and government attended a formal dinner in an ottoman-era palace on the banks of the bosporus to thrash out an agreement on a nato role in training military and police forces for the future sovereign iraqi government . differences however remained over when , and especially where , the training is to take place .
the dispute has given german chancellor gerhard schröder another opportunity to stress that no german soldier will set a foot on iraqi soil . shortly before official talks began in istanbul on monday , the german chancellor expressed his support for attempts to bring stability and democracy to iraq .
speaking to journalists in berlin before boarding a plan to istanbul on sunday , gerhard schröder said the transatlantic row over the iraq war belonged in the history books and that all nato states were interested in improving security in iraq .
at the same time , however , he expressed his determination not to budge on his refusal to send troops to the war-torn country . training must take place in germany - chancellor " we are of course willing to participate in the training of iraqi troops if the iraqi government wants that , " he says .
" but this has to take place in training centers in germany because we stick to our position that no german troops will be sent to iraq .
in istanbul i will once again make that clear . " sixteen nato members have forces in iraq , but key members , including germany and france , have so far resisted pressure from washington to participate .
they have also thwarted the bush administration ’ s original hope of a nato-led force to take command of a peacekeeping force south of baghdad .
schröder ’ s resistance against a german troop deployment is fully backed by his junior coalition partner in the government – the greens .
greens party leader angelika beer believes that nato members won ’ t agree to the alliance 's direct participation on the ground in iraq . greens doubt european support for nato role " i expect there will be an agreement on military training but outside iraq , " she said . " there won ’ t be support for a nato role inside the country so that the controversy may linger on .
the european member states will make it clear again that humanitarian and training assistance is all they are willing to provide .
after all the conflicts in the entire middle east are still waiting for an answer from nato . " the wrangling over military and police training echoes nato divisions before the iraq war when france and germany blocked military assistance of the alliance to turkey , iraq ’ s neighbor .
and senior leaders of iraq ’ s interim government have expressed their dissatisfaction about the rift . hoshyar zebari , foreign minister in the iraqi government which formally assumes sovereignty on wednesday , insisted that any training must take place inside the country to be adaptable to iraqi conditions . uwe hessler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush courts turkey amid protests and violence u.s. president bush renewed calls for turkey 's eu entry as he sought to boost ties with the country in ankara on the eve of a nato summit .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 28.06.2004 viacom snaps up german mtv rival viva großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the much-loved german music broadcaster viva has been bought by viacom mtv owner viacom last week announced it would be buying a majority stake in german rival viva media .
critics fear the buyout could crush competition in the music video market . rumors of the planned bid had been circulating for months , so it was no big surprise when u.s. media giant viacom revealed thursday that a group of 14 viva shareholders , including media conglomerates time warner inc. and vivendi universal , would be selling viacom 75.8 percent of the cologne-based music tv broadcaster 's shares , an offer supported by viva 's management .
the deal , which values viva at € 308.8 million -lrb- $ 373 million -rrb- , is viacom 's largest ever acquisition outside the united states .
bill rhoedy , president of mtv networks international , said the takeover would n't be stopping there .
viacom is now expected to make a further offer for the remaining 24.2 percent . " we want to acquire 100 percent , " he stressed in frankfurt last week .
" germany is the largest cable and satellite market in the world outside the u.s. , " he added , saying , " we believe there 's enormous potential for growth in this market and viva will help consolidate us in germany and europe . "
tom freston , viacom 's co-president , echoed his statements .
" acquiring viva is a top priority to drive mtv 's expansion in germany , " he said , emphasizing that " it 's a critical tv market globally . "
former rivals the two-step deal is by no means without its critics - first and foremost because viacom 's acquisition of loss-making viva will increase mtv 's presence in germany from two to four channels and make it the dominant force within germany 's music-television landscape .
viva first hit tv screens in 1993 , charged with challenging mtv 's hegemony by promoting the german music industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heike makatsch viva 's two channels soon cornered a market share of 3.2 percent in the target audience of 14-to-29-year-olds , beaming in to some 32 million homes .
the station gave homegrown bands such as die fantastischen vier and guano apes their breakthrough and helped launch the careers of a whole host of german celebrities , including stefan raab and heike makatsch -lrb- photo -rrb- , who recently appeared in the british hit film " love actually . "
with insiders concerned that germany 's domestic music scene will now have to take a back seat , mtv insists it will still be concentrating on local culture .
" we 're not going to just replant a u.s. brand in germany , " catherine muehlemann , manager of mtv central , told reporters .
" we want to keep our focus local . "
regulatory issues nonetheless , the deal may attract regulatory scrutiny .
according to reuters , industry sources expect major music labels and german tv channels to complain to cartel officials about the deal , arguing that it gives viacom a stronghold on which videos are broadcast as well as the related advertising market .
simon guild , deputy head of mtv networks europe , told reuters that he did not expect " material regulatory issues " but admitted the deal would have to be submitted to authorities for approval .
viacom also pointed out that the deal was subject to german merger and media ownership approvals .
shares rise viva operates two music channels in germany , while its brain pool unit produces tv shows and movies such as the hugely popular comedy shows " tv total , " " ladykracher " and " anke late night . "
it owns a 51 percent stake in its viva plus tv channel , while the rest is owned by time warner inc . , which is now selling its stake to viacom . recent years saw viva hard hit by the german advertising slump , with net tv advertising sales falling 20 percent since 2000 .
in 2003 , it posted losses of € 42 million .
but once the viacom bid was clinched , viva 's shares were up 5.3 percent at € 12.64 , trading just one cent shy of the offer price , € 12.65 a share , and hitting their highest level for almost two years .
viva stock more than doubled over the past year on speculation of a takeover , and the bid represents a 21 percent premium over its average share price over the three months before the offer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 28.06.2004 viacom snaps up german mtv rival viva großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the much-loved german music broadcaster viva has been bought by viacom mtv owner viacom last week announced it would be buying a majority stake in german rival viva media .
critics fear the buyout could crush competition in the music video market . rumors of the planned bid had been circulating for months , so it was no big surprise when u.s. media giant viacom revealed thursday that a group of 14 viva shareholders , including media conglomerates time warner inc. and vivendi universal , would be selling viacom 75.8 percent of the cologne-based music tv broadcaster 's shares , an offer supported by viva 's management .
the deal , which values viva at € 308.8 million -lrb- $ 373 million -rrb- , is viacom 's largest ever acquisition outside the united states .
bill rhoedy , president of mtv networks international , said the takeover would n't be stopping there .
viacom is now expected to make a further offer for the remaining 24.2 percent . " we want to acquire 100 percent , " he stressed in frankfurt last week .
" germany is the largest cable and satellite market in the world outside the u.s. , " he added , saying , " we believe there 's enormous potential for growth in this market and viva will help consolidate us in germany and europe . "
tom freston , viacom 's co-president , echoed his statements .
" acquiring viva is a top priority to drive mtv 's expansion in germany , " he said , emphasizing that " it 's a critical tv market globally . "
former rivals the two-step deal is by no means without its critics - first and foremost because viacom 's acquisition of loss-making viva will increase mtv 's presence in germany from two to four channels and make it the dominant force within germany 's music-television landscape .
viva first hit tv screens in 1993 , charged with challenging mtv 's hegemony by promoting the german music industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heike makatsch viva 's two channels soon cornered a market share of 3.2 percent in the target audience of 14-to-29-year-olds , beaming in to some 32 million homes .
the station gave homegrown bands such as die fantastischen vier and guano apes their breakthrough and helped launch the careers of a whole host of german celebrities , including stefan raab and heike makatsch -lrb- photo -rrb- , who recently appeared in the british hit film " love actually . "
with insiders concerned that germany 's domestic music scene will now have to take a back seat , mtv insists it will still be concentrating on local culture .
" we 're not going to just replant a u.s. brand in germany , " catherine muehlemann , manager of mtv central , told reporters .
" we want to keep our focus local . "
regulatory issues nonetheless , the deal may attract regulatory scrutiny .
according to reuters , industry sources expect major music labels and german tv channels to complain to cartel officials about the deal , arguing that it gives viacom a stronghold on which videos are broadcast as well as the related advertising market .
simon guild , deputy head of mtv networks europe , told reuters that he did not expect " material regulatory issues " but admitted the deal would have to be submitted to authorities for approval .
viacom also pointed out that the deal was subject to german merger and media ownership approvals .
shares rise viva operates two music channels in germany , while its brain pool unit produces tv shows and movies such as the hugely popular comedy shows " tv total , " " ladykracher " and " anke late night . "
it owns a 51 percent stake in its viva plus tv channel , while the rest is owned by time warner inc . , which is now selling its stake to viacom . recent years saw viva hard hit by the german advertising slump , with net tv advertising sales falling 20 percent since 2000 .
in 2003 , it posted losses of € 42 million .
but once the viacom bid was clinched , viva 's shares were up 5.3 percent at € 12.64 , trading just one cent shy of the offer price , € 12.65 a share , and hitting their highest level for almost two years .
viva stock more than doubled over the past year on speculation of a takeover , and the bid represents a 21 percent premium over its average share price over the three months before the offer .

viva first hit tv screens in 1993 , charged with challenging mtv 's hegemony by promoting the german music industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heike makatsch viva 's two channels soon cornered a market share of 3.2 percent in the target audience of 14-to-29-year-olds , beaming in to some 32 million homes .
the station gave homegrown bands such as die fantastischen vier and guano apes their breakthrough and helped launch the careers of a whole host of german celebrities , including stefan raab and heike makatsch -lrb- photo -rrb- , who recently appeared in the british hit film " love actually . "
with insiders concerned that germany 's domestic music scene will now have to take a back seat , mtv insists it will still be concentrating on local culture .
" we 're not going to just replant a u.s. brand in germany , " catherine muehlemann , manager of mtv central , told reporters .
" we want to keep our focus local . "
regulatory issues nonetheless , the deal may attract regulatory scrutiny .
according to reuters , industry sources expect major music labels and german tv channels to complain to cartel officials about the deal , arguing that it gives viacom a stronghold on which videos are broadcast as well as the related advertising market .
simon guild , deputy head of mtv networks europe , told reuters that he did not expect " material regulatory issues " but admitted the deal would have to be submitted to authorities for approval .
viacom also pointed out that the deal was subject to german merger and media ownership approvals .
shares rise viva operates two music channels in germany , while its brain pool unit produces tv shows and movies such as the hugely popular comedy shows " tv total , " " ladykracher " and " anke late night . "
it owns a 51 percent stake in its viva plus tv channel , while the rest is owned by time warner inc . , which is now selling its stake to viacom . recent years saw viva hard hit by the german advertising slump , with net tv advertising sales falling 20 percent since 2000 .
in 2003 , it posted losses of € 42 million .
but once the viacom bid was clinched , viva 's shares were up 5.3 percent at € 12.64 , trading just one cent shy of the offer price , € 12.65 a share , and hitting their highest level for almost two years .
viva stock more than doubled over the past year on speculation of a takeover , and the bid represents a 21 percent premium over its average share price over the three months before the offer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haim saban other potential bidders for the troubled german broadcaster had included prosiebensat1 , the private broadcaster controlled by u.s. billionaire entrepreneur haim saban -lrb- photo -rrb- . but none were able to compete with the viacom bid , which marked a new milestone in mtv 's global expansion and made viacom the third-biggest player in german television after bertelsmann-owned rtl and saban-owned prosiebensat1 . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de aol time warner seen to have won battle for viva british music giant emi ’ s decision to sell its 15 % stake in viva media ag to aol time warner has effectively put an end to viacom 's chances of taking control of the german tv broadcaster . -lrb- june 24 , 2002 -rrb- saban takes the reins at prosiebensat.1 haim saban , an egyptian-born american billionaire , has bought the controlling stake private german broadcaster prosiebensat.1.

u.s. administrator paul bremer passed the legal documentation to iraqi chief justice midhat al-mahmodi and with them the running of the war-torn country , 15 months after the invasion to remove saddam hussein . during the ceremony , bremer told the assembled officials that as " ex-administrator of the coalition provisional authority " he would " leave iraq confident in the future and confident in the ability of the government to meet the challenges of the future . "
coalition officials said bremer left iraq less than an hour after the ceremony , saying that he was " going home . " reactions from the international community on the whole were positive , with europe 's leaders among the first to offer words of support for the new government .
however , the overall feeling was one of caution . europe sends muted congratulations the german government displayed little excitement over the surprise move , simply sending its cordial greetings to the new , sovereign government in baghdad . deputy government spokesman hans-hermann langguth reported that immediately after the news broke monday morning , chancellor schröder sent a letter to the iraqi president , iyad allawi , congratulating him on his country ’ s new sovereignty .
however , langguth added that the handover of power did not mean that germany would be changing its policy on iraq . " the german envoy in baghdad has handed over a letter to the iraqi president pledging germany ’ s support in rebuilding the country , " he said .
" the chancellor also made it clear that we are prepared to give humanitarian assistance wherever possible , but that this would not include sending troops to iraq . " antje leendertse , spokeswomen for the german foreign ministry , expressed the hope that iraq could now find a respected place among the family of independent nations .
she added that the government in baghdad still faced difficult times ahead . " it ’ s clear that the next important step must be democratic elections under united nations guidance at the end of the year , " she said .
" germany will wholeheartedly support the world body in its effort to make these elections possible . " leendertse said germany ’ s willingness to contribute to the training of iraqi police and military forces , but said this was only possible outside the country . volker rühe , defense expert with the conservative opposition , said it was important to scale back the presence of foreign troops in iraq and strengthen the newly established iraqi police force .
he reiterated his opinion that the disbanding of the old iraqi army by the u.s.-led provisional authority was a major mistake which had contributed to the current security problems in iraq . in france , the reception was equally lukewarm .
french president jacques chirac had " taken note " of the transfer , but the handover was only one step in the political process there , his spokeswoman told afp on monday .
" the transfer of sovereignty is a long-awaited event , important .
it is a step in the political process that will run until 2005 , " she said .
" other steps must follow and france wishes the interim government and the iraqi people every success . " british prime minister tony blair 's spokesman told reporters that downing street welcomed the earlier-than-expected handover , saying it was an attempt to " seize the initiative " from the insurgents .
" we obviously welcome it because it 's their decision and it 's them taking control , " he said .
" what 's important now is that the iraqi people can see iraqi leaders taking charge in baghdad . " irish foreign minister brian cowen , in a statement on behalf of the eu presidency , which ireland currently holds , said that he wished iraq 's government " every success in their mission to govern iraq to the stage where free and fair elections can take place .

u.s. administrator paul bremer passed the legal documentation to iraqi chief justice midhat al-mahmodi and with them the running of the war-torn country , 15 months after the invasion to remove saddam hussein . during the ceremony , bremer told the assembled officials that as " ex-administrator of the coalition provisional authority " he would " leave iraq confident in the future and confident in the ability of the government to meet the challenges of the future . "
coalition officials said bremer left iraq less than an hour after the ceremony , saying that he was " going home . " reactions from the international community on the whole were positive , with europe 's leaders among the first to offer words of support for the new government .
however , the overall feeling was one of caution . europe sends muted congratulations the german government displayed little excitement over the surprise move , simply sending its cordial greetings to the new , sovereign government in baghdad . deputy government spokesman hans-hermann langguth reported that immediately after the news broke monday morning , chancellor schröder sent a letter to the iraqi president , iyad allawi , congratulating him on his country ’ s new sovereignty .
however , langguth added that the handover of power did not mean that germany would be changing its policy on iraq . " the german envoy in baghdad has handed over a letter to the iraqi president pledging germany ’ s support in rebuilding the country , " he said .
" the chancellor also made it clear that we are prepared to give humanitarian assistance wherever possible , but that this would not include sending troops to iraq . " antje leendertse , spokeswomen for the german foreign ministry , expressed the hope that iraq could now find a respected place among the family of independent nations .
she added that the government in baghdad still faced difficult times ahead . " it ’ s clear that the next important step must be democratic elections under united nations guidance at the end of the year , " she said .
" germany will wholeheartedly support the world body in its effort to make these elections possible . " leendertse said germany ’ s willingness to contribute to the training of iraqi police and military forces , but said this was only possible outside the country . volker rühe , defense expert with the conservative opposition , said it was important to scale back the presence of foreign troops in iraq and strengthen the newly established iraqi police force .
he reiterated his opinion that the disbanding of the old iraqi army by the u.s.-led provisional authority was a major mistake which had contributed to the current security problems in iraq . in france , the reception was equally lukewarm .
french president jacques chirac had " taken note " of the transfer , but the handover was only one step in the political process there , his spokeswoman told afp on monday .
" the transfer of sovereignty is a long-awaited event , important .
it is a step in the political process that will run until 2005 , " she said .
" other steps must follow and france wishes the interim government and the iraqi people every success . " british prime minister tony blair 's spokesman told reporters that downing street welcomed the earlier-than-expected handover , saying it was an attempt to " seize the initiative " from the insurgents .
" we obviously welcome it because it 's their decision and it 's them taking control , " he said .
" what 's important now is that the iraqi people can see iraqi leaders taking charge in baghdad . " irish foreign minister brian cowen , in a statement on behalf of the eu presidency , which ireland currently holds , said that he wished iraq 's government " every success in their mission to govern iraq to the stage where free and fair elections can take place . " in poland , janusz zemke , the deputy defense minister , told reporters : " this is very good .

as once strong relations between germany 's unions and the ruling social democrats plunge to new lows , one of the labor movement 's most-powerful leaders threatens to withdraw his support for chancellor gerhard schröder . frank bsirske , head of the german public sector union ver.di , infuriated the coalition government of social democrats and greens over the weekend by telling the newspaper welt am sonntag that chancellor gerhard schröder 's social and economic reform policy has been a huge failure .
" measured against his claim that he would create jobs , reduce joblessness and pep up the economy , gerhard schröder has been a failure , " bsirske told the paper .
bsirske acknowledged that cuts to the country 's generous social welfare system were needed to keep it afloat , while at the same time making the allegation that the government 's policy had by no means led to better employment opportunities in the country .
economic growth rates remain at well below 1 percent this year after three years of total stagnation .
move could hurt social democrats for bsirske 's part , the move was calculated .
himself a member of the green party , he knows his criticism will primarily hurt the social democrats .
the spd 's popularity has fallen to an unparalleled low in recent months , while the greens have recorded major gains in regional elections despite the fact that , as the spd 's junior coalition partner , they are also responsible for germany 's current social and economic policies .
bsirske , as well as other union leaders , are hoping to strengthen the rebellious left-wingers within the spd - many of whom harbor nagging doubts about the political reorientation of their party , which has traditionally represented the interests of the underprivileged in society .
schröder : i 'm not budging for his part , schröder told the newsweekly der spiegel that the " unions need to abandon their abstract considerations instead ask concrete questions in their companies . "
schröder said the unions should focus on what 's really best for their workers .
the chancellor also categorically refused to make any additional change to his labor reform laws .
" i 'm not going to do any more snipping , " he said , referring to his agenda 2010 reform plan .
green party chief reinhard bütikofer did what was expected of him and dismissed bsirske ’ s criticism as " unfounded " and " unconstructive . "
and deputy spd chief kurt beck brushed off bsirske ’ s demand for a change of course in the reform process as " nonsense . "
" a change of course – what ’ s that supposed to mean ? "
beck asked .
" weren ’ t we all agreed that considering our own demographic problems and global developments our social system has to be changed in order to survive at all ?
and weren ’ t we all agreed that the necessary reforms could not be carried out without sacrifices ?
so i don ’ t really understand why some are now calling on the government to revise its policy .
we don ’ t have the right to change our course , because we were elected to do the things that are necessary for germany to become competitive again . "
row to enter new round the row between the government and the trade unions is expected to enter yet another round on wednesday , when an inter-parliamentary arbitration committee is scheduled to agree on the details of combining germany 's welfare and unemployment benefits starting next year .
the move is expected to create even greater hardships for the economically disadvantaged .
" it looks as if there is no capacity and no mechanisms in place to make job placement procedures more efficient as of jan .
1 of next year , " said hermann-joseph ahrentz , the social affairs spokesman for the conservative opposition christian democratic union .
" but since long-term unemployed people will get fewer benefits under the new plan , they should at least have the opportunity to find work more easily .
but i can ’ t see this happening .
this is why the government ’ s policy can only be described as a rush job and a patchwork , and as socially unjust , since it hits the poor and underprivileged once again . "
a conundrum for the spd 's base an editorial in the monday issue of the financial times deutschland newspaper concluded that the spat between unions and the spd is making it impossible for core social democrat voters to maintain their loyalty to both their party and the trade unions .
both are complaining about dwindling membership .
bsirske and his colleagues are well aware that with a conservative government at the helm in 2006 the unions are even less likely to strike a deal for softer reforms .
but the unions may have another strategy altogether .

as once strong relations between germany 's unions and the ruling social democrats plunge to new lows , one of the labor movement 's most-powerful leaders threatens to withdraw his support for chancellor gerhard schröder . frank bsirske , head of the german public sector union ver.di , infuriated the coalition government of social democrats and greens over the weekend by telling the newspaper welt am sonntag that chancellor gerhard schröder 's social and economic reform policy has been a huge failure .
" measured against his claim that he would create jobs , reduce joblessness and pep up the economy , gerhard schröder has been a failure , " bsirske told the paper .
bsirske acknowledged that cuts to the country 's generous social welfare system were needed to keep it afloat , while at the same time making the allegation that the government 's policy had by no means led to better employment opportunities in the country .
economic growth rates remain at well below 1 percent this year after three years of total stagnation .
move could hurt social democrats for bsirske 's part , the move was calculated .
himself a member of the green party , he knows his criticism will primarily hurt the social democrats .
the spd 's popularity has fallen to an unparalleled low in recent months , while the greens have recorded major gains in regional elections despite the fact that , as the spd 's junior coalition partner , they are also responsible for germany 's current social and economic policies .
bsirske , as well as other union leaders , are hoping to strengthen the rebellious left-wingers within the spd - many of whom harbor nagging doubts about the political reorientation of their party , which has traditionally represented the interests of the underprivileged in society .
schröder : i 'm not budging for his part , schröder told the newsweekly der spiegel that the " unions need to abandon their abstract considerations instead ask concrete questions in their companies . "
schröder said the unions should focus on what 's really best for their workers .
the chancellor also categorically refused to make any additional change to his labor reform laws .
" i 'm not going to do any more snipping , " he said , referring to his agenda 2010 reform plan .
green party chief reinhard bütikofer did what was expected of him and dismissed bsirske ’ s criticism as " unfounded " and " unconstructive . "
and deputy spd chief kurt beck brushed off bsirske ’ s demand for a change of course in the reform process as " nonsense . "
" a change of course – what ’ s that supposed to mean ? "
beck asked .
" weren ’ t we all agreed that considering our own demographic problems and global developments our social system has to be changed in order to survive at all ?
and weren ’ t we all agreed that the necessary reforms could not be carried out without sacrifices ?
so i don ’ t really understand why some are now calling on the government to revise its policy .
we don ’ t have the right to change our course , because we were elected to do the things that are necessary for germany to become competitive again . "
row to enter new round the row between the government and the trade unions is expected to enter yet another round on wednesday , when an inter-parliamentary arbitration committee is scheduled to agree on the details of combining germany 's welfare and unemployment benefits starting next year .
the move is expected to create even greater hardships for the economically disadvantaged .
" it looks as if there is no capacity and no mechanisms in place to make job placement procedures more efficient as of jan .
1 of next year , " said hermann-joseph ahrentz , the social affairs spokesman for the conservative opposition christian democratic union .
" but since long-term unemployed people will get fewer benefits under the new plan , they should at least have the opportunity to find work more easily .
but i can ’ t see this happening .
this is why the government ’ s policy can only be described as a rush job and a patchwork , and as socially unjust , since it hits the poor and underprivileged once again . "
a conundrum for the spd 's base an editorial in the monday issue of the financial times deutschland newspaper concluded that the spat between unions and the spd is making it impossible for core social democrat voters to maintain their loyalty to both their party and the trade unions .
both are complaining about dwindling membership .
bsirske and his colleagues are well aware that with a conservative government at the helm in 2006 the unions are even less likely to strike a deal for softer reforms .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.06.2004 portuguese prime minister likely to head eu commission großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : probably the next eu commission president : durao barroso the search for a new european commission president seems finally to have come to an end .
portuguese prime minister durao barroso is expected to fill a position with prerequisites few candidates can satisfy . irish prime minister bertie ahern , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said sunday he would propose portuguese prime minister jose manuel durao barroso for the eu 's top job at a special bloc summit set for tuesday evening . ahern said there was " overwhelming support " for durao barroso .
german chancellor gerhard schröder stressed sunday that durao barroso " could count on germany 's support , " and british prime minister tony blair said he was certain barroso " would do an outstanding job " and that he hoped he would " be able to accept the challenge , " the associated press reported . so far durao barroso has n't commented on taking over the reins from outgoing eu commission president romano prodi .
assuming he does so though , portugal will be faced with the challenge figuring out what to do next , since the country has no clear rules for how to replace him . shifting allegiances in his youth , as a law student under the portuguese dictatorship , durao barroso was a marxist activist , but already at age 20 , his allegiances shifted towards the political center .
durao barroso completed his law degree in lisbon and studied political science in geneva and new york .
at 29 , after returning from the united states , he was elected to parliament .
the following year he was appointed state secretary and later , at 36 , foreign minister . when his party , the conservative liberal social democrats -lrb- psd -rrb- , was voted out of office in 1995 , durao barroso bridged the time back in the united states teaching at georgetown university in washington .
but he returned to portugal and worked his way up in the psd .
his time finally came in march 2002 , when the party , with durao barroso at its helm , - barely - won early elections called after socialist prime minister antonio guterres resigned over poor local election returns . durao barroso worked closely with former spanish prime minister jose maria aznar , and hosted a meeting between aznar , u.s. president george w. bush and british prime minister blair on the azores in march 2003 that cemented the four countries ' decision to cooperate in the iraq war .
portugal still has 120 police deployed in iraq , which durao barroso recently refused to withdraw . horse-trading the " horse-trading " over who would fill the top eu post has been going on intensely since an eu leaders failed to agree on a candidate at a summit in mid-june .
france and germany insisted that the commission head be from a country that fully participates in all eu initiatives , which ruled out britain 's chris patten , since his country is not part of the single currency .
britain had already succeeded in blocking germany 's choice , belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt , partly because he was considered too critical of u.s. foreign policy . france was adamant that the eu president should speak french .
the conservative-liberal european people 's party , the largest political group in the european parliament , demanded a candidate from the center-right .
others pressed for a politician experienced in the highest government levels .
still others asserted that the right person for the job should be from a smaller eu country . in the end , the 48-year-old portuguese prime minister fits all the requirements .
and besides french , he also speaks english and spanish .
unless durao barroso 's nomination is accepted by all 25 eu heads of state on tuesday , the european parliament will have to vote on whether to appoint him , which could happen as early as mid-july .
he would almost certainly be approved by the conservative-liberal dominated parliament .
he would take office in november . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de portugal hopes for euro economic bonus when portugal hosts this year 's european championship this summer , thousands of visiting soccer fans will spend plenty of euros .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.06.2004 opinion : iraq sovereignty is neither the beginning nor the end großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraq 's road to democracy could yet be long hopeful plans of free , democratic elections in 2005 accompanied the handover of sovereignty from the u.s. to the iraqi interim government monday .
but a democratic iraq is still very far away , according to peter philipp . former israeli ambassador avi primor , normally exceedingly popular in germany , elicited uncomfortable silence during a panel discussion recently when he said that you wo n't soon see real democracy in iraq and that the country might be better off with a new " strong man . " the german audience was taken down a peg in its political correctness and political wishful thinking .
though many people did n't accept george w. bush 's democratic domino theory for the middle east , since the " official " end of hostilities 14 months ago , they have became increasingly more impatient and called for a rapid democratization of iraq . such demands or even just expectations were n't exactly underpinned by experience .
the view was - and is - obscured by the unspeakable torture affair and the continual picking to pieces of even the last official reason for going to war : there were neither weapons of mass destruction nor was there an alliance between saddam hussein and international terrorists . war continues to rage on the other hand , a war is raging in iraq against the occupiers , against members of the interim government , against foreigners , against everyone who is at all involved in building a new , better iraq .
that even the united states speaks of " insurgents " bolsters the feeling that this is a war against foreign occupation which , according to international law - and emotionally more than ever - is sanctioned . it 's hardly a good starting point for a transferal of power .
even if the responsibility is officially put in the interim government 's hands , it will have an extremely difficult status .
its members will continue to be endangered .
there 's no reason to assume that the attacks will stop , attacks that only have one aim : to create terror and prevent normalization .
the suicide bombers and kidnappers are n't acting in the interests of the iraqi people , which have long been concentrated on only one issue : security . in any case , it was an exaggeration to expect the country to be democratized in a matter of a few months .
after world war ii , germany needed four years until the first free elections and ten years until sovereignty .
why should the process go faster in iraq , a country which does n't even have a history of democracy but really only of totalitarian rule ? security has priority fourteen months after the official end of hostilities , the iraqi citizen 's dream of freedom and democracy has also faded and lost ground to the simple desire for safety and survival .
the interim government will - and wants to - address those concerns : the security forces should be strengthened , old officers should be rehired , and emergency ordinances should give the government a free hand to pursue terrorists and violent criminals . such a crackdown on the violent criminals is hardly a guarantee that the security situation will improve .
if it does n't , the government 's success is put into question .
how can voters and candidates be motivated if they automatically become the targets of extremists ? elections are supposed to take place in early 2005 , but , like in afghanistan , such plans can quickly fall victim to local developments .
ultimately , there is the " classic " risk : the government must take tough action against violent criminals , but in doing so it risks deepening the abyss and suspending those freedoms that democracy is supposed to bring .
thus , june 28 is surely an important date but hardly more than the prelude to a more than problematic new period in the unfortunate history of iraq . peter philipp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. restores iraqi sovereignty ahead of schedule on monday morning , paul bremer , the u.s. administrator in iraq , formally passed the reins of power to the country 's new government before leaving for the u.s. the handover took place two days earlier than planned .

portuguese prime minister durao barroso is expected to fill a position with prerequisites few candidates can satisfy . irish prime minister bertie ahern , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said sunday he would propose portuguese prime minister jose manuel durao barroso for the eu 's top job at a special bloc summit set for tuesday evening . ahern said there was " overwhelming support " for durao barroso .
german chancellor gerhard schröder stressed sunday that durao barroso " could count on germany 's support , " and british prime minister tony blair said he was certain barroso " would do an outstanding job " and that he hoped he would " be able to accept the challenge , " the associated press reported . so far durao barroso has n't commented on taking over the reins from outgoing eu commission president romano prodi .
assuming he does so though , portugal will be faced with the challenge figuring out what to do next , since the country has no clear rules for how to replace him . shifting allegiances in his youth , as a law student under the portuguese dictatorship , durao barroso was a marxist activist , but already at age 20 , his allegiances shifted towards the political center .
durao barroso completed his law degree in lisbon and studied political science in geneva and new york .
at 29 , after returning from the united states , he was elected to parliament .
the following year he was appointed state secretary and later , at 36 , foreign minister . when his party , the conservative liberal social democrats -lrb- psd -rrb- , was voted out of office in 1995 , durao barroso bridged the time back in the united states teaching at georgetown university in washington .
but he returned to portugal and worked his way up in the psd .
his time finally came in march 2002 , when the party , with durao barroso at its helm , - barely - won early elections called after socialist prime minister antonio guterres resigned over poor local election returns . durao barroso worked closely with former spanish prime minister jose maria aznar , and hosted a meeting between aznar , u.s. president george w. bush and british prime minister blair on the azores in march 2003 that cemented the four countries ' decision to cooperate in the iraq war .
portugal still has 120 police deployed in iraq , which durao barroso recently refused to withdraw . horse-trading the " horse-trading " over who would fill the top eu post has been going on intensely since an eu leaders failed to agree on a candidate at a summit in mid-june .
france and germany insisted that the commission head be from a country that fully participates in all eu initiatives , which ruled out britain 's chris patten , since his country is not part of the single currency .
britain had already succeeded in blocking germany 's choice , belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt , partly because he was considered too critical of u.s. foreign policy . france was adamant that the eu president should speak french .
the conservative-liberal european people 's party , the largest political group in the european parliament , demanded a candidate from the center-right .
others pressed for a politician experienced in the highest government levels .
still others asserted that the right person for the job should be from a smaller eu country . in the end , the 48-year-old portuguese prime minister fits all the requirements .
and besides french , he also speaks english and spanish .
unless durao barroso 's nomination is accepted by all 25 eu heads of state on tuesday , the european parliament will have to vote on whether to appoint him , which could happen as early as mid-july .
he would almost certainly be approved by the conservative-liberal dominated parliament .
he would take office in november . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de portugal hopes for euro economic bonus when portugal hosts this year 's european championship this summer , thousands of visiting soccer fans will spend plenty of euros .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.06.2004 opinion : iraq sovereignty is neither the beginning nor the end großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraq 's road to democracy could yet be long hopeful plans of free , democratic elections in 2005 accompanied the handover of sovereignty from the u.s. to the iraqi interim government monday .
but a democratic iraq is still very far away , according to peter philipp . former israeli ambassador avi primor , normally exceedingly popular in germany , elicited uncomfortable silence during a panel discussion recently when he said that you wo n't soon see real democracy in iraq and that the country might be better off with a new " strong man . " the german audience was taken down a peg in its political correctness and political wishful thinking .
though many people did n't accept george w. bush 's democratic domino theory for the middle east , since the " official " end of hostilities 14 months ago , they have became increasingly more impatient and called for a rapid democratization of iraq . such demands or even just expectations were n't exactly underpinned by experience .
the view was - and is - obscured by the unspeakable torture affair and the continual picking to pieces of even the last official reason for going to war : there were neither weapons of mass destruction nor was there an alliance between saddam hussein and international terrorists . war continues to rage on the other hand , a war is raging in iraq against the occupiers , against members of the interim government , against foreigners , against everyone who is at all involved in building a new , better iraq .
that even the united states speaks of " insurgents " bolsters the feeling that this is a war against foreign occupation which , according to international law - and emotionally more than ever - is sanctioned . it 's hardly a good starting point for a transferal of power .
even if the responsibility is officially put in the interim government 's hands , it will have an extremely difficult status .
its members will continue to be endangered .
there 's no reason to assume that the attacks will stop , attacks that only have one aim : to create terror and prevent normalization .
the suicide bombers and kidnappers are n't acting in the interests of the iraqi people , which have long been concentrated on only one issue : security . in any case , it was an exaggeration to expect the country to be democratized in a matter of a few months .
after world war ii , germany needed four years until the first free elections and ten years until sovereignty .
why should the process go faster in iraq , a country which does n't even have a history of democracy but really only of totalitarian rule ? security has priority fourteen months after the official end of hostilities , the iraqi citizen 's dream of freedom and democracy has also faded and lost ground to the simple desire for safety and survival .
the interim government will - and wants to - address those concerns : the security forces should be strengthened , old officers should be rehired , and emergency ordinances should give the government a free hand to pursue terrorists and violent criminals . such a crackdown on the violent criminals is hardly a guarantee that the security situation will improve .
if it does n't , the government 's success is put into question .

but a democratic iraq is still very far away , according to peter philipp . former israeli ambassador avi primor , normally exceedingly popular in germany , elicited uncomfortable silence during a panel discussion recently when he said that you wo n't soon see real democracy in iraq and that the country might be better off with a new " strong man . " the german audience was taken down a peg in its political correctness and political wishful thinking .
though many people did n't accept george w. bush 's democratic domino theory for the middle east , since the " official " end of hostilities 14 months ago , they have became increasingly more impatient and called for a rapid democratization of iraq . such demands or even just expectations were n't exactly underpinned by experience .
the view was - and is - obscured by the unspeakable torture affair and the continual picking to pieces of even the last official reason for going to war : there were neither weapons of mass destruction nor was there an alliance between saddam hussein and international terrorists . war continues to rage on the other hand , a war is raging in iraq against the occupiers , against members of the interim government , against foreigners , against everyone who is at all involved in building a new , better iraq .
that even the united states speaks of " insurgents " bolsters the feeling that this is a war against foreign occupation which , according to international law - and emotionally more than ever - is sanctioned . it 's hardly a good starting point for a transferal of power .
even if the responsibility is officially put in the interim government 's hands , it will have an extremely difficult status .

the interim government will - and wants to - address those concerns : the security forces should be strengthened , old officers should be rehired , and emergency ordinances should give the government a free hand to pursue terrorists and violent criminals . such a crackdown on the violent criminals is hardly a guarantee that the security situation will improve .

portuguese prime minister durao barroso is expected to fill a position with prerequisites few candidates can satisfy . irish prime minister bertie ahern , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said sunday he would propose portuguese prime minister jose manuel durao barroso for the eu 's top job at a special bloc summit set for tuesday evening . ahern said there was " overwhelming support " for durao barroso .
german chancellor gerhard schröder stressed sunday that durao barroso " could count on germany 's support , " and british prime minister tony blair said he was certain barroso " would do an outstanding job " and that he hoped he would " be able to accept the challenge , " the associated press reported . so far durao barroso has n't commented on taking over the reins from outgoing eu commission president romano prodi .
assuming he does so though , portugal will be faced with the challenge figuring out what to do next , since the country has no clear rules for how to replace him . shifting allegiances in his youth , as a law student under the portuguese dictatorship , durao barroso was a marxist activist , but already at age 20 , his allegiances shifted towards the political center .
durao barroso completed his law degree in lisbon and studied political science in geneva and new york .
at 29 , after returning from the united states , he was elected to parliament .
the following year he was appointed state secretary and later , at 36 , foreign minister . when his party , the conservative liberal social democrats -lrb- psd -rrb- , was voted out of office in 1995 , durao barroso bridged the time back in the united states teaching at georgetown university in washington .
but he returned to portugal and worked his way up in the psd .
his time finally came in march 2002 , when the party , with durao barroso at its helm , - barely - won early elections called after socialist prime minister antonio guterres resigned over poor local election returns . durao barroso worked closely with former spanish prime minister jose maria aznar , and hosted a meeting between aznar , u.s. president george w. bush and british prime minister blair on the azores in march 2003 that cemented the four countries ' decision to cooperate in the iraq war .
portugal still has 120 police deployed in iraq , which durao barroso recently refused to withdraw . horse-trading the " horse-trading " over who would fill the top eu post has been going on intensely since an eu leaders failed to agree on a candidate at a summit in mid-june .
france and germany insisted that the commission head be from a country that fully participates in all eu initiatives , which ruled out britain 's chris patten , since his country is not part of the single currency .
britain had already succeeded in blocking germany 's choice , belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt , partly because he was considered too critical of u.s. foreign policy . france was adamant that the eu president should speak french .
the conservative-liberal european people 's party , the largest political group in the european parliament , demanded a candidate from the center-right .
others pressed for a politician experienced in the highest government levels .
still others asserted that the right person for the job should be from a smaller eu country . in the end , the 48-year-old portuguese prime minister fits all the requirements .
and besides french , he also speaks english and spanish .
unless durao barroso 's nomination is accepted by all 25 eu heads of state on tuesday , the european parliament will have to vote on whether to appoint him , which could happen as early as mid-july .
he would almost certainly be approved by the conservative-liberal dominated parliament .
he would take office in november . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de portugal hopes for euro economic bonus when portugal hosts this year 's european championship this summer , thousands of visiting soccer fans will spend plenty of euros .

serbian voters go to the polls sunday in crucial presidential elections that pit pro-eu reformer boris tadic against ultranationalist tomislav nikolic .
the result will largely determine the country 's political direction . on paper , serbia 's five-year presidency is largely ceremonial , but former president milosevic proved how effectively its few powers could be exploited . sunday 's vote could thus determine whether serbia moves closer to the eu and nato and improves relations with the west or lapses back into the chauvinism and isolation reminiscent of milosevic 's former regime . opinion polls this week gave boris tadic , a pro-europe liberal , a lead of up to 54 percent against 46 percent for tomislav nikolic , an ardent nationalist whose radical party propped up milosevic 's regime and supported his military adventures in the 1990s . but despite the lead enjoyed by tadic , analysts say that a turnout of under 40 percent could still hand the presidency to nikolic , who commands greater loyalty among his supporters . choosing between eu and belarus european union officials have warned that a victory for nikolic would diplomatically isolate serbia , whereas a win for tadic would ease relations . chris patten , the european commissioner for external affairs , said this week that serbs had a choice " between joining the european family or belarus . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tomislav nikolic , frontrunner of the ultranationalist serbian radical party .
nikolic -lrb- photo -rrb- is against serbia 's entry to the eu and any victory for him could leave serbia isolated on the international stage and scare off investors from the west . " we need the east .
russia supplies us with resources and power .
why should n't we exploit that ?
the west should help us to manufacture goods and we should sell them in the east , " nikolic said recently . championing himself as the candidate for the working class , nikolic 's strident rhetoric and calls to limit foreign trade appeal to the unemployed , which make up almost 30 percent of the country 's 7.5 million inhabitants . " serbia has opened its doors to the west , but the west has n't improved your lives .
it has n't made the factories churn out more or brought better harvests , " nikolic said . " eu will improve our lives " tadic , on the other hand , has made no bones about the fact that he 'd like to see serbia in the eu and even the nato one day .
an admirer of assassinated prime minister zoran djindjic , tadic took over the democratic party in february after djindjic 's death .
he has vowed to continue with the reform agenda started by djindjic . tadic is considered popular with business leaders , artists and women alike and has continued the policies of his pro-western predecessor , calling for open borders and greater tolerance . " we must become a member of the european union .
we must continue with these reforms , so we can join the bloc .
that would improve our lives .
without the eu , we can not overcome our problems , " tadic said . the vote could n't be further polarized with the two candidates unequivocal about where they 'd like to take serbia in the future .
opinion polls , however , show serbs to be divided , with many wanting to improve relations with the west but hostile to cooperating further with the international war crimes tribunal , which is trying a host of serbian leaders including milosevic for war crimes at the hague . tough decisions over kosovo the country also faces tough decisions over kosovo , the united nations-administered province , which belgrade insists remain part of serbia even though the majority ethnic albanian population wants independence . nikolic has called for sending security forces back to the troubled province of kosovo , inhabited mainly by ethnic albanians .
he clings to the dream of a greater serbia - saying it would be good for his people if all serbs were united . tadic , meanwhile , advocates a political solution to the future of kosovo . reform versus stagnation reporters at belgrade 's independent television station b-92 expect the election to be a watershed event for serbia .
they say if tadic wins , serbia will open up .

nikolic got 45.1 percent of the vote according to independent monitors from belgrade 's cesid group . more than 6.5 million voters were eligible to cast ballots .
analysts said turnout was 48.5 percent . the presidential election was widely seen as crucial to determine whether serbia would move towards the eu and adopt western-style reforms or whether it would lapse into the nationalist isolation and diplomatic wilderness of the autocratic milosevic regime . three previous attempts to elect a president since 2002 failed because too few voters showed up at the polls .
this vote was certain to produce a president regardless of the turnout , after parliament earlier this year scrapped a 50 percent turnout requirement . " we must join the eu " tadic , who is considered popular with artists and business leaders alike , has received support from prime minister vojislav kostunica , ethnic minorities and dozens of local celebrities . the sarajevo-born psychologist and belgrade college professor had made closer ties with the west a central plank of his campaign .
" we must become a member of the european union .
we must continue with these reforms , so we can join the bloc .
that would improve our lives .
without the eu , we can not overcome our problems , " tadic said . tadic took over the leadership of the democratic party after the march 2003 assassination of zoran djindjic , the democrats ' leader and serbia 's first noncommunist prime minister since world war ii . he has vowed to continue with the reform agenda of his predecessor .
tadic is also an ardent supporter of extraditing serb war crimes suspects to the u.n. war crimes tribunal in the hague , where milosevic and others are standing trial on charges related to their roles in the balkan wars in the 1990s . " the west has n't improved our life " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tomislav nikolic of the ultranationalist serbian radical party .
tadic 's challenger , 52-year-old nikolic -lrb- photo -rrb- is against serbia 's entry to the eu and it was feared that any victory for him could leave serbia isolated on the international stage and scare off investors from the west . after casting his ballot in belgrade earlier in the day , nikolic predicted a tight race but said his " victory would return pride and dignity to serbia . " championing himself as the candidate for the working class , nikolic 's strident rhetoric and calls to limit foreign trade appeal to the unemployed , which make up almost 30 percent of the country 's 7.5 million inhabitants . " serbia has opened its doors to the west , but the west has n't improved your lives .
it has n't made the factories churn out more or brought better harvests , " nikolic said . nikolic has also strongly opposed western demands that belgrade extradite serbs to the hague , and had said that if he won the presidency , he would dedicate his victory to milosevic . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de serbs face clear choice in presidential polls serbian voters go to the polls sunday in crucial presidential elections that pit pro-eu reformer boris tadic against ultranationalist tomislav nikolic .

nikolic got 45.1 percent of the vote according to independent monitors from belgrade 's cesid group . more than 6.5 million voters were eligible to cast ballots .
analysts said turnout was 48.5 percent . the presidential election was widely seen as crucial to determine whether serbia would move towards the eu and adopt western-style reforms or whether it would lapse into the nationalist isolation and diplomatic wilderness of the autocratic milosevic regime . three previous attempts to elect a president since 2002 failed because too few voters showed up at the polls .
this vote was certain to produce a president regardless of the turnout , after parliament earlier this year scrapped a 50 percent turnout requirement . " we must join the eu " tadic , who is considered popular with artists and business leaders alike , has received support from prime minister vojislav kostunica , ethnic minorities and dozens of local celebrities . the sarajevo-born psychologist and belgrade college professor had made closer ties with the west a central plank of his campaign .
" we must become a member of the european union .

tadic is also an ardent supporter of extraditing serb war crimes suspects to the u.n. war crimes tribunal in the hague , where milosevic and others are standing trial on charges related to their roles in the balkan wars in the 1990s . " the west has n't improved our life " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tomislav nikolic of the ultranationalist serbian radical party .
tadic 's challenger , 52-year-old nikolic -lrb- photo -rrb- is against serbia 's entry to the eu and it was feared that any victory for him could leave serbia isolated on the international stage and scare off investors from the west . after casting his ballot in belgrade earlier in the day , nikolic predicted a tight race but said his " victory would return pride and dignity to serbia . " championing himself as the candidate for the working class , nikolic 's strident rhetoric and calls to limit foreign trade appeal to the unemployed , which make up almost 30 percent of the country 's 7.5 million inhabitants . " serbia has opened its doors to the west , but the west has n't improved your lives .
it has n't made the factories churn out more or brought better harvests , " nikolic said . nikolic has also strongly opposed western demands that belgrade extradite serbs to the hague , and had said that if he won the presidency , he would dedicate his victory to milosevic . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de serbs face clear choice in presidential polls serbian voters go to the polls sunday in crucial presidential elections that pit pro-eu reformer boris tadic against ultranationalist tomislav nikolic .

nikolic got 45.1 percent of the vote according to independent monitors from belgrade 's cesid group . more than 6.5 million voters were eligible to cast ballots .
analysts said turnout was 48.5 percent . the presidential election was widely seen as crucial to determine whether serbia would move towards the eu and adopt western-style reforms or whether it would lapse into the nationalist isolation and diplomatic wilderness of the autocratic milosevic regime . three previous attempts to elect a president since 2002 failed because too few voters showed up at the polls .
this vote was certain to produce a president regardless of the turnout , after parliament earlier this year scrapped a 50 percent turnout requirement . " we must join the eu " tadic , who is considered popular with artists and business leaders alike , has received support from prime minister vojislav kostunica , ethnic minorities and dozens of local celebrities . the sarajevo-born psychologist and belgrade college professor had made closer ties with the west a central plank of his campaign .
" we must become a member of the european union .
we must continue with these reforms , so we can join the bloc .
that would improve our lives .
without the eu , we can not overcome our problems , " tadic said . tadic took over the leadership of the democratic party after the march 2003 assassination of zoran djindjic , the democrats ' leader and serbia 's first noncommunist prime minister since world war ii . he has vowed to continue with the reform agenda of his predecessor .
tadic is also an ardent supporter of extraditing serb war crimes suspects to the u.n. war crimes tribunal in the hague , where milosevic and others are standing trial on charges related to their roles in the balkan wars in the 1990s . " the west has n't improved our life " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tomislav nikolic of the ultranationalist serbian radical party .

but germany has made it clear its non-engagement pledge remains . on sunday , the 26 nato heads of state and government attended a formal dinner in an ottoman-era palace on the banks of the bosporus to thrash out an agreement on a nato role in training military and police forces for the future sovereign iraqi government . differences however remained over when , and especially where , the training is to take place .
the dispute has given german chancellor gerhard schröder another opportunity to stress that no german soldier will set a foot on iraqi soil . shortly before official talks began in istanbul on monday , the german chancellor expressed his support for attempts to bring stability and democracy to iraq .
speaking to journalists in berlin before boarding a plan to istanbul on sunday , gerhard schröder said the transatlantic row over the iraq war belonged in the history books and that all nato states were interested in improving security in iraq .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 28.06.2004 viacom snaps up german mtv rival viva großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the much-loved german music broadcaster viva has been bought by viacom mtv owner viacom last week announced it would be buying a majority stake in german rival viva media .
critics fear the buyout could crush competition in the music video market . rumors of the planned bid had been circulating for months , so it was no big surprise when u.s. media giant viacom revealed thursday that a group of 14 viva shareholders , including media conglomerates time warner inc. and vivendi universal , would be selling viacom 75.8 percent of the cologne-based music tv broadcaster 's shares , an offer supported by viva 's management .
the deal , which values viva at € 308.8 million -lrb- $ 373 million -rrb- , is viacom 's largest ever acquisition outside the united states .
bill rhoedy , president of mtv networks international , said the takeover would n't be stopping there .
viacom is now expected to make a further offer for the remaining 24.2 percent . " we want to acquire 100 percent , " he stressed in frankfurt last week .
" germany is the largest cable and satellite market in the world outside the u.s. , " he added , saying , " we believe there 's enormous potential for growth in this market and viva will help consolidate us in germany and europe . "
tom freston , viacom 's co-president , echoed his statements .
" acquiring viva is a top priority to drive mtv 's expansion in germany , " he said , emphasizing that " it 's a critical tv market globally . "
former rivals the two-step deal is by no means without its critics - first and foremost because viacom 's acquisition of loss-making viva will increase mtv 's presence in germany from two to four channels and make it the dominant force within germany 's music-television landscape .
viva first hit tv screens in 1993 , charged with challenging mtv 's hegemony by promoting the german music industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heike makatsch viva 's two channels soon cornered a market share of 3.2 percent in the target audience of 14-to-29-year-olds , beaming in to some 32 million homes .
the station gave homegrown bands such as die fantastischen vier and guano apes their breakthrough and helped launch the careers of a whole host of german celebrities , including stefan raab and heike makatsch -lrb- photo -rrb- , who recently appeared in the british hit film " love actually . "
with insiders concerned that germany 's domestic music scene will now have to take a back seat , mtv insists it will still be concentrating on local culture .
" we 're not going to just replant a u.s. brand in germany , " catherine muehlemann , manager of mtv central , told reporters .
" we want to keep our focus local . "
regulatory issues nonetheless , the deal may attract regulatory scrutiny .
according to reuters , industry sources expect major music labels and german tv channels to complain to cartel officials about the deal , arguing that it gives viacom a stronghold on which videos are broadcast as well as the related advertising market .
simon guild , deputy head of mtv networks europe , told reuters that he did not expect " material regulatory issues " but admitted the deal would have to be submitted to authorities for approval .
viacom also pointed out that the deal was subject to german merger and media ownership approvals .
shares rise viva operates two music channels in germany , while its brain pool unit produces tv shows and movies such as the hugely popular comedy shows " tv total , " " ladykracher " and " anke late night . "
it owns a 51 percent stake in its viva plus tv channel , while the rest is owned by time warner inc . , which is now selling its stake to viacom . recent years saw viva hard hit by the german advertising slump , with net tv advertising sales falling 20 percent since 2000 .
in 2003 , it posted losses of € 42 million .
but once the viacom bid was clinched , viva 's shares were up 5.3 percent at € 12.64 , trading just one cent shy of the offer price , € 12.65 a share , and hitting their highest level for almost two years .
viva stock more than doubled over the past year on speculation of a takeover , and the bid represents a 21 percent premium over its average share price over the three months before the offer .

critics fear the buyout could crush competition in the music video market . rumors of the planned bid had been circulating for months , so it was no big surprise when u.s. media giant viacom revealed thursday that a group of 14 viva shareholders , including media conglomerates time warner inc. and vivendi universal , would be selling viacom 75.8 percent of the cologne-based music tv broadcaster 's shares , an offer supported by viva 's management .
the deal , which values viva at € 308.8 million -lrb- $ 373 million -rrb- , is viacom 's largest ever acquisition outside the united states .
bill rhoedy , president of mtv networks international , said the takeover would n't be stopping there .
viacom is now expected to make a further offer for the remaining 24.2 percent . " we want to acquire 100 percent , " he stressed in frankfurt last week .
" germany is the largest cable and satellite market in the world outside the u.s. , " he added , saying , " we believe there 's enormous potential for growth in this market and viva will help consolidate us in germany and europe . "
tom freston , viacom 's co-president , echoed his statements .
" acquiring viva is a top priority to drive mtv 's expansion in germany , " he said , emphasizing that " it 's a critical tv market globally . "
former rivals the two-step deal is by no means without its critics - first and foremost because viacom 's acquisition of loss-making viva will increase mtv 's presence in germany from two to four channels and make it the dominant force within germany 's music-television landscape .
viva first hit tv screens in 1993 , charged with challenging mtv 's hegemony by promoting the german music industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heike makatsch viva 's two channels soon cornered a market share of 3.2 percent in the target audience of 14-to-29-year-olds , beaming in to some 32 million homes .
the station gave homegrown bands such as die fantastischen vier and guano apes their breakthrough and helped launch the careers of a whole host of german celebrities , including stefan raab and heike makatsch -lrb- photo -rrb- , who recently appeared in the british hit film " love actually . "
with insiders concerned that germany 's domestic music scene will now have to take a back seat , mtv insists it will still be concentrating on local culture .
" we 're not going to just replant a u.s. brand in germany , " catherine muehlemann , manager of mtv central , told reporters .
" we want to keep our focus local . "
regulatory issues nonetheless , the deal may attract regulatory scrutiny .
according to reuters , industry sources expect major music labels and german tv channels to complain to cartel officials about the deal , arguing that it gives viacom a stronghold on which videos are broadcast as well as the related advertising market .
simon guild , deputy head of mtv networks europe , told reuters that he did not expect " material regulatory issues " but admitted the deal would have to be submitted to authorities for approval .
viacom also pointed out that the deal was subject to german merger and media ownership approvals .
shares rise viva operates two music channels in germany , while its brain pool unit produces tv shows and movies such as the hugely popular comedy shows " tv total , " " ladykracher " and " anke late night . "
it owns a 51 percent stake in its viva plus tv channel , while the rest is owned by time warner inc . , which is now selling its stake to viacom . recent years saw viva hard hit by the german advertising slump , with net tv advertising sales falling 20 percent since 2000 .
in 2003 , it posted losses of € 42 million .
but once the viacom bid was clinched , viva 's shares were up 5.3 percent at € 12.64 , trading just one cent shy of the offer price , € 12.65 a share , and hitting their highest level for almost two years .
viva stock more than doubled over the past year on speculation of a takeover , and the bid represents a 21 percent premium over its average share price over the three months before the offer .

u.s. administrator paul bremer passed the legal documentation to iraqi chief justice midhat al-mahmodi and with them the running of the war-torn country , 15 months after the invasion to remove saddam hussein . during the ceremony , bremer told the assembled officials that as " ex-administrator of the coalition provisional authority " he would " leave iraq confident in the future and confident in the ability of the government to meet the challenges of the future . "
coalition officials said bremer left iraq less than an hour after the ceremony , saying that he was " going home . " reactions from the international community on the whole were positive , with europe 's leaders among the first to offer words of support for the new government .
however , the overall feeling was one of caution . europe sends muted congratulations the german government displayed little excitement over the surprise move , simply sending its cordial greetings to the new , sovereign government in baghdad . deputy government spokesman hans-hermann langguth reported that immediately after the news broke monday morning , chancellor schröder sent a letter to the iraqi president , iyad allawi , congratulating him on his country ’ s new sovereignty .
however , langguth added that the handover of power did not mean that germany would be changing its policy on iraq . " the german envoy in baghdad has handed over a letter to the iraqi president pledging germany ’ s support in rebuilding the country , " he said .
" the chancellor also made it clear that we are prepared to give humanitarian assistance wherever possible , but that this would not include sending troops to iraq . " antje leendertse , spokeswomen for the german foreign ministry , expressed the hope that iraq could now find a respected place among the family of independent nations .
she added that the government in baghdad still faced difficult times ahead . " it ’ s clear that the next important step must be democratic elections under united nations guidance at the end of the year , " she said .
" germany will wholeheartedly support the world body in its effort to make these elections possible . " leendertse said germany ’ s willingness to contribute to the training of iraqi police and military forces , but said this was only possible outside the country . volker rühe , defense expert with the conservative opposition , said it was important to scale back the presence of foreign troops in iraq and strengthen the newly established iraqi police force .
he reiterated his opinion that the disbanding of the old iraqi army by the u.s.-led provisional authority was a major mistake which had contributed to the current security problems in iraq . in france , the reception was equally lukewarm .
french president jacques chirac had " taken note " of the transfer , but the handover was only one step in the political process there , his spokeswoman told afp on monday .
" the transfer of sovereignty is a long-awaited event , important .
it is a step in the political process that will run until 2005 , " she said .
" other steps must follow and france wishes the interim government and the iraqi people every success . " british prime minister tony blair 's spokesman told reporters that downing street welcomed the earlier-than-expected handover , saying it was an attempt to " seize the initiative " from the insurgents .
" we obviously welcome it because it 's their decision and it 's them taking control , " he said .
" what 's important now is that the iraqi people can see iraqi leaders taking charge in baghdad . " irish foreign minister brian cowen , in a statement on behalf of the eu presidency , which ireland currently holds , said that he wished iraq 's government " every success in their mission to govern iraq to the stage where free and fair elections can take place .

u.s. administrator paul bremer passed the legal documentation to iraqi chief justice midhat al-mahmodi and with them the running of the war-torn country , 15 months after the invasion to remove saddam hussein . during the ceremony , bremer told the assembled officials that as " ex-administrator of the coalition provisional authority " he would " leave iraq confident in the future and confident in the ability of the government to meet the challenges of the future . "
coalition officials said bremer left iraq less than an hour after the ceremony , saying that he was " going home . " reactions from the international community on the whole were positive , with europe 's leaders among the first to offer words of support for the new government .
however , the overall feeling was one of caution . europe sends muted congratulations the german government displayed little excitement over the surprise move , simply sending its cordial greetings to the new , sovereign government in baghdad . deputy government spokesman hans-hermann langguth reported that immediately after the news broke monday morning , chancellor schröder sent a letter to the iraqi president , iyad allawi , congratulating him on his country ’ s new sovereignty .
however , langguth added that the handover of power did not mean that germany would be changing its policy on iraq . " the german envoy in baghdad has handed over a letter to the iraqi president pledging germany ’ s support in rebuilding the country , " he said .
" the chancellor also made it clear that we are prepared to give humanitarian assistance wherever possible , but that this would not include sending troops to iraq . " antje leendertse , spokeswomen for the german foreign ministry , expressed the hope that iraq could now find a respected place among the family of independent nations .
she added that the government in baghdad still faced difficult times ahead . " it ’ s clear that the next important step must be democratic elections under united nations guidance at the end of the year , " she said .
" germany will wholeheartedly support the world body in its effort to make these elections possible . " leendertse said germany ’ s willingness to contribute to the training of iraqi police and military forces , but said this was only possible outside the country . volker rühe , defense expert with the conservative opposition , said it was important to scale back the presence of foreign troops in iraq and strengthen the newly established iraqi police force .
he reiterated his opinion that the disbanding of the old iraqi army by the u.s.-led provisional authority was a major mistake which had contributed to the current security problems in iraq . in france , the reception was equally lukewarm .
french president jacques chirac had " taken note " of the transfer , but the handover was only one step in the political process there , his spokeswoman told afp on monday .
" the transfer of sovereignty is a long-awaited event , important .
it is a step in the political process that will run until 2005 , " she said .
" other steps must follow and france wishes the interim government and the iraqi people every success . " british prime minister tony blair 's spokesman told reporters that downing street welcomed the earlier-than-expected handover , saying it was an attempt to " seize the initiative " from the insurgents .
" we obviously welcome it because it 's their decision and it 's them taking control , " he said .
" what 's important now is that the iraqi people can see iraqi leaders taking charge in baghdad . " irish foreign minister brian cowen , in a statement on behalf of the eu presidency , which ireland currently holds , said that he wished iraq 's government " every success in their mission to govern iraq to the stage where free and fair elections can take place .

as once strong relations between germany 's unions and the ruling social democrats plunge to new lows , one of the labor movement 's most-powerful leaders threatens to withdraw his support for chancellor gerhard schröder . frank bsirske , head of the german public sector union ver.di , infuriated the coalition government of social democrats and greens over the weekend by telling the newspaper welt am sonntag that chancellor gerhard schröder 's social and economic reform policy has been a huge failure .
" measured against his claim that he would create jobs , reduce joblessness and pep up the economy , gerhard schröder has been a failure , " bsirske told the paper .
bsirske acknowledged that cuts to the country 's generous social welfare system were needed to keep it afloat , while at the same time making the allegation that the government 's policy had by no means led to better employment opportunities in the country .
economic growth rates remain at well below 1 percent this year after three years of total stagnation .
move could hurt social democrats for bsirske 's part , the move was calculated .
himself a member of the green party , he knows his criticism will primarily hurt the social democrats .
the spd 's popularity has fallen to an unparalleled low in recent months , while the greens have recorded major gains in regional elections despite the fact that , as the spd 's junior coalition partner , they are also responsible for germany 's current social and economic policies .
bsirske , as well as other union leaders , are hoping to strengthen the rebellious left-wingers within the spd - many of whom harbor nagging doubts about the political reorientation of their party , which has traditionally represented the interests of the underprivileged in society .
schröder : i 'm not budging for his part , schröder told the newsweekly der spiegel that the " unions need to abandon their abstract considerations instead ask concrete questions in their companies . "
schröder said the unions should focus on what 's really best for their workers .
the chancellor also categorically refused to make any additional change to his labor reform laws .
" i 'm not going to do any more snipping , " he said , referring to his agenda 2010 reform plan .
green party chief reinhard bütikofer did what was expected of him and dismissed bsirske ’ s criticism as " unfounded " and " unconstructive . "
and deputy spd chief kurt beck brushed off bsirske ’ s demand for a change of course in the reform process as " nonsense . "
" a change of course – what ’ s that supposed to mean ? "
beck asked .
" weren ’ t we all agreed that considering our own demographic problems and global developments our social system has to be changed in order to survive at all ?
and weren ’ t we all agreed that the necessary reforms could not be carried out without sacrifices ?
so i don ’ t really understand why some are now calling on the government to revise its policy .
we don ’ t have the right to change our course , because we were elected to do the things that are necessary for germany to become competitive again . "
row to enter new round the row between the government and the trade unions is expected to enter yet another round on wednesday , when an inter-parliamentary arbitration committee is scheduled to agree on the details of combining germany 's welfare and unemployment benefits starting next year .
the move is expected to create even greater hardships for the economically disadvantaged .
" it looks as if there is no capacity and no mechanisms in place to make job placement procedures more efficient as of jan .
1 of next year , " said hermann-joseph ahrentz , the social affairs spokesman for the conservative opposition christian democratic union .
" but since long-term unemployed people will get fewer benefits under the new plan , they should at least have the opportunity to find work more easily .
but i can ’ t see this happening .
this is why the government ’ s policy can only be described as a rush job and a patchwork , and as socially unjust , since it hits the poor and underprivileged once again . "
a conundrum for the spd 's base an editorial in the monday issue of the financial times deutschland newspaper concluded that the spat between unions and the spd is making it impossible for core social democrat voters to maintain their loyalty to both their party and the trade unions .
both are complaining about dwindling membership .
bsirske and his colleagues are well aware that with a conservative government at the helm in 2006 the unions are even less likely to strike a deal for softer reforms .
but the unions may have another strategy altogether .

as once strong relations between germany 's unions and the ruling social democrats plunge to new lows , one of the labor movement 's most-powerful leaders threatens to withdraw his support for chancellor gerhard schröder . frank bsirske , head of the german public sector union ver.di , infuriated the coalition government of social democrats and greens over the weekend by telling the newspaper welt am sonntag that chancellor gerhard schröder 's social and economic reform policy has been a huge failure .
" measured against his claim that he would create jobs , reduce joblessness and pep up the economy , gerhard schröder has been a failure , " bsirske told the paper .
bsirske acknowledged that cuts to the country 's generous social welfare system were needed to keep it afloat , while at the same time making the allegation that the government 's policy had by no means led to better employment opportunities in the country .
economic growth rates remain at well below 1 percent this year after three years of total stagnation .
move could hurt social democrats for bsirske 's part , the move was calculated .
himself a member of the green party , he knows his criticism will primarily hurt the social democrats .
the spd 's popularity has fallen to an unparalleled low in recent months , while the greens have recorded major gains in regional elections despite the fact that , as the spd 's junior coalition partner , they are also responsible for germany 's current social and economic policies .
bsirske , as well as other union leaders , are hoping to strengthen the rebellious left-wingers within the spd - many of whom harbor nagging doubts about the political reorientation of their party , which has traditionally represented the interests of the underprivileged in society .
schröder : i 'm not budging for his part , schröder told the newsweekly der spiegel that the " unions need to abandon their abstract considerations instead ask concrete questions in their companies . "
schröder said the unions should focus on what 's really best for their workers .
the chancellor also categorically refused to make any additional change to his labor reform laws .
" i 'm not going to do any more snipping , " he said , referring to his agenda 2010 reform plan .
green party chief reinhard bütikofer did what was expected of him and dismissed bsirske ’ s criticism as " unfounded " and " unconstructive . "
and deputy spd chief kurt beck brushed off bsirske ’ s demand for a change of course in the reform process as " nonsense . "
" a change of course – what ’ s that supposed to mean ? "
beck asked .
" weren ’ t we all agreed that considering our own demographic problems and global developments our social system has to be changed in order to survive at all ?
and weren ’ t we all agreed that the necessary reforms could not be carried out without sacrifices ?
so i don ’ t really understand why some are now calling on the government to revise its policy .
we don ’ t have the right to change our course , because we were elected to do the things that are necessary for germany to become competitive again . "
row to enter new round the row between the government and the trade unions is expected to enter yet another round on wednesday , when an inter-parliamentary arbitration committee is scheduled to agree on the details of combining germany 's welfare and unemployment benefits starting next year .
the move is expected to create even greater hardships for the economically disadvantaged .
" it looks as if there is no capacity and no mechanisms in place to make job placement procedures more efficient as of jan .
1 of next year , " said hermann-joseph ahrentz , the social affairs spokesman for the conservative opposition christian democratic union .
" but since long-term unemployed people will get fewer benefits under the new plan , they should at least have the opportunity to find work more easily .
but i can ’ t see this happening .
this is why the government ’ s policy can only be described as a rush job and a patchwork , and as socially unjust , since it hits the poor and underprivileged once again . "
a conundrum for the spd 's base an editorial in the monday issue of the financial times deutschland newspaper concluded that the spat between unions and the spd is making it impossible for core social democrat voters to maintain their loyalty to both their party and the trade unions .
both are complaining about dwindling membership .

but i can ’ t see this happening .
this is why the government ’ s policy can only be described as a rush job and a patchwork , and as socially unjust , since it hits the poor and underprivileged once again . "
a conundrum for the spd 's base an editorial in the monday issue of the financial times deutschland newspaper concluded that the spat between unions and the spd is making it impossible for core social democrat voters to maintain their loyalty to both their party and the trade unions .
both are complaining about dwindling membership .
bsirske and his colleagues are well aware that with a conservative government at the helm in 2006 the unions are even less likely to strike a deal for softer reforms .
but the unions may have another strategy altogether .
as bsirske noted on sunday : the unions could much more easily fight a conservative chancellor than a social democrat who claims to be on the unions ' side . hardy graupner -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

portuguese prime minister durao barroso is expected to fill a position with prerequisites few candidates can satisfy . irish prime minister bertie ahern , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said sunday he would propose portuguese prime minister jose manuel durao barroso for the eu 's top job at a special bloc summit set for tuesday evening . ahern said there was " overwhelming support " for durao barroso .
german chancellor gerhard schröder stressed sunday that durao barroso " could count on germany 's support , " and british prime minister tony blair said he was certain barroso " would do an outstanding job " and that he hoped he would " be able to accept the challenge , " the associated press reported . so far durao barroso has n't commented on taking over the reins from outgoing eu commission president romano prodi .
assuming he does so though , portugal will be faced with the challenge figuring out what to do next , since the country has no clear rules for how to replace him . shifting allegiances in his youth , as a law student under the portuguese dictatorship , durao barroso was a marxist activist , but already at age 20 , his allegiances shifted towards the political center .
durao barroso completed his law degree in lisbon and studied political science in geneva and new york .
at 29 , after returning from the united states , he was elected to parliament .
the following year he was appointed state secretary and later , at 36 , foreign minister . when his party , the conservative liberal social democrats -lrb- psd -rrb- , was voted out of office in 1995 , durao barroso bridged the time back in the united states teaching at georgetown university in washington .
but he returned to portugal and worked his way up in the psd .
his time finally came in march 2002 , when the party , with durao barroso at its helm , - barely - won early elections called after socialist prime minister antonio guterres resigned over poor local election returns . durao barroso worked closely with former spanish prime minister jose maria aznar , and hosted a meeting between aznar , u.s. president george w. bush and british prime minister blair on the azores in march 2003 that cemented the four countries ' decision to cooperate in the iraq war .
portugal still has 120 police deployed in iraq , which durao barroso recently refused to withdraw . horse-trading the " horse-trading " over who would fill the top eu post has been going on intensely since an eu leaders failed to agree on a candidate at a summit in mid-june .
france and germany insisted that the commission head be from a country that fully participates in all eu initiatives , which ruled out britain 's chris patten , since his country is not part of the single currency .
britain had already succeeded in blocking germany 's choice , belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt , partly because he was considered too critical of u.s. foreign policy . france was adamant that the eu president should speak french .
the conservative-liberal european people 's party , the largest political group in the european parliament , demanded a candidate from the center-right .
others pressed for a politician experienced in the highest government levels .
still others asserted that the right person for the job should be from a smaller eu country . in the end , the 48-year-old portuguese prime minister fits all the requirements .
and besides french , he also speaks english and spanish .
unless durao barroso 's nomination is accepted by all 25 eu heads of state on tuesday , the european parliament will have to vote on whether to appoint him , which could happen as early as mid-july .
he would almost certainly be approved by the conservative-liberal dominated parliament .
he would take office in november . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de portugal hopes for euro economic bonus when portugal hosts this year 's european championship this summer , thousands of visiting soccer fans will spend plenty of euros .

the charges relate to his alleged role in a nationalist coup four years ago .
mr seniloli is the most senior figure to face charges over the uprising , which ousted the government of fiji 's first ethnic indian prime minister , mahendra chaudhry .
the coup was led by george speight - a failed businessman who is serving a life sentence for treason .
' unlawful oath ' mr seniloli is accused of being sworn in as president by speight when the former rebel leader was attempting to take over the country in may 2000 .
at the time , members of fiji 's elected government were being held at gunpoint inside the parliament compound in the capital , suva .
it is claimed mr seniloli took an unlawful oath to become president while the incumbent ratu sir kamisese mara was still in office .
the trial is expected to last for two weeks .
there is strict security around the court buildings in suva with police and soldiers on duty .
in total six men are facing charges relating to speight 's attempts to create his own hardline nationalist government in the midst of the chaos that the armed rebellion caused .
the defendants have pleaded not guilty .
despite his suspected links with extremists , mr seniloli was sworn in as vice president in the aftermath of the coup .
his appointment illustrates how fijian nationalism has prospered since the uprising .
prime minister laisenia qarase has been determined to enhance the political and economic power of the indigenous community at the expense of the large ethnic indian minority .

the charges relate to his alleged role in a nationalist coup four years ago .
mr seniloli is the most senior figure to face charges over the uprising , which ousted the government of fiji 's first ethnic indian prime minister , mahendra chaudhry .
the coup was led by george speight - a failed businessman who is serving a life sentence for treason .
' unlawful oath ' mr seniloli is accused of being sworn in as president by speight when the former rebel leader was attempting to take over the country in may 2000 .
at the time , members of fiji 's elected government were being held at gunpoint inside the parliament compound in the capital , suva .
it is claimed mr seniloli took an unlawful oath to become president while the incumbent ratu sir kamisese mara was still in office .
the trial is expected to last for two weeks .
there is strict security around the court buildings in suva with police and soldiers on duty .
in total six men are facing charges relating to speight 's attempts to create his own hardline nationalist government in the midst of the chaos that the armed rebellion caused .
the defendants have pleaded not guilty .
despite his suspected links with extremists , mr seniloli was sworn in as vice president in the aftermath of the coup .
his appointment illustrates how fijian nationalism has prospered since the uprising .
prime minister laisenia qarase has been determined to enhance the political and economic power of the indigenous community at the expense of the large ethnic indian minority .

the cash has been invested by the heritage lottery fund in more than 54 schemes throughout the region .
these have included work with water voles and red kites .
funding has been used to buy , create and restore vital habitats and also invested in training volunteers to monitor and improve habitats .
keith bartlett , from the heritage lottery fund , said : " few people realise that every lottery ticket has the potential to save the uk 's landscapes , countryside and creatures but bats are as important a part of our heritage as a botticelli .
improve habitats " imagine if future generations do n't have the chance to see a red kite take to the skies or spot a water vole diving for cover because we did n't do enough to save them now . "
using heritage lottery fund cash , newcastle city council bought land at prestwick carr , dinnington , so it could be developed for a number of rare and threatened animals .
it is now home to birds like skylark , lapwing and partridge , as well as water voles .
another project is the water vole recovery plan in houghton-le-spring which has trained volunteers to monitor and improve its habitats .
the pastures for people project in durham encourages local people to learn about the grasslands , preserving wildflowers and butterflies .

four hours later , he refused to believe it when his son came into his bedroom and told him the tunnel was alight .
temperatures during the fire reached 1,000 degrees centigrade - reporters allowed on site afterwards said the fallen concrete debris was like snow .
" it was as if a lorry had gone in with aggregates , " the firefighter said . "
i will never forget what i saw and what i smelled " eurotunnel worker " when concrete is superheated , the stones move around and fall as ballast . "
staff at the tunnel still refer to the fire as " the accident that was never going to happen " - and some have even compared it to the titanic .
one woman said : " i will never forget what i saw and what i smelled . "
once the fire had been extinguished , debate raged about the tunnel 's safety .

and in 1998 , an inquiry into the fire said a malicious act was the most likely cause .
now eurotunnel staff and emergency teams on site are keen to show off improvements made since .
" we were advised to put certain things into practice - we did more , " a spokeswoman said .
" when the tunnel started , it had no history .
" they had a train set - they built it and it started to run .
" the safety systems are something they have learned over time .

and each year , an emergency exercise is staged , when the tunnel is closed and all agencies are brought in , and which the english and french lead in turn .
small incidents are dealt with by fire crews on site who provide a " first level of response " .
train evacuations in a larger incident , on-site fire crews control evacuations , oversee the safety of the service tunnel between the two railway tunnels and manage communication .
the " second level of response " then comes from kent fire and rescue service and the french fire brigade .
in the event of a fire , staff would try to keep a burning train moving until it cleared the tunnel , the spokeswoman said .
she said if a train had to be evacuated , passengers go through the service tunnel to a waiting train in the second railway tunnel , to bring them out safely .

the mersey tunnels bill has sparked controversy with campaigners against it describing it as a " tax on people going to work " .
if it is agreed , owner merseytravel says the extra profits could be used for tunnel improvements .
but campaigners say they do not believe this would happen .
the bill does not propose a specific price rise but means merseytravel could increase charges in future without needing the approval of parliament .
debt repayments the campaigners , the mersey tunnels users association -lrb- mtua -rrb- , who are not allied to any political party , said the bill would turn the river mersey into a " psychological and economic berlin wall " .
according to merseytravel about 25m vehicles use the tunnels each year , paying £ 1.20 to cross between birkenhead and liverpool .
the charges generate £ 30m in annual revenue , but the firm claims this is all used to cover operating costs , debt repayments and refurbishment costs .
however , the mtua said any increase will cause difficulties for those who can least afford to pay them .
" it will hit the least well-off motorists hardest as an indiscriminate tax that falls equally on the rich and the poor , " a spokesman said .
" if the bill is not stopped merseyside will become unique in britain , outside london . "
lord hunt of wirral is supporting the campaigners , saying original legislation promised tolls would be reduced or stopped once tunnel construction costs had been covered .
however , supporters of the bill say the revenue would help bring the tunnels up to european safety standards .

the mersey tunnels bill has sparked controversy with campaigners against it describing it as a " tax on people going to work " .
if it is agreed , owner merseytravel says the extra profits could be used for tunnel improvements .
but campaigners say they do not believe this would happen .
the bill does not propose a specific price rise but means merseytravel could increase charges in future without needing the approval of parliament .
debt repayments the campaigners , the mersey tunnels users association -lrb- mtua -rrb- , who are not allied to any political party , said the bill would turn the river mersey into a " psychological and economic berlin wall " .
according to merseytravel about 25m vehicles use the tunnels each year , paying £ 1.20 to cross between birkenhead and liverpool .
the charges generate £ 30m in annual revenue , but the firm claims this is all used to cover operating costs , debt repayments and refurbishment costs .
however , the mtua said any increase will cause difficulties for those who can least afford to pay them .
" it will hit the least well-off motorists hardest as an indiscriminate tax that falls equally on the rich and the poor , " a spokesman said .

the machine was introduced as part of a £ 1.4m scheme to modernise and expand basildon hospital pharmacy .
nhs managers hope it will cut down on the number of dispensing mistakes , speed up the service , and free up staff so they can improve the service .
the modernisation project has taken two years to complete , and the robot is the first of its kind to be installed into an essex hospital .
the robot works in a similar way to a canned drinks machine and stores stock which is loaded and retrieved by mechanical arms .
fast service once a prescription has been logged , pharmacy staff order the medication and print a patient label from their computer .
the drugs are then picked and placed in a chute by the robot , arriving at the dispenser 's workstation in ten seconds .
geoff sharman , clinical services directorate manager at the hospital said : " the new system will save staff and manpower .
" it will be quicker for patients to get their medicines and help pharmacy staff to provide a more efficient service .
" the robot also uses less storage space than a traditional pharmacy , giving us a more comfortable and spacious working environment . "
the first computerised dispensing machine in the region was unveiled at addenbrooke 's hospital , cambridge , in january .

fast service once a prescription has been logged , pharmacy staff order the medication and print a patient label from their computer .
the drugs are then picked and placed in a chute by the robot , arriving at the dispenser 's workstation in ten seconds .
geoff sharman , clinical services directorate manager at the hospital said : " the new system will save staff and manpower .
" it will be quicker for patients to get their medicines and help pharmacy staff to provide a more efficient service .
" the robot also uses less storage space than a traditional pharmacy , giving us a more comfortable and spacious working environment . "
the first computerised dispensing machine in the region was unveiled at addenbrooke 's hospital , cambridge , in january .

from monday , crawley hospital 's 24-hour unit was to become a minor injuries unit during the night .
the changes would have seen patients needing emergency treatment between 2100 and 0800 taken to east surrey hospital , nine miles away in redhill .
the hospital 's chief executive said the change had been deferred - but would still go ahead at a later date .
extra distance the proposals would see patients taken to hospital by ambulance going to redhill , while people able to take themselves to crawley with less serious problems would still be treated there .
the move was originally planned for august but two weeks ago was brought forward to 28 june because of difficulties staffing the accident and emergency unit at crawley .
when the changes were outlined earlier this year , a hospital spokesman said 75 % of patients who would previously have been treated at crawley would still be seen at the new minor injuries unit .
but some local residents said the extra distance patients would have to travel could cost lives , and protested against the plan .
junior doctors also voiced their concerns in a letter to management and it was announced on monday morning the changes , set to be introduced just hours later , had been postponed .
the chief executive of the surrey and sussex healthcare nhs trust , keith cunningham , said there was no evidence to suggest moving the accident and emergency unit would put patients at risk .
