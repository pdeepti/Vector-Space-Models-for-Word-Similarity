who deserves to be a saint ?
the question is a source of great debate among catholics .
on sunday , charles i of austria will be beatified at the vatican , while an angry dispute erupts over his historic role at home . for centuries , the announcement of the beatification of a new saint had been big news in the catholic church .
at the start of the 21st century one could argue that the importance of such a ceremony has faded somewhat , at least in the media .
but in austria , the naming of emperor charles i , who ruled for just short of two years at the end of world war i , has caused quite a stir , as the country 's leading news magazine referred to the last ruler of the austro-hungarian empire as " the patron saint of losers . "
herbert lackner , chief editor of the viennese magazine profil criticized the beatification of charles i as tantamount to anointing a proponent of war .
although the emperor himself " was not as much of a war hawk as his generals , he was too weak to actually make the decisive turn to peace , " he wrote ahead of sunday 's ceremony .
lackner also said charles was responsible for the use of mustard gas during the end of the war , which resulted in the deaths of hundreds of soldiers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emperor charles i " he was the supreme commander .
if he had ordered them not to use it , they would n't have done so , " lackner said .
powerful name recognition the journalist maintained charles got beatification because the vatican succumbed to decades of lobbying by the habsburg family that formerly ruled austria.british historian and lawyer james bogel , however , claimed the media is acting like the paparazzi by leveling untruths at the habsburg family because of a deep-seated paranoia about the country 's monarchic past .
" if you 've got people with that degree of paranoia , it 's not surprising that they write articles like this , " said the lawyer , who speaks on behalf of the family .
walburga , the countess douglas and granddaughter of charles , was of the same opinion .
speaking to dw-radio from rome , the royal heiress said pope john paul ii was responsible for the decision and has been more creative than his predecessors in picking the new saints of the catholic church .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope john paul ii " our pope tries to find people who can be symbols for a group of persons , and he was trying to find somebody who can become the symbol for the politicians .
he might be the saint for the politicians , " she explained .
as to accusations that charles was a poor statesman and morally reproachable for allowing generals to use deadly mustard gas , the countess recalled that politicians during the time of her grandfather were in a much different position than today , and many were much harsher when it came to war .
" you will always find people who are going to say , how can you beatify a person who was leading a war , " she said , while adding that charles i was fulfilling the will of god .
one miracle is enough in his official biography - published by the vatican - historians argue that charles i strove tirelessly for peace until abdication in 1918 .
as a dedicated catholic , he was also the only european leader who backed the peace efforts of pope benedict the fifteenth .
according to james bogel , there is also no actual record that the emperor actually authorized mustard gas .
during the war " he certainly refused to attack civilian shipping .
he refused to shell italian civilians .
and he refused to send lenin in a sealed train back to russia , " all reasons bogel has cited for showing that charles i was not as bad as the media makes him out to be .
for the vatican , though , the proof of charles ' saintliness lies elsewhere .
the catholic church said the deceased emperor miraculously healed the varicose veins of a brazilian nun when she prayed to him in 1960 , and one miracle is all it takes for beatification . eric campano -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de historians question the beatification of blessed charles the last emperor of the habsburg dynasty , charles the first of austria , is to be beatified by the pope .

"
this week , the european commission will publish a report expected to give turkey the go ahead to start accession talks .
in an interview with deutsche welle , the turkish premier was convinced this would take place . on oct .
6 , the executive branch of the eu will present a long-awaited progress report on ankara 's chances of joining the 25-member bloc .
the findings of the study will form the basis of a decision by eu leaders at a december summit on whether or not to begin membership negotiations with turkey .
the commission is widely expected to give the thumbs up .
however , an impact study to be approved alongside the main recommendations suggests that the predominantly muslim country on the fringe of europe will not be able to count itself a full-fledged member of the eu until well into the next decade .
eu enlargement commissioner günter verheugen has predicted a long and bumpy road full of specific prerequisites both for ankara and the larger bloc .
verheugen , who only two weeks ago announced there were " no more problems on the table " and no further obstacles to beginning accession talks , has now indicated that certain requirements need to be fulfilled before the eu can welcome turkey into its fold .
first among them , according to inside sources , is a restricted access to the european labor market .
in contrast to the current new members who enjoy free circulation of labor after a certain period of time , verheugen favors long-term restrictions for turks seeking jobs in existing member states .
the enlargement commissioner would also like to stipulate changes in the eu agricultural subsidies system , which if left in place would result in annual costs of between 16 and 28 billion euros -lrb- $ 19 to $ 34 billion -rrb- once turkey joins , and stricter controls of political reforms .
no new requirements in an interview with deutsche welle and a small circle of german journalists , turkish minister president recep tayyip erdogan adamantly rejected any further stipulations to beginning membership talks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan refers to the enlargement commissioner as " my good friend , " after günter verheugen announced there were no more problems ahead of beginning negotiations .
" i have never heard anything like that from mr. verheugen , not in any way .
in the catalog of criteria for the european union there is no such thing as requirements for beginning negotiations .
he could perhaps write something about our little faults .
that would be normal and would be cleared up during the negotiation period , " erdogan said .
as to the significant sum in subsidies the eu would have to shoulder in the decade following turkey 's accession , the premier said it was too early to make any such assumptions : " in my opinion it 's too early to begin talking about such things .
in helsinki in 1999 , the eu decided that turkey was a candidate for membership .
all these things were prepared with the full awareness of the eu .
in the coming years , the situation will change dramatically .
one should not only talk about what the eu will have to pay .
one should also say what the eu will gain through turkey 's membership . "
no question of membership in its impact study , the eu commission addresses the economic benefits turkey would bring to the rest of europe and concluded that ankara 's relatively weak economy would not result in a significant boon for the bloc .
despite opposition to turkey 's membership , erdogan is convinced that in december the 25 heads of state and government will recommend starting accession talks .
a further postponement or a rejection is out of the question , the prime minister said .

commissioner verheugen said , there are no more problems on the table .

18 to oct .
3 , munich revolves around beer the world 's largest folk festival ended this weekend in germany .
the annual oktoberfest in munich attracted over six million people and was , as usual , a great party full of dancing , rides , and of course beer . it 's hard to describe oktoberfest to those who have never been there .
part party , festival and carnival with singalongs , costumes , rides and games , the ultimate beer bash is something you just have to experience , says dw-radio 's allison frost , who spoke with several visitors during oktoberfest 's last weekend .
a toast to gemütlichkeit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors lift their maß , one-liter mugs of beer , during the oktoberfest after spending less than an hour in one of the festival 's enormous beer tents , it 's hard to get the refrain of one of the beer drinker 's favorite songs out of your head .
" a toast , a toast to gemütlichkeit . "
it 's an homage to that uniquely german word for the feeling of sociability , hospitality and that relaxed sense of belonging that defies translation .
in munich , bavaria 's capital and the home to oktoberfest , gemütlichkeit is written big - almost as big as the one-liter mugs that are passed around full of beer .
the jovial good spirit that exudes from the packed beer tents and the experience of locking arms and swaying along with hundreds of other strangers is what keeps drawing back visitors .
this year there were over six million .
for wolf wilberg , who comes to the " wiesn , " as the locals call it , every year , there 's just one way to sum up the oktoberfest experience : home .
the retired teacher hails originally from berlin , but has been a " bavarian at heart " for years .
" this is about being among people which share our attitudes towards life .
which means , we are proud of our traditions and we welcome guests from all over the world , " he says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional brass bands are an integral part of the oktoberfest tradition " when you come here , people will say , hocke die heir , which means come here and have a seat .
and it is less than a minute before you are in an intimate talk and you know your neighbor and you share or do not share his opinions .
if you are completely different you at least share the same beer and the same pretzel and that 's that , " wilberg says of the down-home nature of oktoberfest .
jan schöbel , a munich native , has just returned from studying abroad in portland , oregon .
he says he 's glad to be back in town for the big event : " i like the beer .
when i was a little bit younger , i liked the rides . "
but the main reason he likes oktoberfest is " to sit together in a beer tent or in the beer garden if the weather is nice , have fun with friends and meet foreign people . "
when you 've had too much to drink of course the focus is really on the beer .
that 's what the festival is all about .
and as to be expected , people tend to drink to excess .
the brochures and tourist information do n't mention that , but it 's a given .
sometimes the situation gets a bit out of hand or worse .
minor struggles and fist fights with heavy glass beer mugs breaking are not that uncommon , but usually they are quickly suppressed .
police and medical officials are always on hand to make sure things do n't get out of control .
last year the city adopted a two-pronged approach to respond to reports of sexual assault .
it set up a centrally located security point , staffed by women and open everyday from 6:00 at night to 1:00 in the morning .
it also launched a campaign called " a safe oktoberfest for girls and women " to discourage sexual harassment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : view of munich 's oktoberfest with the st. paul 's cathedral in the background do the darker sides of the festival deter visitors or dampen their mood ?
not really , says wolf wilberg .
" i 'm glad that the police have this under control .
there are always people who do not know where the limits are .
but it is more the fun and spirit of friendship and companionship , and people feel that the atmosphere is more important than heavy drinking .

now , many want it back on oct.3 , germany marks 14 years since reunification .
although the physical barrier between east and west is a thing of the past , many germans still speak about the " mauer im kopf " - the wall in the head . in berlin today , there 's very little left of the berlin wall .
even those who 've lived here all their lives have difficulty remembering exactly where it used to be .
but if every fifth person in germany had their way , the barrier that split the country during the cold war would be resurrected .
a recent poll conducted by the forsa research institute found that a quarter of west germans wished the berlin wall could be rebuilt , while 12 percent of east germans said they did n't want to live in a united germany .
it 's not exactly a glowing testimony about the progress made in the 14 years since the wende , the term used here to describe german reunification . stereotypes persist stereotypes about east and west are stubborn .
east germans think of westerners as " besser-wessies , " or arrogant know-it-alls .
west germans , in turn , roll their eyes about the " jammer ossies , " or whining easterners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the glittering skyline of frankfurt 's banking district symbolizes west german wealth " east germans have a false perception of affluence in the west .
they overestimate the level of prosperity , and take the upper income level as the average , so many of their demands are unrealistic , " says klaus schröder , an expert on the former east germany at berlin 's free university .
" west germans are envious when they see how much money is being transferred to the east .
many people feel that the true cost of reunification is being hidden from them . " negative western stereotypes about easterners have even been passed down to the younger generation , to those who were teenagers when the wall fell .
there 's been an exodus of young easterners to western cities in the 14 years following reunification , but those who 've remained in the east are often pegged as lazy , unmotivated , and bitter about their future prospects . those assumptions are wrong , say sociologists at a leading public opinion research institute in the southern german city of allensbach .
they quizzed 2,000 germans on their attitudes on typically western values .
while they concluded that , in the east , values such as equality and social justice ranked higher than individual freedom , the researchers admit they were surprised by the responses of young easterners . advantage of youth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drivers in the old east german trabant cars celebrating reunification " the younger generation of easterners are n't just falling back into a basic attitude of depression , they 're taking initiative , " thomas petersen , project leader at the allensbach institute told dw-world .
" their optimism and strength is tangible , and those are the qualities that a region needs to pull itself out of the doldrums . " that description could apply to leipzig resident rita barwitzki , 26 , who was a pre-teen when the wall fell .
she says living through the experience has made her stronger . " i gave up a piece of my identity , and because of that , there was this impulse to experience new things , and not to stay stuck in the past , " she recalls .
" and there were new things , there was a whole new system .
i think i 'm more free , more independent today because of those changes . " but barwitzki could n't be more different from fellow easterner lutz r. , a berliner who was in his early 30s when the wall fell .
as incredible as it sounds to western ears , lutz says he felt more free under the east german regime than he does now . " freedom is relative .

for me , that means i 'm not free , " lutz told dw-world .

not about the government , of course , but then i did n't have anything against the government .
but at work , if i complained to my boss , he 'd listen , and i did n't have to fear the consequences . " lutz remembers east germany as a great country for young people - a place where he had a steady job , enough food , and a nice apartment located just a few meters from the berlin wall .

the joyous scenes of reunification which inspired the world when the berlin wall fell on nov .
9 , 1989 , have remained images of hope , beacons of reconcilliation and the evidence that incredible social change could be achieved against amazing odds .
but the pictures of fireworks over berlin and the streets filled with embracing germans are in danger of seeping into a rose tint in the face of the increasingly harsh reality of a united germany .
escalating costs , shaky economic side-effects , discrepencies in living standards and employment opportunities have been the flip side of the euphoria created by the healing of a nation divided for 41 years .
however , germany continues to work at the problems arising from the recovery process .
here , dw-world presents a series of articles documenting the ups and downs experienced in the past 12 months since the last celebration . dw-world.de opinion : a progress report on german unity it 's been over 13 years since the fall of the berlin wall , but germans still have a lot to learn about each other before the mental east-west border disappears .

now , many want it back on oct.3 , germany marks 14 years since reunification .
although the physical barrier between east and west is a thing of the past , many germans still speak about the " mauer im kopf " - the wall in the head . in berlin today , there 's very little left of the berlin wall .
even those who 've lived here all their lives have difficulty remembering exactly where it used to be .
but if every fifth person in germany had their way , the barrier that split the country during the cold war would be resurrected .
a recent poll conducted by the forsa research institute found that a quarter of west germans wished the berlin wall could be rebuilt , while 12 percent of east germans said they did n't want to live in a united germany .
it 's not exactly a glowing testimony about the progress made in the 14 years since the wende , the term used here to describe german reunification . stereotypes persist stereotypes about east and west are stubborn .
east germans think of westerners as " besser-wessies , " or arrogant know-it-alls .
west germans , in turn , roll their eyes about the " jammer ossies , " or whining easterners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the glittering skyline of frankfurt 's banking district symbolizes west german wealth " east germans have a false perception of affluence in the west .
they overestimate the level of prosperity , and take the upper income level as the average , so many of their demands are unrealistic , " says klaus schröder , an expert on the former east germany at berlin 's free university .
" west germans are envious when they see how much money is being transferred to the east .
many people feel that the true cost of reunification is being hidden from them . " negative western stereotypes about easterners have even been passed down to the younger generation , to those who were teenagers when the wall fell .
there 's been an exodus of young easterners to western cities in the 14 years following reunification , but those who 've remained in the east are often pegged as lazy , unmotivated , and bitter about their future prospects . those assumptions are wrong , say sociologists at a leading public opinion research institute in the southern german city of allensbach .

" the world economy is strengthening , but the recovery has been uneven , " british chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown said after a meeting of the imf 's policymaking international monetary and financial committee , of which he is chairman .

world bank president james wolfensohn cited " persistent global imbalances , which require , in particular , readjustment of monetary and fiscal policies in the us , and structural reforms to boost growth in japan , europe and elsewhere . "
he noted that heavily indebted and oil-importing developing countries " are vulnerable to the combination or rising oil prices and interest rates .
mitigating and managing these risks remain important challenges for us all . "
britain sets the example for debt relief following on the heels of the g7 meeting , the imf steering committee also addressed the need to improve debt relief for the world 's poorest nations .
as in the meeting two days earlier between financial leaders from the world 's wealthiest nations , the imf was full of pledges and affirmations , but failed to endorse specific measures which would write-off the debts owed to the world bank by poor countries .
instead gordon brown described the commitment expressed by the g7 as " very significant progress , " and pointed out that the group was preparing a progress report addressing the sustainability of debt relief for the neediest countries .
" there is a growing consensus that multilateral debt relief has to be dealt with as soon as possible , " he said .

on sunday , charles i of austria will be beatified at the vatican , while an angry dispute erupts over his historic role at home . for centuries , the announcement of the beatification of a new saint had been big news in the catholic church .
at the start of the 21st century one could argue that the importance of such a ceremony has faded somewhat , at least in the media .
but in austria , the naming of emperor charles i , who ruled for just short of two years at the end of world war i , has caused quite a stir , as the country 's leading news magazine referred to the last ruler of the austro-hungarian empire as " the patron saint of losers . "
herbert lackner , chief editor of the viennese magazine profil criticized the beatification of charles i as tantamount to anointing a proponent of war .
although the emperor himself " was not as much of a war hawk as his generals , he was too weak to actually make the decisive turn to peace , " he wrote ahead of sunday 's ceremony .
lackner also said charles was responsible for the use of mustard gas during the end of the war , which resulted in the deaths of hundreds of soldiers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emperor charles i " he was the supreme commander .
if he had ordered them not to use it , they would n't have done so , " lackner said .
powerful name recognition the journalist maintained charles got beatification because the vatican succumbed to decades of lobbying by the habsburg family that formerly ruled austria.british historian and lawyer james bogel , however , claimed the media is acting like the paparazzi by leveling untruths at the habsburg family because of a deep-seated paranoia about the country 's monarchic past .
" if you 've got people with that degree of paranoia , it 's not surprising that they write articles like this , " said the lawyer , who speaks on behalf of the family .
walburga , the countess douglas and granddaughter of charles , was of the same opinion .
speaking to dw-radio from rome , the royal heiress said pope john paul ii was responsible for the decision and has been more creative than his predecessors in picking the new saints of the catholic church .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope john paul ii " our pope tries to find people who can be symbols for a group of persons , and he was trying to find somebody who can become the symbol for the politicians .
he might be the saint for the politicians , " she explained .
as to accusations that charles was a poor statesman and morally reproachable for allowing generals to use deadly mustard gas , the countess recalled that politicians during the time of her grandfather were in a much different position than today , and many were much harsher when it came to war .
" you will always find people who are going to say , how can you beatify a person who was leading a war , " she said , while adding that charles i was fulfilling the will of god .
one miracle is enough in his official biography - published by the vatican - historians argue that charles i strove tirelessly for peace until abdication in 1918 .
as a dedicated catholic , he was also the only european leader who backed the peace efforts of pope benedict the fifteenth .
according to james bogel , there is also no actual record that the emperor actually authorized mustard gas .
during the war " he certainly refused to attack civilian shipping .
he refused to shell italian civilians .
and he refused to send lenin in a sealed train back to russia , " all reasons bogel has cited for showing that charles i was not as bad as the media makes him out to be .
for the vatican , though , the proof of charles ' saintliness lies elsewhere .
the catholic church said the deceased emperor miraculously healed the varicose veins of a brazilian nun when she prayed to him in 1960 , and one miracle is all it takes for beatification . eric campano -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de historians question the beatification of blessed charles the last emperor of the habsburg dynasty , charles the first of austria , is to be beatified by the pope .

"
this week , the european commission will publish a report expected to give turkey the go ahead to start accession talks .
in an interview with deutsche welle , the turkish premier was convinced this would take place . on oct .
6 , the executive branch of the eu will present a long-awaited progress report on ankara 's chances of joining the 25-member bloc .
the findings of the study will form the basis of a decision by eu leaders at a december summit on whether or not to begin membership negotiations with turkey .
the commission is widely expected to give the thumbs up .
however , an impact study to be approved alongside the main recommendations suggests that the predominantly muslim country on the fringe of europe will not be able to count itself a full-fledged member of the eu until well into the next decade .
eu enlargement commissioner günter verheugen has predicted a long and bumpy road full of specific prerequisites both for ankara and the larger bloc .
verheugen , who only two weeks ago announced there were " no more problems on the table " and no further obstacles to beginning accession talks , has now indicated that certain requirements need to be fulfilled before the eu can welcome turkey into its fold .
first among them , according to inside sources , is a restricted access to the european labor market .
in contrast to the current new members who enjoy free circulation of labor after a certain period of time , verheugen favors long-term restrictions for turks seeking jobs in existing member states .
the enlargement commissioner would also like to stipulate changes in the eu agricultural subsidies system , which if left in place would result in annual costs of between 16 and 28 billion euros -lrb- $ 19 to $ 34 billion -rrb- once turkey joins , and stricter controls of political reforms .
no new requirements in an interview with deutsche welle and a small circle of german journalists , turkish minister president recep tayyip erdogan adamantly rejected any further stipulations to beginning membership talks .

3 , munich revolves around beer the world 's largest folk festival ended this weekend in germany .
the annual oktoberfest in munich attracted over six million people and was , as usual , a great party full of dancing , rides , and of course beer . it 's hard to describe oktoberfest to those who have never been there .
part party , festival and carnival with singalongs , costumes , rides and games , the ultimate beer bash is something you just have to experience , says dw-radio 's allison frost , who spoke with several visitors during oktoberfest 's last weekend .
a toast to gemütlichkeit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors lift their maß , one-liter mugs of beer , during the oktoberfest after spending less than an hour in one of the festival 's enormous beer tents , it 's hard to get the refrain of one of the beer drinker 's favorite songs out of your head .
" a toast , a toast to gemütlichkeit . "
it 's an homage to that uniquely german word for the feeling of sociability , hospitality and that relaxed sense of belonging that defies translation .
in munich , bavaria 's capital and the home to oktoberfest , gemütlichkeit is written big - almost as big as the one-liter mugs that are passed around full of beer .
the jovial good spirit that exudes from the packed beer tents and the experience of locking arms and swaying along with hundreds of other strangers is what keeps drawing back visitors .
this year there were over six million .
for wolf wilberg , who comes to the " wiesn , " as the locals call it , every year , there 's just one way to sum up the oktoberfest experience : home .
the retired teacher hails originally from berlin , but has been a " bavarian at heart " for years .
" this is about being among people which share our attitudes towards life .
which means , we are proud of our traditions and we welcome guests from all over the world , " he says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional brass bands are an integral part of the oktoberfest tradition " when you come here , people will say , hocke die heir , which means come here and have a seat .
and it is less than a minute before you are in an intimate talk and you know your neighbor and you share or do not share his opinions .
if you are completely different you at least share the same beer and the same pretzel and that 's that , " wilberg says of the down-home nature of oktoberfest .
jan schöbel , a munich native , has just returned from studying abroad in portland , oregon .
he says he 's glad to be back in town for the big event : " i like the beer .
when i was a little bit younger , i liked the rides . "
but the main reason he likes oktoberfest is " to sit together in a beer tent or in the beer garden if the weather is nice , have fun with friends and meet foreign people . "
when you 've had too much to drink of course the focus is really on the beer .
that 's what the festival is all about .
and as to be expected , people tend to drink to excess .
the brochures and tourist information do n't mention that , but it 's a given .
sometimes the situation gets a bit out of hand or worse .
minor struggles and fist fights with heavy glass beer mugs breaking are not that uncommon , but usually they are quickly suppressed .
police and medical officials are always on hand to make sure things do n't get out of control .
last year the city adopted a two-pronged approach to respond to reports of sexual assault .
it set up a centrally located security point , staffed by women and open everyday from 6:00 at night to 1:00 in the morning .
it also launched a campaign called " a safe oktoberfest for girls and women " to discourage sexual harassment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : view of munich 's oktoberfest with the st. paul 's cathedral in the background do the darker sides of the festival deter visitors or dampen their mood ?
not really , says wolf wilberg .
" i 'm glad that the police have this under control .
there are always people who do not know where the limits are .
but it is more the fun and spirit of friendship and companionship , and people feel that the atmosphere is more important than heavy drinking .

now , many want it back on oct.3 , germany marks 14 years since reunification .
although the physical barrier between east and west is a thing of the past , many germans still speak about the " mauer im kopf " - the wall in the head . in berlin today , there 's very little left of the berlin wall .
even those who 've lived here all their lives have difficulty remembering exactly where it used to be .
but if every fifth person in germany had their way , the barrier that split the country during the cold war would be resurrected .
a recent poll conducted by the forsa research institute found that a quarter of west germans wished the berlin wall could be rebuilt , while 12 percent of east germans said they did n't want to live in a united germany .
it 's not exactly a glowing testimony about the progress made in the 14 years since the wende , the term used here to describe german reunification . stereotypes persist stereotypes about east and west are stubborn .
east germans think of westerners as " besser-wessies , " or arrogant know-it-alls .
west germans , in turn , roll their eyes about the " jammer ossies , " or whining easterners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the glittering skyline of frankfurt 's banking district symbolizes west german wealth " east germans have a false perception of affluence in the west .
they overestimate the level of prosperity , and take the upper income level as the average , so many of their demands are unrealistic , " says klaus schröder , an expert on the former east germany at berlin 's free university .
" west germans are envious when they see how much money is being transferred to the east .
many people feel that the true cost of reunification is being hidden from them . " negative western stereotypes about easterners have even been passed down to the younger generation , to those who were teenagers when the wall fell .
there 's been an exodus of young easterners to western cities in the 14 years following reunification , but those who 've remained in the east are often pegged as lazy , unmotivated , and bitter about their future prospects . those assumptions are wrong , say sociologists at a leading public opinion research institute in the southern german city of allensbach .
they quizzed 2,000 germans on their attitudes on typically western values .

18 to oct .
3 , munich revolves around beer the world 's largest folk festival ended this weekend in germany .
the annual oktoberfest in munich attracted over six million people and was , as usual , a great party full of dancing , rides , and of course beer . it 's hard to describe oktoberfest to those who have never been there .
part party , festival and carnival with singalongs , costumes , rides and games , the ultimate beer bash is something you just have to experience , says dw-radio 's allison frost , who spoke with several visitors during oktoberfest 's last weekend .
a toast to gemütlichkeit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors lift their maß , one-liter mugs of beer , during the oktoberfest after spending less than an hour in one of the festival 's enormous beer tents , it 's hard to get the refrain of one of the beer drinker 's favorite songs out of your head .
" a toast , a toast to gemütlichkeit . "
it 's an homage to that uniquely german word for the feeling of sociability , hospitality and that relaxed sense of belonging that defies translation .
in munich , bavaria 's capital and the home to oktoberfest , gemütlichkeit is written big - almost as big as the one-liter mugs that are passed around full of beer .
the jovial good spirit that exudes from the packed beer tents and the experience of locking arms and swaying along with hundreds of other strangers is what keeps drawing back visitors .
this year there were over six million .
for wolf wilberg , who comes to the " wiesn , " as the locals call it , every year , there 's just one way to sum up the oktoberfest experience : home .
the retired teacher hails originally from berlin , but has been a " bavarian at heart " for years .
" this is about being among people which share our attitudes towards life .
which means , we are proud of our traditions and we welcome guests from all over the world , " he says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional brass bands are an integral part of the oktoberfest tradition " when you come here , people will say , hocke die heir , which means come here and have a seat .
and it is less than a minute before you are in an intimate talk and you know your neighbor and you share or do not share his opinions .
if you are completely different you at least share the same beer and the same pretzel and that 's that , " wilberg says of the down-home nature of oktoberfest .
jan schöbel , a munich native , has just returned from studying abroad in portland , oregon .
he says he 's glad to be back in town for the big event : " i like the beer .
when i was a little bit younger , i liked the rides . "
but the main reason he likes oktoberfest is " to sit together in a beer tent or in the beer garden if the weather is nice , have fun with friends and meet foreign people . "
when you 've had too much to drink of course the focus is really on the beer .
that 's what the festival is all about .
and as to be expected , people tend to drink to excess .
the brochures and tourist information do n't mention that , but it 's a given .
sometimes the situation gets a bit out of hand or worse .
minor struggles and fist fights with heavy glass beer mugs breaking are not that uncommon , but usually they are quickly suppressed .
police and medical officials are always on hand to make sure things do n't get out of control .
last year the city adopted a two-pronged approach to respond to reports of sexual assault .
it set up a centrally located security point , staffed by women and open everyday from 6:00 at night to 1:00 in the morning .
it also launched a campaign called " a safe oktoberfest for girls and women " to discourage sexual harassment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : view of munich 's oktoberfest with the st. paul 's cathedral in the background do the darker sides of the festival deter visitors or dampen their mood ?
not really , says wolf wilberg .
" i 'm glad that the police have this under control .
there are always people who do not know where the limits are .
but it is more the fun and spirit of friendship and companionship , and people feel that the atmosphere is more important than heavy drinking .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 03.10.2004 a patron saint for politicians ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how blessed was the last ruler of the austro-hungarian empire ?
who deserves to be a saint ?
the question is a source of great debate among catholics .
on sunday , charles i of austria will be beatified at the vatican , while an angry dispute erupts over his historic role at home . for centuries , the announcement of the beatification of a new saint had been big news in the catholic church .
at the start of the 21st century one could argue that the importance of such a ceremony has faded somewhat , at least in the media .
but in austria , the naming of emperor charles i , who ruled for just short of two years at the end of world war i , has caused quite a stir , as the country 's leading news magazine referred to the last ruler of the austro-hungarian empire as " the patron saint of losers . "
herbert lackner , chief editor of the viennese magazine profil criticized the beatification of charles i as tantamount to anointing a proponent of war .
although the emperor himself " was not as much of a war hawk as his generals , he was too weak to actually make the decisive turn to peace , " he wrote ahead of sunday 's ceremony .
lackner also said charles was responsible for the use of mustard gas during the end of the war , which resulted in the deaths of hundreds of soldiers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emperor charles i " he was the supreme commander .
if he had ordered them not to use it , they would n't have done so , " lackner said .
powerful name recognition the journalist maintained charles got beatification because the vatican succumbed to decades of lobbying by the habsburg family that formerly ruled austria.british historian and lawyer james bogel , however , claimed the media is acting like the paparazzi by leveling untruths at the habsburg family because of a deep-seated paranoia about the country 's monarchic past .
" if you 've got people with that degree of paranoia , it 's not surprising that they write articles like this , " said the lawyer , who speaks on behalf of the family .
walburga , the countess douglas and granddaughter of charles , was of the same opinion .
speaking to dw-radio from rome , the royal heiress said pope john paul ii was responsible for the decision and has been more creative than his predecessors in picking the new saints of the catholic church .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope john paul ii " our pope tries to find people who can be symbols for a group of persons , and he was trying to find somebody who can become the symbol for the politicians .
he might be the saint for the politicians , " she explained .
as to accusations that charles was a poor statesman and morally reproachable for allowing generals to use deadly mustard gas , the countess recalled that politicians during the time of her grandfather were in a much different position than today , and many were much harsher when it came to war .
" you will always find people who are going to say , how can you beatify a person who was leading a war , " she said , while adding that charles i was fulfilling the will of god .
one miracle is enough in his official biography - published by the vatican - historians argue that charles i strove tirelessly for peace until abdication in 1918 .
as a dedicated catholic , he was also the only european leader who backed the peace efforts of pope benedict the fifteenth .
according to james bogel , there is also no actual record that the emperor actually authorized mustard gas .
during the war " he certainly refused to attack civilian shipping .
he refused to shell italian civilians .
and he refused to send lenin in a sealed train back to russia , " all reasons bogel has cited for showing that charles i was not as bad as the media makes him out to be .
for the vatican , though , the proof of charles ' saintliness lies elsewhere .
the catholic church said the deceased emperor miraculously healed the varicose veins of a brazilian nun when she prayed to him in 1960 , and one miracle is all it takes for beatification . eric campano -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de historians question the beatification of blessed charles the last emperor of the habsburg dynasty , charles the first of austria , is to be beatified by the pope .

" the world economy is strengthening , but the recovery has been uneven , " british chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown said after a meeting of the imf 's policymaking international monetary and financial committee , of which he is chairman .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown " and with oil prices doubling and imbalances worsening , we agreed that action must be taken to address risks to the recovery , " he said .
world bank president james wolfensohn cited " persistent global imbalances , which require , in particular , readjustment of monetary and fiscal policies in the us , and structural reforms to boost growth in japan , europe and elsewhere . "
he noted that heavily indebted and oil-importing developing countries " are vulnerable to the combination or rising oil prices and interest rates .
mitigating and managing these risks remain important challenges for us all . "
britain sets the example for debt relief following on the heels of the g7 meeting , the imf steering committee also addressed the need to improve debt relief for the world 's poorest nations .
as in the meeting two days earlier between financial leaders from the world 's wealthiest nations , the imf was full of pledges and affirmations , but failed to endorse specific measures which would write-off the debts owed to the world bank by poor countries .
instead gordon brown described the commitment expressed by the g7 as " very significant progress , " and pointed out that the group was preparing a progress report addressing the sustainability of debt relief for the neediest countries .
" there is a growing consensus that multilateral debt relief has to be dealt with as soon as possible , " he said .
" the uk will lead the way in relieving those countries still under the burden of this debt by paying our share - 10 percent - of their payments to the world bank and the african development bank , " brown announced , adding : " and we urge other governments to follow us in this . "
bildunterschrift : a child stands outside squatter shacks watching the rising waters in the alexandra township north of johannesburg , south africa increasing development aid meanwhile the imf and world bank appealed to industrialized countries to uphold their pledge of spending 0.7 percent of their gross domestic product to support developing countries , particularly those in sub-saharan africa .
agreed to in 1969 during a un conference , only a handful of countries have met the target , including norway and sweden .
the united states , one of the world 's strongest economies , currently spends less than 0.2 percent of its gdp on development aid .
france put 0.4 percent of its gdp towards aid programs in africa , and in germany , the goal is to reach 0.33 percent by 2006 .
no agreement on iraq on the issue of iraq , the support for debt relief was even less resounding .
whereas the us has lobbied for forgiving 90 percent of the arab nation 's $ 120 billion -lrb- € 97 billion -rrb- in foreign debt , other nations are more critical .
germany and france reject such a high percentage , saying 50 percent is more appropriate .
citing its extensive oil reserves , france has argued that iraq should not be treated any better than considerably poorer nations .
on friday , members of the g7 had concluded their meeting with the goal of agreeing to the framework for a debt reduction plan for iraq by the end of the year . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g7 says high oil price threatens economy with a view to rising costs , the group of seven finance chiefs called on oil producers to help keep energy prices manageable .

even those who 've lived here all their lives have difficulty remembering exactly where it used to be .
but if every fifth person in germany had their way , the barrier that split the country during the cold war would be resurrected .

there 's been an exodus of young easterners to western cities in the 14 years following reunification , but those who 've remained in the east are often pegged as lazy , unmotivated , and bitter about their future prospects . those assumptions are wrong , say sociologists at a leading public opinion research institute in the southern german city of allensbach .

now , many want it back on oct.3 , germany marks 14 years since reunification .
although the physical barrier between east and west is a thing of the past , many germans still speak about the " mauer im kopf " - the wall in the head . in berlin today , there 's very little left of the berlin wall .
even those who 've lived here all their lives have difficulty remembering exactly where it used to be .
but if every fifth person in germany had their way , the barrier that split the country during the cold war would be resurrected .
a recent poll conducted by the forsa research institute found that a quarter of west germans wished the berlin wall could be rebuilt , while 12 percent of east germans said they did n't want to live in a united germany .
it 's not exactly a glowing testimony about the progress made in the 14 years since the wende , the term used here to describe german reunification . stereotypes persist stereotypes about east and west are stubborn .
east germans think of westerners as " besser-wessies , " or arrogant know-it-alls .
west germans , in turn , roll their eyes about the " jammer ossies , " or whining easterners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the glittering skyline of frankfurt 's banking district symbolizes west german wealth " east germans have a false perception of affluence in the west .
they overestimate the level of prosperity , and take the upper income level as the average , so many of their demands are unrealistic , " says klaus schröder , an expert on the former east germany at berlin 's free university .
" west germans are envious when they see how much money is being transferred to the east .
many people feel that the true cost of reunification is being hidden from them . " negative western stereotypes about easterners have even been passed down to the younger generation , to those who were teenagers when the wall fell .
there 's been an exodus of young easterners to western cities in the 14 years following reunification , but those who 've remained in the east are often pegged as lazy , unmotivated , and bitter about their future prospects . those assumptions are wrong , say sociologists at a leading public opinion research institute in the southern german city of allensbach .

18 to oct .
3 , munich revolves around beer the world 's largest folk festival ended this weekend in germany .
the annual oktoberfest in munich attracted over six million people and was , as usual , a great party full of dancing , rides , and of course beer . it 's hard to describe oktoberfest to those who have never been there .
part party , festival and carnival with singalongs , costumes , rides and games , the ultimate beer bash is something you just have to experience , says dw-radio 's allison frost , who spoke with several visitors during oktoberfest 's last weekend .
a toast to gemütlichkeit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors lift their maß , one-liter mugs of beer , during the oktoberfest after spending less than an hour in one of the festival 's enormous beer tents , it 's hard to get the refrain of one of the beer drinker 's favorite songs out of your head .
" a toast , a toast to gemütlichkeit . "
it 's an homage to that uniquely german word for the feeling of sociability , hospitality and that relaxed sense of belonging that defies translation .
in munich , bavaria 's capital and the home to oktoberfest , gemütlichkeit is written big - almost as big as the one-liter mugs that are passed around full of beer .
the jovial good spirit that exudes from the packed beer tents and the experience of locking arms and swaying along with hundreds of other strangers is what keeps drawing back visitors .
this year there were over six million .
for wolf wilberg , who comes to the " wiesn , " as the locals call it , every year , there 's just one way to sum up the oktoberfest experience : home .
the retired teacher hails originally from berlin , but has been a " bavarian at heart " for years .
" this is about being among people which share our attitudes towards life .
which means , we are proud of our traditions and we welcome guests from all over the world , " he says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional brass bands are an integral part of the oktoberfest tradition " when you come here , people will say , hocke die heir , which means come here and have a seat .
and it is less than a minute before you are in an intimate talk and you know your neighbor and you share or do not share his opinions .
if you are completely different you at least share the same beer and the same pretzel and that 's that , " wilberg says of the down-home nature of oktoberfest .
jan schöbel , a munich native , has just returned from studying abroad in portland , oregon .
he says he 's glad to be back in town for the big event : " i like the beer .
when i was a little bit younger , i liked the rides . "
but the main reason he likes oktoberfest is " to sit together in a beer tent or in the beer garden if the weather is nice , have fun with friends and meet foreign people . "
when you 've had too much to drink of course the focus is really on the beer .
that 's what the festival is all about .
and as to be expected , people tend to drink to excess .
the brochures and tourist information do n't mention that , but it 's a given .
sometimes the situation gets a bit out of hand or worse .
minor struggles and fist fights with heavy glass beer mugs breaking are not that uncommon , but usually they are quickly suppressed .
police and medical officials are always on hand to make sure things do n't get out of control .
last year the city adopted a two-pronged approach to respond to reports of sexual assault .
it set up a centrally located security point , staffed by women and open everyday from 6:00 at night to 1:00 in the morning .
it also launched a campaign called " a safe oktoberfest for girls and women " to discourage sexual harassment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : view of munich 's oktoberfest with the st. paul 's cathedral in the background do the darker sides of the festival deter visitors or dampen their mood ?
not really , says wolf wilberg .
" i 'm glad that the police have this under control .
there are always people who do not know where the limits are .
but it is more the fun and spirit of friendship and companionship , and people feel that the atmosphere is more important than heavy drinking .

" the world economy is strengthening , but the recovery has been uneven , " british chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown said after a meeting of the imf 's policymaking international monetary and financial committee , of which he is chairman .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown " and with oil prices doubling and imbalances worsening , we agreed that action must be taken to address risks to the recovery , " he said .
world bank president james wolfensohn cited " persistent global imbalances , which require , in particular , readjustment of monetary and fiscal policies in the us , and structural reforms to boost growth in japan , europe and elsewhere . "
he noted that heavily indebted and oil-importing developing countries " are vulnerable to the combination or rising oil prices and interest rates .
mitigating and managing these risks remain important challenges for us all . "
britain sets the example for debt relief following on the heels of the g7 meeting , the imf steering committee also addressed the need to improve debt relief for the world 's poorest nations .
as in the meeting two days earlier between financial leaders from the world 's wealthiest nations , the imf was full of pledges and affirmations , but failed to endorse specific measures which would write-off the debts owed to the world bank by poor countries .
instead gordon brown described the commitment expressed by the g7 as " very significant progress , " and pointed out that the group was preparing a progress report addressing the sustainability of debt relief for the neediest countries .
" there is a growing consensus that multilateral debt relief has to be dealt with as soon as possible , " he said .
" the uk will lead the way in relieving those countries still under the burden of this debt by paying our share - 10 percent - of their payments to the world bank and the african development bank , " brown announced , adding : " and we urge other governments to follow us in this . "
bildunterschrift : a child stands outside squatter shacks watching the rising waters in the alexandra township north of johannesburg , south africa increasing development aid meanwhile the imf and world bank appealed to industrialized countries to uphold their pledge of spending 0.7 percent of their gross domestic product to support developing countries , particularly those in sub-saharan africa .
agreed to in 1969 during a un conference , only a handful of countries have met the target , including norway and sweden .
the united states , one of the world 's strongest economies , currently spends less than 0.2 percent of its gdp on development aid .
france put 0.4 percent of its gdp towards aid programs in africa , and in germany , the goal is to reach 0.33 percent by 2006 .
no agreement on iraq on the issue of iraq , the support for debt relief was even less resounding .
whereas the us has lobbied for forgiving 90 percent of the arab nation 's $ 120 billion -lrb- € 97 billion -rrb- in foreign debt , other nations are more critical .
germany and france reject such a high percentage , saying 50 percent is more appropriate .
citing its extensive oil reserves , france has argued that iraq should not be treated any better than considerably poorer nations .
on friday , members of the g7 had concluded their meeting with the goal of agreeing to the framework for a debt reduction plan for iraq by the end of the year . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g7 says high oil price threatens economy with a view to rising costs , the group of seven finance chiefs called on oil producers to help keep energy prices manageable .

"
this week , the european commission will publish a report expected to give turkey the go ahead to start accession talks .
in an interview with deutsche welle , the turkish premier was convinced this would take place . on oct .
6 , the executive branch of the eu will present a long-awaited progress report on ankara 's chances of joining the 25-member bloc .
the findings of the study will form the basis of a decision by eu leaders at a december summit on whether or not to begin membership negotiations with turkey .
the commission is widely expected to give the thumbs up .
however , an impact study to be approved alongside the main recommendations suggests that the predominantly muslim country on the fringe of europe will not be able to count itself a full-fledged member of the eu until well into the next decade .
eu enlargement commissioner günter verheugen has predicted a long and bumpy road full of specific prerequisites both for ankara and the larger bloc .
verheugen , who only two weeks ago announced there were " no more problems on the table " and no further obstacles to beginning accession talks , has now indicated that certain requirements need to be fulfilled before the eu can welcome turkey into its fold .
first among them , according to inside sources , is a restricted access to the european labor market .
in contrast to the current new members who enjoy free circulation of labor after a certain period of time , verheugen favors long-term restrictions for turks seeking jobs in existing member states .
the enlargement commissioner would also like to stipulate changes in the eu agricultural subsidies system , which if left in place would result in annual costs of between 16 and 28 billion euros -lrb- $ 19 to $ 34 billion -rrb- once turkey joins , and stricter controls of political reforms .
no new requirements in an interview with deutsche welle and a small circle of german journalists , turkish minister president recep tayyip erdogan adamantly rejected any further stipulations to beginning membership talks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan refers to the enlargement commissioner as " my good friend , " after günter verheugen announced there were no more problems ahead of beginning negotiations .
" i have never heard anything like that from mr. verheugen , not in any way .
in the catalog of criteria for the european union there is no such thing as requirements for beginning negotiations .
he could perhaps write something about our little faults .
that would be normal and would be cleared up during the negotiation period , " erdogan said .
as to the significant sum in subsidies the eu would have to shoulder in the decade following turkey 's accession , the premier said it was too early to make any such assumptions : " in my opinion it 's too early to begin talking about such things .
in helsinki in 1999 , the eu decided that turkey was a candidate for membership .
all these things were prepared with the full awareness of the eu .
in the coming years , the situation will change dramatically .
one should not only talk about what the eu will have to pay .
one should also say what the eu will gain through turkey 's membership . "
no question of membership in its impact study , the eu commission addresses the economic benefits turkey would bring to the rest of europe and concluded that ankara 's relatively weak economy would not result in a significant boon for the bloc .
despite opposition to turkey 's membership , erdogan is convinced that in december the 25 heads of state and government will recommend starting accession talks .
a further postponement or a rejection is out of the question , the prime minister said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recep tayyip erdogan speaks to the media nov .
26 , 2002 in copenhagen after the eu came up with a set of criteria for ankara " that would be a hard punch for me and my people , because we have done our homework .
it is now up to the eu to hold up their end .
we have done everything as it stands in the criteria .
commissioner verheugen said , there are no more problems on the table .

this week , the european commission will publish a report expected to give turkey the go ahead to start accession talks .
in an interview with deutsche welle , the turkish premier was convinced this would take place . on oct .
6 , the executive branch of the eu will present a long-awaited progress report on ankara 's chances of joining the 25-member bloc .
the findings of the study will form the basis of a decision by eu leaders at a december summit on whether or not to begin membership negotiations with turkey .
the commission is widely expected to give the thumbs up .
however , an impact study to be approved alongside the main recommendations suggests that the predominantly muslim country on the fringe of europe will not be able to count itself a full-fledged member of the eu until well into the next decade .
eu enlargement commissioner günter verheugen has predicted a long and bumpy road full of specific prerequisites both for ankara and the larger bloc .
verheugen , who only two weeks ago announced there were " no more problems on the table " and no further obstacles to beginning accession talks , has now indicated that certain requirements need to be fulfilled before the eu can welcome turkey into its fold .
first among them , according to inside sources , is a restricted access to the european labor market .
in contrast to the current new members who enjoy free circulation of labor after a certain period of time , verheugen favors long-term restrictions for turks seeking jobs in existing member states .
the enlargement commissioner would also like to stipulate changes in the eu agricultural subsidies system , which if left in place would result in annual costs of between 16 and 28 billion euros -lrb- $ 19 to $ 34 billion -rrb- once turkey joins , and stricter controls of political reforms .
no new requirements in an interview with deutsche welle and a small circle of german journalists , turkish minister president recep tayyip erdogan adamantly rejected any further stipulations to beginning membership talks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan refers to the enlargement commissioner as " my good friend , " after günter verheugen announced there were no more problems ahead of beginning negotiations .
" i have never heard anything like that from mr. verheugen , not in any way .
in the catalog of criteria for the european union there is no such thing as requirements for beginning negotiations .
he could perhaps write something about our little faults .
that would be normal and would be cleared up during the negotiation period , " erdogan said .
as to the significant sum in subsidies the eu would have to shoulder in the decade following turkey 's accession , the premier said it was too early to make any such assumptions : " in my opinion it 's too early to begin talking about such things .
in helsinki in 1999 , the eu decided that turkey was a candidate for membership .
all these things were prepared with the full awareness of the eu .
in the coming years , the situation will change dramatically .
one should not only talk about what the eu will have to pay .
one should also say what the eu will gain through turkey 's membership . "
no question of membership in its impact study , the eu commission addresses the economic benefits turkey would bring to the rest of europe and concluded that ankara 's relatively weak economy would not result in a significant boon for the bloc .
despite opposition to turkey 's membership , erdogan is convinced that in december the 25 heads of state and government will recommend starting accession talks .
a further postponement or a rejection is out of the question , the prime minister said .

" the world economy is strengthening , but the recovery has been uneven , " british chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown said after a meeting of the imf 's policymaking international monetary and financial committee , of which he is chairman .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown " and with oil prices doubling and imbalances worsening , we agreed that action must be taken to address risks to the recovery , " he said .
world bank president james wolfensohn cited " persistent global imbalances , which require , in particular , readjustment of monetary and fiscal policies in the us , and structural reforms to boost growth in japan , europe and elsewhere . "
he noted that heavily indebted and oil-importing developing countries " are vulnerable to the combination or rising oil prices and interest rates .
mitigating and managing these risks remain important challenges for us all . "
britain sets the example for debt relief following on the heels of the g7 meeting , the imf steering committee also addressed the need to improve debt relief for the world 's poorest nations .
as in the meeting two days earlier between financial leaders from the world 's wealthiest nations , the imf was full of pledges and affirmations , but failed to endorse specific measures which would write-off the debts owed to the world bank by poor countries .
instead gordon brown described the commitment expressed by the g7 as " very significant progress , " and pointed out that the group was preparing a progress report addressing the sustainability of debt relief for the neediest countries .
" there is a growing consensus that multilateral debt relief has to be dealt with as soon as possible , " he said .
" the uk will lead the way in relieving those countries still under the burden of this debt by paying our share - 10 percent - of their payments to the world bank and the african development bank , " brown announced , adding : " and we urge other governments to follow us in this . "
bildunterschrift : a child stands outside squatter shacks watching the rising waters in the alexandra township north of johannesburg , south africa increasing development aid meanwhile the imf and world bank appealed to industrialized countries to uphold their pledge of spending 0.7 percent of their gross domestic product to support developing countries , particularly those in sub-saharan africa .
agreed to in 1969 during a un conference , only a handful of countries have met the target , including norway and sweden .
the united states , one of the world 's strongest economies , currently spends less than 0.2 percent of its gdp on development aid .
france put 0.4 percent of its gdp towards aid programs in africa , and in germany , the goal is to reach 0.33 percent by 2006 .
no agreement on iraq on the issue of iraq , the support for debt relief was even less resounding .
whereas the us has lobbied for forgiving 90 percent of the arab nation 's $ 120 billion -lrb- € 97 billion -rrb- in foreign debt , other nations are more critical .
germany and france reject such a high percentage , saying 50 percent is more appropriate .
citing its extensive oil reserves , france has argued that iraq should not be treated any better than considerably poorer nations .
on friday , members of the g7 had concluded their meeting with the goal of agreeing to the framework for a debt reduction plan for iraq by the end of the year . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g7 says high oil price threatens economy with a view to rising costs , the group of seven finance chiefs called on oil producers to help keep energy prices manageable .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 03.10.2004 a patron saint for politicians ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how blessed was the last ruler of the austro-hungarian empire ?
who deserves to be a saint ?
the question is a source of great debate among catholics .
on sunday , charles i of austria will be beatified at the vatican , while an angry dispute erupts over his historic role at home . for centuries , the announcement of the beatification of a new saint had been big news in the catholic church .
at the start of the 21st century one could argue that the importance of such a ceremony has faded somewhat , at least in the media .
but in austria , the naming of emperor charles i , who ruled for just short of two years at the end of world war i , has caused quite a stir , as the country 's leading news magazine referred to the last ruler of the austro-hungarian empire as " the patron saint of losers . "
herbert lackner , chief editor of the viennese magazine profil criticized the beatification of charles i as tantamount to anointing a proponent of war .
although the emperor himself " was not as much of a war hawk as his generals , he was too weak to actually make the decisive turn to peace , " he wrote ahead of sunday 's ceremony .
lackner also said charles was responsible for the use of mustard gas during the end of the war , which resulted in the deaths of hundreds of soldiers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emperor charles i " he was the supreme commander .
if he had ordered them not to use it , they would n't have done so , " lackner said .
powerful name recognition the journalist maintained charles got beatification because the vatican succumbed to decades of lobbying by the habsburg family that formerly ruled austria.british historian and lawyer james bogel , however , claimed the media is acting like the paparazzi by leveling untruths at the habsburg family because of a deep-seated paranoia about the country 's monarchic past .
" if you 've got people with that degree of paranoia , it 's not surprising that they write articles like this , " said the lawyer , who speaks on behalf of the family .
walburga , the countess douglas and granddaughter of charles , was of the same opinion .
speaking to dw-radio from rome , the royal heiress said pope john paul ii was responsible for the decision and has been more creative than his predecessors in picking the new saints of the catholic church .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope john paul ii " our pope tries to find people who can be symbols for a group of persons , and he was trying to find somebody who can become the symbol for the politicians .
he might be the saint for the politicians , " she explained .
as to accusations that charles was a poor statesman and morally reproachable for allowing generals to use deadly mustard gas , the countess recalled that politicians during the time of her grandfather were in a much different position than today , and many were much harsher when it came to war .
" you will always find people who are going to say , how can you beatify a person who was leading a war , " she said , while adding that charles i was fulfilling the will of god .
one miracle is enough in his official biography - published by the vatican - historians argue that charles i strove tirelessly for peace until abdication in 1918 .
as a dedicated catholic , he was also the only european leader who backed the peace efforts of pope benedict the fifteenth .
according to james bogel , there is also no actual record that the emperor actually authorized mustard gas .
during the war " he certainly refused to attack civilian shipping .
he refused to shell italian civilians .
and he refused to send lenin in a sealed train back to russia , " all reasons bogel has cited for showing that charles i was not as bad as the media makes him out to be .
for the vatican , though , the proof of charles ' saintliness lies elsewhere .
the catholic church said the deceased emperor miraculously healed the varicose veins of a brazilian nun when she prayed to him in 1960 , and one miracle is all it takes for beatification . eric campano -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de historians question the beatification of blessed charles the last emperor of the habsburg dynasty , charles the first of austria , is to be beatified by the pope .
news that the deceased monarch will become blessed charles has prompted many to question the pontiff ’ s choice .

3 , munich revolves around beer the world 's largest folk festival ended this weekend in germany .
the annual oktoberfest in munich attracted over six million people and was , as usual , a great party full of dancing , rides , and of course beer . it 's hard to describe oktoberfest to those who have never been there .
part party , festival and carnival with singalongs , costumes , rides and games , the ultimate beer bash is something you just have to experience , says dw-radio 's allison frost , who spoke with several visitors during oktoberfest 's last weekend .
a toast to gemütlichkeit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors lift their maß , one-liter mugs of beer , during the oktoberfest after spending less than an hour in one of the festival 's enormous beer tents , it 's hard to get the refrain of one of the beer drinker 's favorite songs out of your head .
" a toast , a toast to gemütlichkeit . "
it 's an homage to that uniquely german word for the feeling of sociability , hospitality and that relaxed sense of belonging that defies translation .
in munich , bavaria 's capital and the home to oktoberfest , gemütlichkeit is written big - almost as big as the one-liter mugs that are passed around full of beer .
the jovial good spirit that exudes from the packed beer tents and the experience of locking arms and swaying along with hundreds of other strangers is what keeps drawing back visitors .
this year there were over six million .
for wolf wilberg , who comes to the " wiesn , " as the locals call it , every year , there 's just one way to sum up the oktoberfest experience : home .
the retired teacher hails originally from berlin , but has been a " bavarian at heart " for years .
" this is about being among people which share our attitudes towards life .
which means , we are proud of our traditions and we welcome guests from all over the world , " he says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional brass bands are an integral part of the oktoberfest tradition " when you come here , people will say , hocke die heir , which means come here and have a seat .
and it is less than a minute before you are in an intimate talk and you know your neighbor and you share or do not share his opinions .
if you are completely different you at least share the same beer and the same pretzel and that 's that , " wilberg says of the down-home nature of oktoberfest .
jan schöbel , a munich native , has just returned from studying abroad in portland , oregon .
he says he 's glad to be back in town for the big event : " i like the beer .
when i was a little bit younger , i liked the rides . "
but the main reason he likes oktoberfest is " to sit together in a beer tent or in the beer garden if the weather is nice , have fun with friends and meet foreign people . "
when you 've had too much to drink of course the focus is really on the beer .
that 's what the festival is all about .
and as to be expected , people tend to drink to excess .
the brochures and tourist information do n't mention that , but it 's a given .
sometimes the situation gets a bit out of hand or worse .
minor struggles and fist fights with heavy glass beer mugs breaking are not that uncommon , but usually they are quickly suppressed .
police and medical officials are always on hand to make sure things do n't get out of control .
last year the city adopted a two-pronged approach to respond to reports of sexual assault .
it set up a centrally located security point , staffed by women and open everyday from 6:00 at night to 1:00 in the morning .
it also launched a campaign called " a safe oktoberfest for girls and women " to discourage sexual harassment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : view of munich 's oktoberfest with the st. paul 's cathedral in the background do the darker sides of the festival deter visitors or dampen their mood ?
not really , says wolf wilberg .
" i 'm glad that the police have this under control .
there are always people who do not know where the limits are .
but it is more the fun and spirit of friendship and companionship , and people feel that the atmosphere is more important than heavy drinking .

3 , munich revolves around beer the world 's largest folk festival ended this weekend in germany .
the annual oktoberfest in munich attracted over six million people and was , as usual , a great party full of dancing , rides , and of course beer . it 's hard to describe oktoberfest to those who have never been there .
part party , festival and carnival with singalongs , costumes , rides and games , the ultimate beer bash is something you just have to experience , says dw-radio 's allison frost , who spoke with several visitors during oktoberfest 's last weekend .
a toast to gemütlichkeit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors lift their maß , one-liter mugs of beer , during the oktoberfest after spending less than an hour in one of the festival 's enormous beer tents , it 's hard to get the refrain of one of the beer drinker 's favorite songs out of your head .
" a toast , a toast to gemütlichkeit . "
it 's an homage to that uniquely german word for the feeling of sociability , hospitality and that relaxed sense of belonging that defies translation .
in munich , bavaria 's capital and the home to oktoberfest , gemütlichkeit is written big - almost as big as the one-liter mugs that are passed around full of beer .
the jovial good spirit that exudes from the packed beer tents and the experience of locking arms and swaying along with hundreds of other strangers is what keeps drawing back visitors .
this year there were over six million .
for wolf wilberg , who comes to the " wiesn , " as the locals call it , every year , there 's just one way to sum up the oktoberfest experience : home .
the retired teacher hails originally from berlin , but has been a " bavarian at heart " for years .
" this is about being among people which share our attitudes towards life .
which means , we are proud of our traditions and we welcome guests from all over the world , " he says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional brass bands are an integral part of the oktoberfest tradition " when you come here , people will say , hocke die heir , which means come here and have a seat .
and it is less than a minute before you are in an intimate talk and you know your neighbor and you share or do not share his opinions .
if you are completely different you at least share the same beer and the same pretzel and that 's that , " wilberg says of the down-home nature of oktoberfest .
jan schöbel , a munich native , has just returned from studying abroad in portland , oregon .
he says he 's glad to be back in town for the big event : " i like the beer .
when i was a little bit younger , i liked the rides . "
but the main reason he likes oktoberfest is " to sit together in a beer tent or in the beer garden if the weather is nice , have fun with friends and meet foreign people . "
when you 've had too much to drink of course the focus is really on the beer .
that 's what the festival is all about .
and as to be expected , people tend to drink to excess .
the brochures and tourist information do n't mention that , but it 's a given .
sometimes the situation gets a bit out of hand or worse .
minor struggles and fist fights with heavy glass beer mugs breaking are not that uncommon , but usually they are quickly suppressed .
police and medical officials are always on hand to make sure things do n't get out of control .
last year the city adopted a two-pronged approach to respond to reports of sexual assault .
it set up a centrally located security point , staffed by women and open everyday from 6:00 at night to 1:00 in the morning .
it also launched a campaign called " a safe oktoberfest for girls and women " to discourage sexual harassment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : view of munich 's oktoberfest with the st. paul 's cathedral in the background do the darker sides of the festival deter visitors or dampen their mood ?
not really , says wolf wilberg .
" i 'm glad that the police have this under control .
there are always people who do not know where the limits are .
but it is more the fun and spirit of friendship and companionship , and people feel that the atmosphere is more important than heavy drinking .

now , many want it back on oct.3 , germany marks 14 years since reunification .
although the physical barrier between east and west is a thing of the past , many germans still speak about the " mauer im kopf " - the wall in the head . in berlin today , there 's very little left of the berlin wall .
even those who 've lived here all their lives have difficulty remembering exactly where it used to be .
but if every fifth person in germany had their way , the barrier that split the country during the cold war would be resurrected .
a recent poll conducted by the forsa research institute found that a quarter of west germans wished the berlin wall could be rebuilt , while 12 percent of east germans said they did n't want to live in a united germany .
it 's not exactly a glowing testimony about the progress made in the 14 years since the wende , the term used here to describe german reunification . stereotypes persist stereotypes about east and west are stubborn .
east germans think of westerners as " besser-wessies , " or arrogant know-it-alls .
west germans , in turn , roll their eyes about the " jammer ossies , " or whining easterners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the glittering skyline of frankfurt 's banking district symbolizes west german wealth " east germans have a false perception of affluence in the west .
they overestimate the level of prosperity , and take the upper income level as the average , so many of their demands are unrealistic , " says klaus schröder , an expert on the former east germany at berlin 's free university .
" west germans are envious when they see how much money is being transferred to the east .
many people feel that the true cost of reunification is being hidden from them . " negative western stereotypes about easterners have even been passed down to the younger generation , to those who were teenagers when the wall fell .
there 's been an exodus of young easterners to western cities in the 14 years following reunification , but those who 've remained in the east are often pegged as lazy , unmotivated , and bitter about their future prospects . those assumptions are wrong , say sociologists at a leading public opinion research institute in the southern german city of allensbach .
they quizzed 2,000 germans on their attitudes on typically western values .
while they concluded that , in the east , values such as equality and social justice ranked higher than individual freedom , the researchers admit they were surprised by the responses of young easterners . advantage of youth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drivers in the old east german trabant cars celebrating reunification " the younger generation of easterners are n't just falling back into a basic attitude of depression , they 're taking initiative , " thomas petersen , project leader at the allensbach institute told dw-world .
" their optimism and strength is tangible , and those are the qualities that a region needs to pull itself out of the doldrums . " that description could apply to leipzig resident rita barwitzki , 26 , who was a pre-teen when the wall fell .
she says living through the experience has made her stronger . " i gave up a piece of my identity , and because of that , there was this impulse to experience new things , and not to stay stuck in the past , " she recalls .
" and there were new things , there was a whole new system .
i think i 'm more free , more independent today because of those changes . " but barwitzki could n't be more different from fellow easterner lutz r. , a berliner who was in his early 30s when the wall fell .
as incredible as it sounds to western ears , lutz says he felt more free under the east german regime than he does now . " freedom is relative .
in my job now , if i were to complain to my boss about how things are working , i would have to worry about getting fired .
for me , that means i 'm not free , " lutz told dw-world .
" in east germany , i could say what i thought .
not about the government , of course , but then i did n't have anything against the government .
but at work , if i complained to my boss , he 'd listen , and i did n't have to fear the consequences . " lutz remembers east germany as a great country for young people - a place where he had a steady job , enough food , and a nice apartment located just a few meters from the berlin wall .
it 's presence never bothered him .
on the contrary , it reassured him . " the wall was an anti-fascist protective measure , it was there to protect us from the west , " he says . money not enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german chancellor helmut kohl oversaw the reunification process for east germany expert klaus schröder , the persistence of such attitudes stems from key decisions made in 1990 when the two germanys became one . " from the very beginning of reunification , we only thought about the money , " schröder explains .
" but that was only half the story .
we should have also paid attention to the fact that this reunited nation would need to start sharing common values .
back then , everybody thought that those problems would go away if you threw money at them .
that 's proved not to be true . " while few expected reunification to happen overnight , those who experienced the euphoria in 1989 when the wall fell would probably not have guessed that , in 2004 , the gap between east and west would still be so wide .
it seems that germany 's best hope of breaking down the " wall in the head " lies in its young people , for whom the cold war is an indistinct , childhood memory . deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de breaching the east-west economic divide when the german cabinet presented its annual report on the state of german unity wednesday , it reached the unexpected conclusion that the economic gap between east and west has , in fact , begun to close .

who deserves to be a saint ?
the question is a source of great debate among catholics .
on sunday , charles i of austria will be beatified at the vatican , while an angry dispute erupts over his historic role at home . for centuries , the announcement of the beatification of a new saint had been big news in the catholic church .
at the start of the 21st century one could argue that the importance of such a ceremony has faded somewhat , at least in the media .
but in austria , the naming of emperor charles i , who ruled for just short of two years at the end of world war i , has caused quite a stir , as the country 's leading news magazine referred to the last ruler of the austro-hungarian empire as " the patron saint of losers . "
herbert lackner , chief editor of the viennese magazine profil criticized the beatification of charles i as tantamount to anointing a proponent of war .
although the emperor himself " was not as much of a war hawk as his generals , he was too weak to actually make the decisive turn to peace , " he wrote ahead of sunday 's ceremony .
lackner also said charles was responsible for the use of mustard gas during the end of the war , which resulted in the deaths of hundreds of soldiers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emperor charles i " he was the supreme commander .
if he had ordered them not to use it , they would n't have done so , " lackner said .
powerful name recognition the journalist maintained charles got beatification because the vatican succumbed to decades of lobbying by the habsburg family that formerly ruled austria.british historian and lawyer james bogel , however , claimed the media is acting like the paparazzi by leveling untruths at the habsburg family because of a deep-seated paranoia about the country 's monarchic past .
" if you 've got people with that degree of paranoia , it 's not surprising that they write articles like this , " said the lawyer , who speaks on behalf of the family .
walburga , the countess douglas and granddaughter of charles , was of the same opinion .
speaking to dw-radio from rome , the royal heiress said pope john paul ii was responsible for the decision and has been more creative than his predecessors in picking the new saints of the catholic church .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope john paul ii " our pope tries to find people who can be symbols for a group of persons , and he was trying to find somebody who can become the symbol for the politicians .
he might be the saint for the politicians , " she explained .
as to accusations that charles was a poor statesman and morally reproachable for allowing generals to use deadly mustard gas , the countess recalled that politicians during the time of her grandfather were in a much different position than today , and many were much harsher when it came to war .
" you will always find people who are going to say , how can you beatify a person who was leading a war , " she said , while adding that charles i was fulfilling the will of god .
one miracle is enough in his official biography - published by the vatican - historians argue that charles i strove tirelessly for peace until abdication in 1918 .
as a dedicated catholic , he was also the only european leader who backed the peace efforts of pope benedict the fifteenth .
according to james bogel , there is also no actual record that the emperor actually authorized mustard gas .
during the war " he certainly refused to attack civilian shipping .
he refused to shell italian civilians .
and he refused to send lenin in a sealed train back to russia , " all reasons bogel has cited for showing that charles i was not as bad as the media makes him out to be .
for the vatican , though , the proof of charles ' saintliness lies elsewhere .
the catholic church said the deceased emperor miraculously healed the varicose veins of a brazilian nun when she prayed to him in 1960 , and one miracle is all it takes for beatification . eric campano -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de historians question the beatification of blessed charles the last emperor of the habsburg dynasty , charles the first of austria , is to be beatified by the pope .
news that the deceased monarch will become blessed charles has prompted many to question the pontiff ’ s choice .

who deserves to be a saint ?
the question is a source of great debate among catholics .
on sunday , charles i of austria will be beatified at the vatican , while an angry dispute erupts over his historic role at home . for centuries , the announcement of the beatification of a new saint had been big news in the catholic church .
at the start of the 21st century one could argue that the importance of such a ceremony has faded somewhat , at least in the media .
but in austria , the naming of emperor charles i , who ruled for just short of two years at the end of world war i , has caused quite a stir , as the country 's leading news magazine referred to the last ruler of the austro-hungarian empire as " the patron saint of losers . "
herbert lackner , chief editor of the viennese magazine profil criticized the beatification of charles i as tantamount to anointing a proponent of war .
although the emperor himself " was not as much of a war hawk as his generals , he was too weak to actually make the decisive turn to peace , " he wrote ahead of sunday 's ceremony .
lackner also said charles was responsible for the use of mustard gas during the end of the war , which resulted in the deaths of hundreds of soldiers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emperor charles i " he was the supreme commander .
if he had ordered them not to use it , they would n't have done so , " lackner said .
powerful name recognition the journalist maintained charles got beatification because the vatican succumbed to decades of lobbying by the habsburg family that formerly ruled austria.british historian and lawyer james bogel , however , claimed the media is acting like the paparazzi by leveling untruths at the habsburg family because of a deep-seated paranoia about the country 's monarchic past .
" if you 've got people with that degree of paranoia , it 's not surprising that they write articles like this , " said the lawyer , who speaks on behalf of the family .
walburga , the countess douglas and granddaughter of charles , was of the same opinion .
speaking to dw-radio from rome , the royal heiress said pope john paul ii was responsible for the decision and has been more creative than his predecessors in picking the new saints of the catholic church .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope john paul ii " our pope tries to find people who can be symbols for a group of persons , and he was trying to find somebody who can become the symbol for the politicians .
he might be the saint for the politicians , " she explained .
as to accusations that charles was a poor statesman and morally reproachable for allowing generals to use deadly mustard gas , the countess recalled that politicians during the time of her grandfather were in a much different position than today , and many were much harsher when it came to war .
" you will always find people who are going to say , how can you beatify a person who was leading a war , " she said , while adding that charles i was fulfilling the will of god .
one miracle is enough in his official biography - published by the vatican - historians argue that charles i strove tirelessly for peace until abdication in 1918 .
as a dedicated catholic , he was also the only european leader who backed the peace efforts of pope benedict the fifteenth .
according to james bogel , there is also no actual record that the emperor actually authorized mustard gas .
during the war " he certainly refused to attack civilian shipping .
he refused to shell italian civilians .
and he refused to send lenin in a sealed train back to russia , " all reasons bogel has cited for showing that charles i was not as bad as the media makes him out to be .
for the vatican , though , the proof of charles ' saintliness lies elsewhere .
the catholic church said the deceased emperor miraculously healed the varicose veins of a brazilian nun when she prayed to him in 1960 , and one miracle is all it takes for beatification . eric campano -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de historians question the beatification of blessed charles the last emperor of the habsburg dynasty , charles the first of austria , is to be beatified by the pope .

now , many want it back on oct.3 , germany marks 14 years since reunification .
although the physical barrier between east and west is a thing of the past , many germans still speak about the " mauer im kopf " - the wall in the head . in berlin today , there 's very little left of the berlin wall .
even those who 've lived here all their lives have difficulty remembering exactly where it used to be .
but if every fifth person in germany had their way , the barrier that split the country during the cold war would be resurrected .
a recent poll conducted by the forsa research institute found that a quarter of west germans wished the berlin wall could be rebuilt , while 12 percent of east germans said they did n't want to live in a united germany .
it 's not exactly a glowing testimony about the progress made in the 14 years since the wende , the term used here to describe german reunification . stereotypes persist stereotypes about east and west are stubborn .
east germans think of westerners as " besser-wessies , " or arrogant know-it-alls .
west germans , in turn , roll their eyes about the " jammer ossies , " or whining easterners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the glittering skyline of frankfurt 's banking district symbolizes west german wealth " east germans have a false perception of affluence in the west .
they overestimate the level of prosperity , and take the upper income level as the average , so many of their demands are unrealistic , " says klaus schröder , an expert on the former east germany at berlin 's free university .
" west germans are envious when they see how much money is being transferred to the east .
many people feel that the true cost of reunification is being hidden from them . " negative western stereotypes about easterners have even been passed down to the younger generation , to those who were teenagers when the wall fell .
there 's been an exodus of young easterners to western cities in the 14 years following reunification , but those who 've remained in the east are often pegged as lazy , unmotivated , and bitter about their future prospects . those assumptions are wrong , say sociologists at a leading public opinion research institute in the southern german city of allensbach .
they quizzed 2,000 germans on their attitudes on typically western values .
while they concluded that , in the east , values such as equality and social justice ranked higher than individual freedom , the researchers admit they were surprised by the responses of young easterners . advantage of youth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drivers in the old east german trabant cars celebrating reunification " the younger generation of easterners are n't just falling back into a basic attitude of depression , they 're taking initiative , " thomas petersen , project leader at the allensbach institute told dw-world .
" their optimism and strength is tangible , and those are the qualities that a region needs to pull itself out of the doldrums . " that description could apply to leipzig resident rita barwitzki , 26 , who was a pre-teen when the wall fell .
she says living through the experience has made her stronger . " i gave up a piece of my identity , and because of that , there was this impulse to experience new things , and not to stay stuck in the past , " she recalls .
" and there were new things , there was a whole new system .
i think i 'm more free , more independent today because of those changes . " but barwitzki could n't be more different from fellow easterner lutz r. , a berliner who was in his early 30s when the wall fell .
as incredible as it sounds to western ears , lutz says he felt more free under the east german regime than he does now . " freedom is relative .
in my job now , if i were to complain to my boss about how things are working , i would have to worry about getting fired .
for me , that means i 'm not free , " lutz told dw-world .
" in east germany , i could say what i thought .
not about the government , of course , but then i did n't have anything against the government .
but at work , if i complained to my boss , he 'd listen , and i did n't have to fear the consequences . " lutz remembers east germany as a great country for young people - a place where he had a steady job , enough food , and a nice apartment located just a few meters from the berlin wall .
it 's presence never bothered him .
on the contrary , it reassured him . " the wall was an anti-fascist protective measure , it was there to protect us from the west , " he says . money not enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german chancellor helmut kohl oversaw the reunification process for east germany expert klaus schröder , the persistence of such attitudes stems from key decisions made in 1990 when the two germanys became one . " from the very beginning of reunification , we only thought about the money , " schröder explains .
" but that was only half the story .
we should have also paid attention to the fact that this reunited nation would need to start sharing common values .
back then , everybody thought that those problems would go away if you threw money at them .
that 's proved not to be true . " while few expected reunification to happen overnight , those who experienced the euphoria in 1989 when the wall fell would probably not have guessed that , in 2004 , the gap between east and west would still be so wide .
it seems that germany 's best hope of breaking down the " wall in the head " lies in its young people , for whom the cold war is an indistinct , childhood memory . deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de breaching the east-west economic divide when the german cabinet presented its annual report on the state of german unity wednesday , it reached the unexpected conclusion that the economic gap between east and west has , in fact , begun to close .

" the world economy is strengthening , but the recovery has been uneven , " british chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown said after a meeting of the imf 's policymaking international monetary and financial committee , of which he is chairman .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown " and with oil prices doubling and imbalances worsening , we agreed that action must be taken to address risks to the recovery , " he said .
world bank president james wolfensohn cited " persistent global imbalances , which require , in particular , readjustment of monetary and fiscal policies in the us , and structural reforms to boost growth in japan , europe and elsewhere . "
he noted that heavily indebted and oil-importing developing countries " are vulnerable to the combination or rising oil prices and interest rates .
mitigating and managing these risks remain important challenges for us all . "
britain sets the example for debt relief following on the heels of the g7 meeting , the imf steering committee also addressed the need to improve debt relief for the world 's poorest nations .
as in the meeting two days earlier between financial leaders from the world 's wealthiest nations , the imf was full of pledges and affirmations , but failed to endorse specific measures which would write-off the debts owed to the world bank by poor countries .
instead gordon brown described the commitment expressed by the g7 as " very significant progress , " and pointed out that the group was preparing a progress report addressing the sustainability of debt relief for the neediest countries .
" there is a growing consensus that multilateral debt relief has to be dealt with as soon as possible , " he said .
" the uk will lead the way in relieving those countries still under the burden of this debt by paying our share - 10 percent - of their payments to the world bank and the african development bank , " brown announced , adding : " and we urge other governments to follow us in this . "
bildunterschrift : a child stands outside squatter shacks watching the rising waters in the alexandra township north of johannesburg , south africa increasing development aid meanwhile the imf and world bank appealed to industrialized countries to uphold their pledge of spending 0.7 percent of their gross domestic product to support developing countries , particularly those in sub-saharan africa .
agreed to in 1969 during a un conference , only a handful of countries have met the target , including norway and sweden .

now , many want it back on oct.3 , germany marks 14 years since reunification .
although the physical barrier between east and west is a thing of the past , many germans still speak about the " mauer im kopf " - the wall in the head . in berlin today , there 's very little left of the berlin wall .
even those who 've lived here all their lives have difficulty remembering exactly where it used to be .
but if every fifth person in germany had their way , the barrier that split the country during the cold war would be resurrected .
a recent poll conducted by the forsa research institute found that a quarter of west germans wished the berlin wall could be rebuilt , while 12 percent of east germans said they did n't want to live in a united germany .
it 's not exactly a glowing testimony about the progress made in the 14 years since the wende , the term used here to describe german reunification . stereotypes persist stereotypes about east and west are stubborn .
east germans think of westerners as " besser-wessies , " or arrogant know-it-alls .
west germans , in turn , roll their eyes about the " jammer ossies , " or whining easterners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the glittering skyline of frankfurt 's banking district symbolizes west german wealth " east germans have a false perception of affluence in the west .
they overestimate the level of prosperity , and take the upper income level as the average , so many of their demands are unrealistic , " says klaus schröder , an expert on the former east germany at berlin 's free university .
" west germans are envious when they see how much money is being transferred to the east .
many people feel that the true cost of reunification is being hidden from them . " negative western stereotypes about easterners have even been passed down to the younger generation , to those who were teenagers when the wall fell .
there 's been an exodus of young easterners to western cities in the 14 years following reunification , but those who 've remained in the east are often pegged as lazy , unmotivated , and bitter about their future prospects . those assumptions are wrong , say sociologists at a leading public opinion research institute in the southern german city of allensbach .
they quizzed 2,000 germans on their attitudes on typically western values .
while they concluded that , in the east , values such as equality and social justice ranked higher than individual freedom , the researchers admit they were surprised by the responses of young easterners . advantage of youth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drivers in the old east german trabant cars celebrating reunification " the younger generation of easterners are n't just falling back into a basic attitude of depression , they 're taking initiative , " thomas petersen , project leader at the allensbach institute told dw-world .
" their optimism and strength is tangible , and those are the qualities that a region needs to pull itself out of the doldrums . " that description could apply to leipzig resident rita barwitzki , 26 , who was a pre-teen when the wall fell .
she says living through the experience has made her stronger . " i gave up a piece of my identity , and because of that , there was this impulse to experience new things , and not to stay stuck in the past , " she recalls .
" and there were new things , there was a whole new system .
i think i 'm more free , more independent today because of those changes . " but barwitzki could n't be more different from fellow easterner lutz r. , a berliner who was in his early 30s when the wall fell .
as incredible as it sounds to western ears , lutz says he felt more free under the east german regime than he does now . " freedom is relative .
in my job now , if i were to complain to my boss about how things are working , i would have to worry about getting fired .
for me , that means i 'm not free , " lutz told dw-world .
" in east germany , i could say what i thought .
not about the government , of course , but then i did n't have anything against the government .
but at work , if i complained to my boss , he 'd listen , and i did n't have to fear the consequences . " lutz remembers east germany as a great country for young people - a place where he had a steady job , enough food , and a nice apartment located just a few meters from the berlin wall .
it 's presence never bothered him .
on the contrary , it reassured him . " the wall was an anti-fascist protective measure , it was there to protect us from the west , " he says . money not enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german chancellor helmut kohl oversaw the reunification process for east germany expert klaus schröder , the persistence of such attitudes stems from key decisions made in 1990 when the two germanys became one . " from the very beginning of reunification , we only thought about the money , " schröder explains .
" but that was only half the story .
we should have also paid attention to the fact that this reunited nation would need to start sharing common values .
back then , everybody thought that those problems would go away if you threw money at them .
that 's proved not to be true . " while few expected reunification to happen overnight , those who experienced the euphoria in 1989 when the wall fell would probably not have guessed that , in 2004 , the gap between east and west would still be so wide .
it seems that germany 's best hope of breaking down the " wall in the head " lies in its young people , for whom the cold war is an indistinct , childhood memory . deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de breaching the east-west economic divide when the german cabinet presented its annual report on the state of german unity wednesday , it reached the unexpected conclusion that the economic gap between east and west has , in fact , begun to close .

"
this week , the european commission will publish a report expected to give turkey the go ahead to start accession talks .
in an interview with deutsche welle , the turkish premier was convinced this would take place . on oct .
6 , the executive branch of the eu will present a long-awaited progress report on ankara 's chances of joining the 25-member bloc .
the findings of the study will form the basis of a decision by eu leaders at a december summit on whether or not to begin membership negotiations with turkey .
the commission is widely expected to give the thumbs up .
however , an impact study to be approved alongside the main recommendations suggests that the predominantly muslim country on the fringe of europe will not be able to count itself a full-fledged member of the eu until well into the next decade .
eu enlargement commissioner günter verheugen has predicted a long and bumpy road full of specific prerequisites both for ankara and the larger bloc .
verheugen , who only two weeks ago announced there were " no more problems on the table " and no further obstacles to beginning accession talks , has now indicated that certain requirements need to be fulfilled before the eu can welcome turkey into its fold .
first among them , according to inside sources , is a restricted access to the european labor market .
in contrast to the current new members who enjoy free circulation of labor after a certain period of time , verheugen favors long-term restrictions for turks seeking jobs in existing member states .
the enlargement commissioner would also like to stipulate changes in the eu agricultural subsidies system , which if left in place would result in annual costs of between 16 and 28 billion euros -lrb- $ 19 to $ 34 billion -rrb- once turkey joins , and stricter controls of political reforms .
no new requirements in an interview with deutsche welle and a small circle of german journalists , turkish minister president recep tayyip erdogan adamantly rejected any further stipulations to beginning membership talks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan refers to the enlargement commissioner as " my good friend , " after günter verheugen announced there were no more problems ahead of beginning negotiations .
" i have never heard anything like that from mr. verheugen , not in any way .
in the catalog of criteria for the european union there is no such thing as requirements for beginning negotiations .
he could perhaps write something about our little faults .
that would be normal and would be cleared up during the negotiation period , " erdogan said .
as to the significant sum in subsidies the eu would have to shoulder in the decade following turkey 's accession , the premier said it was too early to make any such assumptions : " in my opinion it 's too early to begin talking about such things .
in helsinki in 1999 , the eu decided that turkey was a candidate for membership .
all these things were prepared with the full awareness of the eu .
in the coming years , the situation will change dramatically .
one should not only talk about what the eu will have to pay .
one should also say what the eu will gain through turkey 's membership . "
no question of membership in its impact study , the eu commission addresses the economic benefits turkey would bring to the rest of europe and concluded that ankara 's relatively weak economy would not result in a significant boon for the bloc .
despite opposition to turkey 's membership , erdogan is convinced that in december the 25 heads of state and government will recommend starting accession talks .
a further postponement or a rejection is out of the question , the prime minister said .

26 , 2002 in copenhagen after the eu came up with a set of criteria for ankara " that would be a hard punch for me and my people , because we have done our homework .
it is now up to the eu to hold up their end .
we have done everything as it stands in the criteria .
commissioner verheugen said , there are no more problems on the table .
the world was our witness .
i do not believe that it will happen , but should we receive a negative answer than we will just rename the copenhagen criteria -lrb- the list of requirements for membership -rrb- the ankara criteria and go our own way .

this week , the european commission will publish a report expected to give turkey the go ahead to start accession talks .
in an interview with deutsche welle , the turkish premier was convinced this would take place . on oct .
6 , the executive branch of the eu will present a long-awaited progress report on ankara 's chances of joining the 25-member bloc .
the findings of the study will form the basis of a decision by eu leaders at a december summit on whether or not to begin membership negotiations with turkey .
the commission is widely expected to give the thumbs up .
however , an impact study to be approved alongside the main recommendations suggests that the predominantly muslim country on the fringe of europe will not be able to count itself a full-fledged member of the eu until well into the next decade .
eu enlargement commissioner günter verheugen has predicted a long and bumpy road full of specific prerequisites both for ankara and the larger bloc .
verheugen , who only two weeks ago announced there were " no more problems on the table " and no further obstacles to beginning accession talks , has now indicated that certain requirements need to be fulfilled before the eu can welcome turkey into its fold .
first among them , according to inside sources , is a restricted access to the european labor market .
in contrast to the current new members who enjoy free circulation of labor after a certain period of time , verheugen favors long-term restrictions for turks seeking jobs in existing member states .
the enlargement commissioner would also like to stipulate changes in the eu agricultural subsidies system , which if left in place would result in annual costs of between 16 and 28 billion euros -lrb- $ 19 to $ 34 billion -rrb- once turkey joins , and stricter controls of political reforms .
no new requirements in an interview with deutsche welle and a small circle of german journalists , turkish minister president recep tayyip erdogan adamantly rejected any further stipulations to beginning membership talks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan refers to the enlargement commissioner as " my good friend , " after günter verheugen announced there were no more problems ahead of beginning negotiations .
" i have never heard anything like that from mr. verheugen , not in any way .
in the catalog of criteria for the european union there is no such thing as requirements for beginning negotiations .
he could perhaps write something about our little faults .
that would be normal and would be cleared up during the negotiation period , " erdogan said .
as to the significant sum in subsidies the eu would have to shoulder in the decade following turkey 's accession , the premier said it was too early to make any such assumptions : " in my opinion it 's too early to begin talking about such things .
in helsinki in 1999 , the eu decided that turkey was a candidate for membership .
all these things were prepared with the full awareness of the eu .
in the coming years , the situation will change dramatically .
one should not only talk about what the eu will have to pay .
one should also say what the eu will gain through turkey 's membership . "
no question of membership in its impact study , the eu commission addresses the economic benefits turkey would bring to the rest of europe and concluded that ankara 's relatively weak economy would not result in a significant boon for the bloc .
despite opposition to turkey 's membership , erdogan is convinced that in december the 25 heads of state and government will recommend starting accession talks .
a further postponement or a rejection is out of the question , the prime minister said .

the findings of the study will form the basis of a decision by eu leaders at a december summit on whether or not to begin membership negotiations with turkey .
the commission is widely expected to give the thumbs up .
however , an impact study to be approved alongside the main recommendations suggests that the predominantly muslim country on the fringe of europe will not be able to count itself a full-fledged member of the eu until well into the next decade .
eu enlargement commissioner günter verheugen has predicted a long and bumpy road full of specific prerequisites both for ankara and the larger bloc .
verheugen , who only two weeks ago announced there were " no more problems on the table " and no further obstacles to beginning accession talks , has now indicated that certain requirements need to be fulfilled before the eu can welcome turkey into its fold .
first among them , according to inside sources , is a restricted access to the european labor market .
in contrast to the current new members who enjoy free circulation of labor after a certain period of time , verheugen favors long-term restrictions for turks seeking jobs in existing member states .
the enlargement commissioner would also like to stipulate changes in the eu agricultural subsidies system , which if left in place would result in annual costs of between 16 and 28 billion euros -lrb- $ 19 to $ 34 billion -rrb- once turkey joins , and stricter controls of political reforms .
no new requirements in an interview with deutsche welle and a small circle of german journalists , turkish minister president recep tayyip erdogan adamantly rejected any further stipulations to beginning membership talks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan refers to the enlargement commissioner as " my good friend , " after günter verheugen announced there were no more problems ahead of beginning negotiations .
" i have never heard anything like that from mr. verheugen , not in any way .
in the catalog of criteria for the european union there is no such thing as requirements for beginning negotiations .
he could perhaps write something about our little faults .
that would be normal and would be cleared up during the negotiation period , " erdogan said .
as to the significant sum in subsidies the eu would have to shoulder in the decade following turkey 's accession , the premier said it was too early to make any such assumptions : " in my opinion it 's too early to begin talking about such things .

the joyous scenes of reunification which inspired the world when the berlin wall fell on nov .
9 , 1989 , have remained images of hope , beacons of reconcilliation and the evidence that incredible social change could be achieved against amazing odds .
but the pictures of fireworks over berlin and the streets filled with embracing germans are in danger of seeping into a rose tint in the face of the increasingly harsh reality of a united germany .
escalating costs , shaky economic side-effects , discrepencies in living standards and employment opportunities have been the flip side of the euphoria created by the healing of a nation divided for 41 years .
however , germany continues to work at the problems arising from the recovery process .
here , dw-world presents a series of articles documenting the ups and downs experienced in the past 12 months since the last celebration . dw-world.de opinion : a progress report on german unity it 's been over 13 years since the fall of the berlin wall , but germans still have a lot to learn about each other before the mental east-west border disappears .

-lrb- february 9 , 2004 -rrb- has rebuilding east germany failed ?
germany 's attempt to rebuild its once communist east has been an unmitigated disaster and the massive financial transfers from the west endanger the entire nation 's economy , according to a government-commissioned report .
-lrb- april 6 , 2004 -rrb- berlin 's polar bears : on the way from east to best the berlin eisbären may have placed second in this year 's german hockey league championships , but it 's still a big achievement for the former east german team that struggled to survive after the berlin wall fell .

this week , the european commission will publish a report expected to give turkey the go ahead to start accession talks .
in an interview with deutsche welle , the turkish premier was convinced this would take place . on oct .
6 , the executive branch of the eu will present a long-awaited progress report on ankara 's chances of joining the 25-member bloc .
the findings of the study will form the basis of a decision by eu leaders at a december summit on whether or not to begin membership negotiations with turkey .
the commission is widely expected to give the thumbs up .
however , an impact study to be approved alongside the main recommendations suggests that the predominantly muslim country on the fringe of europe will not be able to count itself a full-fledged member of the eu until well into the next decade .
eu enlargement commissioner günter verheugen has predicted a long and bumpy road full of specific prerequisites both for ankara and the larger bloc .
verheugen , who only two weeks ago announced there were " no more problems on the table " and no further obstacles to beginning accession talks , has now indicated that certain requirements need to be fulfilled before the eu can welcome turkey into its fold .
first among them , according to inside sources , is a restricted access to the european labor market .
in contrast to the current new members who enjoy free circulation of labor after a certain period of time , verheugen favors long-term restrictions for turks seeking jobs in existing member states .
the enlargement commissioner would also like to stipulate changes in the eu agricultural subsidies system , which if left in place would result in annual costs of between 16 and 28 billion euros -lrb- $ 19 to $ 34 billion -rrb- once turkey joins , and stricter controls of political reforms .
no new requirements in an interview with deutsche welle and a small circle of german journalists , turkish minister president recep tayyip erdogan adamantly rejected any further stipulations to beginning membership talks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan refers to the enlargement commissioner as " my good friend , " after günter verheugen announced there were no more problems ahead of beginning negotiations .
" i have never heard anything like that from mr. verheugen , not in any way .
in the catalog of criteria for the european union there is no such thing as requirements for beginning negotiations .
he could perhaps write something about our little faults .
that would be normal and would be cleared up during the negotiation period , " erdogan said .
as to the significant sum in subsidies the eu would have to shoulder in the decade following turkey 's accession , the premier said it was too early to make any such assumptions : " in my opinion it 's too early to begin talking about such things .
in helsinki in 1999 , the eu decided that turkey was a candidate for membership .
all these things were prepared with the full awareness of the eu .
in the coming years , the situation will change dramatically .
one should not only talk about what the eu will have to pay .
one should also say what the eu will gain through turkey 's membership . "
no question of membership in its impact study , the eu commission addresses the economic benefits turkey would bring to the rest of europe and concluded that ankara 's relatively weak economy would not result in a significant boon for the bloc .
despite opposition to turkey 's membership , erdogan is convinced that in december the 25 heads of state and government will recommend starting accession talks .
a further postponement or a rejection is out of the question , the prime minister said .

claudia roth , a charismatic 49-year-old who currently serves as germany 's human rights commissioner , was voted to the top of the green 's leadership along with a re-election for reinhard bütikofer .
roth had previously served as one of the party 's leaders , but was forced to step down in 2002 after being elected to parliament .
after the greens changed party rules last year , enabling parliamentarians to also take on a party position , roth stood for election on saturday .
nearly 78 percent of the 800 delegates voted for her .
roth took over from angelika beer , who was elected to the european parliament .
together with bütikofer , the two are expected to chart the party 's course towards the next federal elections .
opinion polls show the greens have about 13 percent of the vote , four more percentage points than their best-ever wins at the last legislative elections in september 2002 . more briefs 25.09.2004 -pipe- berlin bans neo-nazi rally 24.09.2004 -pipe- brandenburg spd and cdu to continue coalition 23.09.2004 -pipe- are german teachers too old ? 22.09.2004 -pipe- stasi files go online 21.09.2004 -pipe- spd gains good news for chancellor 's chances 17.09.2004 -pipe- schröder says germans too demanding 17.09.2004 -pipe- schily blames constitution protectors for npd success 09.09.2004 -pipe- minister drops change to surveillance law radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

3 , munich revolves around beer the world 's largest folk festival ended this weekend in germany .
the annual oktoberfest in munich attracted over six million people and was , as usual , a great party full of dancing , rides , and of course beer . it 's hard to describe oktoberfest to those who have never been there .
part party , festival and carnival with singalongs , costumes , rides and games , the ultimate beer bash is something you just have to experience , says dw-radio 's allison frost , who spoke with several visitors during oktoberfest 's last weekend .
a toast to gemütlichkeit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors lift their maß , one-liter mugs of beer , during the oktoberfest after spending less than an hour in one of the festival 's enormous beer tents , it 's hard to get the refrain of one of the beer drinker 's favorite songs out of your head .
" a toast , a toast to gemütlichkeit . "
it 's an homage to that uniquely german word for the feeling of sociability , hospitality and that relaxed sense of belonging that defies translation .
in munich , bavaria 's capital and the home to oktoberfest , gemütlichkeit is written big - almost as big as the one-liter mugs that are passed around full of beer .
the jovial good spirit that exudes from the packed beer tents and the experience of locking arms and swaying along with hundreds of other strangers is what keeps drawing back visitors .
this year there were over six million .
for wolf wilberg , who comes to the " wiesn , " as the locals call it , every year , there 's just one way to sum up the oktoberfest experience : home .
the retired teacher hails originally from berlin , but has been a " bavarian at heart " for years .
" this is about being among people which share our attitudes towards life .
which means , we are proud of our traditions and we welcome guests from all over the world , " he says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional brass bands are an integral part of the oktoberfest tradition " when you come here , people will say , hocke die heir , which means come here and have a seat .
and it is less than a minute before you are in an intimate talk and you know your neighbor and you share or do not share his opinions .
if you are completely different you at least share the same beer and the same pretzel and that 's that , " wilberg says of the down-home nature of oktoberfest .
jan schöbel , a munich native , has just returned from studying abroad in portland , oregon .
he says he 's glad to be back in town for the big event : " i like the beer .
when i was a little bit younger , i liked the rides . "
but the main reason he likes oktoberfest is " to sit together in a beer tent or in the beer garden if the weather is nice , have fun with friends and meet foreign people . "
when you 've had too much to drink of course the focus is really on the beer .
that 's what the festival is all about .
and as to be expected , people tend to drink to excess .
the brochures and tourist information do n't mention that , but it 's a given .
sometimes the situation gets a bit out of hand or worse .
minor struggles and fist fights with heavy glass beer mugs breaking are not that uncommon , but usually they are quickly suppressed .
police and medical officials are always on hand to make sure things do n't get out of control .
last year the city adopted a two-pronged approach to respond to reports of sexual assault .
it set up a centrally located security point , staffed by women and open everyday from 6:00 at night to 1:00 in the morning .
it also launched a campaign called " a safe oktoberfest for girls and women " to discourage sexual harassment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : view of munich 's oktoberfest with the st. paul 's cathedral in the background do the darker sides of the festival deter visitors or dampen their mood ?
not really , says wolf wilberg .
" i 'm glad that the police have this under control .
there are always people who do not know where the limits are .
but it is more the fun and spirit of friendship and companionship , and people feel that the atmosphere is more important than heavy drinking .

18 to oct .
3 , munich revolves around beer the world 's largest folk festival ended this weekend in germany .
the annual oktoberfest in munich attracted over six million people and was , as usual , a great party full of dancing , rides , and of course beer . it 's hard to describe oktoberfest to those who have never been there .
part party , festival and carnival with singalongs , costumes , rides and games , the ultimate beer bash is something you just have to experience , says dw-radio 's allison frost , who spoke with several visitors during oktoberfest 's last weekend .
a toast to gemütlichkeit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors lift their maß , one-liter mugs of beer , during the oktoberfest after spending less than an hour in one of the festival 's enormous beer tents , it 's hard to get the refrain of one of the beer drinker 's favorite songs out of your head .
" a toast , a toast to gemütlichkeit . "
it 's an homage to that uniquely german word for the feeling of sociability , hospitality and that relaxed sense of belonging that defies translation .
in munich , bavaria 's capital and the home to oktoberfest , gemütlichkeit is written big - almost as big as the one-liter mugs that are passed around full of beer .
the jovial good spirit that exudes from the packed beer tents and the experience of locking arms and swaying along with hundreds of other strangers is what keeps drawing back visitors .
this year there were over six million .
for wolf wilberg , who comes to the " wiesn , " as the locals call it , every year , there 's just one way to sum up the oktoberfest experience : home .
the retired teacher hails originally from berlin , but has been a " bavarian at heart " for years .
" this is about being among people which share our attitudes towards life .
which means , we are proud of our traditions and we welcome guests from all over the world , " he says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional brass bands are an integral part of the oktoberfest tradition " when you come here , people will say , hocke die heir , which means come here and have a seat .
and it is less than a minute before you are in an intimate talk and you know your neighbor and you share or do not share his opinions .
if you are completely different you at least share the same beer and the same pretzel and that 's that , " wilberg says of the down-home nature of oktoberfest .
jan schöbel , a munich native , has just returned from studying abroad in portland , oregon .
he says he 's glad to be back in town for the big event : " i like the beer .
when i was a little bit younger , i liked the rides . "
but the main reason he likes oktoberfest is " to sit together in a beer tent or in the beer garden if the weather is nice , have fun with friends and meet foreign people . "
when you 've had too much to drink of course the focus is really on the beer .
that 's what the festival is all about .
and as to be expected , people tend to drink to excess .
the brochures and tourist information do n't mention that , but it 's a given .
sometimes the situation gets a bit out of hand or worse .
minor struggles and fist fights with heavy glass beer mugs breaking are not that uncommon , but usually they are quickly suppressed .
police and medical officials are always on hand to make sure things do n't get out of control .
last year the city adopted a two-pronged approach to respond to reports of sexual assault .
it set up a centrally located security point , staffed by women and open everyday from 6:00 at night to 1:00 in the morning .
it also launched a campaign called " a safe oktoberfest for girls and women " to discourage sexual harassment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : view of munich 's oktoberfest with the st. paul 's cathedral in the background do the darker sides of the festival deter visitors or dampen their mood ?
not really , says wolf wilberg .
" i 'm glad that the police have this under control .
there are always people who do not know where the limits are .
but it is more the fun and spirit of friendship and companionship , and people feel that the atmosphere is more important than heavy drinking .

18 to oct .
3 , munich revolves around beer the world 's largest folk festival ended this weekend in germany .
the annual oktoberfest in munich attracted over six million people and was , as usual , a great party full of dancing , rides , and of course beer . it 's hard to describe oktoberfest to those who have never been there .
part party , festival and carnival with singalongs , costumes , rides and games , the ultimate beer bash is something you just have to experience , says dw-radio 's allison frost , who spoke with several visitors during oktoberfest 's last weekend .
a toast to gemütlichkeit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors lift their maß , one-liter mugs of beer , during the oktoberfest after spending less than an hour in one of the festival 's enormous beer tents , it 's hard to get the refrain of one of the beer drinker 's favorite songs out of your head .
" a toast , a toast to gemütlichkeit . "
it 's an homage to that uniquely german word for the feeling of sociability , hospitality and that relaxed sense of belonging that defies translation .
in munich , bavaria 's capital and the home to oktoberfest , gemütlichkeit is written big - almost as big as the one-liter mugs that are passed around full of beer .
the jovial good spirit that exudes from the packed beer tents and the experience of locking arms and swaying along with hundreds of other strangers is what keeps drawing back visitors .
this year there were over six million .
for wolf wilberg , who comes to the " wiesn , " as the locals call it , every year , there 's just one way to sum up the oktoberfest experience : home .
the retired teacher hails originally from berlin , but has been a " bavarian at heart " for years .
" this is about being among people which share our attitudes towards life .
which means , we are proud of our traditions and we welcome guests from all over the world , " he says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional brass bands are an integral part of the oktoberfest tradition " when you come here , people will say , hocke die heir , which means come here and have a seat .
and it is less than a minute before you are in an intimate talk and you know your neighbor and you share or do not share his opinions .
if you are completely different you at least share the same beer and the same pretzel and that 's that , " wilberg says of the down-home nature of oktoberfest .
jan schöbel , a munich native , has just returned from studying abroad in portland , oregon .
he says he 's glad to be back in town for the big event : " i like the beer .
when i was a little bit younger , i liked the rides . "
but the main reason he likes oktoberfest is " to sit together in a beer tent or in the beer garden if the weather is nice , have fun with friends and meet foreign people . "
when you 've had too much to drink of course the focus is really on the beer .
that 's what the festival is all about .
and as to be expected , people tend to drink to excess .
the brochures and tourist information do n't mention that , but it 's a given .
sometimes the situation gets a bit out of hand or worse .
minor struggles and fist fights with heavy glass beer mugs breaking are not that uncommon , but usually they are quickly suppressed .
police and medical officials are always on hand to make sure things do n't get out of control .
last year the city adopted a two-pronged approach to respond to reports of sexual assault .
it set up a centrally located security point , staffed by women and open everyday from 6:00 at night to 1:00 in the morning .
it also launched a campaign called " a safe oktoberfest for girls and women " to discourage sexual harassment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : view of munich 's oktoberfest with the st. paul 's cathedral in the background do the darker sides of the festival deter visitors or dampen their mood ?
not really , says wolf wilberg .
" i 'm glad that the police have this under control .
there are always people who do not know where the limits are .
but it is more the fun and spirit of friendship and companionship , and people feel that the atmosphere is more important than heavy drinking .

who deserves to be a saint ?
the question is a source of great debate among catholics .
on sunday , charles i of austria will be beatified at the vatican , while an angry dispute erupts over his historic role at home . for centuries , the announcement of the beatification of a new saint had been big news in the catholic church .
at the start of the 21st century one could argue that the importance of such a ceremony has faded somewhat , at least in the media .
but in austria , the naming of emperor charles i , who ruled for just short of two years at the end of world war i , has caused quite a stir , as the country 's leading news magazine referred to the last ruler of the austro-hungarian empire as " the patron saint of losers . "
herbert lackner , chief editor of the viennese magazine profil criticized the beatification of charles i as tantamount to anointing a proponent of war .
although the emperor himself " was not as much of a war hawk as his generals , he was too weak to actually make the decisive turn to peace , " he wrote ahead of sunday 's ceremony .
lackner also said charles was responsible for the use of mustard gas during the end of the war , which resulted in the deaths of hundreds of soldiers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emperor charles i " he was the supreme commander .
if he had ordered them not to use it , they would n't have done so , " lackner said .
powerful name recognition the journalist maintained charles got beatification because the vatican succumbed to decades of lobbying by the habsburg family that formerly ruled austria.british historian and lawyer james bogel , however , claimed the media is acting like the paparazzi by leveling untruths at the habsburg family because of a deep-seated paranoia about the country 's monarchic past .
" if you 've got people with that degree of paranoia , it 's not surprising that they write articles like this , " said the lawyer , who speaks on behalf of the family .
walburga , the countess douglas and granddaughter of charles , was of the same opinion .
speaking to dw-radio from rome , the royal heiress said pope john paul ii was responsible for the decision and has been more creative than his predecessors in picking the new saints of the catholic church .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope john paul ii " our pope tries to find people who can be symbols for a group of persons , and he was trying to find somebody who can become the symbol for the politicians .
he might be the saint for the politicians , " she explained .
as to accusations that charles was a poor statesman and morally reproachable for allowing generals to use deadly mustard gas , the countess recalled that politicians during the time of her grandfather were in a much different position than today , and many were much harsher when it came to war .
" you will always find people who are going to say , how can you beatify a person who was leading a war , " she said , while adding that charles i was fulfilling the will of god .
one miracle is enough in his official biography - published by the vatican - historians argue that charles i strove tirelessly for peace until abdication in 1918 .
as a dedicated catholic , he was also the only european leader who backed the peace efforts of pope benedict the fifteenth .
according to james bogel , there is also no actual record that the emperor actually authorized mustard gas .
during the war " he certainly refused to attack civilian shipping .
he refused to shell italian civilians .
and he refused to send lenin in a sealed train back to russia , " all reasons bogel has cited for showing that charles i was not as bad as the media makes him out to be .
for the vatican , though , the proof of charles ' saintliness lies elsewhere .
the catholic church said the deceased emperor miraculously healed the varicose veins of a brazilian nun when she prayed to him in 1960 , and one miracle is all it takes for beatification . eric campano -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de historians question the beatification of blessed charles the last emperor of the habsburg dynasty , charles the first of austria , is to be beatified by the pope .

who deserves to be a saint ?
the question is a source of great debate among catholics .
on sunday , charles i of austria will be beatified at the vatican , while an angry dispute erupts over his historic role at home . for centuries , the announcement of the beatification of a new saint had been big news in the catholic church .
at the start of the 21st century one could argue that the importance of such a ceremony has faded somewhat , at least in the media .
but in austria , the naming of emperor charles i , who ruled for just short of two years at the end of world war i , has caused quite a stir , as the country 's leading news magazine referred to the last ruler of the austro-hungarian empire as " the patron saint of losers . "
herbert lackner , chief editor of the viennese magazine profil criticized the beatification of charles i as tantamount to anointing a proponent of war .
although the emperor himself " was not as much of a war hawk as his generals , he was too weak to actually make the decisive turn to peace , " he wrote ahead of sunday 's ceremony .
lackner also said charles was responsible for the use of mustard gas during the end of the war , which resulted in the deaths of hundreds of soldiers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emperor charles i " he was the supreme commander .
if he had ordered them not to use it , they would n't have done so , " lackner said .
powerful name recognition the journalist maintained charles got beatification because the vatican succumbed to decades of lobbying by the habsburg family that formerly ruled austria.british historian and lawyer james bogel , however , claimed the media is acting like the paparazzi by leveling untruths at the habsburg family because of a deep-seated paranoia about the country 's monarchic past .
" if you 've got people with that degree of paranoia , it 's not surprising that they write articles like this , " said the lawyer , who speaks on behalf of the family .
walburga , the countess douglas and granddaughter of charles , was of the same opinion .
speaking to dw-radio from rome , the royal heiress said pope john paul ii was responsible for the decision and has been more creative than his predecessors in picking the new saints of the catholic church .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope john paul ii " our pope tries to find people who can be symbols for a group of persons , and he was trying to find somebody who can become the symbol for the politicians .
he might be the saint for the politicians , " she explained .
as to accusations that charles was a poor statesman and morally reproachable for allowing generals to use deadly mustard gas , the countess recalled that politicians during the time of her grandfather were in a much different position than today , and many were much harsher when it came to war .
" you will always find people who are going to say , how can you beatify a person who was leading a war , " she said , while adding that charles i was fulfilling the will of god .
one miracle is enough in his official biography - published by the vatican - historians argue that charles i strove tirelessly for peace until abdication in 1918 .
as a dedicated catholic , he was also the only european leader who backed the peace efforts of pope benedict the fifteenth .
according to james bogel , there is also no actual record that the emperor actually authorized mustard gas .
during the war " he certainly refused to attack civilian shipping .
he refused to shell italian civilians .
and he refused to send lenin in a sealed train back to russia , " all reasons bogel has cited for showing that charles i was not as bad as the media makes him out to be .
for the vatican , though , the proof of charles ' saintliness lies elsewhere .
the catholic church said the deceased emperor miraculously healed the varicose veins of a brazilian nun when she prayed to him in 1960 , and one miracle is all it takes for beatification . eric campano -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de historians question the beatification of blessed charles the last emperor of the habsburg dynasty , charles the first of austria , is to be beatified by the pope .

who deserves to be a saint ?
the question is a source of great debate among catholics .
on sunday , charles i of austria will be beatified at the vatican , while an angry dispute erupts over his historic role at home . for centuries , the announcement of the beatification of a new saint had been big news in the catholic church .
at the start of the 21st century one could argue that the importance of such a ceremony has faded somewhat , at least in the media .
but in austria , the naming of emperor charles i , who ruled for just short of two years at the end of world war i , has caused quite a stir , as the country 's leading news magazine referred to the last ruler of the austro-hungarian empire as " the patron saint of losers . "
herbert lackner , chief editor of the viennese magazine profil criticized the beatification of charles i as tantamount to anointing a proponent of war .
although the emperor himself " was not as much of a war hawk as his generals , he was too weak to actually make the decisive turn to peace , " he wrote ahead of sunday 's ceremony .
lackner also said charles was responsible for the use of mustard gas during the end of the war , which resulted in the deaths of hundreds of soldiers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emperor charles i " he was the supreme commander .
if he had ordered them not to use it , they would n't have done so , " lackner said .
powerful name recognition the journalist maintained charles got beatification because the vatican succumbed to decades of lobbying by the habsburg family that formerly ruled austria.british historian and lawyer james bogel , however , claimed the media is acting like the paparazzi by leveling untruths at the habsburg family because of a deep-seated paranoia about the country 's monarchic past .
" if you 've got people with that degree of paranoia , it 's not surprising that they write articles like this , " said the lawyer , who speaks on behalf of the family .
walburga , the countess douglas and granddaughter of charles , was of the same opinion .
speaking to dw-radio from rome , the royal heiress said pope john paul ii was responsible for the decision and has been more creative than his predecessors in picking the new saints of the catholic church .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope john paul ii " our pope tries to find people who can be symbols for a group of persons , and he was trying to find somebody who can become the symbol for the politicians .
he might be the saint for the politicians , " she explained .
as to accusations that charles was a poor statesman and morally reproachable for allowing generals to use deadly mustard gas , the countess recalled that politicians during the time of her grandfather were in a much different position than today , and many were much harsher when it came to war .
" you will always find people who are going to say , how can you beatify a person who was leading a war , " she said , while adding that charles i was fulfilling the will of god .
one miracle is enough in his official biography - published by the vatican - historians argue that charles i strove tirelessly for peace until abdication in 1918 .
as a dedicated catholic , he was also the only european leader who backed the peace efforts of pope benedict the fifteenth .
according to james bogel , there is also no actual record that the emperor actually authorized mustard gas .
during the war " he certainly refused to attack civilian shipping .
he refused to shell italian civilians .
and he refused to send lenin in a sealed train back to russia , " all reasons bogel has cited for showing that charles i was not as bad as the media makes him out to be .
for the vatican , though , the proof of charles ' saintliness lies elsewhere .
the catholic church said the deceased emperor miraculously healed the varicose veins of a brazilian nun when she prayed to him in 1960 , and one miracle is all it takes for beatification . eric campano -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de historians question the beatification of blessed charles the last emperor of the habsburg dynasty , charles the first of austria , is to be beatified by the pope .

3 , munich revolves around beer the world 's largest folk festival ended this weekend in germany .
the annual oktoberfest in munich attracted over six million people and was , as usual , a great party full of dancing , rides , and of course beer . it 's hard to describe oktoberfest to those who have never been there .
part party , festival and carnival with singalongs , costumes , rides and games , the ultimate beer bash is something you just have to experience , says dw-radio 's allison frost , who spoke with several visitors during oktoberfest 's last weekend .
a toast to gemütlichkeit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors lift their maß , one-liter mugs of beer , during the oktoberfest after spending less than an hour in one of the festival 's enormous beer tents , it 's hard to get the refrain of one of the beer drinker 's favorite songs out of your head .
" a toast , a toast to gemütlichkeit . "
it 's an homage to that uniquely german word for the feeling of sociability , hospitality and that relaxed sense of belonging that defies translation .
in munich , bavaria 's capital and the home to oktoberfest , gemütlichkeit is written big - almost as big as the one-liter mugs that are passed around full of beer .
the jovial good spirit that exudes from the packed beer tents and the experience of locking arms and swaying along with hundreds of other strangers is what keeps drawing back visitors .
this year there were over six million .
for wolf wilberg , who comes to the " wiesn , " as the locals call it , every year , there 's just one way to sum up the oktoberfest experience : home .
the retired teacher hails originally from berlin , but has been a " bavarian at heart " for years .
" this is about being among people which share our attitudes towards life .
which means , we are proud of our traditions and we welcome guests from all over the world , " he says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional brass bands are an integral part of the oktoberfest tradition " when you come here , people will say , hocke die heir , which means come here and have a seat .
and it is less than a minute before you are in an intimate talk and you know your neighbor and you share or do not share his opinions .
if you are completely different you at least share the same beer and the same pretzel and that 's that , " wilberg says of the down-home nature of oktoberfest .
jan schöbel , a munich native , has just returned from studying abroad in portland , oregon .
he says he 's glad to be back in town for the big event : " i like the beer .
when i was a little bit younger , i liked the rides . "
but the main reason he likes oktoberfest is " to sit together in a beer tent or in the beer garden if the weather is nice , have fun with friends and meet foreign people . "
when you 've had too much to drink of course the focus is really on the beer .
that 's what the festival is all about .
and as to be expected , people tend to drink to excess .
the brochures and tourist information do n't mention that , but it 's a given .
sometimes the situation gets a bit out of hand or worse .
minor struggles and fist fights with heavy glass beer mugs breaking are not that uncommon , but usually they are quickly suppressed .
police and medical officials are always on hand to make sure things do n't get out of control .
last year the city adopted a two-pronged approach to respond to reports of sexual assault .
it set up a centrally located security point , staffed by women and open everyday from 6:00 at night to 1:00 in the morning .
it also launched a campaign called " a safe oktoberfest for girls and women " to discourage sexual harassment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : view of munich 's oktoberfest with the st. paul 's cathedral in the background do the darker sides of the festival deter visitors or dampen their mood ?
not really , says wolf wilberg .
" i 'm glad that the police have this under control .
there are always people who do not know where the limits are .
but it is more the fun and spirit of friendship and companionship , and people feel that the atmosphere is more important than heavy drinking .

18 to oct .
3 , munich revolves around beer the world 's largest folk festival ended this weekend in germany .
the annual oktoberfest in munich attracted over six million people and was , as usual , a great party full of dancing , rides , and of course beer . it 's hard to describe oktoberfest to those who have never been there .
part party , festival and carnival with singalongs , costumes , rides and games , the ultimate beer bash is something you just have to experience , says dw-radio 's allison frost , who spoke with several visitors during oktoberfest 's last weekend .
a toast to gemütlichkeit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors lift their maß , one-liter mugs of beer , during the oktoberfest after spending less than an hour in one of the festival 's enormous beer tents , it 's hard to get the refrain of one of the beer drinker 's favorite songs out of your head .
" a toast , a toast to gemütlichkeit . "
it 's an homage to that uniquely german word for the feeling of sociability , hospitality and that relaxed sense of belonging that defies translation .
in munich , bavaria 's capital and the home to oktoberfest , gemütlichkeit is written big - almost as big as the one-liter mugs that are passed around full of beer .
the jovial good spirit that exudes from the packed beer tents and the experience of locking arms and swaying along with hundreds of other strangers is what keeps drawing back visitors .
this year there were over six million .
for wolf wilberg , who comes to the " wiesn , " as the locals call it , every year , there 's just one way to sum up the oktoberfest experience : home .
the retired teacher hails originally from berlin , but has been a " bavarian at heart " for years .
" this is about being among people which share our attitudes towards life .
which means , we are proud of our traditions and we welcome guests from all over the world , " he says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional brass bands are an integral part of the oktoberfest tradition " when you come here , people will say , hocke die heir , which means come here and have a seat .
and it is less than a minute before you are in an intimate talk and you know your neighbor and you share or do not share his opinions .
if you are completely different you at least share the same beer and the same pretzel and that 's that , " wilberg says of the down-home nature of oktoberfest .
jan schöbel , a munich native , has just returned from studying abroad in portland , oregon .
he says he 's glad to be back in town for the big event : " i like the beer .
when i was a little bit younger , i liked the rides . "
but the main reason he likes oktoberfest is " to sit together in a beer tent or in the beer garden if the weather is nice , have fun with friends and meet foreign people . "
when you 've had too much to drink of course the focus is really on the beer .
that 's what the festival is all about .
and as to be expected , people tend to drink to excess .
the brochures and tourist information do n't mention that , but it 's a given .
sometimes the situation gets a bit out of hand or worse .
minor struggles and fist fights with heavy glass beer mugs breaking are not that uncommon , but usually they are quickly suppressed .
police and medical officials are always on hand to make sure things do n't get out of control .
last year the city adopted a two-pronged approach to respond to reports of sexual assault .
it set up a centrally located security point , staffed by women and open everyday from 6:00 at night to 1:00 in the morning .
it also launched a campaign called " a safe oktoberfest for girls and women " to discourage sexual harassment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : view of munich 's oktoberfest with the st. paul 's cathedral in the background do the darker sides of the festival deter visitors or dampen their mood ?
not really , says wolf wilberg .
" i 'm glad that the police have this under control .
there are always people who do not know where the limits are .
but it is more the fun and spirit of friendship and companionship , and people feel that the atmosphere is more important than heavy drinking .

who deserves to be a saint ?
the question is a source of great debate among catholics .
on sunday , charles i of austria will be beatified at the vatican , while an angry dispute erupts over his historic role at home . for centuries , the announcement of the beatification of a new saint had been big news in the catholic church .
at the start of the 21st century one could argue that the importance of such a ceremony has faded somewhat , at least in the media .
but in austria , the naming of emperor charles i , who ruled for just short of two years at the end of world war i , has caused quite a stir , as the country 's leading news magazine referred to the last ruler of the austro-hungarian empire as " the patron saint of losers . "
herbert lackner , chief editor of the viennese magazine profil criticized the beatification of charles i as tantamount to anointing a proponent of war .
although the emperor himself " was not as much of a war hawk as his generals , he was too weak to actually make the decisive turn to peace , " he wrote ahead of sunday 's ceremony .
lackner also said charles was responsible for the use of mustard gas during the end of the war , which resulted in the deaths of hundreds of soldiers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emperor charles i " he was the supreme commander .
if he had ordered them not to use it , they would n't have done so , " lackner said .
powerful name recognition the journalist maintained charles got beatification because the vatican succumbed to decades of lobbying by the habsburg family that formerly ruled austria.british historian and lawyer james bogel , however , claimed the media is acting like the paparazzi by leveling untruths at the habsburg family because of a deep-seated paranoia about the country 's monarchic past .
" if you 've got people with that degree of paranoia , it 's not surprising that they write articles like this , " said the lawyer , who speaks on behalf of the family .
walburga , the countess douglas and granddaughter of charles , was of the same opinion .
speaking to dw-radio from rome , the royal heiress said pope john paul ii was responsible for the decision and has been more creative than his predecessors in picking the new saints of the catholic church .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope john paul ii " our pope tries to find people who can be symbols for a group of persons , and he was trying to find somebody who can become the symbol for the politicians .
he might be the saint for the politicians , " she explained .
as to accusations that charles was a poor statesman and morally reproachable for allowing generals to use deadly mustard gas , the countess recalled that politicians during the time of her grandfather were in a much different position than today , and many were much harsher when it came to war .
" you will always find people who are going to say , how can you beatify a person who was leading a war , " she said , while adding that charles i was fulfilling the will of god .
one miracle is enough in his official biography - published by the vatican - historians argue that charles i strove tirelessly for peace until abdication in 1918 .
as a dedicated catholic , he was also the only european leader who backed the peace efforts of pope benedict the fifteenth .
according to james bogel , there is also no actual record that the emperor actually authorized mustard gas .
during the war " he certainly refused to attack civilian shipping .
he refused to shell italian civilians .
and he refused to send lenin in a sealed train back to russia , " all reasons bogel has cited for showing that charles i was not as bad as the media makes him out to be .
for the vatican , though , the proof of charles ' saintliness lies elsewhere .
the catholic church said the deceased emperor miraculously healed the varicose veins of a brazilian nun when she prayed to him in 1960 , and one miracle is all it takes for beatification . eric campano -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de historians question the beatification of blessed charles the last emperor of the habsburg dynasty , charles the first of austria , is to be beatified by the pope .

this week , the european commission will publish a report expected to give turkey the go ahead to start accession talks .
in an interview with deutsche welle , the turkish premier was convinced this would take place . on oct .
6 , the executive branch of the eu will present a long-awaited progress report on ankara 's chances of joining the 25-member bloc .
the findings of the study will form the basis of a decision by eu leaders at a december summit on whether or not to begin membership negotiations with turkey .
the commission is widely expected to give the thumbs up .
however , an impact study to be approved alongside the main recommendations suggests that the predominantly muslim country on the fringe of europe will not be able to count itself a full-fledged member of the eu until well into the next decade .
eu enlargement commissioner günter verheugen has predicted a long and bumpy road full of specific prerequisites both for ankara and the larger bloc .
verheugen , who only two weeks ago announced there were " no more problems on the table " and no further obstacles to beginning accession talks , has now indicated that certain requirements need to be fulfilled before the eu can welcome turkey into its fold .
first among them , according to inside sources , is a restricted access to the european labor market .
in contrast to the current new members who enjoy free circulation of labor after a certain period of time , verheugen favors long-term restrictions for turks seeking jobs in existing member states .
the enlargement commissioner would also like to stipulate changes in the eu agricultural subsidies system , which if left in place would result in annual costs of between 16 and 28 billion euros -lrb- $ 19 to $ 34 billion -rrb- once turkey joins , and stricter controls of political reforms .
no new requirements in an interview with deutsche welle and a small circle of german journalists , turkish minister president recep tayyip erdogan adamantly rejected any further stipulations to beginning membership talks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan refers to the enlargement commissioner as " my good friend , " after günter verheugen announced there were no more problems ahead of beginning negotiations .
" i have never heard anything like that from mr. verheugen , not in any way .
in the catalog of criteria for the european union there is no such thing as requirements for beginning negotiations .
he could perhaps write something about our little faults .
that would be normal and would be cleared up during the negotiation period , " erdogan said .
as to the significant sum in subsidies the eu would have to shoulder in the decade following turkey 's accession , the premier said it was too early to make any such assumptions : " in my opinion it 's too early to begin talking about such things .
in helsinki in 1999 , the eu decided that turkey was a candidate for membership .
all these things were prepared with the full awareness of the eu .
in the coming years , the situation will change dramatically .
one should not only talk about what the eu will have to pay .
one should also say what the eu will gain through turkey 's membership . "
no question of membership in its impact study , the eu commission addresses the economic benefits turkey would bring to the rest of europe and concluded that ankara 's relatively weak economy would not result in a significant boon for the bloc .
despite opposition to turkey 's membership , erdogan is convinced that in december the 25 heads of state and government will recommend starting accession talks .
a further postponement or a rejection is out of the question , the prime minister said .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan refers to the enlargement commissioner as " my good friend , " after günter verheugen announced there were no more problems ahead of beginning negotiations .
" i have never heard anything like that from mr. verheugen , not in any way .
in the catalog of criteria for the european union there is no such thing as requirements for beginning negotiations .
he could perhaps write something about our little faults .
that would be normal and would be cleared up during the negotiation period , " erdogan said .
as to the significant sum in subsidies the eu would have to shoulder in the decade following turkey 's accession , the premier said it was too early to make any such assumptions : " in my opinion it 's too early to begin talking about such things .
in helsinki in 1999 , the eu decided that turkey was a candidate for membership .
all these things were prepared with the full awareness of the eu .
in the coming years , the situation will change dramatically .
one should not only talk about what the eu will have to pay .
one should also say what the eu will gain through turkey 's membership . "
no question of membership in its impact study , the eu commission addresses the economic benefits turkey would bring to the rest of europe and concluded that ankara 's relatively weak economy would not result in a significant boon for the bloc .
despite opposition to turkey 's membership , erdogan is convinced that in december the 25 heads of state and government will recommend starting accession talks .
a further postponement or a rejection is out of the question , the prime minister said .

26 , 2002 in copenhagen after the eu came up with a set of criteria for ankara " that would be a hard punch for me and my people , because we have done our homework .
it is now up to the eu to hold up their end .
we have done everything as it stands in the criteria .
commissioner verheugen said , there are no more problems on the table .
the world was our witness .
i do not believe that it will happen , but should we receive a negative answer than we will just rename the copenhagen criteria -lrb- the list of requirements for membership -rrb- the ankara criteria and go our own way .

but the pictures of fireworks over berlin and the streets filled with embracing germans are in danger of seeping into a rose tint in the face of the increasingly harsh reality of a united germany .
escalating costs , shaky economic side-effects , discrepencies in living standards and employment opportunities have been the flip side of the euphoria created by the healing of a nation divided for 41 years .

" the world economy is strengthening , but the recovery has been uneven , " british chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown said after a meeting of the imf 's policymaking international monetary and financial committee , of which he is chairman .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown " and with oil prices doubling and imbalances worsening , we agreed that action must be taken to address risks to the recovery , " he said .
world bank president james wolfensohn cited " persistent global imbalances , which require , in particular , readjustment of monetary and fiscal policies in the us , and structural reforms to boost growth in japan , europe and elsewhere . "
he noted that heavily indebted and oil-importing developing countries " are vulnerable to the combination or rising oil prices and interest rates .
mitigating and managing these risks remain important challenges for us all . "
britain sets the example for debt relief following on the heels of the g7 meeting , the imf steering committee also addressed the need to improve debt relief for the world 's poorest nations .
as in the meeting two days earlier between financial leaders from the world 's wealthiest nations , the imf was full of pledges and affirmations , but failed to endorse specific measures which would write-off the debts owed to the world bank by poor countries .
instead gordon brown described the commitment expressed by the g7 as " very significant progress , " and pointed out that the group was preparing a progress report addressing the sustainability of debt relief for the neediest countries .
" there is a growing consensus that multilateral debt relief has to be dealt with as soon as possible , " he said .
" the uk will lead the way in relieving those countries still under the burden of this debt by paying our share - 10 percent - of their payments to the world bank and the african development bank , " brown announced , adding : " and we urge other governments to follow us in this . "
bildunterschrift : a child stands outside squatter shacks watching the rising waters in the alexandra township north of johannesburg , south africa increasing development aid meanwhile the imf and world bank appealed to industrialized countries to uphold their pledge of spending 0.7 percent of their gross domestic product to support developing countries , particularly those in sub-saharan africa .
agreed to in 1969 during a un conference , only a handful of countries have met the target , including norway and sweden .
the united states , one of the world 's strongest economies , currently spends less than 0.2 percent of its gdp on development aid .
france put 0.4 percent of its gdp towards aid programs in africa , and in germany , the goal is to reach 0.33 percent by 2006 .
no agreement on iraq on the issue of iraq , the support for debt relief was even less resounding .
whereas the us has lobbied for forgiving 90 percent of the arab nation 's $ 120 billion -lrb- € 97 billion -rrb- in foreign debt , other nations are more critical .
germany and france reject such a high percentage , saying 50 percent is more appropriate .
citing its extensive oil reserves , france has argued that iraq should not be treated any better than considerably poorer nations .
on friday , members of the g7 had concluded their meeting with the goal of agreeing to the framework for a debt reduction plan for iraq by the end of the year . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g7 says high oil price threatens economy with a view to rising costs , the group of seven finance chiefs called on oil producers to help keep energy prices manageable .

who deserves to be a saint ?
the question is a source of great debate among catholics .
on sunday , charles i of austria will be beatified at the vatican , while an angry dispute erupts over his historic role at home . for centuries , the announcement of the beatification of a new saint had been big news in the catholic church .
at the start of the 21st century one could argue that the importance of such a ceremony has faded somewhat , at least in the media .
but in austria , the naming of emperor charles i , who ruled for just short of two years at the end of world war i , has caused quite a stir , as the country 's leading news magazine referred to the last ruler of the austro-hungarian empire as " the patron saint of losers . "
herbert lackner , chief editor of the viennese magazine profil criticized the beatification of charles i as tantamount to anointing a proponent of war .
although the emperor himself " was not as much of a war hawk as his generals , he was too weak to actually make the decisive turn to peace , " he wrote ahead of sunday 's ceremony .
lackner also said charles was responsible for the use of mustard gas during the end of the war , which resulted in the deaths of hundreds of soldiers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emperor charles i " he was the supreme commander .
if he had ordered them not to use it , they would n't have done so , " lackner said .
powerful name recognition the journalist maintained charles got beatification because the vatican succumbed to decades of lobbying by the habsburg family that formerly ruled austria.british historian and lawyer james bogel , however , claimed the media is acting like the paparazzi by leveling untruths at the habsburg family because of a deep-seated paranoia about the country 's monarchic past .
" if you 've got people with that degree of paranoia , it 's not surprising that they write articles like this , " said the lawyer , who speaks on behalf of the family .
walburga , the countess douglas and granddaughter of charles , was of the same opinion .
speaking to dw-radio from rome , the royal heiress said pope john paul ii was responsible for the decision and has been more creative than his predecessors in picking the new saints of the catholic church .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope john paul ii " our pope tries to find people who can be symbols for a group of persons , and he was trying to find somebody who can become the symbol for the politicians .
he might be the saint for the politicians , " she explained .
as to accusations that charles was a poor statesman and morally reproachable for allowing generals to use deadly mustard gas , the countess recalled that politicians during the time of her grandfather were in a much different position than today , and many were much harsher when it came to war .
" you will always find people who are going to say , how can you beatify a person who was leading a war , " she said , while adding that charles i was fulfilling the will of god .
one miracle is enough in his official biography - published by the vatican - historians argue that charles i strove tirelessly for peace until abdication in 1918 .
as a dedicated catholic , he was also the only european leader who backed the peace efforts of pope benedict the fifteenth .
according to james bogel , there is also no actual record that the emperor actually authorized mustard gas .
during the war " he certainly refused to attack civilian shipping .
he refused to shell italian civilians .
and he refused to send lenin in a sealed train back to russia , " all reasons bogel has cited for showing that charles i was not as bad as the media makes him out to be .
for the vatican , though , the proof of charles ' saintliness lies elsewhere .
the catholic church said the deceased emperor miraculously healed the varicose veins of a brazilian nun when she prayed to him in 1960 , and one miracle is all it takes for beatification . eric campano -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de historians question the beatification of blessed charles the last emperor of the habsburg dynasty , charles the first of austria , is to be beatified by the pope .

who deserves to be a saint ?
the question is a source of great debate among catholics .
on sunday , charles i of austria will be beatified at the vatican , while an angry dispute erupts over his historic role at home . for centuries , the announcement of the beatification of a new saint had been big news in the catholic church .
at the start of the 21st century one could argue that the importance of such a ceremony has faded somewhat , at least in the media .
but in austria , the naming of emperor charles i , who ruled for just short of two years at the end of world war i , has caused quite a stir , as the country 's leading news magazine referred to the last ruler of the austro-hungarian empire as " the patron saint of losers . "
herbert lackner , chief editor of the viennese magazine profil criticized the beatification of charles i as tantamount to anointing a proponent of war .
although the emperor himself " was not as much of a war hawk as his generals , he was too weak to actually make the decisive turn to peace , " he wrote ahead of sunday 's ceremony .
lackner also said charles was responsible for the use of mustard gas during the end of the war , which resulted in the deaths of hundreds of soldiers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emperor charles i " he was the supreme commander .
if he had ordered them not to use it , they would n't have done so , " lackner said .
powerful name recognition the journalist maintained charles got beatification because the vatican succumbed to decades of lobbying by the habsburg family that formerly ruled austria.british historian and lawyer james bogel , however , claimed the media is acting like the paparazzi by leveling untruths at the habsburg family because of a deep-seated paranoia about the country 's monarchic past .
" if you 've got people with that degree of paranoia , it 's not surprising that they write articles like this , " said the lawyer , who speaks on behalf of the family .
walburga , the countess douglas and granddaughter of charles , was of the same opinion .
speaking to dw-radio from rome , the royal heiress said pope john paul ii was responsible for the decision and has been more creative than his predecessors in picking the new saints of the catholic church .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope john paul ii " our pope tries to find people who can be symbols for a group of persons , and he was trying to find somebody who can become the symbol for the politicians .
he might be the saint for the politicians , " she explained .
as to accusations that charles was a poor statesman and morally reproachable for allowing generals to use deadly mustard gas , the countess recalled that politicians during the time of her grandfather were in a much different position than today , and many were much harsher when it came to war .
" you will always find people who are going to say , how can you beatify a person who was leading a war , " she said , while adding that charles i was fulfilling the will of god .
one miracle is enough in his official biography - published by the vatican - historians argue that charles i strove tirelessly for peace until abdication in 1918 .
as a dedicated catholic , he was also the only european leader who backed the peace efforts of pope benedict the fifteenth .
according to james bogel , there is also no actual record that the emperor actually authorized mustard gas .
during the war " he certainly refused to attack civilian shipping .
he refused to shell italian civilians .
and he refused to send lenin in a sealed train back to russia , " all reasons bogel has cited for showing that charles i was not as bad as the media makes him out to be .
for the vatican , though , the proof of charles ' saintliness lies elsewhere .
the catholic church said the deceased emperor miraculously healed the varicose veins of a brazilian nun when she prayed to him in 1960 , and one miracle is all it takes for beatification . eric campano -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de historians question the beatification of blessed charles the last emperor of the habsburg dynasty , charles the first of austria , is to be beatified by the pope .
news that the deceased monarch will become blessed charles has prompted many to question the pontiff ’ s choice .

even those who 've lived here all their lives have difficulty remembering exactly where it used to be .
but if every fifth person in germany had their way , the barrier that split the country during the cold war would be resurrected .
a recent poll conducted by the forsa research institute found that a quarter of west germans wished the berlin wall could be rebuilt , while 12 percent of east germans said they did n't want to live in a united germany .
it 's not exactly a glowing testimony about the progress made in the 14 years since the wende , the term used here to describe german reunification . stereotypes persist stereotypes about east and west are stubborn .

" and there were new things , there was a whole new system .
i think i 'm more free , more independent today because of those changes . " but barwitzki could n't be more different from fellow easterner lutz r. , a berliner who was in his early 30s when the wall fell .
as incredible as it sounds to western ears , lutz says he felt more free under the east german regime than he does now . " freedom is relative .

18 to oct .
3 , munich revolves around beer the world 's largest folk festival ended this weekend in germany .
the annual oktoberfest in munich attracted over six million people and was , as usual , a great party full of dancing , rides , and of course beer . it 's hard to describe oktoberfest to those who have never been there .
part party , festival and carnival with singalongs , costumes , rides and games , the ultimate beer bash is something you just have to experience , says dw-radio 's allison frost , who spoke with several visitors during oktoberfest 's last weekend .
a toast to gemütlichkeit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors lift their maß , one-liter mugs of beer , during the oktoberfest after spending less than an hour in one of the festival 's enormous beer tents , it 's hard to get the refrain of one of the beer drinker 's favorite songs out of your head .
" a toast , a toast to gemütlichkeit . "
it 's an homage to that uniquely german word for the feeling of sociability , hospitality and that relaxed sense of belonging that defies translation .
in munich , bavaria 's capital and the home to oktoberfest , gemütlichkeit is written big - almost as big as the one-liter mugs that are passed around full of beer .
the jovial good spirit that exudes from the packed beer tents and the experience of locking arms and swaying along with hundreds of other strangers is what keeps drawing back visitors .
this year there were over six million .
for wolf wilberg , who comes to the " wiesn , " as the locals call it , every year , there 's just one way to sum up the oktoberfest experience : home .
the retired teacher hails originally from berlin , but has been a " bavarian at heart " for years .
" this is about being among people which share our attitudes towards life .
which means , we are proud of our traditions and we welcome guests from all over the world , " he says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional brass bands are an integral part of the oktoberfest tradition " when you come here , people will say , hocke die heir , which means come here and have a seat .
and it is less than a minute before you are in an intimate talk and you know your neighbor and you share or do not share his opinions .
if you are completely different you at least share the same beer and the same pretzel and that 's that , " wilberg says of the down-home nature of oktoberfest .
jan schöbel , a munich native , has just returned from studying abroad in portland , oregon .
he says he 's glad to be back in town for the big event : " i like the beer .
when i was a little bit younger , i liked the rides . "
but the main reason he likes oktoberfest is " to sit together in a beer tent or in the beer garden if the weather is nice , have fun with friends and meet foreign people . "
when you 've had too much to drink of course the focus is really on the beer .
that 's what the festival is all about .
and as to be expected , people tend to drink to excess .
the brochures and tourist information do n't mention that , but it 's a given .
sometimes the situation gets a bit out of hand or worse .
minor struggles and fist fights with heavy glass beer mugs breaking are not that uncommon , but usually they are quickly suppressed .
police and medical officials are always on hand to make sure things do n't get out of control .
last year the city adopted a two-pronged approach to respond to reports of sexual assault .
it set up a centrally located security point , staffed by women and open everyday from 6:00 at night to 1:00 in the morning .
it also launched a campaign called " a safe oktoberfest for girls and women " to discourage sexual harassment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : view of munich 's oktoberfest with the st. paul 's cathedral in the background do the darker sides of the festival deter visitors or dampen their mood ?
not really , says wolf wilberg .
" i 'm glad that the police have this under control .
there are always people who do not know where the limits are .
but it is more the fun and spirit of friendship and companionship , and people feel that the atmosphere is more important than heavy drinking .

3 , munich revolves around beer the world 's largest folk festival ended this weekend in germany .
the annual oktoberfest in munich attracted over six million people and was , as usual , a great party full of dancing , rides , and of course beer . it 's hard to describe oktoberfest to those who have never been there .
part party , festival and carnival with singalongs , costumes , rides and games , the ultimate beer bash is something you just have to experience , says dw-radio 's allison frost , who spoke with several visitors during oktoberfest 's last weekend .
a toast to gemütlichkeit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors lift their maß , one-liter mugs of beer , during the oktoberfest after spending less than an hour in one of the festival 's enormous beer tents , it 's hard to get the refrain of one of the beer drinker 's favorite songs out of your head .
" a toast , a toast to gemütlichkeit . "
it 's an homage to that uniquely german word for the feeling of sociability , hospitality and that relaxed sense of belonging that defies translation .
in munich , bavaria 's capital and the home to oktoberfest , gemütlichkeit is written big - almost as big as the one-liter mugs that are passed around full of beer .
the jovial good spirit that exudes from the packed beer tents and the experience of locking arms and swaying along with hundreds of other strangers is what keeps drawing back visitors .
this year there were over six million .
for wolf wilberg , who comes to the " wiesn , " as the locals call it , every year , there 's just one way to sum up the oktoberfest experience : home .
the retired teacher hails originally from berlin , but has been a " bavarian at heart " for years .
" this is about being among people which share our attitudes towards life .
which means , we are proud of our traditions and we welcome guests from all over the world , " he says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional brass bands are an integral part of the oktoberfest tradition " when you come here , people will say , hocke die heir , which means come here and have a seat .
and it is less than a minute before you are in an intimate talk and you know your neighbor and you share or do not share his opinions .
if you are completely different you at least share the same beer and the same pretzel and that 's that , " wilberg says of the down-home nature of oktoberfest .
jan schöbel , a munich native , has just returned from studying abroad in portland , oregon .
he says he 's glad to be back in town for the big event : " i like the beer .
when i was a little bit younger , i liked the rides . "
but the main reason he likes oktoberfest is " to sit together in a beer tent or in the beer garden if the weather is nice , have fun with friends and meet foreign people . "
when you 've had too much to drink of course the focus is really on the beer .
that 's what the festival is all about .
and as to be expected , people tend to drink to excess .
the brochures and tourist information do n't mention that , but it 's a given .
sometimes the situation gets a bit out of hand or worse .
minor struggles and fist fights with heavy glass beer mugs breaking are not that uncommon , but usually they are quickly suppressed .
police and medical officials are always on hand to make sure things do n't get out of control .
last year the city adopted a two-pronged approach to respond to reports of sexual assault .
it set up a centrally located security point , staffed by women and open everyday from 6:00 at night to 1:00 in the morning .
it also launched a campaign called " a safe oktoberfest for girls and women " to discourage sexual harassment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : view of munich 's oktoberfest with the st. paul 's cathedral in the background do the darker sides of the festival deter visitors or dampen their mood ?
not really , says wolf wilberg .
" i 'm glad that the police have this under control .
there are always people who do not know where the limits are .
but it is more the fun and spirit of friendship and companionship , and people feel that the atmosphere is more important than heavy drinking .

jan schöbel , a munich native , has just returned from studying abroad in portland , oregon .
he says he 's glad to be back in town for the big event : " i like the beer .
when i was a little bit younger , i liked the rides . "
but the main reason he likes oktoberfest is " to sit together in a beer tent or in the beer garden if the weather is nice , have fun with friends and meet foreign people . "
when you 've had too much to drink of course the focus is really on the beer .
that 's what the festival is all about .
and as to be expected , people tend to drink to excess .
the brochures and tourist information do n't mention that , but it 's a given .
sometimes the situation gets a bit out of hand or worse .
minor struggles and fist fights with heavy glass beer mugs breaking are not that uncommon , but usually they are quickly suppressed .
police and medical officials are always on hand to make sure things do n't get out of control .
last year the city adopted a two-pronged approach to respond to reports of sexual assault .
it set up a centrally located security point , staffed by women and open everyday from 6:00 at night to 1:00 in the morning .
it also launched a campaign called " a safe oktoberfest for girls and women " to discourage sexual harassment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : view of munich 's oktoberfest with the st. paul 's cathedral in the background do the darker sides of the festival deter visitors or dampen their mood ?
not really , says wolf wilberg .
" i 'm glad that the police have this under control .
there are always people who do not know where the limits are .
but it is more the fun and spirit of friendship and companionship , and people feel that the atmosphere is more important than heavy drinking .

this week , the european commission will publish a report expected to give turkey the go ahead to start accession talks .
in an interview with deutsche welle , the turkish premier was convinced this would take place . on oct .
6 , the executive branch of the eu will present a long-awaited progress report on ankara 's chances of joining the 25-member bloc .
the findings of the study will form the basis of a decision by eu leaders at a december summit on whether or not to begin membership negotiations with turkey .
the commission is widely expected to give the thumbs up .
however , an impact study to be approved alongside the main recommendations suggests that the predominantly muslim country on the fringe of europe will not be able to count itself a full-fledged member of the eu until well into the next decade .
eu enlargement commissioner günter verheugen has predicted a long and bumpy road full of specific prerequisites both for ankara and the larger bloc .
verheugen , who only two weeks ago announced there were " no more problems on the table " and no further obstacles to beginning accession talks , has now indicated that certain requirements need to be fulfilled before the eu can welcome turkey into its fold .
first among them , according to inside sources , is a restricted access to the european labor market .
in contrast to the current new members who enjoy free circulation of labor after a certain period of time , verheugen favors long-term restrictions for turks seeking jobs in existing member states .
the enlargement commissioner would also like to stipulate changes in the eu agricultural subsidies system , which if left in place would result in annual costs of between 16 and 28 billion euros -lrb- $ 19 to $ 34 billion -rrb- once turkey joins , and stricter controls of political reforms .
no new requirements in an interview with deutsche welle and a small circle of german journalists , turkish minister president recep tayyip erdogan adamantly rejected any further stipulations to beginning membership talks .

" i have never heard anything like that from mr. verheugen , not in any way .
in the catalog of criteria for the european union there is no such thing as requirements for beginning negotiations .
he could perhaps write something about our little faults .
that would be normal and would be cleared up during the negotiation period , " erdogan said .
as to the significant sum in subsidies the eu would have to shoulder in the decade following turkey 's accession , the premier said it was too early to make any such assumptions : " in my opinion it 's too early to begin talking about such things .
in helsinki in 1999 , the eu decided that turkey was a candidate for membership .
all these things were prepared with the full awareness of the eu .
in the coming years , the situation will change dramatically .
one should not only talk about what the eu will have to pay .
one should also say what the eu will gain through turkey 's membership . "
no question of membership in its impact study , the eu commission addresses the economic benefits turkey would bring to the rest of europe and concluded that ankara 's relatively weak economy would not result in a significant boon for the bloc .
despite opposition to turkey 's membership , erdogan is convinced that in december the 25 heads of state and government will recommend starting accession talks .
a further postponement or a rejection is out of the question , the prime minister said .

the joyous scenes of reunification which inspired the world when the berlin wall fell on nov .
9 , 1989 , have remained images of hope , beacons of reconcilliation and the evidence that incredible social change could be achieved against amazing odds .
but the pictures of fireworks over berlin and the streets filled with embracing germans are in danger of seeping into a rose tint in the face of the increasingly harsh reality of a united germany .
escalating costs , shaky economic side-effects , discrepencies in living standards and employment opportunities have been the flip side of the euphoria created by the healing of a nation divided for 41 years .
however , germany continues to work at the problems arising from the recovery process .
here , dw-world presents a series of articles documenting the ups and downs experienced in the past 12 months since the last celebration . dw-world.de opinion : a progress report on german unity it 's been over 13 years since the fall of the berlin wall , but germans still have a lot to learn about each other before the mental east-west border disappears .

now , many want it back on oct.3 , germany marks 14 years since reunification .
although the physical barrier between east and west is a thing of the past , many germans still speak about the " mauer im kopf " - the wall in the head . in berlin today , there 's very little left of the berlin wall .
even those who 've lived here all their lives have difficulty remembering exactly where it used to be .
but if every fifth person in germany had their way , the barrier that split the country during the cold war would be resurrected .
a recent poll conducted by the forsa research institute found that a quarter of west germans wished the berlin wall could be rebuilt , while 12 percent of east germans said they did n't want to live in a united germany .
it 's not exactly a glowing testimony about the progress made in the 14 years since the wende , the term used here to describe german reunification . stereotypes persist stereotypes about east and west are stubborn .
east germans think of westerners as " besser-wessies , " or arrogant know-it-alls .
west germans , in turn , roll their eyes about the " jammer ossies , " or whining easterners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the glittering skyline of frankfurt 's banking district symbolizes west german wealth " east germans have a false perception of affluence in the west .
they overestimate the level of prosperity , and take the upper income level as the average , so many of their demands are unrealistic , " says klaus schröder , an expert on the former east germany at berlin 's free university .
" west germans are envious when they see how much money is being transferred to the east .
many people feel that the true cost of reunification is being hidden from them . " negative western stereotypes about easterners have even been passed down to the younger generation , to those who were teenagers when the wall fell .
there 's been an exodus of young easterners to western cities in the 14 years following reunification , but those who 've remained in the east are often pegged as lazy , unmotivated , and bitter about their future prospects . those assumptions are wrong , say sociologists at a leading public opinion research institute in the southern german city of allensbach .
they quizzed 2,000 germans on their attitudes on typically western values .
while they concluded that , in the east , values such as equality and social justice ranked higher than individual freedom , the researchers admit they were surprised by the responses of young easterners . advantage of youth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drivers in the old east german trabant cars celebrating reunification " the younger generation of easterners are n't just falling back into a basic attitude of depression , they 're taking initiative , " thomas petersen , project leader at the allensbach institute told dw-world .
" their optimism and strength is tangible , and those are the qualities that a region needs to pull itself out of the doldrums . " that description could apply to leipzig resident rita barwitzki , 26 , who was a pre-teen when the wall fell .
she says living through the experience has made her stronger . " i gave up a piece of my identity , and because of that , there was this impulse to experience new things , and not to stay stuck in the past , " she recalls .
" and there were new things , there was a whole new system .
i think i 'm more free , more independent today because of those changes . " but barwitzki could n't be more different from fellow easterner lutz r. , a berliner who was in his early 30s when the wall fell .
as incredible as it sounds to western ears , lutz says he felt more free under the east german regime than he does now . " freedom is relative .
in my job now , if i were to complain to my boss about how things are working , i would have to worry about getting fired .
for me , that means i 'm not free , " lutz told dw-world .
" in east germany , i could say what i thought .
not about the government , of course , but then i did n't have anything against the government .
but at work , if i complained to my boss , he 'd listen , and i did n't have to fear the consequences . " lutz remembers east germany as a great country for young people - a place where he had a steady job , enough food , and a nice apartment located just a few meters from the berlin wall .
it 's presence never bothered him .
on the contrary , it reassured him . " the wall was an anti-fascist protective measure , it was there to protect us from the west , " he says . money not enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german chancellor helmut kohl oversaw the reunification process for east germany expert klaus schröder , the persistence of such attitudes stems from key decisions made in 1990 when the two germanys became one . " from the very beginning of reunification , we only thought about the money , " schröder explains .
" but that was only half the story .
we should have also paid attention to the fact that this reunited nation would need to start sharing common values .
back then , everybody thought that those problems would go away if you threw money at them .
that 's proved not to be true . " while few expected reunification to happen overnight , those who experienced the euphoria in 1989 when the wall fell would probably not have guessed that , in 2004 , the gap between east and west would still be so wide .
it seems that germany 's best hope of breaking down the " wall in the head " lies in its young people , for whom the cold war is an indistinct , childhood memory . deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de breaching the east-west economic divide when the german cabinet presented its annual report on the state of german unity wednesday , it reached the unexpected conclusion that the economic gap between east and west has , in fact , begun to close .

there 's been an exodus of young easterners to western cities in the 14 years following reunification , but those who 've remained in the east are often pegged as lazy , unmotivated , and bitter about their future prospects . those assumptions are wrong , say sociologists at a leading public opinion research institute in the southern german city of allensbach .

" and there were new things , there was a whole new system .
i think i 'm more free , more independent today because of those changes . " but barwitzki could n't be more different from fellow easterner lutz r. , a berliner who was in his early 30s when the wall fell .
as incredible as it sounds to western ears , lutz says he felt more free under the east german regime than he does now . " freedom is relative .

who deserves to be a saint ?
the question is a source of great debate among catholics .
on sunday , charles i of austria will be beatified at the vatican , while an angry dispute erupts over his historic role at home . for centuries , the announcement of the beatification of a new saint had been big news in the catholic church .
at the start of the 21st century one could argue that the importance of such a ceremony has faded somewhat , at least in the media .
but in austria , the naming of emperor charles i , who ruled for just short of two years at the end of world war i , has caused quite a stir , as the country 's leading news magazine referred to the last ruler of the austro-hungarian empire as " the patron saint of losers . "
herbert lackner , chief editor of the viennese magazine profil criticized the beatification of charles i as tantamount to anointing a proponent of war .
although the emperor himself " was not as much of a war hawk as his generals , he was too weak to actually make the decisive turn to peace , " he wrote ahead of sunday 's ceremony .
lackner also said charles was responsible for the use of mustard gas during the end of the war , which resulted in the deaths of hundreds of soldiers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emperor charles i " he was the supreme commander .
if he had ordered them not to use it , they would n't have done so , " lackner said .
powerful name recognition the journalist maintained charles got beatification because the vatican succumbed to decades of lobbying by the habsburg family that formerly ruled austria.british historian and lawyer james bogel , however , claimed the media is acting like the paparazzi by leveling untruths at the habsburg family because of a deep-seated paranoia about the country 's monarchic past .
" if you 've got people with that degree of paranoia , it 's not surprising that they write articles like this , " said the lawyer , who speaks on behalf of the family .
walburga , the countess douglas and granddaughter of charles , was of the same opinion .
speaking to dw-radio from rome , the royal heiress said pope john paul ii was responsible for the decision and has been more creative than his predecessors in picking the new saints of the catholic church .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope john paul ii " our pope tries to find people who can be symbols for a group of persons , and he was trying to find somebody who can become the symbol for the politicians .
he might be the saint for the politicians , " she explained .
as to accusations that charles was a poor statesman and morally reproachable for allowing generals to use deadly mustard gas , the countess recalled that politicians during the time of her grandfather were in a much different position than today , and many were much harsher when it came to war .
" you will always find people who are going to say , how can you beatify a person who was leading a war , " she said , while adding that charles i was fulfilling the will of god .
one miracle is enough in his official biography - published by the vatican - historians argue that charles i strove tirelessly for peace until abdication in 1918 .
as a dedicated catholic , he was also the only european leader who backed the peace efforts of pope benedict the fifteenth .
according to james bogel , there is also no actual record that the emperor actually authorized mustard gas .
during the war " he certainly refused to attack civilian shipping .
he refused to shell italian civilians .
and he refused to send lenin in a sealed train back to russia , " all reasons bogel has cited for showing that charles i was not as bad as the media makes him out to be .
for the vatican , though , the proof of charles ' saintliness lies elsewhere .
the catholic church said the deceased emperor miraculously healed the varicose veins of a brazilian nun when she prayed to him in 1960 , and one miracle is all it takes for beatification . eric campano -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de historians question the beatification of blessed charles the last emperor of the habsburg dynasty , charles the first of austria , is to be beatified by the pope .

who deserves to be a saint ?
the question is a source of great debate among catholics .
on sunday , charles i of austria will be beatified at the vatican , while an angry dispute erupts over his historic role at home . for centuries , the announcement of the beatification of a new saint had been big news in the catholic church .
at the start of the 21st century one could argue that the importance of such a ceremony has faded somewhat , at least in the media .
but in austria , the naming of emperor charles i , who ruled for just short of two years at the end of world war i , has caused quite a stir , as the country 's leading news magazine referred to the last ruler of the austro-hungarian empire as " the patron saint of losers . "
herbert lackner , chief editor of the viennese magazine profil criticized the beatification of charles i as tantamount to anointing a proponent of war .
although the emperor himself " was not as much of a war hawk as his generals , he was too weak to actually make the decisive turn to peace , " he wrote ahead of sunday 's ceremony .
lackner also said charles was responsible for the use of mustard gas during the end of the war , which resulted in the deaths of hundreds of soldiers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emperor charles i " he was the supreme commander .
if he had ordered them not to use it , they would n't have done so , " lackner said .
powerful name recognition the journalist maintained charles got beatification because the vatican succumbed to decades of lobbying by the habsburg family that formerly ruled austria.british historian and lawyer james bogel , however , claimed the media is acting like the paparazzi by leveling untruths at the habsburg family because of a deep-seated paranoia about the country 's monarchic past .
" if you 've got people with that degree of paranoia , it 's not surprising that they write articles like this , " said the lawyer , who speaks on behalf of the family .
walburga , the countess douglas and granddaughter of charles , was of the same opinion .
speaking to dw-radio from rome , the royal heiress said pope john paul ii was responsible for the decision and has been more creative than his predecessors in picking the new saints of the catholic church .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope john paul ii " our pope tries to find people who can be symbols for a group of persons , and he was trying to find somebody who can become the symbol for the politicians .
he might be the saint for the politicians , " she explained .
as to accusations that charles was a poor statesman and morally reproachable for allowing generals to use deadly mustard gas , the countess recalled that politicians during the time of her grandfather were in a much different position than today , and many were much harsher when it came to war .
" you will always find people who are going to say , how can you beatify a person who was leading a war , " she said , while adding that charles i was fulfilling the will of god .
one miracle is enough in his official biography - published by the vatican - historians argue that charles i strove tirelessly for peace until abdication in 1918 .
as a dedicated catholic , he was also the only european leader who backed the peace efforts of pope benedict the fifteenth .
according to james bogel , there is also no actual record that the emperor actually authorized mustard gas .
during the war " he certainly refused to attack civilian shipping .
he refused to shell italian civilians .

" the world economy is strengthening , but the recovery has been uneven , " british chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown said after a meeting of the imf 's policymaking international monetary and financial committee , of which he is chairman .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown " and with oil prices doubling and imbalances worsening , we agreed that action must be taken to address risks to the recovery , " he said .
world bank president james wolfensohn cited " persistent global imbalances , which require , in particular , readjustment of monetary and fiscal policies in the us , and structural reforms to boost growth in japan , europe and elsewhere . "
he noted that heavily indebted and oil-importing developing countries " are vulnerable to the combination or rising oil prices and interest rates .
mitigating and managing these risks remain important challenges for us all . "
britain sets the example for debt relief following on the heels of the g7 meeting , the imf steering committee also addressed the need to improve debt relief for the world 's poorest nations .
as in the meeting two days earlier between financial leaders from the world 's wealthiest nations , the imf was full of pledges and affirmations , but failed to endorse specific measures which would write-off the debts owed to the world bank by poor countries .
instead gordon brown described the commitment expressed by the g7 as " very significant progress , " and pointed out that the group was preparing a progress report addressing the sustainability of debt relief for the neediest countries .
" there is a growing consensus that multilateral debt relief has to be dealt with as soon as possible , " he said .
" the uk will lead the way in relieving those countries still under the burden of this debt by paying our share - 10 percent - of their payments to the world bank and the african development bank , " brown announced , adding : " and we urge other governments to follow us in this . "
bildunterschrift : a child stands outside squatter shacks watching the rising waters in the alexandra township north of johannesburg , south africa increasing development aid meanwhile the imf and world bank appealed to industrialized countries to uphold their pledge of spending 0.7 percent of their gross domestic product to support developing countries , particularly those in sub-saharan africa .
agreed to in 1969 during a un conference , only a handful of countries have met the target , including norway and sweden .
the united states , one of the world 's strongest economies , currently spends less than 0.2 percent of its gdp on development aid .
france put 0.4 percent of its gdp towards aid programs in africa , and in germany , the goal is to reach 0.33 percent by 2006 .
no agreement on iraq on the issue of iraq , the support for debt relief was even less resounding .
whereas the us has lobbied for forgiving 90 percent of the arab nation 's $ 120 billion -lrb- € 97 billion -rrb- in foreign debt , other nations are more critical .
germany and france reject such a high percentage , saying 50 percent is more appropriate .
citing its extensive oil reserves , france has argued that iraq should not be treated any better than considerably poorer nations .
on friday , members of the g7 had concluded their meeting with the goal of agreeing to the framework for a debt reduction plan for iraq by the end of the year . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g7 says high oil price threatens economy with a view to rising costs , the group of seven finance chiefs called on oil producers to help keep energy prices manageable .

3 , munich revolves around beer the world 's largest folk festival ended this weekend in germany .
the annual oktoberfest in munich attracted over six million people and was , as usual , a great party full of dancing , rides , and of course beer . it 's hard to describe oktoberfest to those who have never been there .
part party , festival and carnival with singalongs , costumes , rides and games , the ultimate beer bash is something you just have to experience , says dw-radio 's allison frost , who spoke with several visitors during oktoberfest 's last weekend .
a toast to gemütlichkeit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors lift their maß , one-liter mugs of beer , during the oktoberfest after spending less than an hour in one of the festival 's enormous beer tents , it 's hard to get the refrain of one of the beer drinker 's favorite songs out of your head .
" a toast , a toast to gemütlichkeit . "
it 's an homage to that uniquely german word for the feeling of sociability , hospitality and that relaxed sense of belonging that defies translation .
in munich , bavaria 's capital and the home to oktoberfest , gemütlichkeit is written big - almost as big as the one-liter mugs that are passed around full of beer .
the jovial good spirit that exudes from the packed beer tents and the experience of locking arms and swaying along with hundreds of other strangers is what keeps drawing back visitors .
this year there were over six million .
for wolf wilberg , who comes to the " wiesn , " as the locals call it , every year , there 's just one way to sum up the oktoberfest experience : home .
the retired teacher hails originally from berlin , but has been a " bavarian at heart " for years .
" this is about being among people which share our attitudes towards life .
which means , we are proud of our traditions and we welcome guests from all over the world , " he says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional brass bands are an integral part of the oktoberfest tradition " when you come here , people will say , hocke die heir , which means come here and have a seat .
and it is less than a minute before you are in an intimate talk and you know your neighbor and you share or do not share his opinions .
if you are completely different you at least share the same beer and the same pretzel and that 's that , " wilberg says of the down-home nature of oktoberfest .
jan schöbel , a munich native , has just returned from studying abroad in portland , oregon .
he says he 's glad to be back in town for the big event : " i like the beer .
when i was a little bit younger , i liked the rides . "
but the main reason he likes oktoberfest is " to sit together in a beer tent or in the beer garden if the weather is nice , have fun with friends and meet foreign people . "
when you 've had too much to drink of course the focus is really on the beer .
that 's what the festival is all about .
and as to be expected , people tend to drink to excess .
the brochures and tourist information do n't mention that , but it 's a given .
sometimes the situation gets a bit out of hand or worse .
minor struggles and fist fights with heavy glass beer mugs breaking are not that uncommon , but usually they are quickly suppressed .
police and medical officials are always on hand to make sure things do n't get out of control .
last year the city adopted a two-pronged approach to respond to reports of sexual assault .
it set up a centrally located security point , staffed by women and open everyday from 6:00 at night to 1:00 in the morning .
it also launched a campaign called " a safe oktoberfest for girls and women " to discourage sexual harassment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : view of munich 's oktoberfest with the st. paul 's cathedral in the background do the darker sides of the festival deter visitors or dampen their mood ?
not really , says wolf wilberg .
" i 'm glad that the police have this under control .
there are always people who do not know where the limits are .
but it is more the fun and spirit of friendship and companionship , and people feel that the atmosphere is more important than heavy drinking .

3 , munich revolves around beer the world 's largest folk festival ended this weekend in germany .
the annual oktoberfest in munich attracted over six million people and was , as usual , a great party full of dancing , rides , and of course beer . it 's hard to describe oktoberfest to those who have never been there .
part party , festival and carnival with singalongs , costumes , rides and games , the ultimate beer bash is something you just have to experience , says dw-radio 's allison frost , who spoke with several visitors during oktoberfest 's last weekend .
a toast to gemütlichkeit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors lift their maß , one-liter mugs of beer , during the oktoberfest after spending less than an hour in one of the festival 's enormous beer tents , it 's hard to get the refrain of one of the beer drinker 's favorite songs out of your head .
" a toast , a toast to gemütlichkeit . "
it 's an homage to that uniquely german word for the feeling of sociability , hospitality and that relaxed sense of belonging that defies translation .
in munich , bavaria 's capital and the home to oktoberfest , gemütlichkeit is written big - almost as big as the one-liter mugs that are passed around full of beer .
the jovial good spirit that exudes from the packed beer tents and the experience of locking arms and swaying along with hundreds of other strangers is what keeps drawing back visitors .
this year there were over six million .
for wolf wilberg , who comes to the " wiesn , " as the locals call it , every year , there 's just one way to sum up the oktoberfest experience : home .
the retired teacher hails originally from berlin , but has been a " bavarian at heart " for years .
" this is about being among people which share our attitudes towards life .
which means , we are proud of our traditions and we welcome guests from all over the world , " he says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional brass bands are an integral part of the oktoberfest tradition " when you come here , people will say , hocke die heir , which means come here and have a seat .
and it is less than a minute before you are in an intimate talk and you know your neighbor and you share or do not share his opinions .
if you are completely different you at least share the same beer and the same pretzel and that 's that , " wilberg says of the down-home nature of oktoberfest .
jan schöbel , a munich native , has just returned from studying abroad in portland , oregon .
he says he 's glad to be back in town for the big event : " i like the beer .
when i was a little bit younger , i liked the rides . "
but the main reason he likes oktoberfest is " to sit together in a beer tent or in the beer garden if the weather is nice , have fun with friends and meet foreign people . "
when you 've had too much to drink of course the focus is really on the beer .
that 's what the festival is all about .
and as to be expected , people tend to drink to excess .
the brochures and tourist information do n't mention that , but it 's a given .
sometimes the situation gets a bit out of hand or worse .
minor struggles and fist fights with heavy glass beer mugs breaking are not that uncommon , but usually they are quickly suppressed .
police and medical officials are always on hand to make sure things do n't get out of control .
last year the city adopted a two-pronged approach to respond to reports of sexual assault .
it set up a centrally located security point , staffed by women and open everyday from 6:00 at night to 1:00 in the morning .
it also launched a campaign called " a safe oktoberfest for girls and women " to discourage sexual harassment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : view of munich 's oktoberfest with the st. paul 's cathedral in the background do the darker sides of the festival deter visitors or dampen their mood ?

"
this week , the european commission will publish a report expected to give turkey the go ahead to start accession talks .
in an interview with deutsche welle , the turkish premier was convinced this would take place . on oct .
6 , the executive branch of the eu will present a long-awaited progress report on ankara 's chances of joining the 25-member bloc .
the findings of the study will form the basis of a decision by eu leaders at a december summit on whether or not to begin membership negotiations with turkey .
the commission is widely expected to give the thumbs up .
however , an impact study to be approved alongside the main recommendations suggests that the predominantly muslim country on the fringe of europe will not be able to count itself a full-fledged member of the eu until well into the next decade .
eu enlargement commissioner günter verheugen has predicted a long and bumpy road full of specific prerequisites both for ankara and the larger bloc .
verheugen , who only two weeks ago announced there were " no more problems on the table " and no further obstacles to beginning accession talks , has now indicated that certain requirements need to be fulfilled before the eu can welcome turkey into its fold .
first among them , according to inside sources , is a restricted access to the european labor market .
in contrast to the current new members who enjoy free circulation of labor after a certain period of time , verheugen favors long-term restrictions for turks seeking jobs in existing member states .
the enlargement commissioner would also like to stipulate changes in the eu agricultural subsidies system , which if left in place would result in annual costs of between 16 and 28 billion euros -lrb- $ 19 to $ 34 billion -rrb- once turkey joins , and stricter controls of political reforms .
no new requirements in an interview with deutsche welle and a small circle of german journalists , turkish minister president recep tayyip erdogan adamantly rejected any further stipulations to beginning membership talks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan refers to the enlargement commissioner as " my good friend , " after günter verheugen announced there were no more problems ahead of beginning negotiations .
" i have never heard anything like that from mr. verheugen , not in any way .
in the catalog of criteria for the european union there is no such thing as requirements for beginning negotiations .
he could perhaps write something about our little faults .
that would be normal and would be cleared up during the negotiation period , " erdogan said .
as to the significant sum in subsidies the eu would have to shoulder in the decade following turkey 's accession , the premier said it was too early to make any such assumptions : " in my opinion it 's too early to begin talking about such things .
in helsinki in 1999 , the eu decided that turkey was a candidate for membership .
all these things were prepared with the full awareness of the eu .
in the coming years , the situation will change dramatically .
one should not only talk about what the eu will have to pay .
one should also say what the eu will gain through turkey 's membership . "
no question of membership in its impact study , the eu commission addresses the economic benefits turkey would bring to the rest of europe and concluded that ankara 's relatively weak economy would not result in a significant boon for the bloc .
despite opposition to turkey 's membership , erdogan is convinced that in december the 25 heads of state and government will recommend starting accession talks .
a further postponement or a rejection is out of the question , the prime minister said .

eu enlargement commissioner günter verheugen has predicted a long and bumpy road full of specific prerequisites both for ankara and the larger bloc .
verheugen , who only two weeks ago announced there were " no more problems on the table " and no further obstacles to beginning accession talks , has now indicated that certain requirements need to be fulfilled before the eu can welcome turkey into its fold .
first among them , according to inside sources , is a restricted access to the european labor market .
in contrast to the current new members who enjoy free circulation of labor after a certain period of time , verheugen favors long-term restrictions for turks seeking jobs in existing member states .
the enlargement commissioner would also like to stipulate changes in the eu agricultural subsidies system , which if left in place would result in annual costs of between 16 and 28 billion euros -lrb- $ 19 to $ 34 billion -rrb- once turkey joins , and stricter controls of political reforms .
no new requirements in an interview with deutsche welle and a small circle of german journalists , turkish minister president recep tayyip erdogan adamantly rejected any further stipulations to beginning membership talks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan refers to the enlargement commissioner as " my good friend , " after günter verheugen announced there were no more problems ahead of beginning negotiations .
" i have never heard anything like that from mr. verheugen , not in any way .
in the catalog of criteria for the european union there is no such thing as requirements for beginning negotiations .
he could perhaps write something about our little faults .
that would be normal and would be cleared up during the negotiation period , " erdogan said .
as to the significant sum in subsidies the eu would have to shoulder in the decade following turkey 's accession , the premier said it was too early to make any such assumptions : " in my opinion it 's too early to begin talking about such things .

no question of membership in its impact study , the eu commission addresses the economic benefits turkey would bring to the rest of europe and concluded that ankara 's relatively weak economy would not result in a significant boon for the bloc .

the joyous scenes of reunification which inspired the world when the berlin wall fell on nov .
9 , 1989 , have remained images of hope , beacons of reconcilliation and the evidence that incredible social change could be achieved against amazing odds .
but the pictures of fireworks over berlin and the streets filled with embracing germans are in danger of seeping into a rose tint in the face of the increasingly harsh reality of a united germany .
escalating costs , shaky economic side-effects , discrepencies in living standards and employment opportunities have been the flip side of the euphoria created by the healing of a nation divided for 41 years .
however , germany continues to work at the problems arising from the recovery process .
here , dw-world presents a series of articles documenting the ups and downs experienced in the past 12 months since the last celebration . dw-world.de opinion : a progress report on german unity it 's been over 13 years since the fall of the berlin wall , but germans still have a lot to learn about each other before the mental east-west border disappears .

-lrb- february 9 , 2004 -rrb- has rebuilding east germany failed ?

-lrb- april 6 , 2004 -rrb- berlin 's polar bears : on the way from east to best the berlin eisbären may have placed second in this year 's german hockey league championships , but it 's still a big achievement for the former east german team that struggled to survive after the berlin wall fell .

even those who 've lived here all their lives have difficulty remembering exactly where it used to be .
but if every fifth person in germany had their way , the barrier that split the country during the cold war would be resurrected .
a recent poll conducted by the forsa research institute found that a quarter of west germans wished the berlin wall could be rebuilt , while 12 percent of east germans said they did n't want to live in a united germany .
it 's not exactly a glowing testimony about the progress made in the 14 years since the wende , the term used here to describe german reunification . stereotypes persist stereotypes about east and west are stubborn .

there 's been an exodus of young easterners to western cities in the 14 years following reunification , but those who 've remained in the east are often pegged as lazy , unmotivated , and bitter about their future prospects . those assumptions are wrong , say sociologists at a leading public opinion research institute in the southern german city of allensbach .

" their optimism and strength is tangible , and those are the qualities that a region needs to pull itself out of the doldrums . " that description could apply to leipzig resident rita barwitzki , 26 , who was a pre-teen when the wall fell .
she says living through the experience has made her stronger . " i gave up a piece of my identity , and because of that , there was this impulse to experience new things , and not to stay stuck in the past , " she recalls .
" and there were new things , there was a whole new system .
i think i 'm more free , more independent today because of those changes . " but barwitzki could n't be more different from fellow easterner lutz r. , a berliner who was in his early 30s when the wall fell .
as incredible as it sounds to western ears , lutz says he felt more free under the east german regime than he does now . " freedom is relative .
in my job now , if i were to complain to my boss about how things are working , i would have to worry about getting fired .

now , many want it back on oct.3 , germany marks 14 years since reunification .
although the physical barrier between east and west is a thing of the past , many germans still speak about the " mauer im kopf " - the wall in the head . in berlin today , there 's very little left of the berlin wall .
even those who 've lived here all their lives have difficulty remembering exactly where it used to be .
but if every fifth person in germany had their way , the barrier that split the country during the cold war would be resurrected .
a recent poll conducted by the forsa research institute found that a quarter of west germans wished the berlin wall could be rebuilt , while 12 percent of east germans said they did n't want to live in a united germany .
it 's not exactly a glowing testimony about the progress made in the 14 years since the wende , the term used here to describe german reunification . stereotypes persist stereotypes about east and west are stubborn .
east germans think of westerners as " besser-wessies , " or arrogant know-it-alls .
west germans , in turn , roll their eyes about the " jammer ossies , " or whining easterners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the glittering skyline of frankfurt 's banking district symbolizes west german wealth " east germans have a false perception of affluence in the west .
they overestimate the level of prosperity , and take the upper income level as the average , so many of their demands are unrealistic , " says klaus schröder , an expert on the former east germany at berlin 's free university .
" west germans are envious when they see how much money is being transferred to the east .
many people feel that the true cost of reunification is being hidden from them . " negative western stereotypes about easterners have even been passed down to the younger generation , to those who were teenagers when the wall fell .
there 's been an exodus of young easterners to western cities in the 14 years following reunification , but those who 've remained in the east are often pegged as lazy , unmotivated , and bitter about their future prospects . those assumptions are wrong , say sociologists at a leading public opinion research institute in the southern german city of allensbach .
they quizzed 2,000 germans on their attitudes on typically western values .
while they concluded that , in the east , values such as equality and social justice ranked higher than individual freedom , the researchers admit they were surprised by the responses of young easterners . advantage of youth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drivers in the old east german trabant cars celebrating reunification " the younger generation of easterners are n't just falling back into a basic attitude of depression , they 're taking initiative , " thomas petersen , project leader at the allensbach institute told dw-world .
" their optimism and strength is tangible , and those are the qualities that a region needs to pull itself out of the doldrums . " that description could apply to leipzig resident rita barwitzki , 26 , who was a pre-teen when the wall fell .
she says living through the experience has made her stronger . " i gave up a piece of my identity , and because of that , there was this impulse to experience new things , and not to stay stuck in the past , " she recalls .
" and there were new things , there was a whole new system .
i think i 'm more free , more independent today because of those changes . " but barwitzki could n't be more different from fellow easterner lutz r. , a berliner who was in his early 30s when the wall fell .
as incredible as it sounds to western ears , lutz says he felt more free under the east german regime than he does now . " freedom is relative .
in my job now , if i were to complain to my boss about how things are working , i would have to worry about getting fired .
for me , that means i 'm not free , " lutz told dw-world .
" in east germany , i could say what i thought .
not about the government , of course , but then i did n't have anything against the government .
but at work , if i complained to my boss , he 'd listen , and i did n't have to fear the consequences . " lutz remembers east germany as a great country for young people - a place where he had a steady job , enough food , and a nice apartment located just a few meters from the berlin wall .

this week , the european commission will publish a report expected to give turkey the go ahead to start accession talks .
in an interview with deutsche welle , the turkish premier was convinced this would take place . on oct .
6 , the executive branch of the eu will present a long-awaited progress report on ankara 's chances of joining the 25-member bloc .
the findings of the study will form the basis of a decision by eu leaders at a december summit on whether or not to begin membership negotiations with turkey .
the commission is widely expected to give the thumbs up .
however , an impact study to be approved alongside the main recommendations suggests that the predominantly muslim country on the fringe of europe will not be able to count itself a full-fledged member of the eu until well into the next decade .
eu enlargement commissioner günter verheugen has predicted a long and bumpy road full of specific prerequisites both for ankara and the larger bloc .
verheugen , who only two weeks ago announced there were " no more problems on the table " and no further obstacles to beginning accession talks , has now indicated that certain requirements need to be fulfilled before the eu can welcome turkey into its fold .
first among them , according to inside sources , is a restricted access to the european labor market .
in contrast to the current new members who enjoy free circulation of labor after a certain period of time , verheugen favors long-term restrictions for turks seeking jobs in existing member states .
the enlargement commissioner would also like to stipulate changes in the eu agricultural subsidies system , which if left in place would result in annual costs of between 16 and 28 billion euros -lrb- $ 19 to $ 34 billion -rrb- once turkey joins , and stricter controls of political reforms .
no new requirements in an interview with deutsche welle and a small circle of german journalists , turkish minister president recep tayyip erdogan adamantly rejected any further stipulations to beginning membership talks .

" i have never heard anything like that from mr. verheugen , not in any way .
in the catalog of criteria for the european union there is no such thing as requirements for beginning negotiations .
he could perhaps write something about our little faults .
that would be normal and would be cleared up during the negotiation period , " erdogan said .
as to the significant sum in subsidies the eu would have to shoulder in the decade following turkey 's accession , the premier said it was too early to make any such assumptions : " in my opinion it 's too early to begin talking about such things .
in helsinki in 1999 , the eu decided that turkey was a candidate for membership .
all these things were prepared with the full awareness of the eu .
in the coming years , the situation will change dramatically .
one should not only talk about what the eu will have to pay .
one should also say what the eu will gain through turkey 's membership . "
no question of membership in its impact study , the eu commission addresses the economic benefits turkey would bring to the rest of europe and concluded that ankara 's relatively weak economy would not result in a significant boon for the bloc .
despite opposition to turkey 's membership , erdogan is convinced that in december the 25 heads of state and government will recommend starting accession talks .
a further postponement or a rejection is out of the question , the prime minister said .

"
this week , the european commission will publish a report expected to give turkey the go ahead to start accession talks .
in an interview with deutsche welle , the turkish premier was convinced this would take place . on oct .
6 , the executive branch of the eu will present a long-awaited progress report on ankara 's chances of joining the 25-member bloc .
the findings of the study will form the basis of a decision by eu leaders at a december summit on whether or not to begin membership negotiations with turkey .
the commission is widely expected to give the thumbs up .
however , an impact study to be approved alongside the main recommendations suggests that the predominantly muslim country on the fringe of europe will not be able to count itself a full-fledged member of the eu until well into the next decade .
eu enlargement commissioner günter verheugen has predicted a long and bumpy road full of specific prerequisites both for ankara and the larger bloc .
verheugen , who only two weeks ago announced there were " no more problems on the table " and no further obstacles to beginning accession talks , has now indicated that certain requirements need to be fulfilled before the eu can welcome turkey into its fold .
first among them , according to inside sources , is a restricted access to the european labor market .
in contrast to the current new members who enjoy free circulation of labor after a certain period of time , verheugen favors long-term restrictions for turks seeking jobs in existing member states .
the enlargement commissioner would also like to stipulate changes in the eu agricultural subsidies system , which if left in place would result in annual costs of between 16 and 28 billion euros -lrb- $ 19 to $ 34 billion -rrb- once turkey joins , and stricter controls of political reforms .
no new requirements in an interview with deutsche welle and a small circle of german journalists , turkish minister president recep tayyip erdogan adamantly rejected any further stipulations to beginning membership talks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan refers to the enlargement commissioner as " my good friend , " after günter verheugen announced there were no more problems ahead of beginning negotiations .
" i have never heard anything like that from mr. verheugen , not in any way .
in the catalog of criteria for the european union there is no such thing as requirements for beginning negotiations .
he could perhaps write something about our little faults .
that would be normal and would be cleared up during the negotiation period , " erdogan said .
as to the significant sum in subsidies the eu would have to shoulder in the decade following turkey 's accession , the premier said it was too early to make any such assumptions : " in my opinion it 's too early to begin talking about such things .
in helsinki in 1999 , the eu decided that turkey was a candidate for membership .
all these things were prepared with the full awareness of the eu .
in the coming years , the situation will change dramatically .
one should not only talk about what the eu will have to pay .
one should also say what the eu will gain through turkey 's membership . "
no question of membership in its impact study , the eu commission addresses the economic benefits turkey would bring to the rest of europe and concluded that ankara 's relatively weak economy would not result in a significant boon for the bloc .
despite opposition to turkey 's membership , erdogan is convinced that in december the 25 heads of state and government will recommend starting accession talks .
a further postponement or a rejection is out of the question , the prime minister said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recep tayyip erdogan speaks to the media nov .
26 , 2002 in copenhagen after the eu came up with a set of criteria for ankara " that would be a hard punch for me and my people , because we have done our homework .
it is now up to the eu to hold up their end .
we have done everything as it stands in the criteria .
commissioner verheugen said , there are no more problems on the table .
the world was our witness .
i do not believe that it will happen , but should we receive a negative answer than we will just rename the copenhagen criteria -lrb- the list of requirements for membership -rrb- the ankara criteria and go our own way .

3 , munich revolves around beer the world 's largest folk festival ended this weekend in germany .
the annual oktoberfest in munich attracted over six million people and was , as usual , a great party full of dancing , rides , and of course beer . it 's hard to describe oktoberfest to those who have never been there .
part party , festival and carnival with singalongs , costumes , rides and games , the ultimate beer bash is something you just have to experience , says dw-radio 's allison frost , who spoke with several visitors during oktoberfest 's last weekend .
a toast to gemütlichkeit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors lift their maß , one-liter mugs of beer , during the oktoberfest after spending less than an hour in one of the festival 's enormous beer tents , it 's hard to get the refrain of one of the beer drinker 's favorite songs out of your head .
" a toast , a toast to gemütlichkeit . "
it 's an homage to that uniquely german word for the feeling of sociability , hospitality and that relaxed sense of belonging that defies translation .
in munich , bavaria 's capital and the home to oktoberfest , gemütlichkeit is written big - almost as big as the one-liter mugs that are passed around full of beer .
the jovial good spirit that exudes from the packed beer tents and the experience of locking arms and swaying along with hundreds of other strangers is what keeps drawing back visitors .
this year there were over six million .
for wolf wilberg , who comes to the " wiesn , " as the locals call it , every year , there 's just one way to sum up the oktoberfest experience : home .
the retired teacher hails originally from berlin , but has been a " bavarian at heart " for years .
" this is about being among people which share our attitudes towards life .
which means , we are proud of our traditions and we welcome guests from all over the world , " he says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional brass bands are an integral part of the oktoberfest tradition " when you come here , people will say , hocke die heir , which means come here and have a seat .
and it is less than a minute before you are in an intimate talk and you know your neighbor and you share or do not share his opinions .
if you are completely different you at least share the same beer and the same pretzel and that 's that , " wilberg says of the down-home nature of oktoberfest .
jan schöbel , a munich native , has just returned from studying abroad in portland , oregon .
he says he 's glad to be back in town for the big event : " i like the beer .
when i was a little bit younger , i liked the rides . "
but the main reason he likes oktoberfest is " to sit together in a beer tent or in the beer garden if the weather is nice , have fun with friends and meet foreign people . "
when you 've had too much to drink of course the focus is really on the beer .
that 's what the festival is all about .
and as to be expected , people tend to drink to excess .
the brochures and tourist information do n't mention that , but it 's a given .
sometimes the situation gets a bit out of hand or worse .
minor struggles and fist fights with heavy glass beer mugs breaking are not that uncommon , but usually they are quickly suppressed .
police and medical officials are always on hand to make sure things do n't get out of control .
last year the city adopted a two-pronged approach to respond to reports of sexual assault .
it set up a centrally located security point , staffed by women and open everyday from 6:00 at night to 1:00 in the morning .
it also launched a campaign called " a safe oktoberfest for girls and women " to discourage sexual harassment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : view of munich 's oktoberfest with the st. paul 's cathedral in the background do the darker sides of the festival deter visitors or dampen their mood ?
not really , says wolf wilberg .
" i 'm glad that the police have this under control .
there are always people who do not know where the limits are .
but it is more the fun and spirit of friendship and companionship , and people feel that the atmosphere is more important than heavy drinking .

18 to oct .
3 , munich revolves around beer the world 's largest folk festival ended this weekend in germany .
the annual oktoberfest in munich attracted over six million people and was , as usual , a great party full of dancing , rides , and of course beer . it 's hard to describe oktoberfest to those who have never been there .
part party , festival and carnival with singalongs , costumes , rides and games , the ultimate beer bash is something you just have to experience , says dw-radio 's allison frost , who spoke with several visitors during oktoberfest 's last weekend .
a toast to gemütlichkeit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors lift their maß , one-liter mugs of beer , during the oktoberfest after spending less than an hour in one of the festival 's enormous beer tents , it 's hard to get the refrain of one of the beer drinker 's favorite songs out of your head .
" a toast , a toast to gemütlichkeit . "
it 's an homage to that uniquely german word for the feeling of sociability , hospitality and that relaxed sense of belonging that defies translation .
in munich , bavaria 's capital and the home to oktoberfest , gemütlichkeit is written big - almost as big as the one-liter mugs that are passed around full of beer .
the jovial good spirit that exudes from the packed beer tents and the experience of locking arms and swaying along with hundreds of other strangers is what keeps drawing back visitors .
this year there were over six million .
for wolf wilberg , who comes to the " wiesn , " as the locals call it , every year , there 's just one way to sum up the oktoberfest experience : home .
the retired teacher hails originally from berlin , but has been a " bavarian at heart " for years .
" this is about being among people which share our attitudes towards life .
which means , we are proud of our traditions and we welcome guests from all over the world , " he says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional brass bands are an integral part of the oktoberfest tradition " when you come here , people will say , hocke die heir , which means come here and have a seat .
and it is less than a minute before you are in an intimate talk and you know your neighbor and you share or do not share his opinions .
if you are completely different you at least share the same beer and the same pretzel and that 's that , " wilberg says of the down-home nature of oktoberfest .
jan schöbel , a munich native , has just returned from studying abroad in portland , oregon .
he says he 's glad to be back in town for the big event : " i like the beer .
when i was a little bit younger , i liked the rides . "
but the main reason he likes oktoberfest is " to sit together in a beer tent or in the beer garden if the weather is nice , have fun with friends and meet foreign people . "
when you 've had too much to drink of course the focus is really on the beer .
that 's what the festival is all about .
and as to be expected , people tend to drink to excess .
the brochures and tourist information do n't mention that , but it 's a given .
sometimes the situation gets a bit out of hand or worse .
minor struggles and fist fights with heavy glass beer mugs breaking are not that uncommon , but usually they are quickly suppressed .
police and medical officials are always on hand to make sure things do n't get out of control .
last year the city adopted a two-pronged approach to respond to reports of sexual assault .

" the world economy is strengthening , but the recovery has been uneven , " british chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown said after a meeting of the imf 's policymaking international monetary and financial committee , of which he is chairman .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown " and with oil prices doubling and imbalances worsening , we agreed that action must be taken to address risks to the recovery , " he said .
world bank president james wolfensohn cited " persistent global imbalances , which require , in particular , readjustment of monetary and fiscal policies in the us , and structural reforms to boost growth in japan , europe and elsewhere . "
he noted that heavily indebted and oil-importing developing countries " are vulnerable to the combination or rising oil prices and interest rates .
mitigating and managing these risks remain important challenges for us all . "
britain sets the example for debt relief following on the heels of the g7 meeting , the imf steering committee also addressed the need to improve debt relief for the world 's poorest nations .
as in the meeting two days earlier between financial leaders from the world 's wealthiest nations , the imf was full of pledges and affirmations , but failed to endorse specific measures which would write-off the debts owed to the world bank by poor countries .
instead gordon brown described the commitment expressed by the g7 as " very significant progress , " and pointed out that the group was preparing a progress report addressing the sustainability of debt relief for the neediest countries .
" there is a growing consensus that multilateral debt relief has to be dealt with as soon as possible , " he said .
" the uk will lead the way in relieving those countries still under the burden of this debt by paying our share - 10 percent - of their payments to the world bank and the african development bank , " brown announced , adding : " and we urge other governments to follow us in this . "
bildunterschrift : a child stands outside squatter shacks watching the rising waters in the alexandra township north of johannesburg , south africa increasing development aid meanwhile the imf and world bank appealed to industrialized countries to uphold their pledge of spending 0.7 percent of their gross domestic product to support developing countries , particularly those in sub-saharan africa .
agreed to in 1969 during a un conference , only a handful of countries have met the target , including norway and sweden .
the united states , one of the world 's strongest economies , currently spends less than 0.2 percent of its gdp on development aid .
france put 0.4 percent of its gdp towards aid programs in africa , and in germany , the goal is to reach 0.33 percent by 2006 .
no agreement on iraq on the issue of iraq , the support for debt relief was even less resounding .
whereas the us has lobbied for forgiving 90 percent of the arab nation 's $ 120 billion -lrb- € 97 billion -rrb- in foreign debt , other nations are more critical .
germany and france reject such a high percentage , saying 50 percent is more appropriate .
citing its extensive oil reserves , france has argued that iraq should not be treated any better than considerably poorer nations .

" the world economy is strengthening , but the recovery has been uneven , " british chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown said after a meeting of the imf 's policymaking international monetary and financial committee , of which he is chairman .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown " and with oil prices doubling and imbalances worsening , we agreed that action must be taken to address risks to the recovery , " he said .
world bank president james wolfensohn cited " persistent global imbalances , which require , in particular , readjustment of monetary and fiscal policies in the us , and structural reforms to boost growth in japan , europe and elsewhere . "
he noted that heavily indebted and oil-importing developing countries " are vulnerable to the combination or rising oil prices and interest rates .
mitigating and managing these risks remain important challenges for us all . "
britain sets the example for debt relief following on the heels of the g7 meeting , the imf steering committee also addressed the need to improve debt relief for the world 's poorest nations .
as in the meeting two days earlier between financial leaders from the world 's wealthiest nations , the imf was full of pledges and affirmations , but failed to endorse specific measures which would write-off the debts owed to the world bank by poor countries .
instead gordon brown described the commitment expressed by the g7 as " very significant progress , " and pointed out that the group was preparing a progress report addressing the sustainability of debt relief for the neediest countries .
" there is a growing consensus that multilateral debt relief has to be dealt with as soon as possible , " he said .
" the uk will lead the way in relieving those countries still under the burden of this debt by paying our share - 10 percent - of their payments to the world bank and the african development bank , " brown announced , adding : " and we urge other governments to follow us in this . "
bildunterschrift : a child stands outside squatter shacks watching the rising waters in the alexandra township north of johannesburg , south africa increasing development aid meanwhile the imf and world bank appealed to industrialized countries to uphold their pledge of spending 0.7 percent of their gross domestic product to support developing countries , particularly those in sub-saharan africa .
agreed to in 1969 during a un conference , only a handful of countries have met the target , including norway and sweden .
the united states , one of the world 's strongest economies , currently spends less than 0.2 percent of its gdp on development aid .
france put 0.4 percent of its gdp towards aid programs in africa , and in germany , the goal is to reach 0.33 percent by 2006 .
no agreement on iraq on the issue of iraq , the support for debt relief was even less resounding .
whereas the us has lobbied for forgiving 90 percent of the arab nation 's $ 120 billion -lrb- € 97 billion -rrb- in foreign debt , other nations are more critical .
germany and france reject such a high percentage , saying 50 percent is more appropriate .

who deserves to be a saint ?
the question is a source of great debate among catholics .
on sunday , charles i of austria will be beatified at the vatican , while an angry dispute erupts over his historic role at home . for centuries , the announcement of the beatification of a new saint had been big news in the catholic church .
at the start of the 21st century one could argue that the importance of such a ceremony has faded somewhat , at least in the media .
but in austria , the naming of emperor charles i , who ruled for just short of two years at the end of world war i , has caused quite a stir , as the country 's leading news magazine referred to the last ruler of the austro-hungarian empire as " the patron saint of losers . "
herbert lackner , chief editor of the viennese magazine profil criticized the beatification of charles i as tantamount to anointing a proponent of war .
although the emperor himself " was not as much of a war hawk as his generals , he was too weak to actually make the decisive turn to peace , " he wrote ahead of sunday 's ceremony .
lackner also said charles was responsible for the use of mustard gas during the end of the war , which resulted in the deaths of hundreds of soldiers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emperor charles i " he was the supreme commander .
if he had ordered them not to use it , they would n't have done so , " lackner said .
powerful name recognition the journalist maintained charles got beatification because the vatican succumbed to decades of lobbying by the habsburg family that formerly ruled austria.british historian and lawyer james bogel , however , claimed the media is acting like the paparazzi by leveling untruths at the habsburg family because of a deep-seated paranoia about the country 's monarchic past .
" if you 've got people with that degree of paranoia , it 's not surprising that they write articles like this , " said the lawyer , who speaks on behalf of the family .
walburga , the countess douglas and granddaughter of charles , was of the same opinion .
speaking to dw-radio from rome , the royal heiress said pope john paul ii was responsible for the decision and has been more creative than his predecessors in picking the new saints of the catholic church .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope john paul ii " our pope tries to find people who can be symbols for a group of persons , and he was trying to find somebody who can become the symbol for the politicians .
he might be the saint for the politicians , " she explained .
as to accusations that charles was a poor statesman and morally reproachable for allowing generals to use deadly mustard gas , the countess recalled that politicians during the time of her grandfather were in a much different position than today , and many were much harsher when it came to war .
" you will always find people who are going to say , how can you beatify a person who was leading a war , " she said , while adding that charles i was fulfilling the will of god .
one miracle is enough in his official biography - published by the vatican - historians argue that charles i strove tirelessly for peace until abdication in 1918 .
as a dedicated catholic , he was also the only european leader who backed the peace efforts of pope benedict the fifteenth .
according to james bogel , there is also no actual record that the emperor actually authorized mustard gas .
during the war " he certainly refused to attack civilian shipping .
he refused to shell italian civilians .
and he refused to send lenin in a sealed train back to russia , " all reasons bogel has cited for showing that charles i was not as bad as the media makes him out to be .
for the vatican , though , the proof of charles ' saintliness lies elsewhere .
the catholic church said the deceased emperor miraculously healed the varicose veins of a brazilian nun when she prayed to him in 1960 , and one miracle is all it takes for beatification . eric campano -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de historians question the beatification of blessed charles the last emperor of the habsburg dynasty , charles the first of austria , is to be beatified by the pope .

who deserves to be a saint ?
the question is a source of great debate among catholics .
on sunday , charles i of austria will be beatified at the vatican , while an angry dispute erupts over his historic role at home . for centuries , the announcement of the beatification of a new saint had been big news in the catholic church .
at the start of the 21st century one could argue that the importance of such a ceremony has faded somewhat , at least in the media .
but in austria , the naming of emperor charles i , who ruled for just short of two years at the end of world war i , has caused quite a stir , as the country 's leading news magazine referred to the last ruler of the austro-hungarian empire as " the patron saint of losers . "
herbert lackner , chief editor of the viennese magazine profil criticized the beatification of charles i as tantamount to anointing a proponent of war .
although the emperor himself " was not as much of a war hawk as his generals , he was too weak to actually make the decisive turn to peace , " he wrote ahead of sunday 's ceremony .
lackner also said charles was responsible for the use of mustard gas during the end of the war , which resulted in the deaths of hundreds of soldiers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emperor charles i " he was the supreme commander .
if he had ordered them not to use it , they would n't have done so , " lackner said .
powerful name recognition the journalist maintained charles got beatification because the vatican succumbed to decades of lobbying by the habsburg family that formerly ruled austria.british historian and lawyer james bogel , however , claimed the media is acting like the paparazzi by leveling untruths at the habsburg family because of a deep-seated paranoia about the country 's monarchic past .
" if you 've got people with that degree of paranoia , it 's not surprising that they write articles like this , " said the lawyer , who speaks on behalf of the family .
walburga , the countess douglas and granddaughter of charles , was of the same opinion .
speaking to dw-radio from rome , the royal heiress said pope john paul ii was responsible for the decision and has been more creative than his predecessors in picking the new saints of the catholic church .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope john paul ii " our pope tries to find people who can be symbols for a group of persons , and he was trying to find somebody who can become the symbol for the politicians .
he might be the saint for the politicians , " she explained .
as to accusations that charles was a poor statesman and morally reproachable for allowing generals to use deadly mustard gas , the countess recalled that politicians during the time of her grandfather were in a much different position than today , and many were much harsher when it came to war .
" you will always find people who are going to say , how can you beatify a person who was leading a war , " she said , while adding that charles i was fulfilling the will of god .
one miracle is enough in his official biography - published by the vatican - historians argue that charles i strove tirelessly for peace until abdication in 1918 .
as a dedicated catholic , he was also the only european leader who backed the peace efforts of pope benedict the fifteenth .
according to james bogel , there is also no actual record that the emperor actually authorized mustard gas .
during the war " he certainly refused to attack civilian shipping .
he refused to shell italian civilians .
and he refused to send lenin in a sealed train back to russia , " all reasons bogel has cited for showing that charles i was not as bad as the media makes him out to be .
for the vatican , though , the proof of charles ' saintliness lies elsewhere .

nearly £ 14m of lottery funding has helped regenerate the carmarthenshire shoreline , which attracts half a million visitors every year .
out of 700 entries for the amazing spaces prize , the park will compete against st george 's market in belfast and the lowry in salford .
the public vote will decide the winner , which will be announced next month .
the park , opened in june 2002 , is in the final of the helping hand awards , established to mark the 10th anniversary of the national lottery .
the results will be announced at the tate modern in london on saturday 6 november .
a national lottery spokesperson said : " the national lottery helping hand awards aim to celebrate the remarkable achievements of the 175,000 good cause projects across the uk which have received lottery funding over the last 10 years .
" the award winners will be decided entirely by public vote . "
the coastal park began as an attempt to regenerate 22km and 2,000 acres of contaminated and neglected industrial wasteland and coastal plain .
it stretches from pembrey country park in the west to the national wetlands centre of wales at penclawdd in the east .
visitor centre land which had become almost derelict after 200 years of coal and steel production now boasts cycle trails , six lakes , a marina and promenade .
the seafront had been one of the most polluted coastlines in the uk .
a £ 2m visitor centre which has attracted both european and welsh assembly government regeneration funding should open by the end of 2004 .

the public vote will decide the winner , which will be announced next month .
the park , opened in june 2002 , is in the final of the helping hand awards , established to mark the 10th anniversary of the national lottery .
the results will be announced at the tate modern in london on saturday 6 november .
a national lottery spokesperson said : " the national lottery helping hand awards aim to celebrate the remarkable achievements of the 175,000 good cause projects across the uk which have received lottery funding over the last 10 years .
" the award winners will be decided entirely by public vote . "
the coastal park began as an attempt to regenerate 22km and 2,000 acres of contaminated and neglected industrial wasteland and coastal plain .
it stretches from pembrey country park in the west to the national wetlands centre of wales at penclawdd in the east .
visitor centre land which had become almost derelict after 200 years of coal and steel production now boasts cycle trails , six lakes , a marina and promenade .
